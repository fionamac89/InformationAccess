   First Bank System's New Chairman
   Swings Ax and Tightens Purse Strings

   MINNEAPOLIS -- John F. Grundhofer says he just hates to
criticize his predecessors in top management at First Bank
System Inc. But, apparently, not as much as he hates what
they did.
   "It was out of control," the banking concern's new
chairman, president and chief executive officer says in an
interview 10 weeks into the job. A former vice chairman at
Wells Fargo &amp; Co., where cost-cutting is a religion, Mr.
Grundhofer says he quickly grew irritated at First Bank's
spending habits. "There were some real silly things going on
around here. Anybody could sign approval for expenses."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Grundhofer, who is called Jack, succeeded D.H. Ankeny
Jr., who quit last September after presiding over huge bond
market and lending forays at First Bank. Mr. Ankeny, who says
he doesn't want to discuss the past, wasn't known as a penny
pincher.
   But things are quickly changing at once laid-back First
Bank, which owns banks across the upper Midwest. Gone are the
club memberships that every vice president received -- only
officers who need to entertain customers get to keep them.
Gone is the open access to the executive dining room -- also
only for entertaining customers. Other cutbacks include
office plants, company cars and company-paid newspaper
subscriptions.
   In their place, for now, there is fear. "There's a high
level of anxiety for everybody," says William Farley, who
perhaps represents Mr. Grundhofer's strongest rebuke of
former management. Mr. Farley, then president of the
company's flagship Minneapolis bank, was fired by Mr. Ankeny
in 1988 after he criticized the company's huge bond position,
which ultimately led to a half-billion dollar loss. A
well-regarded manager of consumer and electronic banking
businesses, Mr. Farley was rehired within weeks of Mr.
Grundhofer's arrival, as a vice chairman of the parent
company.
   Mr. Grundhofer is in the process of letting go hundreds of
employees, from executive vice presidents on down, and plans
to eliminate the duplication of staffs that existed at the
holding company and lead bank. He hasn't wasted time. Hired
on a Tuesday, he closed the purchase of a house that
Thursday, took home a load of loan files over the weekend,
and began firing people the following Monday.
   "It's hard to improve morale when you're cutting costs,"
Mr. Grundhofer says. "Offsetting the hatchet image," he
hopes, "is the fact that I understand banking." So, he says
he's also hard at work on growth strategies: "What are we
going to do after this holocaust?"
   Given First Bank's past, and the need for severe
cost-cutting, says Richard Ferry, the headhunter who
recruited Mr. Grundhofer on behalf of the company's board,
"you couldn't help but be led to someone in the Wells Fargo
system."
   First Bank will pay Mr. Grundhofer about $1.4 million to
buy him out of Wells Fargo options and other benefits he
would have received, and his 1990 salary and bonus will be at
least $787,500, according to his employment contract.
   Under Mr. Ankeny and his predecessor, George Dixon, First
Bank spent much of the 1980s behaving as if it were too big
for -- and bored by -- its home markets, which include the
Dakotas and Montana. The bank's executives put little
emphasis on building the consumer-banking business they
inherited, at times siphoning off huge amounts of deposits
from the company's little banks -- first to fund a national
lending binge, and then to help fund the $8 billion bond
market position that went awry.
   Mr. Farley says the company was overtaken by a "trading
mentality. `Today I'll take your deposits. Tomorrow I don't
want them.' You can't run a consumer business that way."
   Mr. Grundhofer calls the consumer business "very
underutilized. The company under the previous management
didn't pay any attention to the consumer." He plans to
streamline the number of consumer-banking products First
Bank's units offer, and then gear up the troops to do what
Wells Fargo has been so successful at doing: selling.
   Fewer than 25% of the company's customers carry its Visa
or MasterCards, a highly profitable product. And other
consumer loan products haven't been pushed enough, Mr.
Grundhofer says. "We need to sell more."
   That won't be as easy as he had hoped, in part because
under Mr. Ankeny the company sold off a bunch of its smallest
banks, in large part to rid itself of its then-troubled
exposure to the farm economy. Since then, agricultural
lending has again become quite profitable. "In hindsight,
this franchise would be even more valuable if we still had
those," Mr. Grundhofer says.
   The firing and cutting and fixing will easily take all of
1990, which Mr. Grundhofer calls "a throwaway year." For now,
he won't worry about the stock price, languishing in the
low-to-mid teens. Yesterday, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, its common closed at $13.25, off 25
cents.
   Mr. Grundhofer won't say whether the quarterly dividend,
already halved to 20.5 cents a share, is safe. It's up for
review next month by the board, and eliminating it could send
the stock still lower.
   The company yesterday reported first-quarter profit of
$28.5 million, or 37 cents a share, against $50.3 million, or
77 cents a share, the year earlier. While problem real estate
and leveraged buy-out loans rose, the quarter didn't include
yet another big addition to First Bank's reserves for loan
losses, as some had expected. Mr. Grundhofer, however,
doesn't rule out such an addition later in the year, though
one isn't currently expected. "I have to tell you: volatility
in the {loan} portfolio is still there."
   First Bank's nonperforming assets, which include loans
delinquent 90 days or more and other troubled credits, rose
about 16% during the quarter to $368.3 million.
   With all the firings, Mr. Grundhofer is in the market for
a few good bankers, including a top commercial lending
officer, and on one issue the tough new boss is flexible:
"Titles are not a problem. This company has more damn titles.
Whatever he wants, we can give him."

   Castro Remains Firmly in Control of Cuba

   But Country's Tough Times
   Are Likely to Get Tougher

   HAVANA, Cuba -- Last month, the Cuban government practiced
a one-day trial of what it calls a "special period in
peacetime" -- a dry run of how the country plans to survive
in a siege economy.
   Workers at one of the country's largest steel plants
burned wood for fuel in the mill. The University of Havana
dimmed classroom lights. Fidel Castro proclaimed that no
matter how bad things got the all-important sugar crop would
be harvested "even if we have to use oxen."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Things are tough here and getting tougher. The Socialist
bloc has crumbled, leaving Cuba's government isolated
ideologically and its economy vulnerable. "This is our most
critical moment in 25 years," whispers a young economist.
   A four-day visit here produced impressions of an embattled
society. Although Cuba's future seems uncertain, Mr. Castro
remains firmly in control.
   As the world around him changes, Mr. Castro, dressed in
the green military uniforms he has worn for the past 31
years, remains the same.
   Flanked by high-ranking aides wearing guayaberas, Mr.
Castro answered reporters' questions for more than two hours.
Graying but combative, he told a crowded news conference that
Cuba is one of the most democratic nations in the world. In
fact, he said, stabbing the air with a finger for emphasis,
Cuba is "very short from being a Greek democracy."
   That night, addressing a youth rally, Mr. Castro,
introduced to the crowd as Cuba's "clean-up hitter,"
reiterated his promise of "death before slavery." Mr. Castro
almost seems to call for a U.S. invasion, a Caribbean
Gotterdamerung, that would allow him a glorious if bloody
exit from the dead end at which the revolution seems to have
arrived.
   At the modernistic Soviet Embassy, a tall building that
resembles an airport control tower, a vase of red silk roses
adorns a heroic bust of Lenin.
   The Soviet Union is standing fast by its Caribbean ally.
"We are not going to stop helping our Cuban friends," insists
Yuri Petrov, the Soviet ambassador.
   But the relationship is, nonetheless, changing. According
to the U.S., the Soviets, through favorable terms of trade,
subsidize Cuba to the tune of $4 billion a year. Now
Ambassador Petrov says that the Soviets are discussing with
their Cuban counterparts how to base trade between the two
countries for the next five years on hard currency
transactions. "How long the transition period, we can't say,"
says Mr. Petrov. "There will be change."
   Mr. Petrov says one joint Cuban-Soviet enterprise is over.
The Soviet Union used to send Cuba wood in exchange for the
labor of about 1,000 Cuban lumbermen who worked in the
Siberian forest. "That company didn't work very well," says
Mr. Petrov, sipping coffee. "The Cubans didn't get used to
the weather -- 40 degrees below zero with strong winds."
   In the most recent Soviet election, Mr. Petrov says that
80% of the Soviet personnel in Cuba voted for radical Boris
Yeltsin. He says the Soviets "tell our Cuban comrades of our
experiences" with economic reform and glasnost, "but we never
try to impose our concepts."
   At a meat shop in the colonial part of Havana, a
29-year-old, white-frocked butcher keeps up a manic
affability as he cleaves frozen Brazilian chickens for
customers, who are entitled to purchase, under the country's
rationing system, one chicken every nine days. Bulgaria used
to be Cuba's main supplier of chickens, until turmoil in the
East bloc stopped the traffic in chicken parts. But after Mr.
Castro's trip last month to Brazil, Cuba hasn't lacked for
chickens "not because of Fidel," says the butcher, "but
because the Brazilians are good people."
   Not only are Bulgarian chickens out, says Mr. Castro, Cuba
can no longer swap its sugar, citrus fruits and nickel for
buses from Hungary, or barley from Czechoslovakia. And if
Moscow cuts or reduces its trade, which includes supplying
all of the island's oil, adds the young economist, "we will
have very serious problems."
   Planning for that day, Cuba is striving to increase its
hard currency by promoting tourism, particularly through
joint ventures with Spanish companies. It also is pushing
sales of Cuban biotechnology and pharmaceutical products to
countries like Brazil. Domestically, Cuba is concentrating
its scant resources in increasing agricultural production to
make the island more self-sufficient, and ease consumer
discontent.
   Down the street at a corner grocery store, Elia, the shop
owner, relies on Mr. Castro. As in the rest of Havana, her
store shelves are almost bare of both rationed and freely
available goods. There are jars of unrationed honey, on sale
for two pesos (an average monthly salary in Cuba is about 150
pesos), and garlic sauce, also unrationed. There used to be a
lot more goods available. "Fidel is very intelligent," she
says hopefully. "Let's see if he finds a way out of this."
   Mr. Castro may just soon face some opposition from a
renewed Roman Catholic Church, which is preparing for a visit
from Pope John Paul II. Relations with the church, which had
been improving, have soured lately. During his recent visit
to Brazil, Mr. Castro excoriated the Cuban church hierarchy,
saying it was highly influenced by U.S. policy.
   Preparing for the papal visit, the church has organized
processions to take the image of Cuba's patroness, the Virgin
of Charity, from town to town. The downturn in relations,
says a priest, is partly because of the crowds that have
flocked to the processions, the first independent popular
meetings to be held on the island in three decades. The
government is so unnerved, says the priest, that in some
towns it has organized parallel fiestas and even provided
hard-to-get beer. "But the people took the beer and followed
the virgin," says the priest.
   "We have the government between the sword and the wall,"
says the priest, somewhat optimistically.
   "I wouldn't want my kid to run in and out of traffic
selling cigarettes," says Juan Jacomino, a Foreign Ministry
official. "I've been to Caracas and I know."
   Nowhere in Havana does one find, as in many Latin American
capitals, hordes of child beggars or tin-shack "misery
belts." Instead, neat troops of uniformed schoolchildren
attend day-care centers and schools. Everyone eats, if not
well, and medical care and education are free and available.
   Tomasa Gonzalez, the deputy director of a nursery in old
Havana, inaugurated by Mr. Castro last year, loves her job.
The nursery, which cares for 214 children aged 45 days to 4
1/2 years is spotless and Ms. Gonzalez proudly shows visitors
around the playroom full of colorful children's toys. Dozens
of uniformed tots, segregated by age, doze in separate cots.
   There is a Cuban flag and a bust of Jose Marti, the 19th
century Cuban patriot, in the small, sunny courtyard. Ms.
Gonzalez says she teaches the children love of country,
socialist morals, and respect for national symbols. Sometimes
18-month-old kids, imitating the older children, stand at
attention before the bust of Marti. "This is the nursery of
the New Man, of Communist Man," she says.
   Strolling on the grounds of the University of Havana, a
professor whispers to a visitor. "One must be careful," he
says. "At least four students in each of my classes report to
State Security."
   "I don't use the phone," says one diplomat. "They are all
tapped."
   "Things are bad. People want a change," says the tourist
taxi driver nervously. Then he turns up the volume of the car
radio. "This is a government car. It may be bugged."

   DALLAS -- Southmark Corp.'s creditors' committee has asked
a federal bankruptcy judge to allow it to sue the company's
former top two executives to recover more than $83 million in
assets.
   In a filing with the court, the committee said it asked to
file an adversary proceeding against Gene E. Phillips, former
Southmark chairman; William S. Friedman, former vice
chairman, and companies they control to recover funds and
assets on behalf of Southmark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The creditors contend that the assets were fraudulently
conveyed to Messrs. Phillips and Friedman as part of
settlements with Southmark in January and July 1989, when the
real estate and thrift concern already was insolvent.
   In the proposed complaint, the creditors committee argues
that Southmark gave up at least $82 million in actual assets
in those two settlements while receiving less than $14
million in return. A hearing on the request is scheduled for
May 16.
   The settlements stem from an arrangement under which Mr.
Phillips and Mr. Friedman would resign their positions at
Southmark. Among other things, the agreements called for
Southmark to swap its stock in several affiliates and release
the executives from personal guarantees on a costly real
estate project in exchange for mortgages and release from its
own guarantees on other assets.
   Messrs. Phillips and Friedman have contended that the
agreements were fairly negotiated transactions that should be
allowed to stand. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Friedman
said he hasn't seen the complaint, but said: "We're very
happy to have an opportunity in a fair and unbiased forum to
present what actually happened in these transactions."
   Separately, Southmark said it reached an agreement with
its equity holders committee calling for holders of its
preferred and common stock to receive 11% of the stock in
reorganized company, up from about 5%.

   MIT Team Uses New Method of Altering
   Animal Genes to Produce Strain of Mice
   ----

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Using a potent new technique to alter
genes in animals, scientists here developed a strain of
mutant mice that are expected to answer basic questions about
the immune system.
   The work represents the latest advance in research on
"transgenic" animals, which contain artificially inserted
foreign genes. During the past few years, many transgenic
animals have been developed using a technique in which
scientists add or randomly knock out genes. Now, however, a
new technique is emerging that enables researchers to knock
out or replace specific genes. The development of the new
mouse strain represents one of the first applications of this
more powerful way to make "designer" animals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are racing to use this new technique to mimic
human genetic diseases in mice and to investigate functions
of specific genes. Among other things, the work promises to
shed light on how certain genes predispose people to cancer
and how inherited diseases might be treated or prevented. It
also throws into sharper relief the issues raised by
scientists' growing power to manipulate genes in animals.
   "We're bringing things into the orbit of manipulation that
previously weren't at our disposal," said Stuart Newman, an
embryologist at New York Medical College who has written
about ethical issues in transgenic animal research. "We have
to be aware of possible pain, distress and physical
derangement in transgenic animals and balance that against
the benefits" of research on them.
   The new strain of mutant mice were developed by scientists
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Whitehead
Institute, a biomedical research establishment affiliated
with MIT. They deactivated a gene indirectly responsible for
production of a crucial immune-system protein, called MHC-1.
The mice look normal, but they lack both MHC-1 and killer T
cells, said Rudolf Jaenisch, who led the research with MIT's
David Raulet.
   Many researchers believe one function of the T cells is to
kill cells that turn cancerous. Scientists now can
investigate that theory by studying whether the mutant mice
are prone to cancer.
   The work, reported in today's issue of the journal Nature,
also promises to advance organ-transplant technology. MHC-1
occurs in each cell of normal animals, serving as a flag to
the immune system that the cell belongs to "self" and
shouldn't be attacked as a foreign invader. Cells from
different animals have different MHC-1 molecules. Thus, when
cells are transplanted from one animal to another, the
recipient's immune system senses and attacks them as aliens,
causing transplant rejection.
   Tissues from the mice without MHC-1 may not be detectable
as foreign by the immune system, hence may not be subject to
rejection when transplanted. If so, scientists someday may be
able to develop similar tissues without MHC-1 to use as
transplants that wouldn't be rejected, Mr. Jaenisch said.
   The new technique springs from research in the early 1980s
led by British scientist Martin Evans, who showed that
foreign genes could be placed in mouse embryos at an early
state of development. Later, other researchers developed ways
to alter specific genes in the embryonic cells. Recently,
scientists have begun producing strains of mice that can pass
such altered genes to their offspring.
   The new technique "eventually will supplant
micro-injection," the less-powerful method now usually used
to make transgenic animals, said Oliver Smithies, a
University of North Carolina researcher who helped develop
the new method. Micro-injection involves placing foreign
genetic material with microscopic instruments into newly
fertilized embryos. It has been used by a number of companies
trying to develop transgenic animals that grow faster, resist
disease or produce human drugs in their milk.

   Carlton's Stock-Price Plunge Reflects
   Fall From Grace of U.K. Video Highflier

   LONDON -- Nothing has better symbolized Britain's
rekindled entrepreneurial energy in recent times than Carlton
Communications PLC.
   Now, Carlton is facing its own energy crisis, as
yesterday's tumble in its stock price showed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A rapid-fire series of acquisitions -- capped by its
purchases of Technicolor Holdings Inc. from Ronald Perelman
in 1988 and UEI PLC last year for $1.5 billion -- has made
the once-tiny London television-production company a major
force in the world video market. It duplicates more
videotapes than anyone else. Its high-tech graphics machines
set industry standards. Its Zenith unit, 49%-owned by
Paramount Communications Inc., makes TV programs with such
stars as Michelle Pfeiffer and Tina Turner seen in 30
countries.
   Led by its chairman and chief executive officer, Michael
Green, Carlton's pretax profits have risen nearly tenfold in
five years. And at its height last year, the company's #1.7
billion ($2.79 billion) market capitalization exceeded
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC, a previous highflier whose founders
are friends of Mr. Green.
   But suddenly, like Saatchi, Carlton appears to have lost
its hustle. A vague warning from Mr. Green of slower profits
growth this fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, has contributed to
a big fall in the company's share price. On the London Stock
Exchange, Carlton dropped 43 pence a share yesterday to close
at 481 pence, off about 49% from last year's highs. American
depositary receipts, in national over-the-counter trading,
plunged $1.75 a share to close at $15.125.
   Now, holders fear the stock may tread water until June,
when the company posts first-half results, and beyond. The
performance raises some discomforting questions about
Carlton's operations and strategy. There are even whispers
that unless it pulls out of the slump, the much-feared
acquirer could one day be a target itself.
   Acquisitive Carlton's price-earnings ratio -- whose lofty
heights allowed the company to finance acquisitions through
share issues -- now has plunged to below the U.K. average.
That hampers Carlton's ability to finance acquisitions by
issuing shares, and is a setback to Mr. Green's aims to make
Carlton big enough to compete against such rivals as Sony
Corp. Carlton has recently been courting the U.K.'s Thames
Television, which it tried to buy in 1985.
   Carlton "has very much fallen from grace," says Robert
Elliot, fund manager at #6 billion Scottish Amicable
Investment Managers in Glasgow, Scotland. "It is reasonable
to assume we will not see it back on a premium, at least not
this side of a bull market."
   Carlton is the latest casualty of the curious British
fondness for boom-and-bust stories. In the past, the London
market has propelled companies such as Saatchi and Sir
Terence Conran's Storehouse PLC retailing group to
exaggerated heights, only to knock them to equally stunning
lows when bad news surfaces. Now it seems to be Carlton's
turn.
   Carlton's share-price gyrations reflect both current
problems and its transition from growth stock to
conglomerate. Mr. Perelman sold Technicolor at the right
time; tough competition is cutting margins at the unit, which
may account for over a third of Carlton's profits. (Carlton
doesn't disclose figures.) Moreover, high inflation and
interest rates are hurting the advertising market in Britain,
a country Carlton depends on for 36% of revenue.
   By branching out from its base in the back rooms of
television, Carlton is embarking on a riskier strategy to
become a media colossus with operations in hardware,
programming and broadcasting itself. The jury is out on
whether Mr. Green, 42 years old, will be as successful a
manager as he has been a deal-maker. The question is whether
he can make varied businesses work.
   Mr. Green declined to comment for this article. But he
told Carlton shareholders two weeks ago that first-quarter
revenue and pretax profits "show a respectable increase" from
a year earlier, in contrast to the "healthy" increase in
previous years. Holders who have spoken to him since say he
expects profits to grow faster next year after this year's
pause.
   Several holders say they are angry that Carlton failed to
provide earlier clues about the apparent slowdown. They
remain confused about how long the situation will last. Their
biggest fear is the apparent slowdown in the company's energy
may become permanent.

   Dayton Hudson Said to be Front-Runner
   To Buy B.A.T's Marshall Field's Chain

   NEW YORK -- Dayton Hudson Corp. has emerged as the clear
front-runner to acquire the Marshall Field's department store
chain, according to people familiar with the situation.
   Marshall Field's, one of the country's most famous
retailers, was put up for sale last year by B.A.T Industries
PLC as part of a restructuring to fight a takeover bid by Sir
James Goldsmith. B.A.T, which also is selling its Saks Fifth
Avenue unit, had set last Monday as the deadline for bids for
the 24-store Field's chain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   People familiar with B.A.T, a British company that also is
involved in tobacco and financial services, said an agreement
with Dayton Hudson could be reached this week. A deal would
link two of the Midwest's largest retailers and give Dayton
Hudson dominant positions in Chicago and several other
Midwestern cities.
   Executives of Dayton Hudson and their investment bankers
from Salomon Brothers Inc. met yesterday with B.A.T
representatives to negotiate a contract, people familiar with
the talks said. The negotiations were held at the offices
here of Chadbourne &amp; Parke, the law firm representing B.A.T.
   Jerome C. Katz, a partner with Chadbourne &amp; Parke,
declined to comment. A spokesman for Minneapolis-based Dayton
Hudson also declined to comment.
   Details of the Dayton Hudson bid couldn't be learned. Some
have estimated that Marshall Field's might bring between $850
million and $950 million. Other interested parties were said
to include May Department Stores Co., based in St. Louis, and
Dillard Department Stores Inc., based in Little Rock, Ark.
   Philip Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of
Marshall Field's, said in an interview yesterday that a
management group also submitted a bid for Field's. "We
haven't had a response yet," said Mr. Miller, who declined to
comment on any other aspects of the sale.
   Marshall Field's operates l5 stores in Chicago, four in
Wisconsin, four in Texas, and one in Ohio. For the year ended
Jan. 31, 1989, the chain generated about $1.09 billion in
revenue and earned $91 million before depreciation, interest
and taxes.
   Dayton Hudson, which last year earned $410 million on
$13.64 billion in revenue, operates 37 department stores
under the Hudson and Dayton's names in Indiana, Michigan,
Ohio, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
   "It appears to be a terrific fit," said one retail
executive who declined to be identified. "Both are high-end
department stores. They share the same customer base and
dominate their key cities. What this means is that Dayton
Hudson will dominate Detroit, Chicago and Minneapolis."
   Dayton Hudson has performed extremely well in recent
years, according to some retail observers. "Basically,
they've improved the operations in all of their divisions,"
said Marcia Raley, an analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc., based
in Minneapolis. "They've also changed their promotional
stance," continued Ms. Raley. "Customers no longer think
everything is on sale. This helps gross margins because more
of their revenues are coming at full price."
   Richard Pyle, an analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in
Minneapolis, said the department store division now accounts
for about 12% of Dayton Hudson's total revenue.
   "Those stores dominate their market areas," said Mr. Pyle.
"Both Dayton's in Minneapolis-St. Paul and the Hudson group
in Detroit are both probably in the 40% market-share area.
These are full-line department stores which serve a lot of
loyal customers. Marshall Field's would be an excellent
acquisition because it shares many of the same
characteristics."
   Under Mr. Miller, who took over the chief executive's job
in 1983, Marshall Field's has accomplished a substantial
turnaround. "It's a store which has successfully switched its
approach from serving the carriage trade to serving the
contemporary fashion needs of middle to upper-income
customers," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail
Marketing Report.

   Tokyo Prices Surge as Market Resists Pressure
   Of Sliding Yen and Investors Decide to Buy In

   Tokyo share prices surged yesterday afternoon to end
sharply higher, after the market's resistance to another
slide in the yen encouraged a broad range of investors to
buy.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which edged down
1.58 points Tuesday, was up 787.46 points, or more than 2.7%,
to close at 29249.06.

   By mid-morning Thursday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index had
surged 654.79 points to 29903.85.
   The Nikkei ended Wednesday morning's session with a
178-point gain, and the rally's pace increased later in the
afternoon, as sentiment improved further after the dollar
fell back from the high of 160.15 yen it reached in the
morning. Prices were also boosted by a drop in bond yields,
participants said.
   Futures-related program buying by arbitragers and several
rounds of index-linked buying by investment trust funds added
to the gains, traders said.
   Trading remained light. Volume on the first section was
estimated at 450 million shares, slightly up from 423 million
shares Tuesday. Winners outnumbered losers 699 to 234, while
163 issues remained unchanged. Lack of sell orders permitted
a small amount of buying to push up stock prices, observers
said.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 1.20 points Tuesday, was up 39.39
points to 2167.96.
   The second section index, which fell 11.03 points Tuesday,
gained 16.76 points to close at 3524.56. Volume in the second
section was estimated at eight million shares, up from seven
million shares Tuesday.
   The advances yesterday were led by interest rate-sensitive
large-capital issues, such as steel companies and
shipbuilders, which are usually sold when the yen weakens.
   The unusual gains made in these shares created speculation
that some trust banks and life insurance companies were
buying these stocks in exchange for pension-fund contracts of
steel and shipbuilding companies, traders said.
   Some analysts said such speculation could be true, but
added it would be more reasonable to see the gains as a
technical rise since such shares have been oversold in the
past month.
   Market attention was focused on the U.S. merchandise trade
report for February, scheduled for release yesterday, as a
sharp improvement of the U.S. trade deficit is likely to
strengthen the dollar against the yen.
   In the afternoon session, TDK rose strongly, climbing 460
yen to 6,840 yen ($42.75), as buying by one of the "big four"
brokerage houses encouraged other investors.
   TDK's gains also encouraged buying in other high-priced
high-technology shares, traders said. Sony was up 130 at
8,400, while Pioneer increased 120 to 6,070.
   All the major steel manufacturers rose stronglyl. Kobe
Steel gained 14 to 579 and NKK advanced 11 to 547.
   Among shipbuilders, Kawasaki Heavy Industries added 20 to
800. Hitachi Zosen rose 19 to 779 and Ishikawajima-Harima
Heavy Industries was up 18 to 953.
   Other big winners included Isuzu Motors, which gained 100
to 870, and Daiwa House, which ended at 2,150, up 130.
   In Frankfurt, share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
closed sharply lower in moderate activity as traders sold the
shares of engineering group Mannesmann and other companies
with investments in Brazil.
   The German Stock Index (DAX) dropped 24.59 points, or
1.3%, to 1889.76.
   Mannesmann, which has a large Brazilian subsidiary,
tumbled 17.50 marks ($10.45), or 4.5%, to 369 marks after a
British securities firm issued a sell recommendation because
the Brazilian government has frozen most liquid assets as
part of its economic restructuring program. Massive sales of
Mannesmann shares by British investors pulled the broader
market lower and kept it under pressure for the whole
session, traders said.
   Another stock that was dumped because of market's worries
about Brazil was auto maker Volkswagen, which is the junior
partner in the Brazilian-Argentine Autolatina joint venture
with Ford Motor Corp. Volkswagen dropped 10.90 marks to
579.20.
   Uncertainty about the timing and terms of monetary union
with East Germany and a lack of interest from foreign
investors is also keeping a lid on the market, traders said.
   Trading volume, which is still low as many participants
are away on Easter vacations, is likely to pick up again next
week, a trader at a large West German bank said.
   Traders said they were also disappointed that Deutsche
Bank fell below the psychological 800-mark level, dropping
9.50 marks to 791.50. Among other banking shares, Commerzbank
fell 1.50 mark to 286.50 marks.
   In the auto sector, Daimler-Benz slumped 8.50 marks to
912, and Bayerische Motoren Werke declined 11.50 marks to
574.50. Tire maker Continental gave up all of Tuesday's gain,
dropping 6.50 marks to 308.50.
   The Mannesmann sell-off pulled the whole steel and
machinery sector down, as Linde dropped 18 marks to 995, MAN
slumped nine marks to 497, Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD)
tumbled 11 marks to 272 and Hoesch plunged 12 marks to 324
marks.
   In London, share prices finished lower in a light,
trendless session as most investors pondered an array of
market forces. Shares were propelled higher initially by a
healthy rise in Tokyo. But participants soon began to lose
interest and awaited the outcome of U.S. trade figures. When
Wall Street refused to run with the good news, London
investors were bewildered. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index closed down 8.6 points at 2205.9. The
narrower 30-share index was down 3.7 points at 1732.6.
   Elsewhere in Europe, share prices closed higher in
Amsterdam and Stockholm, lower in Paris, Zurich and Brussels.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, prices closed higher in
Sydney, Hong Kong and Singapore, and were lower in Manila,
Taipei, Seoul and Wellington.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   China's `Soviet Card' Has Been Devalued

   Once Feared Beijing-Moscow
   Links Now Seem Irrelevant

   BEIJING -- The whole world was watching in May when Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev made his historic visit to Beijing,
ending 30 years of estrangement between China and the Soviet
Union.
   On Monday, Chinese Premier Li Peng flies to Moscow to
begin what should have been an historic reciprocal visit. But
this time, no one is taking much notice.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sino-Soviet rapprochement once loomed as a momentous
strategic advance and an ominous threat to Western security.
But now that normal ties are resuming, the relationship seems
harmless, even irrelevant to the major issues facing the
world.
   Chinese attempts to wrest concessions from the West by
playing the so-called Soviet card won't succeed, Western
diplomats say. The two communist neighbors are far apart
ideologically and have relatively little to offer each other
in strategic or economic terms. Both sides have too much at
stake in their relationship with the West.
   "It's remarkable," says a senior Western diplomat.
"China's top government official is going to Moscow, the two
sides increasingly are engaged in military cooperation -- and
no one even cares."
   Such a relaxed attitude is a product mainly of China's
retreat from the world stage. The momentous global events of
the past year have largely left China behind. After violently
suppressing its pro-democracy movement in June, soon after
Mr. Gorbachev's return to Moscow, Beijing's leaders have
watched uncomfortably as communist nations around the world
have yielded to the popular forces of political pluralism and
economic freedom.
   China's old guard still rules out such reform, and finds
itself in international semi-isolation as a result. Beijing's
leaders are publicly hostile toward the capitalist West and
privately critical of the rapidly reforming Soviet bloc. In
such a strained context, there isn't likely to be much
progress in Sino-Soviet ties during Mr. Li's four-day trip to
Moscow and Leningrad.
   On the other hand, the two sides seem intent on not
letting the new ideological gulf derail the renewed
relationship. Despite mutual suspicion, Moscow and Beijing
are careful not to say anything in public to poison
relations. Soviet diplomats, to cite one example, now praise
the Russian-speaking ability of the Soviet-trained Mr. Li;
they used to ridicule it.
   The visit is likely to be much smoother than the last time
a Chinese premier visited Moscow. In 1961, when the two sides
had already broken off most contacts, Chou En-lai attended a
Soviet Party congress. Mr. Chou pointedly refused to meet
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and criticized his Soviet
hosts as Marxist "revisionists."
   This time, "both sides are trying to keep things relaxed,"
says a Soviet Embassy source in Beijing. "The only hope for
the relationship is if both sides avoid trying to teach the
other how to run their country, or what socialism really
means."
   But tension still is evident. In private discussions with
foreign leaders and in internal Communist Party documents,
China has savaged Mr. Gorbachev and the reforms he has
fostered. The Chinese began to tone down that rhetoric only
recently, sources say, after Mr. Gorbachev strengthened his
position during a February party plenum in Moscow.
   Prior to that plenum, diplomats say, China had been
betting that Mr. Gorbachev would fall, and be succeeded
either by the conservative Politburo member Yegor Ligachev or
the centrist premier, Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   "Their intelligence and their guesswork were wrong," says
a Western diplomat. "They actually expected Gorbachev to get
canned."
   For Mr. Li, the trip offers a chance to bolster his
sagging prestige. At the very least, the voyage will shelve
speculation that he is to be sacrificed to placate critics in
China and abroad who hold him responsible for June's
Tiananmen massacre and who view him as an obstacle to
economic and political reform.
   Mr. Li's trip also promises to be an awkward homecoming.
The 61-year-old premier studied at the Moscow Power Institute
from 1948 to 1954. He was nurtured during the Stalinist era
and, diplomats say, still thinks the state should control
society tightly from the top. But the Soviet Union today is a
radically different place from the one in which Mr. Li
studied.
   In a recent meeting with Soviet journalists in Beijing,
Mr. Li seemed to concede how much things are changing. "Even
if your people think that socialism is no longer the ideal
system for the Soviet Union, our basic policy will still be
aimed at preserving normal state relations," he said.
   Soviet glasnost already is making the Chinese
uncomfortable. New, independent Soviet magazines sometimes
criticize the Tiananmen massacre and China's resistance to
political liberalization. An article in Moscow's
Literaturnaya Gazeta, a magazine Mr. Li himself reads
regularly, recently carried a sympathetic interview with the
Dalai Lama, the self-exiled spiritual leader of
Chinese-occupied Tibet. China protested to Soviet officials,
who responded by saying that, unlike in China, the state no
longer has the power or desire to control every publication.
   Moreover, there are concerns that many Soviet citizens
don't welcome Mr. Li's visit. When Mr. Gorbachev came to
Beijing, he walked into the middle of vast student-led
demonstrations. Some of the protesters greeted the Soviet
leader as a champion of reform, and welcomed him with banners
in Russian. By contrast, Soviet sources say, Mr. Li could
even encounter a few jeers and protest banners.
   While the visit probably won't produce breakthroughs, the
two sides are likely to sign several agreements. The most
important is a planned "confidence-building" agreement in
principle to reduce the presence of troops along the shared
4,200-mile border. But the two sides won't even try to
address the thornier historical question of exactly where
that border should be drawn.
   On the economic front, they also are likely to sign a
trade agreement. But Moscow and Beijing earlier agreed that,
beginning next year, trade should be on a cash basis, not by
bartering goods. As a result, two-way trade between the
cash-strapped nations is likely to significantly decline from
its current annual level of about $2.4 billion.

   Speaking of Business:
   Indexation May Be Bad for Us

   After the horrendous bouts with inflation in the 1970s and
early 1980, it was natural that our kind-hearted government
would want to do something to ease future inflation pains.
   Social Security benefits are indexed, and in this tax
season most of us know that the government has taken steps
toward indexing ordinary income taxes. For tax years
beginning after 1988, the taxable income bracket at which the
28% rate begins has been subject to adjustment for inflation.
The standard deduction also is adjusted to reflect inflation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There are a number of other proposals kicking around to
lessen inflation's sting. Capital income might be indexed,
the government might issue indexed bonds or it might even pay
interest on money. Two economists, however, suggest that such
inflation-softening measures might be very bad ideas.
   Stanley Fischer of the World Bank and MIT and Lawrence
Summers of Harvard believe that such gimmicks may help to
assure that the inflation will persist. "Should Governments
Learn to Live With Inflation?" is the title of their paper
reprinted by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
(Reprint No. 1347.) Their answer is an emphatic, "No."
   "Our main conclusion," they write, "is that governments
whose ability to maintain low rates of inflation is uncertain
should not reduce the costs of actual inflation. Measures
that reduce the cost of anticipated inflation, or undercut
opposition to it, are particularly likely to be pernicious."
   It would be reasonable to say that the U.S. government's
ability to maintain low inflation rates is at least
uncertain. The double-digit inflation rates of 1979, 1980 and
1981 were finally beaten down by major Federal Reserve
surgery, involving the deep recession of 1981-82. With the
help of an oil price drop, the rate actually fell below 2% in
1986, but it bounced right back up. The rate has been
vacillating between 4% and 5%, though it shot up to 8.5% in
the first quarter. Nevertheless, administration officials are
wont to say that inflation has been "contained," whatever
that means.
   When you've weathered the high inflation rates of the
1970s and early 1980s, it's easy to sniff at 4% to 5%
inflation. That, in effect, is exactly what the Council of
Economic Advisers does in the latest Economic Report. "Low,
predictable rates of inflation," the Council says, "have
little adverse effect on the economy." It's the high and
widely variable inflation rates that can do a lot of damage
to economic performance. "Low" and "high" remain undefined.
   Perceptions change over the years. When the inflation rate
crept above 4% in 1971, President Richard Nixon imposed wage
and price controls.
   Wage-price controls were obviously a desperate move; the
government didn't know what else to do. But so, to a
considerable extent, is any effort to palliate the effects of
inflation. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns put
it like this in 1978:
   "This (indexation) is a counsel of despair. . . . I doubt
if there is any practical way of redesigning economic
contracts to deal with this problem satisfactorily. In any
event, if a nation with our traditions attempted to make it
easy to live with inflation, rather than resist its corrosive
influence, we would slowly but steadily lose the sense of
discipline needed to pursue governmental policies with an eye
to the permanent welfare of our people."
   The inflation palliatives make it easier for legislators
to embark on spending programs that may have inflationary
effects. With the safeguards in place, the lawmakers can
reason, nobody is going to get hurt. But inflation mitigation
policies, Mr. Fischer and Mr. Summers note, although they
reduce the cost of a given level of inflation, may end up
making inflation more costly to society. Inflation is always
counterproductive, because the extra inflation that results
has costs that exceed the direct benefits of protecting
against inflation.
   It isn't surprising that indexation has been especially
popular in the high-inflation countries of Latin America.
It's a way to keep the electorate reasonably quiet while
governments try to think of something else to do. Indexation
is more controversial in relatively low (there's that word
again) inflation countries such as the U.S.
   Forgoing inflation palliatives, in a real sense, amounts
to a commitment -- though hardly a perfect one -- to seek
stable prices. A better way may be for the government to
achieve a reputation for hating inflation. Once such a
reputation is attained -- West Germany and Switzerland have
had it pretty consistently in recent decades -- it is
difficult to give it up. The public becomes adjusted to an
inflation rate of 1% or 2%, and if the rate goes higher it
feels it has been cheated. Inflation expectations and
interest rates rise, damaging the economy.
   Profs. Fischer and Summers suggest that nations with
impeccable anti-inflation credentials have no reason to fear
indexation and some reason to favor it. It's difficult for
any country to control inflation precisely, and a country
with very low rates might offer indexation as assurance that,
if things went bad for a year or two, the public wouldn't
suffer.
   The authors don't get into it, but Japan might be in that
sort of situation now. Japan's inflation rates have been very
low. Consumer prices since the mid-1980s have usually risen
about 1% a year or less. But efforts to control the yen have
contributed to a sharp monetary expansion, with the result
that consumer prices in the past year have been moving up at
annual rates close to 3%.
   The Bank of Japan has been raising interest rates to curb
the inflation, and perhaps it will succeed. But until the
issue is settled, indexation might help if the government
could persuade the public that the current episode is no more
than a temporary aberration.
   Otherwise the Japanese, like the Latin Americans, could
find that better inflation protection would merely lead to
more inflation.

five to seven cents a share, compared with a loss of 13 cents
a share a year earlier, on revenue of $47 million, an

   The company attributed the better-than-expected results to
strength in its Remediation Services Group, including
increased revenue from industrial clients and federal and

   BERN, Switzerland -- Switzerland's trade deficit in March
narrowed to 775 million francs ($520.3 million) from a
revised gap of 827 million francs in February and from a
deficit of 993 million francs a year earlier, the government
said.
   For the first three months of this year, the trade gap
widened to 2.8 billion francs from 2.5 billion francs a year
earlier.

   Last month, imports surged to 9.2 billion francs from 8.2
billion francs in February and from 8.2 billion francs in
March 1989. Exports expanded strongly to 8.4 billion francs
last month from 7.4 billion francs in February and from 7.2
billion francs a year earlier. The continued export boom has
worried the Swiss National Bank because of the inflationary
implications of an overheated economy.
   For the year through March, imports totaled 25.4 billion
francs, up from 22.3 billion francs a year earlier, and
exports increased to 22.57 billion francs from 19.7 billion
francs.

   EAST BERLIN -- East Germany's industrial production
dropped 4.7% in the first quarter of 1990 from year-earlier
levels, mostly reflecting a decline in the number of workers,
the president of the nation's Statistics Office, Arno Donda,
said.
   According to East Germany's ADN news agency, Mr. Donda
said the total number of industrial workers declined by
124,000 during the period, while the number of workers in the
construction sector alone was off 33,000 from year-earlier
levels.

   Many East Germans started to move permanently to West
Germany in search of better living conditions after the
breaching of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9. That trend continued
during the first months of 1990, but the stream of

slowed to a trickle after East Germany held its first free
elections on March 18.

   Investors' enormous thirst for Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo
shares may finally have been quenched.
   Some money managers say the stocks have become too
high-priced, even while many brokerage house analysts
continue to recommend them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A few managers say Coke and Pepsi have become today's
equivalent of the wildly popular "one-decision stocks" of
1972. And that, they say, is a sign of trouble not just for
the two companies' shares, but for the stock market as a
whole.
   Both soft-drink makers have been among the strongest
performing stocks for more than a year. Coca-Cola has fizzed
up 78% and PepsiCo 68% since the start of 1989. Yesterday's
closing prices of 79 1/4 for Coca-Cola and 66 3/8 for PepsiCo
were off two points from the companies' all-time highs,
reached last week.
   Back in 1972, investors raved about the "Nifty Fifty," a
small band of high-quality growth stocks that investors
supposedly could buy and put away for the long haul. (Only
"one decision" was needed -- to buy them.)
   Companies such as Xerox, International Business Machines
Corp. and McDonald's were among the favored few at the time
and were bid up to sky-high multiples of 40 to 60 times the
companies' earnings. As businesses, the companies operated
superbly in the 1970s. But as stocks, they were miserable
flops because investors had overpaid for their expectations
of high growth.
   Coca-Cola and PepsiCo haven't reached the sky-high
valuations that prevailed back then. But Coca-Cola is selling
for 24 times the past 12 months' earnings and PepsiCo's
multiple is 20. It has been more than 15 years since the
soft-drink stocks (PepsiCo is also big in snack foods and
restaurants) sold at such high multiples.
   The pair have been investor favorites because of their
strong and steady growth, recession resistance and prospects
for further international expansion. According to Coca-Cola,
Americans consume 283 eight-ounce servings of its soft drinks
per person a year. By contrast, German consumers drink 167
servings, Italians 80 servings and the Chinese 0.4 serving.
   Other news has also boosted the stocks. Coke may have been
traded up in anticipation of a 2-for-1 stock split, which
holders approved yesterday at the company's annual meeting.
Also yesterday, Coke reported a healthy 15% increase in
first-quarter per-share earnings. Pepsi is expected to report
a gain of at least 13% when it releases first-quarter
results. Most analysts expect earnings gains for both
companies of at least 12% this year.
   What's more, last year's purchase of a 6% Coca-Cola stake
by investing legend Warren E. Buffett has had a halo effect.
"Buffett owns it, and he's got that mystique," says Kyle
Krueger, senior vice president of Eagle Asset Management Inc.
in St. Petersburg, Fla. (Mr. Buffett couldn't be reached for
comment.)
   But Mr. Krueger wouldn't touch the stocks. "We think at
this level Coke is overpriced. Pepsi as well," he says. The
enthusiasm for the stocks on Wall Street strikes him as an
example of analysts' tendency to recommend what's already
gone up. Just this week, he says, he was visited by an
analyst who disdained PepsiCo five years ago at far lower
prices, but now calls it "one of the best-managed companies
in America."
   One New York money manager who both buys stocks and sells
them short (betting on a price decline) says he won't buy
Coke or Pepsi because they're overpriced. But he wouldn't
consider short-selling them either, because they are
high-quality companies and business prospects look good.
   In response to such comments, Roberto C. Goizueta,
chairman and chief executive officer of Coke, said yesterday,
"Coca-Cola's stock is always cheap. I have yet to meet an
investor who hasn't increased his wealth by putting his money
on KO," the company's stock symbol. A company spokesman added
that the company's purchase of eight million shares of its
own stock during the past five months is an expression of
confidence in the stocks's value.
   A PepsiCo spokesman said: "We haven't seen any indications
that we're getting pricey." Some key analysts have recently
raised their year-end earnings estimates for PepsiCo and a
couple have changed their hold recommendations to buy, the
spokesman said. "The sense we get from analysts is that
there's a high degree of comfort out there."
   However, analysts' enthusiasm isn't a guarantee that a
stock will perform well. Research by Sasho Dalov, publisher
of Wall Street Wire, a market analysis service, indicates
that stocks recommended by large numbers of brokerage houses
usually underperform the market. By his tally, 13 brokerage
houses were recently recommending PepsiCo and eight were
recommending Coca-Cola.
   Institutional Capital Inc. of Chicago sold its entire
holding of more than 600,000 PepsiCo shares last year. "It
had done what we wanted it to do," says William Maloney,
chief investment officer. Cautious about the market (partly
because of rising interest rates), the firm has been raising
cash, and chose to sell first those stocks with prices that
were high compared with earnings.
   Roy Burry, a Kidder Peabody analyst, isn't recommending
either stock. He thinks they have gotten a little pricey as
enthusiasm spreads for companies with an international
flavor. "Global is a hot buzzword these days," he says.
   To be sure, the soda stocks still attract plenty of
enthusiasm. Martin Romm of First Boston recommends both, and
says they'll benefit from recent turbulence in the Japanese
market. "Investors are looking for the safety of
tried-and-true companies," he says.
   "These are very desirable stocks when the economy slows,"
adds John Maxwell, an analyst with Wheat First Securities
Inc. "The main downside is the market. If there's a crack
somewhere along the line, everybody suffers." Mr. Maxwell
believes Coke shares will reach $100 or more in the next 18
months, while Pepsi could be up in the 80s over the same
period.
   Roger Engemann, a Pasadena, Calif., money manager, owns
both Coke and Pepsi. Based on his firm's growth estimates, he
thinks Coca-Cola should sell for 106 by year end and PepsiCo
should sell for 91. "What we're looking for is companies that
we can just put away for five years," he says. "These brand
names are supervaluable things."
   Emanuel Goldman, analyst at PaineWebber, has long been a
fan of both Coke and Pepsi. "You have to search far and wide
to find stocks with their characteristics," including a clear
business strategy and "the ability to deliver earnings
short-term and long-term."
   Certain money managers are uneasy about the outlook for
the market because investor enthusiasm is so narrowly focused
on a few favorites such as the soda stocks, Philip Morris and
Federal National Mortgage Association. "The similarities to
1973 are eerie," says Mark Perkins, chairman of Perkins
Smith, a securities firm in Tampa, Fla. "There are stocks
that everybody wants to own, and there's everything else."
   Mr. Perkins also sees other similarities between today's
stock market and that of 1973. Then, banks had problems with
bad loans to real estate investment trusts. Today, banks have
problems with bad loans to real estate developers. In 1973,
the problems helped bring on a credit crunch, and he thinks
the same thing could happen again.
   In 1973, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was struggling
to pass the 1000 mark for the third time (the first two were
in 1966 and 1969). Today, the industrial average is near its
peaks of 1987 and 1989. In each case, Mr. Perkins discerns a
"triple top," a formation that technical analysts say is a
sign of trouble.
   Trouble did follow in 1973-74. Stocks entered the
third-worst bear market in history, which ultimately carried
stock prices down 45%. Of course, no one knows what the
market will do, but Mr. Perkins is battening down the
hatches. He has accumulated more than a 50% cash position,
and is short selling some high-flying small stocks.

   Philip Morris Cos. earnings rose 31% in the first quarter
to $775 million, or 84 cents a share, powered by strong gains
in its core food, beer, and tobacco businesses.
   In the year-ago quarter, the nation's largest
packaged-goods maker earned $590 million, or 64 cents a
share. Revenue rose 7.3% to $11.38 billion from $10.6
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts reacted favorably to the higher-than-expected
earnings, which were fueled by surprisingly robust results at
Philip Morris's domestic tobacco and Miller Brewing
operations. Many analysts had forecast earnings of around 78
cents a share for the quarter.
   "You become numb to Philip Morris's strong earnings gains,
but this was awesome," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. "This company wants cash flow to facilitate
their acquisition efforts."
   Added Marc Cohen of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.: "People
who were doubtful about this company's ability to continue to
grow given the industries in which it operates, as well as
its size, have reason to rethink their postitions."
   In the first quarter, Philip Morris's operating profit
rose 18% to $1.9 billion from $1.6 billion. Although the
company doesn't break out operating profit by division, Mr.
Cohen of Sanford Bernstein estimated that operating profit
from the company's U.S. tobacco business rose 18% to about
$815 million. At a time when cigarette consumption is
declining about 3%, Philip Morris's unit volume grew about
0.4%. Overseas, the No. 1 tobacco maker's unit sales rose 8%.
   At Miller Brewing, unit sales grew a buoyant 4%, thanks in
large part to the company's recently introduced Genuine Draft
and further gains by Milwaukee's Best, a popular-priced beer.
   Operating profit at Kraft General Foods rose an estimated
15% to about $600 million, mostly due to cost savings in the
aftermath of Kraft's 1988 merger with Philip Morris. But
volume at the nation's largest food company was up only 2%.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Philip
Morris closed at $42.625, down 37.5 cents, on volume of more
than 2.3 million shares.

   LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corp. posted a 61%
increase in first-quarter net income to $108 million, or 37
cents a share, from $67 million, or 24 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Sales rose 2%, to $5.2 billion from $5.1 billion. The
results include extraordinary losses of $2 million, or one
cent a share, in the latest first quarter, and $9 million, or
three cents a share, in the year-earlier period from the
early extinguishment of debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Occidental closed at $27.125, unchanged.
   The company had increased earnings in its oil and gas and
natural gas transmission divisions, offset by a $96 million
drop in earnings from chemical operations.
   Profit from oil and gas operations rose to $100 million in
the quarter from $35 million a year earlier. That increase
reflected higher world-wide prices for crude oil and higher
domestic prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids, and
the resumption of production from the North Sea Claymore and
Scalpa fields after the explosion of the nearby Piper Alpha
oil platform in 1988. These gains were partially offset by
reduced domestic crude oil and natural gas volumes.
   The latest first-quarter results included a $36 million
pretax gain from the settlement of a claim against Venezuela
for the 1975 nationalization of Occidental's commercial
block, a reduction in costs due to the restructuring last
year of domestic oil and gas operations, a $13 million pretax
write-off of certain receivables, and a $16 million benefit
from the reversal of certain income-tax reserves. Occidental
said the reversal of the tax reserves resulted from an
Internal Revenue Service audit of the company and certain
subsidiaries back to 1985 that determined the reserves are no
longer necessary.
   Earnings from chemical operations fell to $186 million
from $282 million in the year-earlier quarter, reflecting
lower profit margins in petrochemicals and polymers and
plastics. Earnings in the latest quarter included a $14
million reversal of income tax reserves.
   Natural gas transmission earnings rose to $94 million from
$61 million a year earlier, reflecting lower operating costs,
a rate refund and a $12 million tax benefit in the latest
period. Earnings from agribusiness operations, conducted by
Occidental's 51%-owned IBP Inc. subsidiary, rose to $14
million in the latest first quarter from $13 million the year
before. Earnings from coal operations rose to $4 million from
$3 million.
   Among the unallocated corporate items in the year-earlier
first quarter was a $36 million pretax charge for a
charitable contribution to the Armand Hammer Museum of Art
and Cultural Center. The $95 million project has sparked
shareholder litigation, and the Delaware Chancery Court is
considering whether the outlay is appropriate.

   Not only have I never "floated" such an idea, I am
strongly opposed to a national identity card. What I have
said is that Congress should consider just what the General

system to eliminate discrimination in hiring. This could
include something as simple as a phone verification using a
Social Security number, similar to what occurs every time you

   LOS ANGELES -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., buoyed
by continued strength in its long-distance business and
slimmer costs, said net income rose 12% in the quarter on a
2.7% increase in sales.
   Net income for the first three months was $668 million, or
62 cents a share, from $594 million, or 55 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $8.89 billion from $8.66
billion in the 1989 quarter.

   While earnings were slightly below analysts' expectations
of 68 cents to 70 cents a share, AT&amp;T posted a strong 21%
increase in operating profit in the quarter, to $1.18 billion
from $977 million the previous year, indicating that its
struggle to control costs is paying off.
   Net income was hurt by several factors including increased
interest expenses, a higher tax rate and costs associated
with last January's network disaster, when a software problem
shut down the company's nationwide long-distance network for
nine hours. In addition, AT&amp;T's telecommunications-equipment
business continues to suffer from increased price competition
and a softening of orders for switching equipment from local
telephone companies.
   Despite these problems, AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen said
the New York-based company's results showed it was off to "a
strong start toward making 1990 an even stronger year than
1989, which was our best."
   Mr. Allen, who made his comments at the company's annual
meeting at the convention center here, added that AT&amp;T has
set a goal for itself of increasing its earnings by at least
10% to 12% annually. "We were clearly ahead of that in the
first quarter. Typically, the first quarter is a weak one for
us." (Profit in the first quarter actually rose slightly more
than 12%.)
   However, AT&amp;T received a boost from businesses that had
not been a part of the company a year earlier, including
Istel Group Ltd., a U.K. information services company
acquired in the fourth quarter of 1989, and two divisions of
PacifiCorp Financial Services, which were purchased by AT&amp;T
Capital Corp. during the first quarter.
   AT&amp;T's revenue from product sales, including telephone and
computer equipment, increased a meager 1.2% to $2.72 billion
from $2.69 billion the year before. Mr. Allen blamed the
lackluster sales on the "rather weak economy" and a backlog
in computer-systems sales "due to customer demand and our
inability to fill that demand." To improve shipments, AT&amp;T
recently began manufacturing personal computers to augment
supplies from Intel Corp.
   Mr. Allen said the company is banking on new products to
boost sales. These include its recently announced credit
card, in which orders so far "have exceeded our wildest
expectations . . . customers are calling us by the tens of
thousands." In addition, he announced that AT&amp;T will begin
selling switching equipment based on an optical computer
processor developed by Bell Laboratories, within five years.
   Analysts reacted favorably to the company's results. "The
earnings masked what was probably AT&amp;T's best quarter since
divestiture," said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber
Inc. Long-distance "volume is up 7% and operating margins
were 13.2%, two points higher than a year ago. That's a lot
of expansion for a company this size." He estimated that the
network outage alone cost AT&amp;T about three cents a share
because of lost revenue and remittances to business customers
covered under AT&amp;T's 800 Assurance Plan.
   Robert B. Morris III, telecommunications analyst at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said AT&amp;T earnings were about three
cents less than his estimate. And sales, general and
administrative expenses were 35.2% of revenue "when I had
expected 34%." But Mr. Morris said, "I wouldn't characterize
this as a disappointing quarter."
   At the shareholder meeting, Mr. Allen defended the
company's previously reported decision to withdraw its
funding of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. AT&amp;T
announced the move on March 26 following pressure applied on
the company by shareholding anti-abortion activists.
   Referring to protests by Planned Parenthood, Mr. Allen
said: "I'm disappointed in their actions. If someone were
supporting me for 25 years, I would say `thank you.' In the
last 25 years, we funded them to the tune of $600,000, and we
never heard a word of thanks from them."
   Mr. Allen added that AT&amp;T will spend $2.5 million this
year supporting teen-pregnancy prevention programs similar to
those they had been supporting at Planned Parenthood.
   Mr. Allen said Planned Parenthood has elevated the
abortion issue to political advocacy and that "this caused
our opponents and proponents to say that we are supporting
abortion. I concluded -- I should say the {AT&amp;T} foundation
concluded -- that abortion or opposing abortion shouldn't be
supported by the corporation."
   A first-time shareholder proposal that AT&amp;T stop funding
organizations that advocate abortion managed to win 5.5% of
the votes cast at the company's annual meeting, insuring its
inclusion on the ballot for a second time at AT&amp;T's 1991
meeting. Another resolution, calling on AT&amp;T to drop its
affirmative action program, garnered 8.8% of the vote, less
than the 10% it needed to be included for the fourth time
next year.
   AT&amp;T common stock fell $1 yesterday to close at $41 a
share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   Rising College Costs a Sign of Success

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A15
</SO>
<LP>
   Your March 12 editorial "College Prices" bemoans college
tuition-rate increases, accuses U.S. colleges of significant
waste and exhorts them to pay attention to the forces of the
market. The editorial misleads on all counts. First, the
forces of the marketplace tell colleges that, if anything,
tuition should be rising more rapidly than it is. Rates of
return on college education have skyrocketed in recent years.
Students may pay more, but they are getting back even more in
higher income. Changes in the U.S. industrial structure away
from heavy manufacturing toward services, "inter alia", has
generated a shortage of high-paying blue-collar jobs and a
surplus of jobs requiring more-sophisticated analytical
skills. In 1973, the median income of a 30-year-old male
highschool graduate was 15% less than the income of a
30-year-old male college graduate. By 1987, the gap had
widened to 50%. College education, then, is one of the best
investments an 18-year-old can make. This, of course, is a
major reason why the share of college enrollments among the
relevant age cohort rose throughout the past decade despite
the tuition increases.
   Second, you suggest that professors' lives are too cozy.
You miss the point when you observe that professors at some
schools teach eight to 12 hours a week in the classroom.
Would we judge the work of a CEO by hours spent in the board
room? In addition to classroom hours, professors spend long
hours working with individual students, preparing for
lectures and seminars, attending meetings and doing research.
The average workweek is well over 40 hours. This is not to
say that certain professors don't take advantage of the
luxury of tenure. They do, and this is just as troubling to
those of us in academia as to the outside critics, but this
group is a small minority and surely has its analogues
elsewhere in society. It is difficult to understand how you
can believe that as a group professors are overpaid when
individuals in the private sector with similar levels of
skill and educational attainment receive salaries many times
higher. President Bush, to his credit, has noted the
problematic state of U.S. schools and the absolute necessity
of upgrading and enriching the entire educational system.
This can happen only if teacher salaries, at all levels, go
up appreciably and quickly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There remains the issue of making a college education
accessible to all income groups. Here the best solution is
simple. Rather than tinkering with the price of output as the
Justice Department investigation encourages (as well as
significantly pushing college operating costs), the
government would do well to make educational loans available
to all worthy applicants. The high rates of return to college
graduates would make this among the safer loans issued by our
financial institutions in recent years.

law firm.
   I cannot sympathize with parents who hold themselves
hostage to an expensive institution's tuition, because I know
that there is a bright alternative -- public higher
education.

   ---
   Your complaint that "too often it looks as if the schools
exist mainly for the benefit of the faculty" is both naive
and misguided. Are not the tenured faculty members the de
facto proprietors of educational institutions? Are not
enterprises, in a free-enterprise economy, run for the
benefit of their proprietors? Do you take seriously the
rhetoric of college and university administrators who pretend
to be motivated by charitable rather than self-interested
objectives? Do you think that the not-for-profit tax loophole
really means not for profit?
   Most important, what is your problem with the profit
motive? You suggest that similar tuition at similar
institutions is evidence of collusion. But the market for
educational services, with thousands of suppliers and free
entry, actually is highly competitive. Students, who apply in
large numbers and cherish admission, clearly regard an
education at even the elite colleges and universities that
charge the highest tuition to be a bargain. In fact, the
interesting question is why demand has not driven tuition
substantially higher. (The answer presumably is that an
excess of applicants enables colleges and universities to
perform a useful screening function.)
   The bottom line is that Adam Smith's invisible hand works.
All studies show that a higher education is the best
investment a family can make. The self-interest of suppliers
constrained by competition has given us, as you grudgingly
admit, "the best university system in the world."

   You use the terms "average workload" and "teaching load"
interchangeably. In order to clarify your meaning for me and,
perhaps, for other readers as well, let me pose the following
question.
   Does an editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal have
an average workload calculated solely on the time his or her
fingers are actually inputting information via an electronic
keyboard, to the exclusion of time spent on research,
thinking, communicating, administering, meeting with
colleagues and perchance even drinking coffee?

   American's Videos
   Don't Mean to Be Funny

   IF YOU WANT to be a video star, you don't have to record
an ear-splitting rock and roll tune. All you have to do is
drum up some gripes about American Airlines.
   As part of a test, the airline recently set up a video
booth in the baggage section of the Nashville airport to give
customers a chance to tape their comments. And judging from
some footage of the comments, obtained by this newspaper,
people don't seem to be the least bit shy about going on
camera.
   "We've just had the worst flight of our life," complains
one bearded traveler from Arizona, who describes how his
plane made two aborted landing attempts through fog in Dallas
before diverting to Austin to refuel, where he waited "hours
and hours." One elderly woman fights off tears as she
explains how a canceled American flight to Chattanooga is
forcing her and her ailing husband to rent a car and drive
three hours to get home.
   Another video guest says she has ordered special meals on
five flights and hasn't received one yet. Maybe she's lucky:
Another woman, named Patricia, complains that a special
seafood meal she ordered was so bad "even the stewardess said
`You shouldn't eat that. It smells terrible.'"
   The booth, designed by a company called Short Takes Inc.,
gives each passenger one minute. And for at least one weary
soul, that wasn't enough. Holding up a $25 award certificate
from American, he bitterly complains about having to go
through "an act of God" to redeem it and then takes a swipe
at the man in charge of American. "I don't like what Robert
Crandall is doing to our hub and if he were here right now,
I'd . . . ." (Oops, time's up.)
   Of course, not all the comments are so mean. One American
customer compliments the airline for serving bran muffins for
breakfast, but can't resist adding that "I think you could
lose the eggs and it wouldn't hurt our feelings bad at all."
One New York women provides a glowing account of how a
diligent American clerk hunted down a lost scarf. And an
Atlanta man gushes that American is "one of the greatest
businesses I have ever dealt with in any respect."
   American insists that despite some of the negative
feedback, it's pleased with the test so far. But it hasn't
decided whether to open more booths, which got mixed reviews
from customers. "This thing seems a little expensive to me,"
one patron says. "I would have been glad to do just a post
card."
                                                                                                       

   You Can Go Cheaply,
   But Do You Want to?
                                                                                                       

   IF ONLY Tallahassee, Fla., were some great mecca for
business travelers.
   Tallahassee turns out to be the cheapest city for business
travel, according to a survey of 100 cities by Corporate
Travel magazine. It costs the average business traveler just
$116 a day to spend a day and night there, including
overnight lodging, one-day car rental and three meals.
Biloxi, Miss., at $122 and Omaha, Neb., at $124 are the next
cheapest.
   But of course, most business people don't have reason to
go to these places. Here's the average cost for a one-day
business trip in the 10 most expensive cities: New York
($312); Chicago ($256); Boston ($252); Washington ($226);
Newark, N.J. ($218); San Francisco ($207); Los Angeles
($192); Dallas ($191); Baltimore ($186) and Detroit ($185).
                                                                                                       

   Running Into Confusion
   With Damage Waivers
                                                                                                       

   FOR MOST car renters, deciding whether to take the
collision-damage waiver has always been a bewildering choice.
Now, it may only get more confusing.
   Yesterday, Alamo Rent A Car Inc. announced it was offering
three types of waivers, instead of just one, in Florida
beginning this week. If it succeeds, the company plans to
expand the offer to other states, and analysts say at least
some competitors will have to match the policy, although they
haven't so far.
   The waiver is basically an agreement that a rental firm
won't charge the driver for any car damage in most cases.
Under Alamo's new plan, Florida drivers can buy the
traditional waiver for $9 a day for all car sizes. Or, they
can pay less and get less protection: For $6 a day, the
waiver covers the first $3,000 in damage; for $3 a day, it
covers the first $500.
   For savvy renters, the new options may be very attractive.
Many drivers' own insurance policies, for example, already
cover car rental damage, but come with $500 deductibles.
Those people, Alamo points out, can now buy the cheaper
waiver to cover the deductible without paying for any
unnecessary coverage.
   But renters who don't have this insurance -- or who aren't
clear about their coverage -- will now have only more hard
choices to make. And they still may not need any waiver if
they're using certain credit cards that provide free
car-rental insurance.
   "It was tough enough to explain their options when there
was only one level of coverage," says Fred Mudgett, a
car-rental industry consultant in Florida. "Now you've got
three levels to explain to people."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MORE THAN NINE out of 10 drivers think traffic congestion
worsened or didn't improve in 1989, according to a survey by
the American Automobile Association. Almost three out of 10
drove at least 10 miles out of their way to avoid the crowded
roads, the survey of 1,700 drivers found. . . . Consolidate
and conquer: Travel agencies with annual revenues of over $5
million controlled 33% of the market in 1987, up from 24% in
1983, according to a U.S. Department of Transportation study.

   Dun &amp; Bradstreet
   Net Plunged 23%
   In the 1st Quarter
   ----

   NEW YORK -- Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.'s first-quarter profit
fell 23%, reflecting the biggest shock yet to earnings from a
year-old controversy surrounding sales practices in the
company's credit services operations.
   The information company also cited the impact of an
expired contract on its Donnelley Directory operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, directors declared a 6% increase in the
quarterly dividend to 53 cents a share from 50 cents, payable
June 8 to stock of record May 18.
   Financial analysts said they expected the results, which
the company had been clearly signaling. Yesterday, Dun &amp;
Bradstreet reiterated a forecast of 1990 per-share earnings
of about $2.80, indicating an 11% decline from 1989's $3.14 a
share.
   In the quarter, net income totaled $110.3 million, or 60
cents a share, down from $143.3 million, or 77 cents a share,
the year earlier. Revenue rose 8.5% to $1.15 billion from
$1.1 billion. The company noted, however, that the gain was
only 4% after adjusting for the acquisition of Management
Science America, a software concern, and the divestiture of
Thomas Cook Travel.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, D&amp;B closed unchanged at $47.125 a share, down 12.5
cents.
   The earnings drop "was due in part to a decrease in
revenue at U.S. Credit Services and substantial increase in
costs" to revamp the operations, the company said. The
company added that world-wide revenue for credit services
declined, largely because of a "high-single-digit" drop in
first-quarter revenue of U.S. credit services. A spokesman
declined to elaborate.
   Last year, many customers accused Dun &amp; Bradstreet
salespeople of misleading them to buy far more credit
services than the company knew were needed. The company has
conceded that, in some cases, customers were abused. In
addition, without admitting any wrongdoing, the company
reached an $18 million agreement to settle five major
lawsuits that similarly alleged customers were oversold
services through deceit. As part of the settlement, the
company agreed to modify its business practices in several
important respects. And it was those changes that accounted
for substantial cost increases in the credit services
business.
   In the wake of the controversy, sales growth of credit
services has been weak, but Dun &amp; Bradstreet's profit had
continued to increase until the first quarter.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet revenue for its directory information
services fell 21% to $90.3 million from $114.3 million the
year earlier because of the absence of revenue from a
Donnelley directory contract and the timing of revenue from
yellow pages directories.
   In other highlights, the company said, revenue grew 12% in
marketing information services, 5.8% in financial information
services and 30% in business services.

   CORPORATE WASTE is a growing market in the recycling
business.
   More companies are separating their garbage as recycling
programs take hold. "For years we tried to solicit their
business," says Neil Kossis of Atlas Waste Paper Corp.,
Pittsburgh. Now soaring landfill costs are making companies
think again, he says. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. tests recycling of
office paper, cardboard and aluminum cans. Corning Inc. says
it will start an inhouse program within six months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Environmental concern is one motivation, but many programs
also make money. BankAmerica Corp. nets about $175,000 a year
on its paper-recycling. McKesson Corp. uses the revenue from
its paper program -- $1,344 last month -- for community
programs and philanthropy. Some 600 New York corporations now
recycle cans through WE CAN, a non-profit group that uses the
five-cent-per-can bounty to help the poor and the
environment. Tax deductions for the nickel-a-can donation
"can be substantial," says WE CAN founder Guy Polhemus.
   Typically it is a concerned secretary, not an executive,
who instigates corporate recycling, Mr. Polhemus says.
                                                                                                       

   HOME GARDENERS show few signs of going organic.
   Garden centers are stocking more organic supplies, but
they aren't cutting back on the chemical side. If
alternatives don't work, they say, customers will be back for
their old standbys. People are "definitely" reading labels
more carefully, says Jerry Armstrong of Village Green Plant &amp;
Garden Center, Chicago. But most aren't changing their buying
habits, says Betty Jackson of Frank's Nursery &amp; Garden
Center, Philadelphia. "People are coming in and buying the
same dandelion preventer as usual."
   In Atlanta, a warm winter coupled with heavy spring rains
has created a boom market for pesticides and other chemicals.
Customers there couldn't care less about toxicity, local
nurserymen say. They just want something to kill the bugs,
weeds and fungi. "I'm selling three cases of Dacanil a week
just to fight black spot," says Randy Kucera of Randy's
Nursery &amp; Greenhouses, Lawrenceville, Ga. Still, Chalet
Nursery &amp; Garden Shop in Wilmette, Ill., expects organic
gardening to finally catch on this year.
                                                                                                       

   CLEANER FUELS hit the road as demonstration projects gain
ground.
   With some 780 methanol and flexible-fuel vehicles in
operation, California now claims the largest alternative-fuel
fleets in the country. "And they will soon expand
dramatically," with the addition of some 5,000 flexible-fuel
vehicles, says Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the California
Energy Commission. New York State tests compressed natural
gas vehicles in Tonawanda's town fleet. The U.S. government
gets set to order the first of several thousand flexible-fuel
vehicles for its own demonstration.
   "Things are starting to happen and more things will
happen," says Carmine Difiglio, acting director of the
federal office of energy demand policy. He sees commercial
fleets -- such as overnight-mail services -- phasing in such
vehicles around 1994. Californians, he says, will probably be
the first to feel the push for alternative fuels at the
consumer level.
   Flexible-fuel vehicles -- which use either gas or alcohol
-- will ease the transition to other fuels, says Albert
Chesnes of the Department of Energy.
                                                                                                       

   A GOOD FLORIST is hard to find long distance. That's the
premise of "Fine Flowers by Phone," a new guide by Barbera
Brooks, which offers brief reviews -- complete with style
descriptions and minimum prices -- of 300 floral "artists" in
250 cities.
                                                                                                       

   DANGLING DIAMONDS: To ease demand for Saturday night
wedding receptions, the Mayflower Hotel, Plymouth, Mich.,
offers a pair of $500 diamond earrings to any couple that
books a Friday night reception for 125 people or more. Also
included: an appraisal certificate.
                                                                                                       

   ISSUE ORIENTED: Ohio-based insurer Progressive Corp.
devotes its annual report to the issue of drunken driving,
commissioning eight artists to create works on the theme.
McDonald's Corp. devotes its report to the environment,
printing it on paper recycled from its offices and suppliers.
                                                                                                       

   RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES find funds for buildings in a novel
type of bond.
   Faced with a need for new research facilities, some
schools are issuing bonds backed by research-related
revenues, such as rents, interest on grant funds and
reimbursements for overhead costs. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
says it has rated only a handful of such tax-exempt issues.
"But interest from other universities is expected to rise as
research activity and the need to expand facilities
increase," says S&amp;P's Lisa Danzig.
   Utah State University is just completing a new
biotechnology building financed with such bonds. "We will be
able to attract better qualified people and they in turn,
because they have the facilities, will attract contracts and
grants," says Bartell Jensen, Utah State's vice president for
research. The University of Colorado is about to issue $13.4
million in bonds to build new facilities, including a home
for the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics.
   The technique isn't for every school. Tax problems could
result if buildings house much corporate research, says Linda
Fan of Morgan Stanley.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Europe in 1792 is the theme of the Harvard
Business School Show entitled "Les Bizerables." . . . The
National Anxiety Center, Maplewood, N.J., announces an Earth
Day Anxiety Alert for people afraid of overdosing on
environmental hype.

   In Corvallis, Ore., the U.S. Forest Service has clipped
the wings of what it believes is a highly controversial
political figure -- Woodsy the Owl.
   Woodsy, the civic-minded sidekick of Smokey Bear, has
spent the better part of two decades encouraging the public
to "Give a Hoot-Don't Pollute." But officials at the Siuslaw
National Forest near here decided they didn't want
elementaryschool students to confuse a Forest Service
employee wearing a 5 1/2-foot "Woodsy" costume with the
real-life Spotted Owl.

   The living bird is at the center of political debate in
the Pacific Northwest because it needs old-growth forests to
survive. Environmentalists want to protect the owl by
preserving large tracts of land, including some in the
Siuslaw National Forest. Loggers and millworkers, meanwhile,
say such action might preserve the birds but would threaten
their own jobs.
   "Parents of some of the kids could have their lives and
livelihoods affected by decisions about the Spotted Owl,"
says Norm Hesseldahl, a spokesman for the Forest Service. "We
didn't want to upset people."
   So the Forest Service mascots won't be making their usual
joint appearances in kindergarten through second-grade
classrooms in Benton County, which has a population of
69,000. Woodsy has been caged for the rest of the year, while
Smokey goes it alone.
   Woodsy's woodshed treatment might not be a bad idea in
view of the strong feelings the Spotted Owl raises, says Rod
Harvey, principal of the elementary school in Philomath, Ore.
"Since our job is to educate children from both sides," he
says, "we try to stay clear of getting involved in
controversy."
   But the character's no-show has prompted grumbling from at
least one Corvallis elementary school.
   Woodsy was scheduled to be the headliner at Hoover
Elementary School's Earth Day celebration this week. And when
Earth Week celebrations coordinator Terry Sullivan heard
about Woodsy's grounding, the second-grade teacher canceled
plans for Smokey's appearance, too.
   "These are just primary-aged children," Ms. Sullivan says.
"I think it's pretty unlikely they would even associate
Woodsy Owl and the Spotted Owl."

   RICHMOND, Va. -- Media General Inc. reported a 77% drop in
first-quarter net income as operating profit declined sharply
in its newspaper and newsprint divisions.
   James S. Evans, president and chief executive officer,
said "although 1990 revenue growth is expected, the
uncertainty of the economy currently is clouding the earnings
outlook." But he added that the company sees "1990 and 1991
as the first rung on a new growth ladder, which will provide
a period of renewed growth and expansion."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   First-quarter net income fell to 2.7 million, or 10 cents
a share, from $11.9 million, or 46 cents a share, a year
earlier. The 1989 quarter included an after-tax gain of $5.7
million, or 22 cents a share, from the sale of a newsprint
recycling mill. Excluding the year-ago gain, profit was off
56%. Revenue fell slightly to $148 million from $149.3
million.
   Media General said newspaper profit fell 44%, reflecting
continued softness in national, retail and classified
advertising and consolidation in the retailing industry.
Newsprint profit dropped 38% because of heavy price-cutting
in a market plagued by overcapacity.
   Media General owns four daily newspapers and a 40%
interest in a company that owns 15 other dailies. It also
owns four television stations and two cable-TV properties and
has interests in three newsprint mills.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Media
General closed at $28.75, down 50 cents.

   Bookshorts: Thirtysomething and Having a Rough Time

<LP>
   Paul Russell's first novel, "The Salt Point" (Dutton, 210
pages, $18.95), might have been written on a dare. It's
saddled with a hero who is, superficially anyway, a cliche --
he's a gay hairdresser named Anatole. Its setting, the Hudson
River burg of Poughkeepsie, is a byword for exurban dullness.
And it's got a plot that might make many readers
uncomfortable. Let's just say it involves Anatole, his
friends Lydia and Chris -- both of whom, like him, are
pushing 30 and leading romantically uncommitted,
professionally aimless lives -- and a remote, alluring
18-year-old lad named Leigh who enters their world and
changes it forever.
   Mr. Russell has taken these materials, however, and
created a wise, tender and remarkably engrossing story about
human affections -- their power and illogic, their
preciousness and unpredictability -- and about how those
affections flare and fare at the "salt point."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What, you ask, is the salt point? As Chris explains, it's
the ever-shifting place where the Hudson turns salty and
technically becomes an estuary. It serves here as a metaphor
for the equivocal stage of life at which Anatole and his
friends find themselves: They're at the far edge of youth,
torn between the attractions of adolescence and the
imperatives of adulthood, forced to confront their childlike
tendencies to mistake irresponsibility for innocence,
detachment for freedom, maturity for corruption, commitment
for confinement.
   Yet there are important differences among the characters,
and one of the most impressive things about this book is the
deftness and impartiality with which Mr. Russell moves from
one point of view to another, seeing each character through
the others' eyes and disinterestedly rendering their
discrepant readings of the same circumstances. Mr. Russell
speaks of the "forces mysterious as weather" that rule the
human heart -- and his mindfulness of these forces, and of
the rich ambiguity of all human relations, makes his novel
extremely credible.
   Most of it, that is. For Mr. Russell interpolates several
contrived flashbacks to account for his characters'
aimlessness and fear of commitment, and works in a number of
pretentious references to atomic apocalypse. But these
touches of simplistic motivation and baby nihilism are the
exception in a book conspicuous for its genuineness and
humanity. Mr. Russell knows that in the great scheme of
things "nobody matters much"; his accomplishment is to remind
us, with surprising poignancy, that the miracle of life is
how very much people can mean to each other.
   ---
   Like "The Salt Point," Christopher Osborn's lyrical,
meditative "A Sense of Touch" (Harper &amp; Row, 282 pages,
$18.95) is a debut novel about concupiscence and commitment
featuring a thirtyish gay protagonist. Robert is a London
pianist whose first professional concert provides the novel's
structural framework: While he plays, we share his thoughts
and memories, as well as those of his parents and friends in
the audience.
   These thoughts and memories are largely carnal. While
Robert contemplates the ecstasies and frustrations of his
promiscuous sex life -- which inspires some of the book's
most impassioned prose -- and recalls his brief affair, a
year earlier, with an attractive, mendacious young man named
Johnny (who has much in common with Mr. Russell's Leigh),
Robert's parents ponder the tedium of their marriage.
   The message is clear: Monogamy can be deadening; sex with
a multiplicity of virtual strangers can be life-enhancing, a
form of "pure communication" with one's fellow man. Even
during his liaison with Johnny, Robert "has no desire to
intrude, to absorb or be absorbed; he is aware of Johnny as a
quite separate life; and this awareness, which is the
opposite of possession, is enriching."
   Mr. Osborn writes well -- sensitively, perceptively, even
beautifully -- about these matters. Yet he fails to convey a
vivid sense of the life of which Robert's libidinous
encounters are, after all, only a part. Robert's scenes with
family and friends seem odd and fragmentary: Often one isn't
sure what point Mr. Osborn seeks to make about these
relationships. Nor -- for all his immense efforts -- does Mr.
Osborn convince one for a moment that Robert's sexual habits
are anything but hollow and grubby and sad. On the contrary,
his novel inadvertently reminds one that meaningful human
communication -- like a masterly performance of an unfamiliar
piano piece -- calls for something more than skilled
extemporaneous virtuosity.

   Heileman Brewing
   Unit of Bond corp.
   Acts on Huge Debt

   G. Heileman Brewing Co. said it is negotiating with its
banks to restructure its huge debt, the result of its $1.3
billion leveraged buy-out by the Australian investor Alan
Bond in 1987. No agreements with the lenders have been
reached, a company spokesman said.
   According to news reports in Australia, Heileman and its
bankers, led by Bank of Boston Corp., are discussing a
debt-for-equity swap that would give the banks some ownership
in the brewer in return for some debt forgiveness.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Heileman, based in LaCrosse, Wis.,
declined to comment on details of the discussions.
   The troubled brewer, fifth largest in the nation, is
reported to have about $850 million in bank debt and junk
bonds. Analysts have reported that the company has a $60
million principal payment due to its banks in June and
another $50 million payment at year end.
   Heileman declined to comment on its debt or the payment
schedule. A spokesman for the Bank of Boston also declined to
comment.
   In January, Heileman said it had an operating profit for
the first half of its fiscal year, which ends June 30, but a
net loss following interest payments. Heileman declined to
comment on its third-quarter performance; but analysts and
consultants have reported that the company's market share
declined almost 10% in 1989, putting the company below the
"critical mass" needed to play in today's highly competitive
beer market.
   "They've got less than a year," said Tom Pirko, president
of consulting company BevMark Inc. of Los Angeles. "There's
no practical way they can continue on. They're a good company
in many ways and have some brands with good equity but
they're heading for a fall."
   Heileman is known to have some assets up for sale,
including some breweries, but liquidation of all the
company's assets still may not raise sufficient money to pay
off the debt. Mr. Bond paid between two and three times what
the company is now worth, analysts and individuals in the
industry estimate. These people put the value of Heileman
assets at between $350 million and $500 million.
   Some industry experts have compared Heileman's bank debt
to the debt of Third World countries, because it appears that
the loans can't be paid off in full out of income. The
difference, says Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's
Insights, is that the "banks can't sell a Third World
country. They can sell Heileman."
   Earlier this month, Mr. Bond's Australian company, Bond
Corp. Holdings Ltd., posted a loss of A$758.2 million (US$580
million) for the first half of the fiscal year, which ends
June 30, mainly due to losses incurred on asset sales and
write-downs on the value of certain assets. The latest
results compare with a year-earlier profit of A$152.8
million.
   In the latest results, Bond Corp. disclosed that as of
Dec. 31, Heileman was carried on Bond Corp.'s books at a
value of A$532.5 million. Bond Corp. paid $1.28 billion for
Heileman in 1987 and later sold a small part of the U.S.
concern.
   Bond Corp., 58%-owned by Mr. Bond, has announced an
agreement to sell its Australian breweries to a 58%-owned
unit, Bell Resources Ltd., for A$1.85 billion. Those
breweries as a whole represent the second-largest beer maker
in Australia.

   NEW YORK -- A big rout in the Treasury bond market sent
stock prices tumbling and helped weaken the dollar against
key currencies.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 32.89 to 2732.88,
the sharpest decline in about two months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Traders and investors said the main factor was continued
Japanese selling of long-term U.S. Treasury securities. The
bellwether 30-year bond dropped 1 1/8 points, or $11.25 for
each $1,000 face amount, taking yields up to 8.83%, the
highest level in nearly a year.
   All three markets largely ignored yesterday's merchandise
trade report for February, which showed a significant
narrowing of the U.S. deficit. "The trade report, if
anything, should have been favorable" for bond prices, said
Michael Strauss, chief economist at UBS Securities Inc.
   Imports of oil and consumer goods dropped, pointing to
moderating inflation pressures. Non-auto capital goods
exports rose to $12.9 billion, a record high, according to
Louis Crandall, economist at R.H. Wrightson &amp; Associates,
Inc., an economic research firm. "All the surprises in the
trade report were favorable," Mr. Crandall said.
   But bonds fell sharply as talk of widespread Japanese
selling spread through the market. Traders said Japan's trust
banks and other financial institutions were taking profits on
both bond and currency positions.
   Indeed, foreign exchange traders said the dollar tumbled
on steady sales from traders around the world, starting in
Tokyo the night before, as the dollar traded near 160 yen.
   "My guess is that Japanese investors are moving to other
financial centers," said John Gaines, a foreign exchange
trader at Bank of New York. "I think they are switching out
of dollars and into {West German} marks."
   Added James McGroarty, senior vice president at Greenwich
Capital Markets: "I think Japanese investors chose this as an
opportune time to take some profits."
   Treasury bond prices could keep falling until yields are
buoyed up to 9%, several traders predicted. Such a sharp rise
in bond yields usually hurts stocks, which become a less
attractive investment.
   But not all investors are bearish. The improved U.S.
exports confirmed what several stock strategists have been
forecasting: a rebound in America's basic industries this
year. "I haven't shared the notion that the economy is going
to grind to a halt and that earnings are so terrible," said
Joseph McAlinden, director of research at Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Among other cyclical stocks, which rise and fall with the
pace of economic activity, some auto shares held their
ground; Ford rose 7/8 to 48. But profit-taking clobbered
semiconductor, technology and software stocks that have risen
lately.
   Michael Schonberg, chief investment strategist at Chase
Investors Management Corp., said he will use declines in
stock prices to start "paying more attention to cyclical
stocks." Earnings of many of these companies are at the low
point for the year, he believes.
   The Dow industrials' drop was the sharpest since a
38.74-point slump Feb. 20. But volume was a light 147.1
million shares. Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his own stock
research firm, said net dollar outflow from the stock market
amounted to $163 million in block trades and $96 million in
non-block trades.
   "Given what the market did today, it was not an especially
large amount {of net outflow}; there was very little selling
pressure," Mr. Birinyi said. That meant foreign investors who
were selling dollars and Treasury bonds weren't also dumping
stocks.
   "Stocks that had a lot of net outflows were not those that
I would characterize as foreign-owned," Mr. Birinyi said.
   Among typically foreign-owned issues, such as General
Motors, Merck and Ford, more money flowed into these stocks
through big block trades than flowed out, Mr. Birinyi said.
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks fell. Declining issues swamped advancers on the New
York Stock Exchange by 1,056 to 477.
                                                                                                       

   Bonds tumbled. The benchmark 30-year Treasury issue sank 1
1/8 points, or $11.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was off sharply. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 1.6722 marks and 158.10 yen, compared
with 1.6768 marks and 159.68 yen late Tuesday.

   NEW YORK -- Capital Cities/ABC Inc. reported first-quarter
net income climbed 28% as revenue rose 13% on the strength of
a 15% increase in its broadcast operations revenue.
   The broadcasting and publishing company posted net of
$106.3 million, or $6.08 a share, up from $82.7 million, or
$4.59 a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew to $1.26 billion
from $1.12 billion. Broadcasting operating profit rose to
$200.5 million from $148.7 million, but publishing operating
profit eased to $24.3 million from $24.8 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue at the broadcast division, consisting of the
network and eight TV stations, advanced to $992.5 million
from $865.6 million, primarily because of strong advertising
demand and healthy ratings, except for its daytime schedule.
   Publishing revenue increased to $269.8 million from $254.9
million. The division consists of nine daily newspapers and
weeklies as well as shopping guides and specialty magazines.
   Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said
one reason Capital Cities/ABC performed so well was that its
TV network, despite its second-place showing in the ratings,
continues to be demographically attractive to advertisers.
   "Unlike NBC, ABC hasn't had to do make-goods," he said,
referring to the industry practice of giving free commercial
time to advertisers when a show doesn't deliver the audience
size guaranteed to the sponsor.
   Mr. McAlpine said he anticipated a weak so-called up-front
market -- when ads are sold in advance of the 1990-91 TV
season. Despite that, Mr. McAlpine said, "ABC is in the best
position of any network." As previously reported, ABC
finished the 30-week 1989-90 prime-time season, which ended
Sunday, in second place, behind General Electric Co.'s
National Broadcasting Co. and ahead of CBS Inc.'s TV network.
   But ABC had the season's only hits of the three major
networks: "America's Funniest Home Videos" and "Twin Peaks."
The only other hit is "The Simpsons" on Fox Broadcasting Co.,
a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Capital Cities/ABC closed at $539.375 a share, down $7.125.

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. steel imports declined 16.8% in
February from a year earlier, while steel exports climbed to
one of the highest monthly totals in recent years, according
to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
   The trade group compilation of Commerce Department data
showed U.S imports of steel mill products in February were
1,111,000 tons compared with 1,336,000 a year earlier.
January imports totaled 1,430,000.

<TEXT>
   Imported steel in February was 15.8% of the total supply
of the U.S. market, compared with 16.8% a year earlier and
17% for the first two months of the year.
   February steel exports were 565,000 tons, substantially
higher than both the 237,000 tons a year earlier and 374,000
tons in January.
   The American Institute for Imported Steel noted that
imports for the first five months under the new voluntary
restraint agreement were 17.9% of consumption, well below the
U.S. target of 19.1%. The agreement, which went into effect
in October, allows imports to account for 19.1% of
consumption through December 1990 and 20.1% until the program
ends in March 1992.

   Film: A Mystery and a Romance From France

   Like many comedians, the French actor Michel Blanc often
hints at the sadness lurking just behind his apple cheeks. He
is wonderfully sad in "Monsieur Hire," a French mystery about
an odd little tailor whose main pleasures in life are bowling
and voyeurism.
   Bowling, however, plays only a small part in this very
cool, very bleak adaptation of Georges Simenon's novel, "The
Betrothals of Mr. Hire." Like so many film makers before him,
it is the voyeurism that commanded the attention of director
Patrice Leconte, who until now has devoted himself mainly to
light comedy. Actually, Mr. Leconte was inspired by
"Panique," the 1946 film version of the Simenon novel, making
his movie an adaptation of an adaptation -- which may help
account for its occasional lapses in coherence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Hire is suspected of murder. This information comes
early, in a somewhat oblique way, from the investigation
conducted by the unnamed police inspector played by Andre
Wilms. Presumably this inspector is modeled on Simenon's
Inspector Maigret, though his obsession with this particular
murder, and with Mr. Hire, are never really explained.
   What makes Mr. Hire a suspect are two facts: The victim, a
young woman whose ethereal dead face fills the opening frames
of the film, lived near the reclusive tailor. And Mr. Hire is
not only reclusive, he has a brooding quality that makes his
simplest actions seem potentially sinister. Even his
apparently innocent encounters with a child who lives in his
building seem ominous.
   "What do you do to make people detest you?" the inspector
asks him.
   "I'm not chatty," says Mr. Hire. Mr. Blanc, small and
balding with large dark eyes, presents a convincing and
unnerving portrayal of a man who either is a pitiable loner
or a pervert. Every day he stares out his window into the
apartment across the way, at the lovely young woman who lives
there. He watches her all the time. He sees her dress and
undress, read in bed, embrace her lover.
   Whether he's watching her or not, it is impossible to read
the expression on his face. But his manner, his face,
everything about him breeds uneasy feelings, not unlike the
mixture of sensations set off by the approach of a beggar.
Does he deserve hostility or sympathy?
   The film makers keep adding information about Mr. Hire
purposely designed to make him more, not less inscrutable. He
regularly visits prostitutes whom he bores and confuses with
long bitter stories about nice little old ladies who poison
pigeons. He prides himself on being unobtrusive, which he
probably would be if, like so many self-designed loners, he
didn't imagine himself to be the focus of other people's
attention. "Do you want my photograph?" he snarls at
neighbors idly watching him coming and going.
   Before Mr. Hire can confess his infatuation to Alice, she
catches him spying on her. As it turns out, Alice not only
doesn't mind him looking at her, she likes it. Sandrine
Bonnaire, the interesting young actress who plays Alice, has
an appropriately mysterious aura, and in this kind of film,
aura is usually all a girl can hope for.
   There is a kind of chilly perfection in the remoteness
that pervades this film, from the characterizations to the
stark, somber imagery. Wear a sweater.

   The French director Coline Serreau, born into an acting
family, has spent time as an organist, a trapeze artist, an
actress, a writer and a movie director. This may explain why
her movies have such peripatetic plots.
   She also has an intuitive sense of what masses of people
will find funny, as she demonstrated in "Three Men and a
Cradle," a successful film that was even more successful in
its Americanized remake, "Three Men and a Baby."
   Now, with "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed" she once again
combines her slick commercial in tuition with a loopy
sensibility to produce this romance between a conventional
yuppie careerist (who's married, white and the fa ther of
two) and the black woman who cleans his office.
   The problem with this Romeo and Juliet story (in French
the film is titled "Romuald et Juliette") is that Daniel
Auteuil's businessman seems far too egocentric and
disagreeable to be so easily converted to niceness by the
earthy, worthy Juliette (played by Firmine Richard, in her
first screen role). This is, after all, a woman who goes
through husbands the way a child goes through Pampers: She
needs them when she needs them but they are eminently
disposable once they've served their purpose.
   The purpose of Juliette's husbands was to provide her with
the many cute children crowded into her tiny apartment, and
to appear now and then for comic relief. She wins her Romuald
by helping him conquer the corrupt corporate colleagues whose
shenanigans provide the complex farcical subplot. Along the
way he comes to see the worthlessness of his value system. On
the other hand, Juliette's reward for her nobility is being
elevated out of the poverty level into a comfortable
upper-class life.
   Perhaps this inconsistency will be cleared up in the
American version, which Ms. Serreau reportedly is preparing
for Disney Co.

   VIDEO TIPS: The interaction between voyeur and subject has
been done before "Monsieur Hire," and better. Louis Malle,
for example, used a similar trick to lead into much more
fascinating territory in his superb film, "Atlantic City."
And then, of course, there's the classic film on the subject
of peeping tomism, Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window."

   Mideast Struggles

   A few weeks ago in an Israeli court, Hertzl Bocovza, a
26-year-old trucker, appeared on charges of careless driving.
The proceeding was a banal coda to the 28 months of violence
sparked when Mr. Bocovza's truck killed four Gaza Strip
Palestinians.
   "Intifada: The Palestinian Uprising -- Israel's Third
Front" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 352 pages, $22.95) takes Mr.
Bocovza's December 1987 accident as its starting point. In
the seething, squalid camps of Gaza, Mr. Bocovza's smash
wasn't seen as a careless accident, but an act of war; a
deliberate killing of Palestinian laborers on their way home
from work.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Written by Ze'ev Schiff and Ehud Ya'ari, two experienced
Israeli military correspondents, the book offers much new and
revealing detail gleaned from army and security-service
insiders. For instance, a survey conducted in Gaza jails
during the first days of the intifada showed that the riots
were being led by an entirely new type of protester,
unfamiliar with even the most rudimentary slogans of the
Palestine Liberation Organization or any of the typical
baggage of politicized Palestinians.
   Instead, the 100 or so young men interviewed turned out to
be driven to despair by the routine miseries of scrambling
for the poorly paid work unwanted by an Israeli majority who
regarded them with a mixture of contempt and fear. Many told
of humiliations, such as the wedding convoy stopped at a
checkpoint, where the groom was ordered to dismantle the
wheels and seats of his car as his anguished bride looked on.
   Initially, such findings didn't stop Israeli politicians
calling the intifada the work of outside agitators, nor stop
Yasser Arafat pathetically trying to claim credit as its
puppet-master. Eventually though, the authors say, the
evidence began "tearing through the veil of hypocrisy and
self-deceit that what Israel had practiced for over 21 years
was a `benevolent occupation.'"
   Unfortunately, the book's insights are embedded in
mechanical prose that clunks along with so many "steam
boilers," "gaskets" and "pistons" pressed into metaphorical
service that it reads, in part, like a technical manual. This
is a bloodless book, bereft of human voices. Instead of
allowing us to hear directly from the participants, Messrs.
Schiff and Ya'ari distill the fruits of their extensive
contacts into a colorless concoction.
   More serious is the book's lack of balance. The authors
date their foreword October 1989, but the book seems to lose
track of the intifada long before that date. Little light is
shed, for instance, on the uprising's sharp turn inward in
the second year: the ghastly murders of Palestinians by their
own activists on charges of collaboration with Israelis.
   Perhaps this imbalance also skews the authors'
conclusions. Arguing that the intifada has paved the way for
a negotiated settlement, Israelis, they say, must ask
themselves "what life will be like in a country that is
preoccupied with suppressing a large part of the population
living within its borders."
   Yet the uprising has ceased to preoccupy Israel. Talk
these days turns excitedly to the influx of Soviet Jews, the
need for electoral reform, the nefarious intentions of Iraq's
Saddam Hussein. By avoiding West Bank roadways, forgoing the
convenience of shopping in cheaper Arab "souqs" and the
pleasure of dining in the graceful stone precincts of Arab
East Jerusalem, most Israelis have reduced contact with the
intifada to an uncomfortable awareness that part of military
service now includes a stint of riot control in the occupied
lands. And short of some visionary leadership on either the
Israeli or the Palestinian side, that isn't enough to compel
a settlement.
   And many don't think it should. Like the government of
Israel, the Washington D.C.-based authors Neil C. Livingstone
and David Halevy seem to have a policy of refusing to talk to
the PLO. Indeed, accuracy should require that their "Inside
the PLO: Covert Wars, Secret Funds and the War Against Israel
and the United States" (William Morrow, 288 pages, $18.95) be
retitled. "Outside the PLO" would be a good deal more
appropriate for a book that draws whatever marginal amount of
new information it offers almost exclusively from unnamed
"intelligence officials" -- mostly U.S. and Israeli.
Otherwise the authors draw on newspaper articles and
published works on terrorism.
   The authors state that the book initially was envisioned
as "a modest monograph" detailing PLO actions against the
U.S., and that catalog of horrors remains its centerpiece.
But in trying to deal with all the PLO's factions as well as
its putative links with Abu Nidal and Hezbollah, the authors
too often rest their case on cobwebs of thin research.
   For example, the chapter on George Habash, leader of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is titled
"Yesterday's Man." But recent conversations with Palestinians
-- both inside the Israeli-occupied territories and in
influential outside communities such as Kuwait's -- indicate
that the soft-spoken doctor, who feels armed struggle is the
Palestinian's only long-term hope, is more likely than ever
to emerge as tomorrow's hero.
   So far, Mr. Arafat's strategy strikes many of the
dispossessed Palestinian young to have failed bitterly, and
it is to an uneasy alliance of Dr. Habash's secular,
left-wing faction and the Islamic extremists that more and
more eyes are turning.

   Gulliver for the Defense

   Imagine that in a single year your business is the subject
of hearings by 14 committees and 43 subcommittees of the U.S.
Congress. Consider that about 1,500 staff members devote
nearly all of their time to your issues. And imagine that
they call your company 599,000 times in a year.
   You're beginning to understand what it's like to run the
Pentagon. These and other amazing facts are contained in a
study released this month by Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney. The 41-page "White Paper on the Department of Defense
and the Congress" shows that it's impossible to understand
gold-plated Pentagon hammers without also understanding the
meddling of the U.S. Congress.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The current congressional defense process is
characterized by a multiplicity of actors, frequent
decisions, lack of finality, disintegration and lack of
accountability," says the White Paper, in typical
Pentagonese. In other words, Dick Cheney is Gulliver in
Capitol Hill's Lilliput. While influence by Congress is
obviously important in a democracy, congressional control
over defense has grown like Topsy in the past 20 years. It's
yet more evidence that Congress has grabbed power from the
executive branch since Watergate.
   In 1988 alone Congress sent the Pentagon some 18,000
letters, usually in the form of all-purpose requests for
documents or information. The Pentagon spent some 245,000
hours just answering this mail. Then there are congressional
requests for "reports." Those increased to 861 requests in
1989 from 36 in 1970, or more than 2,000%. The average report
takes about 1,000 hours to prepare and costs about $50,000.
Among the urgent report topics: a new hospital at the Army
medical center near Rep. Pat Schroeder's Colorado district.
   Capitol Hill supervision is most inane on the budget, with
the President's annual request now little more than a
sideshow. Congress's budget fixes doubled in number in the
1970s and they multiplied by several hundred percent again
from 1982 to 1987. Congress now alters more than 60% of the
Pentagon's budget line items.
   As if this weren't enough, no budget decision is ever
final. The White Paper points out that a program can be
adjusted on at least 14 different occasions as it makes its
way through the annual legislative "process." An unneeded
F-14D jet can be slipped in at any point along the way, or a
B-2 bomber chopped away.
   The classic examples are the four "studies" Mr. Cheney has
to supply Congress before he can even think about closing a
military base. Mikhail Gorbachev has an easier time closing
bases. An American President's only leverage is the veto, but
only if he has the nerve to veto an entire spending bill (or
close down the entire government if it gets packed into one
giant "continuing resolution").
   The White Paper doesn't quantify the cost of all this, but
it's safe to assume it's billions of dollars each year. With
each dollar meaning more as defense spending is cut, we'd
have thought this problem might warrant some Washington
attention. Mr. Cheney's report barely rated a paragraph in
most major news media. Somehow Pentagon waste, fraud and
abuse is a story only when defense contractors are involved.
   The complaint on the Hill just now is that Mr. Cheney
hasn't proposed a new defense "strategy." But what's the
point of a strategy if more than 60% of what's proposed is
sliced, diced or spliced? If the Lilliputians want to
strangle Gulliver, they should also get credit for the
"strategy."

   Earnings at United
   Technologies Rose
   8.7% in 1st Period

   United Technologies Corp.'s first-quarter profit rose 8.7%
on a 7.6% revenue rise as the jet engine and elevator
divisions more than offset weakness in its automotive, air
conditioner, helicopter and defense electronics units.
   Net income climbed to $134.5 million, or $1.05 a share,
from $123.7 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. The
gain was in line with estimates by analysts who follow the
Hartford, Conn.-based concern. Revenue rose to $4.8 billion
in the latest quarter, from $4.46 billion a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said operating earnings for its Pratt &amp;
Whitney aircraft engine business soared 40% to $251 million
in the quarter, from $179 million a year earlier, primarily
because of higher spare parts sales and cost cuts. Pratt &amp;
Whitney's results also benefited from lower research and
development costs, which were inflated in the year-earlier
period by work on the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter
program.
   United Technologies said earnings for its Building Systems
segment rose 21% to $92 million in the quarter, from $76
million, largely because of international after-market sales
and service revenue at the Otis division, which makes
elevators and escalators. The Building Systems segment
includes the Carrier division, which posted lower earnings
because of weak demand for its heating, air conditioning and
ventilation equipment in North America, the company said.
   The company said its Flight Systems segment had an $11
million loss in the quarter, against a $12 million profit a
year ago, as sales of lower-valued parts and service reduced
earnings at the Sikorsky helicopter and Hamilton Standard
aerospace divisions. Losses at the Norden defense electronics
division continued in the quarter at year-earlier levels, a
spokesman said.
   Operating profit for the Industrial segment, which
includes the automotive products business, fell to $16
million from $53 million in the period due to reduced U.S.
car and truck production, the company said.
   "The corporation's diversity, large after-market
businesses and international presence continue to be its
greatest strengths, particularly when some segments of the
U.S. economy are soft," said Robert F. Daniell, the company's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   The company said its backlog reached a record $21.2
billion at March 31, up from $18.2 billion a year earlier.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, the shares closed at $57, down 37.5 cents.

   The number of Vietnamese boat people arriving in Hong Kong
has fallen sharply, allowing hard-pressed officials to
concentrate on persuading those who are here to go home.
   So far this year 917 have arrived, against 2,441 for the
same period in 1989. Altogether last year, more than 34,000
boat people streamed into Hong Kong, which now has 54,000
Vietnamese packed into its camps. Most of 1989's influx was
from northern Vietnam, while this year's refugees are
predominantly southerners.
   "We have hard evidence that our message has got across in
northern Vietnam that there is no future here," says Mike
Hanson, Hong Kong government refugee coordinator. "It seems
people are coming from the south because it's cheaper and
safer there to come to Hong Kong."
   Hong Kong has recently suspended its controversial policy
of forcibly repatriating Vietnamese, and has attempted
instead to convince small groups of refugees to return
voluntarily to Vietnam.
                                                                                                       

   BUILT IN AMERICA
                                                                                                       

   A study financed by the import auto industry predicts that
direct foreign investment in U.S. auto manufacturing will
create 110,000 jobs and lower the U.S.-Japan trade deficit by
$9.3 billion to $15.2 billion below what it otherwise would
be at the end of 1992. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department
projects that more than 1.5 million foreign cars will be made
at seven plants in the U.S. this year and 2.25 million
passenger cars will be imported. New-car sales are expected
to exceed 8.5 million.
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMAN OUTPUT FALLS
                                                                                                       

   East Germany's industrial production dropped 4.7% in the
first quarter of 1990 from a year earlier. The nation's
Statistics Office attributed most of the fall to the exodus
of workers to West Germany. According to East German
officials, the total number of industrial laborers declined
by 124,000 over the last year.
                                                                                                       

   TAIWAN RETIREMENT PLAN
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party has approved a plan to
phase out aging legislators, who have been frozen in office
since 1949 when they followed the late Chiang Kai-shek into
exile after the Communist victory in mainland China. The
Nationalist Party resolution calls for the retirement of
these lawmakers by the end of 1991. Holding more than half
the seats in parliament, they have been the focus of heated
public protests in recent years because they have never stood
for re-election. Legislators in the fledgling opposition
Democratic Progressive Party have taken to yelling insults,
spitting and sometimes shoving elderly deputies to the floor
in order to prevent them from speaking during parliamentary
sessions.
                                                                                                       

   MAGNETIC SHIPS
                                                                                                       

   Japanese shipbuilders are taking a major stride toward
launching the world's first vessel powered by superconducting
magnets. The 100-foot-long hull of a test ship, the Yamato I,
will be moved next week from the western Japanese port of
Shimonoseki to Kobe, near Osaka, where engineers will attach
the magnetic propulsion system now under construction. "Our
goal is to test the propulsion system on the high seas next
year," says a spokesman for the Japan Foundation for
Shipbuilding Advancement. The system has many potential
advantages over propellers, including higher speed and
maneuverability, lower noise and running costs.
                                                                                                       

   PEPSI COMES TO BURMA
                                                                                                       

   PepsiCo Inc.'s Pepsi-Cola International has signed an
agreement to operate in Burma for the first time and hopes to
begin production by the end of the year. A company spokesman
says Pepsi would beat archrival Coca-Cola into the Burmese
market, which has been largely off-limits to Western
corporations for the past quarter century.
                                                                                                       

   ROMANIA'S FINEST?
                                                                                                       

   Romanian police, long regarded as the enforcers of
dictatorship, have launched a drive to become modern,
professional crime-fighters, and are appealing to Western
police forces to help train them.
   "We want to change the mentality of the policeman -- he
should be closer to the people and not terrorize them," says
Col. Vasile Dobrinoiu, who became head of the police training
academy after the fall and execution in December of dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Col. Dobrinoiu expressed the hope that Western countries
will send police instructors and donate modern teaching
materials to Romania.
   The police especially need training in non-violent crowd
control now that demonstrations, strictly banned under Mr.
Ceausescu, are becoming a feature of Romanian life.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A virus outbreak destroyed or damaged data in thousands of
computers throughout China last week, according to the
official New China News Agency. . . . Estonia has hired an
unnamed foreign firm to print bank notes that will replace
the ruble. If the new krone notes go into circulation as
scheduled on Dec. 24, Estonia will become the first
constituent Soviet republic to have its own currency.

   NEW YORK -- Thomson McKinnon Inc. agreed in principle to
sell its general partnership interest in its asset management
company to a group including executives of the money manager.
   The money manager, Thomson McKinnon Asset Management
Limited Partnership, is Thomson McKinnon's largest remaining
operating company. Thomson McKinnon, which is liquidating,
last year sold its retail brokerage network to
Prudential-Bache Securities Group Inc. The operations that
remained of the broker-dealer unit filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code
last month.

   Greylock Investments and TA Associates, both of Boston,
and several investment advisers of Thomson McKinnon Asset
Management are proposing to acquire Thomson McKinnon's
general partnership interest in the manager of mutual funds
and private accounts.
   Greylock and TA are closely held equity investment firms
with a total of more than $1 billion of committed equity
capital. The Thomson unit had $6.7 billion in assets under
management as of March 31. The group doesn't plan to buy any
of the public limited partnership units.
   Under the plan, the group would become the general
partner, purchasing 200,000 general partnership units from
Thomson McKinnon for $800,000 and paying $5.4 million for an
option to acquire the balance of Thomson's total of about 6.2
million units. The option would have to be exercised by 1994,
and dividends would go toward reducing the purchase price.
   The agreement also includes the sale of the broker
dealer's Thomson McKinnon Fund Distributors Inc.

   CML, Acton, Mass., said Mr. Jacobs decided against

fiscal 1990 and 1991.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Jacobs, whose earlier $25-a-share bid was rejected by
CML, stopped short of ruling out any future action on CML. He
said no standstill or other agreements have been reached with
CML.
   Mr. Jacobs noted that CML's forecast represents "quite a
difference from where they've been." He said CML, after
selling a number of businesses, "can focus on fewer
businesses without stretching beyond their means."
   Since Mr. Jacobs and Minstar, a Minneapolis company he
runs, bought their stake, CML has sold several businesses as
part of a restructuring. CML predicted earnings from
continuing operations of $1.90 to $2 a share in the fiscal
year ending July 31, although it will post a loss for the
year because of losses from discontinued operations. Sales in
the year will be about $275 million, up from $234.6 million.
   CML also predicted that earnings from operations will
increase to about $2.80 a share on increased sales of about
$318 million. CML said its growth will come in part from an
expansion of its Nature Co. stores and additions to its line
of NordicTrack exercise equipment.
   In the previous fiscal year, the company had a loss of
$5.5 million, or 85 cents a share, from continuing
operations. A loss from discontinued operations of $26.4
million resulted in a loss in the year of $31.9 million, or
$4.92 a share.
   In an agreement earlier this year between Mr. Jacobs and
CML and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Jacobs would have been permitted to solicit consents from
CML shareholders from April 18 to May 18, calling for a
special meeting to remove CML's board and replace it with a
slate committed to selling the company to the highest bidder.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CML
closed at $21.125 a share, down $1.125.

   Dollar Mostly Sags Against Major Units
   Despite Improved U.S. Trade Statistics

   NEW YORK -- The dollar tumbled against most major
currencies yesterday despite a report of a sharp improvement
in the U.S. merchandise trade performance in February.
   Dealers said the U.S. unit had expended its energy in the
days leading up to the release of the trade data, advancing
on expectations that the trade deficit would narrow
substantially. But when the expected improvement was finally
reported, the market tried to lift the dollar and was met
almost instantly by selling.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was obvious that the market was long on dollars before
the trade figures were released, said Douglas Madison,
corporate trader at Bank of America in Los Angeles. A brief
effort to take the dollar higher right after release of the
figures was countered by a large number of orders to sell, he
said. "It was just a wall that the interbank market in no way
could break through," he added.
   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's
merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $6.49 billion in
February from a revised gap of $9.32 billion in January. The
result was the best recorded since December 1983. Economists
had forecast a February deficit of $7.6 billion, although
some currency dealers had been talking about deficits as
narrow as $4.5 billion to $5 billion in recent days.
   One minute after the release of the data, the dollar hit
its intraday high of 1.6830 marks and 1.4940 Swiss francs.
But the U.S. currency put up little defense of such heights.
A few minutes later, the dollar had turned sharply lower
against the West German and Swiss currencies as well as
against the yen.
   Hubert Pedroli, vice president and manager of foreign
exchange at Credit Suisse in New York, said a trader at his
firm was selling the dollar to one customer for 1.6830 marks
almost as he was buying it from another for 1.6770 marks. The
whole thing lasted 10 seconds, he said.
   Against the yen, dealers didn't even try to push the U.S.
currency higher, he said. The dollar never went up against
its Japanese counterpart because 160.00 yen had previously
proved a solid ceiling, he said. People bought the dollar
ahead of the trade number, he said. Once the news was out,
"it just couldn't go higher."
   The dollar was trading at 159.60 yen just before the
release of the trade data.
   Charles Spence, vice president of foreign exchange at
First Interstate of California in Los Angeles, said dealers
quickly noted that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan had
widened for the month despite the overall narrowing. As a
result, the first analysis led to a sell-off of the dollar
against the yen, he said.
   U.S. imports from Japan exceeded exports to that country
by $3.12 billion for the month, swelling from $2.86 billion
in January.
   Bank of America's Mr. Madison said the worsening U.S.
trade performance with Japan will strengthen the position of
those who argue that the U.S. should take part in some effort
-- like intervention -- to bring the dollar lower against the
yen.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6722 marks, down from 1.6768 marks late Tuesday, and at
158.10 yen, down from 159.68 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6392, up from $1.6385 Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at
158.35 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 159.87 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6735 marks.
   The Treasury Department said in a report to Congress
yesterday that the depreciation of the yen is a matter of
concern and that the Group of Seven industrialized nations
will keep developments under review. However, Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady told Congress earlier that the
recent decline of the yen is of no immediate concern and that
the Japanese unit has been relatively stable over the past
two to three years.
   The Brady statement came late in the trading day and had
no impact on rates. The report was released following the
close of trading.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $376.10 an ounce, up 90 cents. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $376.70 an
ounce.

   AMR Posts Loss
   Of $19.3 Million
   For First Quarter

   AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, reported a
first-quarter net loss of $19.3 million, its first quarterly
deficit in more than two years.
   A poor showing had been expected. AMR's vocal chairman,
Robert L. Crandall, had publicly warned that the company's
first-quarter results wouldn't come close to last year's $101
million profit. AMR's per-share loss was 31 cents, compared
with year-earlier profit of $1.60 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nonetheless, in a statement, Mr. Crandall said he was
"very disappointed" with the loss. "Our results can only be
called unsatisfactory," he said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AMR stock closed at $64.50, down 87.5 cents.
   AMR's results are frequently the bellwether for the
industry, with the company's profits higher and losses
narrower than those of its competitors. First-quarter results
of other carriers are likely to run true to this form,
analysts said.
   "It's going to be a bad quarter for everybody," said
Thomas Longman, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Mr.
Longman said he expects losses at other carriers to surpass
AMR's.
   At AMR, a 9.7% increase in revenue to $2.69 billion,
couldn't offset sharply higher operating costs. AMR was
squeezed by higher fuel prices, soft travel demand and static
fares. Plus, the first quarter is traditionally the weakest
period in the airline industry because the span is sandwiched
between peak holiday travel and the busy summer months.
   While the company's load factor, or percentage of seats
filled, held steady at 59.9%, its break-even load factor was
60.6%, compared with last year's 54.8%.
   Currently, many of the factors that made for a rough first
quarter seem to be receding. Fuel prices, while not down to
last year's levels, are somewhat lower. Demand is up. Also,
this year's Easter season, always a high-traffic period, was
in the second quarter. That should help offset expected
difficulties airlines may have this quarter making fare
increases stick, Mr. Longman said.

   U.S. Upgrading
   Its Probe of Brakes
   In GM Automobiles

   The federal government is upgrading its probe into reports
of faulty brakes in more than one million full-sized cars
built by General Motors Corp.
   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
said it has learned of almost 900 complaints of faulty brakes
on GM's so called "H-body" cars: the Buick LeSabre,
Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville. The agency's
investigation covers some 1,080,000 million cars built in the
1986 through 1988 model years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government said it has received notice of 892
complaints about the braking systems, which were involved in
187 accidents. Seventy-four people reportedly were injured as
a result of these accidents.
   A spokesman for the agency said the problems appear to
have something to do with the brake master cylinder, but as
of this time, "we don't have the exact nature" of the
problem. He said the agency hasn't determined whether a
safety defect is the cause.
   The upgrade moves the probe from a preliminary
investigation status to the engineering analysis level.
   By moving the probe to a higher level, the government is
signaling it believes there could be a substantial problem
with the brakes on the cars. In addition, the government now
will dedicate a greater amount of resources to its
investigation.
   A GM spokesman said the auto maker is cooperating with the
agency's investigation, and wouldn't have any further
comment.
   Last August, the government stepped up a similar
investigation to determine whether 1,064,000 GM cars had a
potential rear-brake defect. That investigation involved all
of GM's 1986-1987 "C-body" and "H-body" cars, including the
Oldsmobile 98, the Cadillac DeVille and some models in the
current investigation. At the time, a federal safety official
said the agency had received 59 complaints, with one reported
accident and injury. The outcome of the prior investigation
wasn't immediately clear yesterday.
   Separately, the agency made an initial determination that
a safety-related defect exists in about 25,000 "micro-mini"
motor homes built between 1977 and 1986. It was the first
time the agency made an initial determination of a defect
since 1983.
   The motor homes are built on the back of mini-pickup truck
chassis built by Toyota Motor Co. Dozens of manufacturers
have done the conversion work on the vehicles covered by the
investigation. According to the agency, excessive weight has
been placed on the rear axles, resulting in axle failure and
the separation of wheels from the axle. The agency has
received 440 complaints about problems, including reports of
16 crashes involving injury.
   The agency will conduct a public meeting on May 23 about
the motor homes, before deciding whether to order the
manufacturers to recall the vehicles.

   What Is Whiskered
   And Ugly and Has
   Little Squinty Eyes?

   No, Not Your Former Spouse
   But the Naked Mole-Rat,
   The New Darling of Zoos
   ----

   The naked mole-rat is a nasty-looking piece of work.
   It is pink, wrinkly and 3 to 6 inches long. Though neither
mole nor rat, it is naked, or nearly so. Whiskers sprout from
its awful little face, and strands of hair stick out from the
tip of its tail and from between its bony toes. It has long
tusk-like teeth and squinty eyes. It is a rodent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is also being hailed as "the animal of the future" by
marketing people at zoos.
   Scaling the heights of zoo fashion isn't going to be easy
for this underground beast. Described as a sausage with teeth
by a zoo curator and called "really quite revolting" by an
editor of a coming book on the breed, the naked mole-rat
hardly elicits the kind of human response found around the
monkey cage or outside the leafy preserve of the giant panda.
Almost universal is the sentiment often expressed by
youngsters encountering a colony at the Cincinnati Zoo:
"Ooooh. Gross]"
   Yet beauty, as we know, is only skin deep. And zoologists
find the naked mole-rat enchanting. Next month, the
Brookfield Zoo near Chicago will unveil its first colony of
naked mole-rats. Other zoos -- in Phoenix, Chicago (Lincoln
Park Zoo) and Washington, D.C. -- want to acquire some. Zoos
that already have colonies -- in London, Philadelphia and in
New York City's Bronx borough -- are preparing the skittery
creatures for display.
   In time, zoo people hope, the public will respond
favorably to the naked mole-rat. "People are less married to
cute and cuddly," says a spokeswoman at the Cincinnati Zoo,
"and more willing to reach out to what used to seem too
strange and unpalatable." Look at the wart-hog, says a
spokeswoman at the Philadelphia Zoo. Asked to vote it "beauty
or beast," zoogoers in that city decided "beauty." "His inner
qualities shined through," says the spokeswoman.
   What makes naked mole-rats so exciting to scientists,
however, is not their looks, but their stranger-than-fiction
behavior. These creatures represent a little-understood
evolutionary parallel between insects and mammals: They are
the only known mammals with the social behavior of wasps,
bees and ants.
   In their native habitats in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia,
mole-rats live in underground tunnels, a colony of about 100
infiltrating areas as large as six football fields. Each
colony has a queen, almost always the sole breeding female,
and one or two breeding males. The others are sexually
uninterested workers who dig for food and tend the royal
brood, or "pups."
   Getting to be queen sometimes involves a bloody fight to
the death. Females sink their huge buck teeth into their
rivals' mouths and genitalia. The victor, who may end up
missing a toe or two, then balloons in size, sometimes nearly
doubling her weight. The males don't seem to care who gets to
service her. But those who do pay for the honor: Their bulk
gradually shrinks by half.
   Stan Braude, a mole-rat researcher affiliated with the
University of Michigan, is so enthralled by all this that he
sells mole-rat T-shirts to his scientific colleagues, bearing
a cartoon of a queen in pearls, sharing martinis with her
mate in a bow tie. The caption: "The Naked Mole-rat, A Truly
Social Mammal."
   A typical zoo display of naked mole-rats resembles an
immense ant farm. The animals scurry through a
temperature-controlled system of plastic tubes and chambers,
climbing over each other, sweeping, grooming and tussling.
They run backwards as fast as forward, tapping their tails
like a blind person's cane. "When they are all active, it's
like Times Square on New Year's Eve," says James Doherty,
general curator at the Bronx Zoo. In sleep, they pile on top
of one another, like nudists huddling for warmth.
   Maintaining mole-rats in captivity is no small feat. Most
zoos keep their colonies "off exhibit" -- away from the
public -- while pondering how to keep them content. Mole-rats
get spooked by everyday noises. "We notice every time
somebody slams a door, they all stop for a minute and
listen," says Jo Gipps, a curator at the London Zoo. If pups
are repeatedly disrupted by noise-freaked adults, they quit
nursing and die. The Philadelphia Zoo, hoping to accustom its
colony to human sound, has borrowed a trick that dairy
workers use to calm cows: radio music, specifically the songs
of Bruce Springsteen. Brookfield, meanwhile, is trying talk
radio.
   Furthermore, these animals constantly test the fondness of
their handlers. Naked mole-rats are so wary of foreign smells
that zoo keepers touching them must first rub their hands
with chips coated with the queen's urine.
   As zoologists cope with keeping molerats healthy and
happy, marketing people cope with hyping them. Bruce Brewer,
a curator at Brookfield, offered this suggestion: Place a
billboard in the Chicago area's affluent North Shore that
displays a giant photo of a naked mole-rat face and the words
"Now at Brookfield Zoo." "People would think we have
monsters," he says gleefully.
   The marketing department killed that idea, as well as
another suggestion for an ad theme: "Let's Get Naked."
Instead, the zoo plans to feature photographs of naked
mole-rats, along with some other animals, in mailings to
members.
   Yet just one glimpse of a naked mole-rat can cause the
willies. Mystery writer Elmore Leonard says a magazine photo
of the rodents inspired his account of the delirium tremens
suffered by a wealthy drunk in "Freaky Deaky": "Woody saw
naked mole-rats coming at him . . . with teeth so big they
couldn't close their mouth. . . . They were on his bed, on
him . . . crawling up his body and he couldn't move. All he
could do was raise his head and scream, `Yaaaah]' "
   Coincidentally, there is a real Woody: Dave Wood, an
assistant curator who tends the Philadelphia Zoo's
off-exhibit colony of naked mole-rats. Nicknamed "Woody," he
displays the excerpt from "Freaky Deaky" on his office door
as a caption to a large photo of the animals. "They're ugly
as sin," he says, but "they grow on you."
   He is careful, however, to prepare behind-the-scenes
visitors for seeing the live colony by first showing them the
photo.
   Bob Truett, a zoo director in Birmingham, Ala., who also
operates a nudist colony, has a theory to explain why people
dislike the naked mole-rat. "We identify with things that
have hair," he says, "because we are very hairy creatures."
   Gordon Gallup, psychologist at the State University of New
York who studies people's reactions to animals, disagrees,
insisting that human beings and mole-rats have much in
common. Unlike most mammals, both are mostly naked, he notes,
and love to congregate in large groups.
   "If an intelligent life form from another part of the
cosmos were to visit planet Earth," he adds, "my guess is
they'd lump naked mole-rats and humans together because we
are so unusual relative to other species."
   Some people even develop a sort of kinship with the
creatures. Jennifer Jarvis, a researcher in South Africa,
raises mole-rat colonies for study and is the chief supplier
to zoos ($200 per animal, or $4,000 for a small colony of
20). She remembers a time she was collecting mole-rats near a
watering hole in northern Kenya. A blanket-swathed elder from
the dark-skinned Samburu tribe, regarding the white-skinned
Ms. Jarvis and her catches, noted, "Their skin is just like
your skin."
   Perhaps afraid he'd offended her, he added: "But oh, they
are beautiful."
   Ms. Jarvis, whose skin had turned a dusty pink-brown after
two weeks' digging in the hot sun, realized with delight that
he was right. "I hadn't really thought about them being like
me," she says.

   NL Industries Sues
   Lockheed, Seeking
   To Nullify Election

   DALLAS -- Investor Harold C. Simmons and NL Industries
Inc., recently rebuffed in a proxy fight with Lockheed Corp.,
sued the defense concern and its directors, challenging the
fairness and legality of the recent director elections.
   In the suit filed in Los Angeles federal court, NL alleged
that Lockheed's management and directors breached their
fiduciary duties and "manipulated the corporate machinery" by
placing millions of shares in friendly hands through an
Employee Stock Ownership Plan and then intimidated employees
into voting in management's favor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Houston chemicals concern, which Mr. Simmons controls,
also alleges that Lockheed illegally solicited some shares by
distributing misleading proxy materials and that it threw out
other shares that should have been voted for NL.
   NL argues that if those votes were properly handled and
the ESOP votes were thrown out, its directors nominees would
have been elected. It asks the court to declare its slate the
winner or to call a new election in which the ESOP wouldn't
be permitted to vote.
   Backed by the ESOP, which owns about 18.9% of Lockheed's
stock, and several large institutions, Lockheed's director
nominees won between 58% and 61% of the votes at the March 29
annual meeting. NL, which owns 18.94% of Lockheed, got about
37% of the vote for its slate. At the same time, Lockheed
shareholders overwhelmingly approved shareholder initiatives
that NL had backed.
   In Calabasas, Calif., a Lockheed spokesman said the
company hasn't seen the suit and couldn't comment.
   In the lawsuit, NL contends that Lockheed's ESOP, which
was created about a year ago, allows employees to vote shares
well before they are allotted to their accounts or even paid
for. As a result, NL contends, Lockheed salaried employees
who own about 1% of the company can vote a block of more than
17% of the company, giving them about 15 votes for every
share of stock they own through the ESOP.
   NL also alleged that Lockheed unfairly pressured employees
to vote for management's slate by, among other things,
sending out solicitation materials through the credit union,
threatening punishment if NL materials were brought on
company property, requiring employees to wear pro-management
buttons and threatening employees who wore NL buttons with
dismissal.
   Further, the company charges that Lockheed further
"tainted" the election by moving up its usual annual meeting
date by almost six weeks -- giving NL only five business days
to nominate a slate -- and by distributing proxy materials
that implied that the election was uncontested.

   Dream no more, would-be entrepreneurs. Wake up, flip on
late-night TV and tune in to Fran Tarkenton.
   On a show called, "Think and Grow Rich," the former pro
quarterback pitches cassettes, books and a "success/I.Q.
indicator" that will help you "succeed against any odds
imaginable." The materials, which together sell for $149.50,
are based on a 20-year study of Henry Ford, Alexander Graham
Bell, Thomas Edison and other great thinkers. Together, Mr.
Tarkenton says on a show produced by Guthy-Renker Corp. of
Palm Desert, Calif., they are "a master plan for achievement"
that has "created more millionaires than any program before
or since."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Think and Grow Rich" is part of a proliferation of
half-hour ads that hawk business opportunities, money-making
ideas and home-study courses or seminars on getting rich.
Many such programs, including "Think and Grow Rich," are
considered reputable, but some of them aren't. Scrutiny of
the industry is growing, and Congress and regulators are
beginning to crack down on deceptive advertisers.
   These program-length commercials first appeared in 1984
when the government lifted restrictions on the duration of TV
advertising. Now more than 2,000 such ads run each year and
the most successful shows can produce up to $30 million in
revenue annually. There is "How to Build a Fortune," "Making
It Happen" and "Creating Wealth." If "101 Ways to Get Cash
From the Government" doesn't suit you, try "Make as Much as
$200 an Hour for the Next 20 Years."
   Most of these ads show up on independent and cable-TV
between midnight and daybreak. Stations like them because
they can generate up to four times the revenue of, say,
reruns of "The Beverly Hillbillies." So do many of the
nation's insomniacs. At 2 a.m., untold numbers of restless
Americans who once counted sheep now ponder counting millions
of dollars; A.C. Nielsen Co. says 12% of U.S. households are
watching TV at that time.
   "The country has gone crazy for this stuff," says Thomas
Herwitz, vice president and general manager of WTTG-TV, an
independent station in Washington, D.C. "Americans see people
like Donald Trump making all this money and they want to,
too." Adds Doug Bernstein, a media buyer in Philadelphia, who
purchases time on TV stations for program-length ads: "If you
get on the air with the right show, it's a license to steal."
   Federal regulators, lawmakers and even members of the
industry itself say some advertisers are doing just that. "We
believe millions of dollars of fraud is directly attributable
to these kinds of ads," says Steve Jenning, staff director of
the House Small Business subcommittee on regulations. The
subcommittee is holding hearings aimed at increasing the
enforcement of laws governing claims by such advertisers as
well as requiring disclosures that the programs are
commercials.
   Mark Williams, who produces promotions for self-proclaimed
"success-merchant" Dave Del Dotto, says, "It's take your
money and run. There are some people in the industry who are
underhanded and rub off on our name even though we've never
done anything wrong."
   Regulators say the claims of some ads are misleading -- a
practice they are trying to curtail. In February, the Federal
Trade Commission charged in an administrative complaint that
Wayne T. Phillips falsely claimed in a half-hour ad that $33
billion in government grants is available to start small
businesses. The ad portrays Mr. Phillips as "America's
foremost expert on low-interest government loans and
government grants" and promotes his book, "How to Start Your
Business by Doing Business With the Government," which sells
for $49.95.
   In a suit filed in October in Maricopa County, Ariz.,
Superior Court, the state's attorney general also accused Mr.
Phillips, as well as Harold L. Morris, who is host of several
business-opportunity ads, of falsely claiming that consumers
could quickly obtain $25,000 in "free money" from the
government, even if they had bad credit. The suit, like the
FTC complaint, is pending.
   Mr. Phillips's lawyer, David Bosse, says the ad isn't
deceptive. Moreover, he says, only 5% to 6% of the 300,000
people who bought Mr. Phillips's book asked for a refund.
"There isn't one allegation of a hurt consumer who wanted
their money back and didn't get it," he adds. Mr. Morris's
attorney couldn't be reached.
   In a separate action this month, Twin Star Productions
Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz., which derived 40% of its revenue
during the first nine months of 1989 from the sale of
products advertised on the show featuring Mr. Phillips,
settled FTC charges -- without admitting or denying them --
that it made false claims on three TV ads unrelated to Mr.
Phillips's show. The company and six of its officers,
including its chairman, Jerald Steer, agreed to pay over 18
months $1.5 million in redress to consumers. Twin Star plans
to pay $500,000 of that with proceeds from an initial public
stock offering it commenced in January.
   To people like Jeff Padden, a small-business advocate for
the governor of Michigan, the consequences of deceptive
business-opportunity ads are more far-reaching than financial
losses to people. In theory, such commercials should be
inspiring entrepreneurial spirit. Instead, they could
discourage it. "The real tragedy is that people spend time
chasing these rainbows," Mr. Padden says, "and when they
don't get what they have been led to expect, they don't go
any further. It damages the entrepreneurial climate."
   Except for their gushing testimonials and periodic breaks
for a direct sales pitch, these extra-long ads rarely look
like a typical commercial. "Wealth Without Risk," produced by
the Charles J. Givens Organization in Longwood, Fla., at
times appears to be a segment of "Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous." The only difference: the rich and famous person, in
this case, is none other than Mr. Givens.
   There he is riding with a beautiful blond woman in a white
Lincoln limousine or stepping with her aboard a yacht named
the Great Adventure. Later Mr. Givens and his companion sip
champagne while soaking in a poolside Jacuzzi. Now the couple
are dining by candlelight inside what he says is his $2
million Florida estate.
   Don't think Mr. Givens was born into such wealth. When he
was 13 years old, viewers are told, his father left home, the
family business went bankrupt, the tax man hauled away his
possessions and his mother became an alcoholic.
   But Mr. Givens, says the ad, turned his life around with
strategies he devised in personal finance, tax reduction and
investing -- strategies now available to anyone who, for
$399, becomes a member of his organization and buys his
audio-cassette library of 300 presumably riskless ways to
increase your wealth.
   Mr. Del Dotto's program-length promotion, "Financial
Freedom and Wealth Building in America Today," looks like a
talk show. It is taped in Hawaii, where amid images of lush
tropical scenery, celebrity John Davidson questions folks
"from all walks of life who decided to reach for their
financial freedom."
   After Mr. Davidson introduces them, the guests relate the
rewards of applying the principles of Mr. Del Dotto --
"self-made millionaire and best-selling author" of "How to
Make Nothing but Money." The story of Adam Stone, a former
exercise physiologist, seems to the audience especially
startling. At just 26 years old, he says he controls $1
million in property, has $600,000 in equity and grosses
$6,000 to $7,000 a month in rental income.
   Later, viewers are advised to pay $367 for Mr. Del Dotto's
writings on creative financing, credit, foreclosures, tax
sales, government loans and auctions and running a business.
"Please don't try to compare this system to anything else on
the market," cautions an announcer, "because there's nothing
like it."

   Two Big Banks
   Had Lower Net
   In First Quarter

   Continental Bank's Earnings
   Fell 25%; First Interstate
   Posts 4% Profit Decline

   Continental Bank Corp.'s first-quarter profit dropped 25%,
as problem loans increased and the cost of hiring some
high-priced traders and investment bankers cut into the
Chicago bank's bottom line.
   And First Interstate Bancorp, Los Angeles, reported a 4%
decline in net income, reflecting the continuing drag of
$2.05 billion of nonperforming assets, stubbornly high
expenses, a drop in loans outstanding and a foreign-exchange
trading loss of $7.8 million compared with a year-ago trading
gain of $22.7 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Continental's shares fell $1.125 to $14.625 while First
Interstate's rose 87.5 cents to $36.
   At Continental, net income for the quarter fell to $56.7
million, or 89 cents a share, from $75.6 million, or $1.23 a
share, a year earlier. The year-ago figures are restated to
reflect discontinued operations.
   The first-quarter comparison would have been worse but for
gains of $34 million before tax on the sale of real estate,
compared with $17 million of such gains a year ago.
   The problem for Continental, as for many big banks, is
that the number of acquisitions and other big deals that need
financing has dropped off sharply. At the same time,
Continental is paying some big salaries to bankers hired in
recent quarters to boost its lending, trading and other
business with corporate clients. Salaries and other benefits
grew $10 million in the quarter from a year earlier, while
the number of employees was essentially unchanged.
   Continental's First Options of Chicago Inc. unit, which is
up for sale, posted a $5 million loss for the quarter -- the
combination of operating losses and of the parent further
marking down the unit's value. Continental said it expects to
announce a sale agreement for First Options, which guarantees
and processes futures and options trades, before June 30. It
wouldn't elaborate.
   Nonperforming loans -- those 60 days or more past due at
Continental -- rose about 6% to $455 million at March 31 from
$430 million at year's end. About half of both those figures
represent loans to less-developed countries. The total
reserve for loan losses was $258 million at March 31.
   Continental said one big loan on a so-called highly
leveraged transaction -- meaning a leveraged buy-out or
recapitalization -- accounted for a $45 million increase in
nonperforming loans to such borrowers. It wouldn't identify
the borrower.
   First Interstate's net fell to $127.2 million, or $2.23 a
share, from $132.2 million, or $2.81 a share, a year earlier.
   First Interstate's earnings were boosted by a very low
6.5% tax rate, $6.8 million of tax credits and a $30 million
gain from an accounting change. Year-ago results were taxed
at 28.5% but were aided by a $21.8 million tax credit and a
$16.1 million gain from the accounting change. Stripped of
these special items, First Interstate's pretax earnings fell
21% to $103.9 million, from $131.8 million.
   The company established huge reserves late last year for
expected losses from rapid disposition of nonperforming
assets in Texas, and for troubled Arizona real estate. It
used some of those reserves in the first quarter, recording
$198.1 million of loan charge-offs that helped reduce Texas
nonperforming assets by $208 million in the quarter. The
losses were only partly offset by a $91.8 million loan-loss
provision. As a result, First Interstate's total reserve
against losses fell by $139 million, but at $1.3 billion, it
is still 114% of nonperforming loans, a relatively high
level.
   "The aggressive actions that were taken at the end of
1989, especially the accelerated asset disposition program in
Texas, are beginning to pay off," said Joseph J. Pinola,
First Interstate's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our
Texas bank is reporting earnings, while our Arizona bank is
now slightly above break-even and meeting our expectations."
   Donald Crowley, a bank analyst for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods
Inc., said the first-quarter earnings were slightly better
than expected, and "a crucial first step toward rebuilding
creditability in the marketplace."
   Nonetheless, First Interstate's annualized return on
assets, the key measure of bank profitability, was a mediocre
0.68% in the first quarter, excluding special gains but
including the low tax rate. Wells Fargo &amp; Co., a big
California competitor that may bid for First Interstate after
Mr. Pinola steps down in June, has a return of about twice
that rate, even though it is fully taxed. Moreover, First
Interstate's stock remains mired in the mid-$30s, down 50%
from last fall, increasing its vulnerability to an
unsolicited takeover.

   Global Warming Conference Illustrates
   Difficulty of Establishing World Policy

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush, who invited 17 nations to
find "common ground" on global warming issues at a two-day
conference here, closed the meeting by ignoring the
differences among them.
   The conference illustrated the enormous difficulty of
forging a global policy to head off a potential disastrous
warming of the earth caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide
and other so-called greenhouse gases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dutch, West Germans and some other Europeans said they
were ready to adopt strict limits on carbon-dioxide
production. Apparently nobody else was. The U.S. and the
Japanese said more study is needed, and the Japanese promoted
a 100-year plan to solve warming through new technology. The
Soviets said they need a new tax system. The Indonesians and
the Poles said they are broke.
   "Due to a difficult economic situation, we are not able at
this moment to take up our obligations to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions," said Jan Janowski, Poland's deputy prime
minister, who spent much of his speech praising the U.S. and
trashing totalitarianism.
   President Bush said, "We have never considered research
(on global warming) a substitute for action." Padraig Flynn,
the European Council's minister for the environment, along
with a horde of environmentalists who hovered around the
conference, pointed to that as a commitment by the U.S. to do
something specific about global warming.
   But the White House has said that for some time, while
dodging proposals that would require the U.S. to reduce
greenhouse emissions. The U.S. delegation to the conference
was advised in two pages of "talking points" prepared by the
White House to avoid discussions of whether warming is
accelerating. "A better approach is to raise the many
uncertainties that need to be better understood on this
issue," the paper advised.
   The talking points were distributed to reporters by
environmentalists, to whom they had been leaked.
   After the president's speech, D. Allan Bromley, the
president's science adviser, said the U.S. hadn't changed its
global-warming policy "whatsoever" because of European
criticism. He said the U.S. will be able to "respond" to
specific proposals late this year, when the U.S. plans to
host preliminary talks on a global warming treaty. But "that
doesn't mean we'll have a particular percentage or particular
timetable" regarding greenhouse gas stabilization or
reduction in mind, he quickly added.
   The only concrete proposals President Bush made were to
build international institutes to study global change and
computer networks to link researchers. But even those
seemingly innocuous suggestions sparked controversy when they
were circulated early yesterday. A number of delegates
thought the U.S. was trying to ram the proposals past them
without asking for their assent and that the wording of the
proposals was designed to get them to admit that scientific
knowledge about global warming is more uncertain than they
believe it is. So the U.S. withdrew the proposals, and the
president later characterized them as merely "ideas."
   The sensitivity of the delegates and the apparent distrust
of each other's motives was much in evidence. The U.S.
repeatedly criticized a proposal by the Dutch and others to
sharply reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Americans said
it failed to take into account the economic costs. But J.G.M.
Alders, minister of the environment in the Netherlands, said
his government had thoroughly studied the problem and found
the costs negligible.
   "Do you believe we could go home and take such measures
without anybody saying, `What are the economic effects?'" he
asked.

   As communism is being destroyed in Eastern Europe, social
democrats all over the world are urging the new regimes to
adopt a Scandinavian welfare-state model, and not a pure
free-market system. Having lived most of my life in this
utopia, "the most perfect of all systems," as our domestic
social democrats love to describe it, I take a somewhat
different position. . . . In our countries people are growing
disillusioned, and no longer believe the welfare state can
deliver what it promised. At the same time, the moral hazards
of the system are beginning to show. The Scandinavian welfare
state has little to offer either East or West. Do not adopt a
model we are moving away from.

   Inco Plans Boost
   In Capital Outlays,
   Despite Net Plunge

   TORONTO -- Inco Ltd. said it will increase capital
spending about 28% to US$500 million this year, despite a
sharp drop in first-quarter earnings that resulted largely
from deteriorating nickel prices.
   Donald Phillips, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, told the annual meeting, "Substantial capital
investments and further improvements in productivity will be
required to remain a low-cost nickel producer."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unit production costs at Inco, the Western world's largest
nickel producer, increased about 24% in 1989. Mr. Phillips
said costs are likely to increase between 5% and 10% this
year. He said the increase is mostly a result of lower ore
grades and continued strength of the Canadian dollar against
other currencies.
   Inco posted a 76% decline in first-quarter earnings to
$67.7 million, or 64 cents a share, from $276.3 million, or
$2.60 a share, a year earlier.
   Sales fell 34% to $734.5 million from $1.12 billion.
   The company said its realized price for nickel in the
quarter was $3.69 a pound, down from $6.59 a year earlier.
Mr. Phillips said the company's realized price now runs about
10 to 20 cents above the trading price of nickel on the
London Metal Exchange, where it is currently quoted at about
$3.85 a pound.
   Industry analysts are divided on the near-term direction
of the metal, but most see a slip below $3 a pound as a
distinct possibility before year end.
   "I think the rally in January and February has fizzled,"
said Julian Baldry, senior mining analyst with Nesbitt
Thomson Deacon Inc. He said the price of nickel depends to a
large degree on auto sales, housing starts and durable goods
orders, all of which have bearish outlooks. He said he
expects the metal to decline below $3 a pound this year.
   "I see a fabulous time for the company in the longer term,
but I think we have a valley to travel through first," Mr.
Baldry said.
   Analysts also are concerned about Inco's debt level and
reduced cash flow, which is earnings plus depreciation
allowances. The company has about $1 billion in debt, largely
a result of a $1 billion special dividend paid in early 1989.
   In a recent report, John Lydall, an analyst with First
Marathon Securities Ltd., said Inco's debt level isn't
unusual for a company of its size, "but when combined with a
shortage of liquid assets, reduced cash flows and a high
capital expenditure program, it's not a comfortable
situation."
   Mr. Phillips, the chief executive, disagrees. "I think
we're in a very, very strong financial position," he said.
   Alan Ferry, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., agreed that the company is in good shape. He said he
doesn't see any financial problems for Inco, as long as
nickel stays in the range of $3 to $4 a pound.
   About $155 million of the company's capital spending
budget will go to a $400 million sulfur dioxide
emission-reduction program, Inco said. It said a "significant
portion" will go to the development of existing and new
nickel mines in Ontario and Manitoba, as well as to the
expansion of nickel production capacity in Indonesia.
   Mr. Phillips said that while 1990 probably won't be
another record earnings year for the company, it "could still
be a very good year." But he said, "How we will fare during
the balance of this year cannot be predicted with any great
certainty."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Inco shares
closed at $24.875, unchanged.

   TORONTO -- Harold Ballard bequeathed his 80% stake in
Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to a trust created to benefit various
charities.
   Mr. Ballard, who died last week at 86 years of age, willed
that the trust vote his Maple Leaf Gardens shares, which have
a market value of about 108 million Canadian dollars (US$92.7
million), the company said. Maple Leaf Gardens owns the
Toronto Maple Leafs National Hockey League franchise, an
arena in Toronto and a printing plant.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Executors of Mr. Ballard's will, who are also trustees of
the trust, said they don't anticipate any changes in the
corporate structure or business affairs of Maple Leaf Gardens
in the near future. They will make any decisions regarding
the ultimate disposition of the trust's stake in Maple Leaf
Gardens. Beneficiaries of the trust are various charitable,
humanitarian and non-profit organizations to which Mr.
Ballard contributed during his life.
   Mr. Ballard didn't bequeath any of his Maple Leaf Gardens
shares to his three children, the company said. Under the
terms of his will, Mr. Ballard's companion of the last eight
years, Yolanda Ballard, 56, will receive an annual annuity of
C$50,000 until her death or until she marries.

   WASHINGTON -- A divided Supreme Court, defying
expectations, reaffirmed the broad authority of courts to
correct constitutional violations, ruling that a federal
judge may require the Kansas City school district to raise
taxes to pay for desegregation.
   At the same time, however, the high court said there must
be limits on the enforcement power of federal judges. The
court ruled unanimously that U.S. District Judge Russell
Clark, who is handling the complex Kansas City case, went too
far when he raised the tax rate himself in 1987 instead of
ordering the school board do it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the court's disagreement with Judge Clark's
methods, the decision yesterday was a surprising civil rights
victory. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Byron White,
the high court ruled that a federal judge may order school
officials to raise the funds to pay for a desegregation plan
and may block enforcement of state laws limiting tax
increases that interfere with funding the plan.
   The ratification of judicial power was unexpected.
Conservatives, including some justices, have criticized what
they deemed to be abuses of federal judicial power. And the
court's growing concern with this issue has been apparent, as
evidenced by its recent decision in the Yonkers, N.Y.,
housing desegregation case. In January, the high court ruled
that a federal judge handling the case had exceeded his
authority by imposing contempt fines on city council members.
   Moreover, the high court announced its intention to review
the Kansas City case last spring, as it was issuing a string
of civil rights decisions that substantially limited federal
laws on employment discrimination.
   Had the high court ruled that federal courts don't have
the power to require that their orders be funded by state and
local governments, the decision would have limited the
authority of judges, not only to implement school
desegregation plans, but also to set and enforce standards
for prison and jail systems, for state mental institutions
and for other government programs.
   Arthur Benson, a Kansas City lawyer who represented black
parents and children challenging the local school system,
said, "This is an important victory for civil rights in
general. It reinforces the broad discretion that federal
courts have to right wrongs."
   That broad discretion dismayed Justice Anthony Kennedy,
who wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Sandra O'Connor and
Antonin Scalia. "This assertion of judicial power in one of
the most sensitive of policy areas, that involving taxation,
begins a process that . . . could threaten fundamental
alteration of the form of government our Constitution
embodies," Justice Kennedy wrote.
   The Kansas City dispute began in 1977. Parents and
children and the school board sued the state of Missouri for
maintaining a segregated school system in the district that
includes much of Kansas City and parts of neighboring
Independence and Sugar Creek. In 1984, Judge Clark agreed
that the system needed to be desegregated and, between 1985
and 1987, ordered a broad and expensive plan of construction
and renovation of schools and reassignment of students.
   In 1987, Judge Clark ruled that the state and school
district should share the total cost of the plan, which has
been estimated between $500 million and $700 million. But the
school district can only raise funds through the local
property tax, and state law puts a cap on property tax
increases unless approved by the voters.
   Voters repeatedly rejected tax increases to pay for the
plan, prompting Judge Clark to raise the tax rate himself to
$4 per $100 of assessed value, from $2.05. In 1988, a federal
appeals court in St. Louis upheld the tax increase, but
suggested that in the future, Judge Clark should order the
school district to set the rate and that he should block
enforcement of the state law capping tax increases.
   Yesterday, the high court struck down Judge Clark's own
tax increase, but upheld the appeals court's approach that he
could order the school district to raise taxes.
   The decision will allow continued funding of the plan. But
practical problems remain for Judge Clark to resolve. He must
decide whether to refund the tax collected for 1987, which
produced some $30 million. If he decides that refunds are in
order, he must decide if all of the taxpayers are entitled to
them or only those who, at the suggestion of the local
Landmark Legal Foundation, paid in protest and placed $12
million in an escrow fund.
   Despite the practical problems, Allen Snyder, a Washington
lawyer for the Kansas City school board, said, "There is no
question about the system we're operating under now." He said
that under an earlier ruling by Judge Clark, any shortfall in
funding caused by refunds must be paid by the state.
(Missouri vs. Jenkins)
                                                                                                       

   Child Pornography
                                                                                                       

   The court ruled, 6-3, that a state may make it illegal to
possess or view child pornography, even in the privacy of
one's home. The decision, written by Justice White, upheld an
Ohio law and effectively puts the court's stamp of approval
on the laws of 18 other states as well.
   In 1982, the high court ruled that states may make it
illegal to sell pictures of children in sexual poses. But the
court hadn't previously said that states may punish the
buyer, as well as the seller, of such material. The Ohio law
makes it a crime for individuals to possess nude pictures of
children, except parents who may have nude pictures of their
own children. The court said that such a ban doesn't violate
the First Amendment guarantee of free speech.
   Justice William Brennan dissented, joined by Justices
Thurgood Marshall and John Stevens. Justice Brennan said that
the Ohio law is much too broad because it outlaws depictions
of nudity that aren't obscene and that are protected by the
First Amendment.
   Despite upholding Ohio's law, the court on technical
grounds threw out the conviction and six-month prison
sentence for a Columbus man charged with possession of nude
photos of a young boy. The court ordered a new trial. (Ohio
vs. Osborne)
                                                                                                       

   Civil Rights Fees
                                                                                                       

   By a 9-0 vote, the court ruled that lawyers who win civil
rights cases in federal court and whose fees are paid by the
losing parties, may still collect a portion of their clients'
damages.
   The decision involves the relationship between so-called
contingent-fee agreements and court-ordered civil rights
attorneys' fees. A contingent-fee agreement is one in which a
lawyer agrees to be paid a share of what his client wins,
usually 40%. In a civil rights lawsuit under federal law, a
federal judge may order the loser to pay the winner's legal
fees, once the judge sets a reasonable rate and number of
hours for the winning lawyer.
   The federal appeals courts have split over whether lawyers
on contingent fees may collect more than a court-ordered
award in civil rights cases or whether the court award is the
maximum. In an opinion written by Justice White, the high
court ruled that contingent-fee agreements are valid in civil
rights cases.
   The decision was a defeat for a California man who hired a
lawyer on a contingent-fee basis to sue the Long Beach police
for prosecuting him with false testimony. He won $2.12
million in federal court, and the judge ordered the police to
pay his lawyer $75,000 in fees. But the lawyer went to court
to recover his contingent fee, $406,000. (Venegas vs.
Mitchell)

   Earnings Drop
   34% in Quarter
   ----

<LP>
   ATLANTA -- Georgia-Pacific Corp. reported that
first-quarter earnings fell 34% because of higher interest
expense and lower prices for pulp and paper products.
   The forest-products concern said first-quarter net income
dropped to $101 million, or $1.18 a share, from $154 million,
or $1.65 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 8.6% to $2.66
billion from $2.45 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results were the first to include earnings from Great
Northern Kekoosa Corp., which Georgia-Pacific acquired in
March for $3.74 billion. Total cost of the purchase --
including fees and expenses related to the acquisition,
refinancing certain Georgia-Pacific debt and paying off
Nekoosa's debt -- was about $5 billion.
   That acquisition pushed Georgia-Pacific's interest expense
in the first quarter to $97 million from $66 million a year
ago. At the same time, softer prices for pulp and paper
helped reduce first-quarter operating profits in that segment
to $182 million from $247 million a year earlier.
   Analysts said the results were in line with expectations
and added that Georgia-Pacific should have little difficulty
meeting its new debt payments -- even considering a downturn
in pulp and paper. "The earnings from Nekoosa itself should
be able to cover the interest costs," said Gary Palmero,
paper and forest-products analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New
York. He still expects Georgia-Pacific to post 1989 earnings
of between $5 and $5.30 a share, compared with $7.42 a share
in 1989 for Georgia-Pacific alone.
   Meanwhile, Georgia-Pacific indicated that it is already
considering restructuring its debt -- a move that the company
estimated would save about $80 million a year in finance
costs. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate on how or when the
debt might be refinanced.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Georgia-Pacific closed at $40.75 a share, down 37.5 cents.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Haagen-Dazs Goes Whole Hog With Ads
   ----

   Twenty-five years ago, Haagen-Dazs Co. opened for business
and quickly created a niche in the U.S. ice cream market. Its
super-premium ice cream was an especially big hit in the
1980s, when consumers turned to the pricey desserts.
   But as a new decade gets under way, Haagen-Dazs and its
fellow players at ice cream's highest echelon are finding
themselves at a difficult juncture: Consumers want to indulge
-- but they don't necessarily want the fat and cholesterol
that go along with super-rich ice cream.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some companies such as Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade and Steve's
Homemade Ice Cream are trying to address the problem by
introducing new light products. But Haagen-Dazs is sticking
with the status quo -- at least for the time being -- and is
trying an aggressive ad campaign to recruit new takers to its
rich-and-creamy menu. In the words of its new ad slogan, the
Teaneck, N.J., unit of Grand Metropolitan invites consumers
to "Enter the State of Haagen-Dazs."
   "This is the time to make sure the consumer finds this
brand inviting and accessible," says Yves E. Coleon, vice
president of marketing at Haagen-Dazs. "We want to make the
brand relevant to a broader group of people."
   That'll be no easy task. Since 1988, the entire ice cream
category, including super-premium products, has been sliding.
According to the International Ice Cream Association, a trade
group, consumption across the board has been falling about 4%
a year for the past two years.
   Haagen-Dazs concedes its rate of sales growth has slowed,
but the company insists it continues to post annual increases
in sales.
   Haagen-Dazs's new $4 million ad campaign, created by
Margeotes Fertitta &amp; Weiss, will keep print ads in magazines
from May through September. Outdoor advertising is planned in
a few big markets. A radio campaign is in the works, and the
company is considering TV advertising.
   In addition, Haagen-Dazs is developing a number of special
promotions in a bid to boost sales. The first is a Mother's
Day promotion in which Haagen-Dazs will pitch ice cream as an
alternative to roses as a gift for mom. Consumers can call a
toll-free number and order gift certificates that the
recipient can redeem for pints of ice cream. Haagen-Dazs says
such promotions offer a significant opportunity to hook up
with new consumers who may not have had much exposure to the
brand.
   The new print ads, which first appear in next week's issue
of People, feature quirky portraits of various Haagen-Dazs
enthusiasts eating their favorite dessert. In each ad, a
model sports a wide grin. But while the subjects' grins
reflect childlike excitement, the product itself is presented
with a lot of respect. One ad shows a Haagen-Dazs pop resting
on a velvet pillow.
   Haagen-Dazs also is placing ads in tonier publications
such as Vanity Fair and Esquire. And in an unusual media
strategy for an ice-cream product, the company also hopes to
tap the cutting-edge crowd by advertising in magazines such
as Egg, Interview and Details.
   Despite the high-brow imagery in some of the new ads,
Haagen-Dazs's Mr. Coleon believes the campaign overall is
brighter and friendlier than past campaigns, which may have
reinforced an "elitist" image.
   He points to recent campaigns that featured some confusing
images of, among other things, a man with blue feet who was
poised to jump off a diving board into a "pool" of chocolate
ice cream. The copy read: "If you're afraid of emotional
heights, beware of Haagen-Dazs deep chocolate."
   "In the past, we may have taken ourselves a bit too
seriously," he says.

   CBS Touts Older Viewers
                                                                                                       

   CBS Inc., whose TV network attracts older demographic
groups than those traditionally desired by advertisers,
yesterday released a study that showed, to no one's surprise,
the advantage of marketing to older viewers.
   The study, "Coming of Age: Targeting the Middle of the
Market," will be used in presentations to ad agency media
planners by CBS, which finished in the ratings basement for
the third consecutive year in the 1989-90 prime-time season.
   The key demographic for the 1990s is the 35-54 age group,
according to Thomas Leahy, president of CBS Marketing. That
group, says Mr. Leahy, consists of the "aging baby boomers
who have the strongest economic value for advertisers."
   The most sought-after demographic for advertisers is women
18 to 49 years old.
   The study, conducted by CBS and Ephron, Papazian &amp; Ephron,
showed that the "middle of the market" in 1990 for most goods
and services advertised on network TV is a 40-year-old
consumer, not the 30-year-old from a decade ago.
   John Sisk, a senior vice-president at J. Walter Thompson,
said that although 35 to 49 years old is a "key age group,
there are questions about how key of a demographic people
over 50 years old can be." One reason networks want to
attract younger viewers, said Mr. Sisk, is because that
particular demographic group "tends to be open to sample new
programming."

   Norton Goes to Court Again
   To Stave Off BTR Takeover

   BOSTON -- Norton Co. brought a new legal challenge to a
$1.64 billion takeover bid by BTR PLC, arguing that
shareholders who have accepted the bid shouldn't be able to
vote at Norton's annual meeting.
   BTR is trying to oust Norton directors at the company's
annual meeting next Thursday in order to force Norton, an
abrasives company based in Worcester, Mass., to accept the
bid. Holders of more than 62% of Norton have already tendered
their shares to BTR.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a claim filed in federal court yesterday, Norton said
those shares shouldn't be allowed to be voted at the meeting
because BTR has already acquired them under a 1988
Massachusetts anti-takeover law without complying with other
provisions of the same law.
   A lawyer for BTR called the lawsuit "totally frivolous."
Takeover stock traders were also skeptical of the lawsuit.
Although Norton stock fell 62.5 cents to $75.375 a share in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, its price
still remained above the $75 BTR bid.
   The stock fell after Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis signed a new state law allowing companies to impose
staggered terms for directors, with one-third elected every
year, which could delay BTR's acquisition. However, a federal
appeals court upheld an earlier federal court decision
blocking Norton's attempt to delay its annual meeting until
June.

   HAVANA, Cuba -- Cuba and the Soviet Union signed a

special committee to discuss future trade relations.
   The agreement calls for an exchange of Soviet oil,
cereals, food, equipment and other goods for Cuban sugar,
nickel, chrome, citrus and, for the first time, Cuban-made
medicine and medical equipment. AIN, the domestic Cuban news
agency, said the value of the pact was 8.7% higher than last
year.

   A special committee was set up to study future economic
ties, which the Soviets say they want to make more efficient.
Soviet officials say a new economic cooperation accord will
be shorter than five years, probably two years, and will take
into account Soviet economic reforms. About 80% of Cuba's
trade is with the Soviet Union.
   Western diplomats say the changes could affect the price
Moscow is willing to pay for Cuban sugar in the future. The
Soviets currently pay well over the world market price for
sugar and in return sell Cuba oil at subsidized rates.

   GM Says It Plans an Electric Car, but Details Are Spotty

<LP>
   General Motors Corp. says it wants to bring back the
electric car to help save the planet, but it won't say
exactly when or how.
   Outgoing Chairman Roger B. Smith, in a bid to score points
with environmentalists and regulators, said the auto maker
will move ahead with plans for a mass-market,
electric-powered car.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier this year, GM unveiled an electric vehicle, the
"Impact," a sporty-looking show car. In a speech yesterday at
the National Press Club in Washington, Mr. Smith wouldn't say
when GM might begin producing and marketing a vehicle like
the Impact, and he stopped short of promising that the
vehicle would ever reach production. "It will take some time
for all of the technical questions to be resolved," he said.
   Electric cars enjoyed a brief heyday during the early
years of the century. But after GM perfected the
self-starting gasoline engine, electric cars, with shorter
range and little power, virtually vanished from the market.
   But now GM and other auto makers are under pressure from
environmental regulators, mainly in California, to begin
offering electric cars or other "ultra-clean" vehicles by the
mid-1990s. To meet this deadline, GM would have to start
immediately to push a car project from the concept stage --
where the Impact is now -- to full production. GM typically
takes four to five years to develop a new model.
   GM has other incentives to build an electric car. Such a
vehicle could give the auto maker a boost in meeting federal
fuel economy regulations, particularly if Congress moves to
make them more stringent.
   In his speech, Mr. Smith linked GM's electric-car decision
to the environmental consciousness symbolized by Earth Day,
which takes place on Sunday. He mentioned the electric car as
one of a number of GM efforts to clean up its cars and
factories since the first Earth Day, in 1970.
   "Our goal is to be the first automobile company since the
early days of the auto industry to mass-produce an electric
car," Mr. Smith said. "We are taking a major step toward
helping our country meet its transportation needs and
environmental goals."
   Environmentalists heckled Mr. Smith's effort to wrap a
green mantle around GM. "This is just the latest example of
the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde style of corporate
environmentalism," said Robert Dewey of the Environmental
Action Foundation. Observing that the GM chairman declined to
say when the electric car would be built, Mr. Dewey declared
Mr. Smith's speech "long on rhetoric but short on details."
   California officials reacted more positively. A spokesman
for the state's air resources board said he was "encouraged"
by Mr. Smith's announcement. "We believe electric cars
definitely have a role to play in our plans to reduce
emissions."
   Whether a car such as Impact ever shows up in a GM
showroom will depend on a variety of factors, including the
auto maker's ability to build and sell electric cars at a
profit. In 1979, GM officials reacted to predictions of
$2-a-gallon gas by vowing to have electric cars in dealer
showrooms by the mid-1980s. By 1990, the company was to have
converted 10% of its total U.S. car fleet to electric power.
But these plans were shelved when gas prices fell, along with
demand for alternative-fuel vehicles.
   This time, GM officials say new technology could make a
commercially viable electric car possible. The
battery-powered Impact can be driven as far as 120 miles at
55 miles per hour on one charge, GM says. The car accelerates
from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 8 seconds, which puts Impact
in the same league as many of GM's current, gas-fueled
models.
   But GM officials caution there are still a lot of bugs to
work out. Impact's 120-mile range, although better than many
previous electric car prototypes, still may be too limited
for most consumers in sprawling cities such as Los Angeles.
Impact's batteries take about two hours to recharge.
   Further, although Impact doesn't spew fumes into the air,
its 870-pounds of lead-acid batteries could be an
environmental liability when an owner has to dispose of them.
What's more, Impact's batteries currently have a life span of
only 20,000 miles and cost roughly $1,500 to replace. GM
officials have said that the batteries would have to last at
least 50,000 miles for Impact to be as economical to operate
as a gas-powered car.
   Mr. Smith acknowledged that GM may need "a broad-based
development effort" to develop cheaper, more efficient
batteries for a production version of the car.
   Other auto makers are looking into the technology. Ford
Motor Co., which has been running a small experimental fleet
of electric-powered minivans in California, is studying
broader applications of the technology. But Ford officials
say they don't see a big market for such cars in the U.S.

   11% Rise in Net,
   Shearson, a Loss

   NEW YORK -- The nation's two biggest securities firms
posted mixed results for the first quarter as both were
pinched by the slump in investment banking, one of Wall
Street's biggest sources of income.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., helped by cost-cutting, reported an
11% rise in first-quarter net income. American Express Co.'s
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. subsidiary had a $915
million loss, a securities industry record, after posting
previously predicted one-time charges of $787 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At industry leader Merrill, investment-banking revenue
plunged 27% from a year earlier, while No. 2 Shearson
indicated that it had a 25% decline. Both firms were hit by
lower stock and bond underwriting, slumping junk-bond prices
and the ensuing drop in takeover activity.
   Separately, Charles Schwab Corp., parent of the discount
brokerage firm, reported a 7.5% decline in first-quarter net.
   Merrill's top officers were cautious about the outlook for
a pickup in the investment-banking sector.
   "Will it rebound to 1988 levels? No, that's probably not
in the cards," said Daniel P. Tully, Merrill president and
chief operating officer. Mr. Tully said that the slump allows
the firm to "lay the groundwork" for a future upturn, but
that "getting back to '88 is going to take some time."
   Merrill, which previously indicated it would lay off as
many as 3,000 of its 41,000 employees, has let go 1,600 so
far, including investment bankers. Many of the remaining
1,400 or so may be dismissed in the current quarter and
investment bankers will be among those idled, Merrill
officials said.
   Although Merrill will continue to cut costs the rest of
the year, officials said they don't expect another
retrenchment charge such as the $470 million Merrill took in
the fourth quarter.
   One reason investment bankers are being shown the door:
Much of their business depends on the health of the $200
billion public market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds,
which shows few signs of rebounding. Investment-banking firms
rely heavily on the fat fees associated with mergers and
acquisitions, which in recent years have been financed
largely by junk bonds.
   Merrill's investment-banking revenue declined in the first
quarter to $182.7 million from $249.2 million. Shearson's
investment-banking revenue fell to $162 million from $216
million.
   For the first quarter, Merrill posted net of $41.3 milion,
or 34 cents a share, up from $37.2 million, or 31 cents a
share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included a
gain of $1.7 million, or two cents a share, from discontinued
operations. Profit from ongoing lines rose 16%. Revenue fell
4.7%, to $2.66 billion from $2.80 billion.
   The quarterly results were bolstered by a continued
increase in customer assets under management, to nearly $104
billion from $83 billion. Merrill's asset-management and
custodial fee revenue jumped 19%, to $170.1 million from $143
million. Managing mutual-fund assets generates fees based on
the amount of assets under management; those fees continue to
rush in even in poor markets.
   Merrill and other firms hope to make money selling stocks
to individuals once investors return in large numbers to the
stock market. Merrill says only 22% of the assets it manages
for investors are in the stock market. "The {potential}
buying power there is just awesome," says William A.
Schreyer, Merrill chairman and chief executive officer.
   Merrill insists that its huge "retail," or
individual-investor brokerage, network of 12,000 brokers will
position the firm to one day take advantage of resumed
small-investor interest. The retail business might not turn
around this quarter or next, says Mr. Tully, "but as sure as
God made little apples, this business will grow."
   Messrs. Schreyer and Tully said the firm's cost-cutting
efforts are starting to bear fruit. Merrill's expenses of
$2.6 billion were down 5% from $2.73 billion a year earlier.
Among other things, Merrill managed an 8.5% cut in office
supplies and postage, to $36.5 million.
   Because of their new cost-cutting bent, Merrill officials
said they aren't any longer focusing on being No. 1 in every
business. Still, they pointed with pride in a news release
that the firm maintained its No. 1 ranking in U.S. and global
underwriting for the quarter. Said Mr. Tully: "We are going
for profitable market share. If it turns out we're No. 1, so
be it. But we're not going for market share for market
share's sake."
   Analysts still wonder how fast Merrill can turn itself
around. "I'm not totally convinced quite yet; the next three
quarters will give us a better idea" of how Merrill's big
cost-cutting program is working, said Diana Keat, an analyst
at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
   Merrill stock fell 75 cents to $23.125 yesterday in a
slumping stock market. Shearson, which reported its loss
after the market closed, fell 37.5 cents to $13.50.
   Overall, Wall Street's earnings picture remains dim. Most
major firms, aside from Salomon Inc., are expected to post
mediocre results. The two big publicly traded firms that have
managed to post gains, Merrill and PaineWebber Group Inc. (up
17%), have done so largely because the comparable
year-earlier results were so bad, analysts say.
   Shearson, aside from its one-time charges, had operating
losses of $128 million, resulting mainly from "a marked
slowdown in overall business activity." Revenue decreased 15%
to $2.6 billion from $3 billion.
   Shearson's assets under management declined to $92.8
billion from $99.8 billion. Shearson said the decline
reflects the sale of part of its Boston Co. money-management
business and related divestitures.
   Even though Shearson announced a massive cost-cutting
program in late February, it said that first-quarter expenses
rose 9%, to $3.3 billion from $3 billion. Expenses included a
restructuring charge of $630 million. Shearson said its
cost-cutting drive, when fully implemented, will save it
about $400 million annually.
   Charles Schwab's first-quarter net income fell to $3.7
million, or 14 cents a share, from $4 million, or 15 cents a
share, a year earlier.

   Many scholars have noted that the fascism of Hitler's
National Socialists resembled communism more than it did any
form of conservatism. Now the Czechs have linked communism
with fascism as a matter of law. Tomas Sokol, the Prague
public prosecutor, threatens to outlaw the Communist Party
under an existing statute prohibiting fascism. Mr. Sokol says
communism and Nazism are movements aimed at the "destruction
of all democratic rights" through "terror and social
demagoguery." East Europeans understand these ideologies,
having had to live under both.

   The Market -- Conservation's Best Friend

   The environmental movement has come a long way since Earth
Day, 1970. Membership and revenues have grown by leaps and
bounds, as the nearby table shows. Membership in the
Wilderness Society has multiplied by eight; the Sierra Club
and the National Audubon Society have seen their memberships
quintuple. The National Wildlife Federation's revenues have
grown tenfold.
   Altogether, the revenues of the dozen largest
environmental groups amount to roughly $250 million a year.
And that doesn't include the revenues of the research outfits
that provide the analysis that fuels the environmentalists'
political activity -- big groups such as the World Resources
Institute and Worldwatch Institute, or the myriad of smaller
activist groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists and
Friends of the Earth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All that money has bought less environmental improvement
than it could have. The major environmental groups are
committed to protecting the environment by exerting political
pressure to change statutes, court interpretations of
statutes and executive branch regulations. The tax laws
require that they limit their spending on direct lobbying to
20% of their revenues, but in essence their entire program
budget is designed to change government laws and practices.
Typically, this effort represents close to 75% of their total
budget.
   There are some exceptions, of course, mostly among
old-line organizations that continue programs started years
ago. The National Audubon Society, for example, devotes 14%
of its $34 million in revenues to managing its wildlife
sanctuaries, and the National Wildlife Federation spends at
least $11 million on children's nature education. For the
most part, however, the leading environmental organizations
lobby for current political change.
   The trouble with this strategy is that it can only be a
constant battle. Even though environmentalists list with
pride the vast number of environmental laws passed over the
past two decades -- from the Clean Air Act and its amendments
to Superfund and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
-- they recognize that most are poorly implemented. They are
constantly going to court to force the Environmental
Protection Agency or the Forest Service to follow the law as
they see it. Often, their legislative achievements are
undermined in the congressional appropriations process or by
agencies of the executive branch that heed livestock owners
or timber producers more than environmentalists.
   Lobbying is not just costly; it never ends. As the cliche
would have it: you can't buy a vote, you can only rent it.
One Congress can establish a wilderness, but the next has the
legal right to turn it into a nuclear waste facility.
   Those who weren't adults at the time of the first Earth
Day may find it hard to believe that a reversal of
environmentalism is possible; protecting the environment has
been politically popular for nearly two decades. They won't
remember that the state government of Pennsylvania used to
have bounties on hawks, that Oregon was officially committed
to wiping out the sea lion and that during the 1960s the
Interior Department considered damming the Grand Canyon.
Political tides ebb as well as flow.
   If environmental groups really want to save endangered
species and tropical rainforest, they would do well to
consider applying their ample revenues to purchasing land or
protective easements. Using some of their funds for purchase
could give them a permanent impact that is elusive today.
   Consider the Wilderness Society's effort to get the
government to stop below-cost timber sales. On the theory
that the worst boondoggles should be the easiest to overturn,
the society has been attacking logging in Alaska's Tongass
National Forest. If the society's figures are correct,
logging the Tongass is economically unjustified: It maintains
that timber-cutting on the Tongass loses between 29 cents and
93 cents for every taxpayer dollar spent. Yet a 1980 law
requires the government to spend $40 million a year, if
necessary, to support Tongass timber jobs. At 1,800 jobs (the
Wilderness Society's estimate), that is more than $20,000 per
job per year.
   So far, the Wilderness Society's lobbying has accomplished
little. So why doesn't the society buy the land it wants to
protect? Although the Tongass is vast (the Forest Service
owns more than 16 million acres), fewer than 100,000 acres of
the critical old-growth forest is high-volume commercial
timber, according to the society's report. Arranging a
purchase deal wouldn't be easy; but the payoff would be title
to a deed, not just another chance to fight the battle again
next year. Since the government is losing millions of dollars
each year on the Tongass anyway, it could, after selling the
loggable land to the society, divert just two years of its
subsidy budget to buy out the mill owners and pay the workers
generous severance pay, saving the taxpayer money from then
on.
   The Nature Conservancy, which does take a market approach,
just made a much larger purchase than the critical Tongass
acreage, acquiring more than 300,000 acres in New Mexico for
a price said to be between $16 million and $20 million. This
is a lot of money, but, by obtaining title, the Conservancy
will not have to persuade a continual string of Congresses to
manage the land as wilderness.
   The Nature Conservancy has been using markets since 1951
and now owns and manages nearly 2.6 million acres of land
selected to preserve endangered wildlife or plants. Hundreds
of other land trusts around the country are working quietly,
with little fanfare, to protect land, usually through the
purchase or donation of land and conservation easements.
Ducks Unlimited, for example, spends $30 million a year to
lease or purchase conservation easements and to create
wetlands.
   Plenty of land is available for purchase by conservation
groups. Most wild areas are not attractive for commercial
development. Brent Haglund, president of the Sand County
Foundation in Madison, Wisc., says that wilderness-quality
areas in Wisconsin are available for between $100 and $200 an
acre. "I'd like to see some private groups secure parcels of
5,000 acres, remove evidence of man's disturbance and create
private wilderness tracts," he says. Indeed, Mr. Haglund's
Sand County Foundation is re-creating a wilderness-like area
on its Leopold Reserve, the place in Wisconsin where envi
ronmentalist Aldo Leopold wrote his Sand County Al manac in
the 1930s and '40s. Out West, the Rocky Mountain Elk
Foundation recently helped negotiate a purchase (most of it
ultimately paid for by government) of prime elk habitat that
averaged about $800 an acre.
   Purchase is especially promising for tropical forests. A
recent study published in Nature magazine pointed out that
tropical forestlands in Peru, now worth about $200 an acre
when used for timber pro duction, could be worth far more if
local people harvested fruits, latex and other indigenous
crops on a sustainable basis. A conservation organization, or
even a speculator in genetic resources, could buy the land
and rent it to the local inhabitants. Indeed, part of its
payment to the government for title could be transferable
permits giving local people sustainable harvest rights.
   Ecologist Norman Myers estimates that genetic resources
represent a $40 billion market today in medical and
pharmaceutical products. If he is correct, the acquisition of
unique, indigenous plant and animal genetic stocks offers the
possibility for great future reward. Roger Sedjo, an
economist with Resources for the Future, says that holding a
piece of tropical forest is "like holding a lottery ticket"
-- one could be a big winner.
   The World Wildlife Fund has already begun to use some of
its resources for "debt-for-nature" swaps, in which it
purchases a portion of a country's debt in return for the
government's promise to use the funds to protect tropical
lands. The swaps are fraught with difficulties, WWF officials
concede. It's time for the fund to try to take the more
permanent step of obtaining title to the land.
   In sum, those who work for preservation should consider
the market as a mechanism. The result will be far greater
security of ownership, not a continual bill for lobbying that
is never marked "paid."

   Yields on Money Funds and Bank CDs
   Were Little Changed in the Latest Week

   Yields on both money-market mutual funds and bank
certificates of deposit were little changed in the latest
week.
   The average seven-day compound yield on taxable money
funds remained at 7.99%, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money
Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.based newsletter. The average
yield on a small-denomination six-month CD stayed at 7.80%,
according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information
service. Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yields on tax-free money funds rose, however.
   Assets of the 427 taxable money funds tracked by
Donoghue's fell by about $1.5 billion in the week ended
Tuesday, the third consecutive weekly decline. Brenda Malizia
Negus, editor of the newsletter, attributed the latest drop
in part to redemptions for tax purposes.
   Average maturity of the funds' investments shortened by a
day to 44 days, staying within the range of the past few
months. Maturities are thought to indicate which way
portfolio managers think interest rates are headed, with
shorter maturities signaling rising rates and longer
maturities indicating a decline. Average maturity has ranged
from 29 to 53 days in recent years.
   The average seven-day simple yield remained at 7.69%. The
average 30-day simple yield stayed at 7.68% and the average
30-day compound yield at 7.98%.
   The average seven-day compound yield on tax-free funds
rose to 5.63% from 5.57%, Donoghue's reported. That's equal
to 7.82% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and 8.40% in
the 33% bracket.
   Assets of the 220 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's
fell by $1.3 billion, to $77.5 billion. Average maturity
shortened to 45 days from 46.
   The only measurable change in CD yields in the week ended
yesterday was in long-term "jumbo" CDs, which generally
require deposits of at least $90,000. The average yield on
five-year jumbos rose to 8.38% from 8.33%, according to
Banxquote. That increase was led by New York's Chase
Manhattan Bank, which boosted its five-year jumbo yield to
8.86% from 8.55% early last week.
   That sharp rise could portend other increases, said
Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. "When a major bank
suddenly pushes a rate up strongly, it points to a new
trend," he said.
   The average yield on popular one-year small-denomination
CDs, which generally require minimum deposits of $10,000 or
less, slipped to 7.95% from 7.96%. Fiveyear
small-denomination CD yields remained at an average 8.16%.

   Portfolio Changes
                                                                                                       

   Some money funds are moving to improve the credit quality
of their investments, after two instances when several funds'
investment advisers had to step in to avert possible
shareholder losses.
   T. Rowe Price Associates' $4.9 billion Prime Reserve money
fund, for instance, has reduced its commercial paper holdings
and increased its investments in government and agency
securities. The fund also has reduced its holdings of
commercial paper that doesn't carry the very highest credit
ratings, said Steven Norwitz, a T. Rowe Price vice president.
   Heritage Cash Trust has been upgrading its portfolio since
last year, said Stephen Hill, president of Heritage Asset
Management, the fund's investment adviser. Only 10% of the
fund's approximately $700 million in assets is currently in
paper that is below the highest grade, he said, and more than
10% is in Treasury bills.
   The two funds were among 10 moneymarket mutual funds
holding the commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs,
of Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust, an Elkins Park, Pa., real estate
investment trust that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection last week, a month after its commercial paper was
downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   All together, the investment advisers or parent companies
bought a total of about $75 million of the paper from the
funds to protect shareholders. Among others, Prime Reserve
held about $42 million of the paper, Heritage Cash Trust
about $12 million and Alliance Money Reserves $8.7 million.
"We consider it of paramount importance to retain investor
confidence," said Mr. Norwitz of T. Rowe Price. Any loss will
be absorbed by the parent company.
   There was similar fast action last spring, when the
parents of four money funds stepped in to absorb the loss
after Integrated Resources Inc. defaulted on commercial
paper. Integrated Resources also subsequently filed for
Chapter 11 protection.
   As previously reported, the Securities and Exchange
Commission is considering tighter restrictions on investments
by money-market mutual funds. The SEC's division of
investment management is planning to propose further limits
on the amount a fund can invest in a single issuer,
restrictions on its investments in less than the very highest
rated commercial paper and shortening the permissible average
maturity of a fund's investments.
   More than half the nearly $400 billion in money fund
assets currently is invested in commercial paper. That's up
from 44% at the start of 1989 and 29% at the start of 1984.
The SEC already limits money funds' investments to highly
rated securities.

   BRASILIA, Brazil -- Confident that its bold anti-inflation
program is working, the Brazilian government plans to resume
negotiations on its $115 billion foreign debt and start its
drive to sell state companies in the coming weeks, senior
officials said.
   In separate interviews here, Economics Minister Zelia
Cardoso de Mello and Central Bank President Ibrahim Eris said
the government, after winning the endorsement of Brazil's
Congress last week for its stabilization program, will begin
a "new phase" of the program, which will include:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- Resumption of negotiations with Brazil's foreign
creditors, beginning with the International Monetary Fund, as
early as next month. But officials say Brazil will adopt a
"tough stance."
   -- The start next month of the government's ambitious plan
to sell most of Brazil's 188 state-controlled companies,
which have a combined deficit of $62 billion. Ms. Cardoso
said the program would start with Usiminas, a profitable
steelmaker.
   -- Efforts to start lowering the non-tariff barriers that
have effectively shielded the Brazilian economy from
competition.
   -- The dismantling in the weeks ahead of most of the price
controls the government imposed last month as part of its
anti-inflation program. Mr. Eris says the controls contradict
the government's freemarket aims and are "redundant" because
of the anti-inflation plan's initial success.
   Indeed, the unveiling of the new phase of the plan
coincides with indications that Brazil's chronic inflation,
which reached 4,854% in the past 12 months, could be on the
way out. Because of the huge liquidity squeeze that forms the
centerpiece of the plan -- the government took about $80
billion out of circulation by freezing a large part of
savings and money market accounts for 18 months -- Brazil
expects to post negative inflation of between 0.5% and 1% for
the 30-day period since the the program was unveiled March
16.
   Ms. Cardoso said the figure shows the plan is "working
well" and added that she saw "no reason why inflation should
return" even though the government is prepared to reinject
money in the economy to help the beleaguered automobile,
construction and capital-goods industries.
   But Mr. Eris, striking a more cautionary note echoed by
many economists, says Brazil runs the risk of falling into
recession or returning to high inflation unless the economy
is properly tuned.
   Walter Barelli, an economist affiliated with a Brazilian
union research organization, disputed the government's
estimate of zero inflation and predicted steep price
increases.
   On Brazil's foreign debt of $115 billion, the developing
world's largest, Ms. Cardoso said she would resume contacts
with creditors by attending the IMF's interim committee
meeting in Washington in early May. Brazil hasn't paid
interest on its $65 billion of medium-term and long-term bank
debt since September. That failure in the past several days
helped to depress the first-quarter earnings of big U.S.
banks.
   But Mr. Eris warned creditors against expecting much from
Brazil. "Brazil's stance will be tough," he said.
"Arrangements can be flexible as long as they're compatible
with our payments capacity. Brazil needs to grow without
inflation," he added, "and for that we need savings and
investment rates comparable to those of other countries."
   Ms. Cardoso said reports that Brazil would limit its
payments to about $5 billion a year were reasonable. However,
it isn't clear how the payments would be distributed among
Brazil's multilateral, government and bank creditors.
   By unveiling plans to sell off Usiminas next month, Ms.
Cardoso indicated the government intends to move fast to kick
off its privatization campaign and address charges that the
private sector bears the burden of the adjustment plan. Mr.
Eris said many other sales are planned.
   "Everything is on sale except a few companies," such as
oil giant Petrobras and the Banco do Brasil commercial bank,
which have to remain in the public sector under the
privatization bill, Mr. Eris said. "And I don't only mean the
companies," he added. "I mean houses, buildings and cars
owned by the state too."
   On foreign trade, Mr. Eris said the government hopes to
eliminate all controls on imports by the end of the year,
maintaining tariffs only as a policy instrument.

   TORONTO -- Unicorp Canada Corp. suspended its dividend on
common shares after reporting a big loss for the year, and
said it plans to spin off its controlling stake in ailing
Unicorp American Corp. to its shareholders.
   The company paid a dividend of five cents (Canadian) on
its Class A and B shares on Feb. 28 for the fourth quarter.
Unicorp said the moves were part of a restructuring in which
it will focus on non-regulated energy and utility operations
and strengthening its capital base. Unicorp Canada also plans
a common-share rights offering of C$40 million to C$50
million (US$34.3 million to $42.9 million).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unicorp reported a loss of C$151.2 million, or C$7.94 a
share, in 1989, compared with a profit of C$42.2 million, or
C$1.24 a share, in 1988. Last year's loss included a C$137.6
million provision for losses on disposal of discontinued U.S.
real estate and financial services operations and a reserve
against its entire investment in Unicorp American.
   Unicorp Canada said it is in negotiations to sell most of
its Unicorp American properties to a joint venture in which
Unicorp American will have a significant interest. Unicorp
also said its investment in Lincoln Savings Bank was added to
discontinued operations.
   Under its plan to distribute all of its common shares of
Unicorp American to holders of Unicorp Canada Class A and B
common shares, shareholders will receive about two-fifths of
a Unicorp American share for each share of Unicorp Canada.
The distribution is subject to regulatory approvals and is
planned for the third quarter.
   "We've chosen to write the entire investment off and
dividend it out to our shareholders," said James Leech,
president of Unicorp Canada.
   Unicorp Canada said the distribution will separate its
energy and non-energy operations, but it will continue to
assist Unicorp American in devising its own restructuring
plan. On Tuesday, Unicorp American said it was trying to
restructure a loan agreement that was already in default and
needed an infusion of US$15 million in new funds to continue
operations. Unicorp American is 75%-owned by Unicorp Canada.
Its shares closed yesterday at 37.5 cents, down 37.5 cents,
in American Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Unicorp Canada's restructuring raises speculation that
Hees International Bancorp Inc. eventually could end up with
control of the company. Unicorp Canada is a holding company
with operations in energy, financial services, real estate
and merchant banking. It controls Canada's second-largest
utility, Union Gas Ltd., and is involved in gas marketing and
transportation. In January, Hees International, a merchant
bank and holding company controlled by Toronto financiers
Peter and Edward Bronfman, acquired a 22% stake in Unicorp
Canada and supports its restructuring. Hees is Unicorp
Canada's second-largest shareholder after George Mann, its
founder and chairman.
   Hees insiders said they would be willing to accept
stewardship of Unicorp Canada if Mr. Mann eventually was
willing to hand it over. Mr. Mann recently had a heart attack
and indications are that, at some point, he may retire.
   The Hees insiders said that Unicorp's utility operations
could fit with those of Brascan Ltd., a natural resources,
financial services and consumer products concern that is
49%-owned by Hees.

ENVIRONMENT (ENV)
</IN>
<LP>
   With Easter past and Passover ended, we are left with only
one remaining spring religious celebration. This Sunday the
bishops and cardinals of environmentalism will gather their
flocks for Earth Day.
   We do not say this to mock, for in our book the religious
impulse is commendable. Men and women ennoble themselves by
reaching out for contact with the transcendental, the
universe beyond themselves. We accept the thought that the
current wave of concern with the environment started when
astronauts brought back the first photographs of the Earth
from space, showing a shining jewel against the black
vastness of the cosmos. Surely, the image said, we have been
endowed with something extraordinary, something precious and
something vulnerable.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We are coming to see environmentalism as a religion,
rather, in a quest for understanding. Those of us attuned
primarily to concerns of the secular world have trouble
fitting the movement into our usual categories. As much as
anyone else, we are in favor of clean air, blue water,
wholesome food, verdant parks, neat streets, pristine
mountains and unspoiled deserts. Having set these ends, we
turn to our usual means: cost-benefit analysis, emissions
taxes, economic growth, technology-clean nuclear power, for
example. Yet consensus with environmentalists seems to take
no roots; indeed, our very efforts seem to make it more and
more remote.
   So perhaps we could comprehend more by taking
environmentalism as not at all about this world, but about
the next world. Not ultimately about mere material things,
but about the cleansing of sins and the saving of souls. The
religious jargon is a bit disconcerting at first, but it does
seem to explain many puzzles.
   The catechism of global warming, for example, is clearly
sustained by a leap of faith. Such empirical data as exist
are inconclusive, in the case of satellite measurements over
the past decade, negative. Scientists agree that other things
being equal increasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases will raise the Earth's temperature, but disagree on how
much, whether the other things are equal and indeed what they
may even be. But even without data, the hypothesis is taken
as confirmed by "computer models," the contemporary world's
font of pure revelation.
   The faith remains undisturbed, too, by the confounding of
predictions. The world has somehow not yet run out of crude
oil, the Club of Rome notwithstanding. Asbestos confined in
walls is no threat, even the conventional wisdom has come to
agree. Acid rain, extensive scientific analysis has now
concluded, causes isolated problems; the easy answer is to
dump limestone in acid lakes. Yet the altars of these causes
still bend under the weight of huge sacrifices.
   Mysterious hearth rites have arisen; costumed priests
exorcise homes of radon and other evil spirits. Commandments
are particularly directed at the arrogance of mankind: Thou
shall not split the atom, nor touch the forbidden fruit of
the gene. Certain animals are deemed sacred, though
nasty-tempered mink seem a curious choice over the Hindu's
gentle cows. Certain foods are non-kosher, particularly palm
and coconut oils. The new rabbinate proscribes the mixing of
glass and aluminum with other garbage. The holiest renounce
the carnal altogether for the monkish life of Vermont.
   It matters little whether the professed worldly goals are
in fact accomplished. If limits on U.S. tuna fishing mean
more dolphins die as tuna is taken by less careful foreign
fleets, the American soul is still cleansed. If the end of
DDT deprives impoverished Third World children of cheap
protection against malaria, the return of the peregrine
falcon still uplifts the human spirit. Loggers put out of
jobs find their reward in the immortality of the spotted owl.
   All of this is tied together with a chiliastic thread. As
the second millennium approaches, the apocalypse must be upon
us. The devout search frantically to learn which of the seven
ends will ensue: The fire of nuclear war. The ice of nuclear
winter. The unseen peril of radiation, or a new plague as a
judgment for genetic tampering. The roast of global warming,
or the judgment of a new ice age, the climatological fear of
only a decade ago. Or merely perhaps terminal boredom in the
end of history?
   These insights into the environmental creed, admittedly,
yield no easy prescription. The methods of secular society
are designed to deal with material impulses, and are often
confounded by spiritual ones. Even if it were possible,
containing such impulses probably would not be wise.
Religions do mobilize people for true progress, and
environmentalism can claim no little credit for cleaner air
and water. Newly born religions often display disagreeable
traits such as excessive evangelism, intolerance of the
heathen and the suppression of any deviation as heresy. But
usually, as they mature, they develop the even more sacred
traits of inner peace, forgiveness and humility.

   The chemical industry continues to be battered by
generally weak commodity prices, but other factors
contributed to widely varying first-quarter results at three
companies.
   Rohm &amp; Haas Co. reported that net income increased 2%,
which was significantly better than expected. The gain came
on increased plant operating efficiencies and lower propylene
costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Quantum Chemical Corp.'s earnings, which dropped 92%, were
below expectations as a result of weak commodity prices, a
plant shutdown and reduced propane sales caused by warm
weather.
   Ethyl Corp.'s profit, which dropped 7%, was consistent
with expectations, with higher insurance segment income
making up for lower chemical profits.
   Philadelphia-based Rohm &amp; Haas said first-quarter results
reflected modest sales increases, smoother plant operations
and a favorable litigation settlement with Rhone-Poulenc S.A.
Sales increased 2.2% to $694.4 million from $679.5 million.
Analyst James Wilbur of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. said
Rohm &amp; Haas earnings were "significantly better" than an
expected 65 cents a share, reflecting successful efforts to
reduce manufacturing costs. William R. Young of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. said he will probably
increase by 20 cents a share his 1990 earnings estimate of
$2.40 a share.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Rohm &amp; Haas shares closed at $33.75, down 37.5 cents.
   Quantum Chemical, based in New York, said first-quarter
results were hurt by lower selling prices for polyethylene
and polypropylene and by lower propane sales volume. Costs
exceeding insurance recoveries for a fire-related plant
shutdown reduced earnings by $15 million, or 59 cents a
share. Sales dropped 16% to $682.8 million from $814.1
million.
   Analyst George Krug of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said Quantum
earnings were "somewhat below" the expected range of 30 cents
to 80 cents a share. Charles LoCastro of Donaldson Lufkin
said he is considering lowering his current 1990 profit
estimate of $2.25 a share because second and third-quarter
earnings are likely to be lower than first-quarter net.
   Quantum shares closed at $22.25, down 62.5 cents, in Big
Board trading.
   Ethyl, of Richmond, Va., said income from continuing
operations increased 2.6%, reflecting a 24% increase in
insurance segment operating profit. Chemical earnings
declined 6% as a result of sharply reduced shipments of
anti-knock chemicals. Sales were up 6.9% to $609.7 million
from $570.5 million. Analysts said earnings were consistent
with estimates in the range of 44 to 45 cents a share.
   Shares of Ethyl closed on the Big Board at $24.75, down 25
cents.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Canada's National Gallery Under `Fire'
   ----

   Ottawa -- A primary-school teacher leads her gaggle of
grade fivers down the long high-vaulted art gallery. They
stop short 20 feet before an immense canvas hanging on the
end wall. Then, slowly, she starts them forward again. "Can
you feel anything yet?" she calls. Nervous giggles, much
scrunching of eyes and fists, "It feels interesting]" comes a
small voice from the back of the group.
   The painting is "Voice of Fire," a gigantic 18-by-8-foot
work that the late U.S. abstract expressionist Barnett Newman
created for the U.S. Pavilion at EXPO 67 in Montreal. This
red-and-blue-striped canvas has ignited the hottest debate
over art in Canada since the government began to assemble a
national art collection in 1880.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The gallery's pamphlet says: "`Voice of Fire' is a visual
call beckoning the visitor to come closer," and these grade
fivers are here to discover if that's what it does for them.
   Not everyone in Canada who's voiced an opinion about this
new acquisition by Canada's National Gallery has been to
Ottawa to see it. Most have reacted to seeing it on
television or in the newspaper, and finding out that it cost
just under 1.8 million Canadian dollars ($1.5 million) in
public funds.
   "Voice of Fire" is minimalist art, only three strong
stripes of color, two intensely vivid stripes of ultramarine
blue flanking a single stripe in deep cadmium red. "It's
about seeing and being," the contemporary curators say, "a
modern masterpiece, a mystical work for a secular age." And
they're thrilled that the Gallery nabbed it at a price that
other modern art collectors would consider a steal.
   Ordinary Canadians, however, see it differently. Mired in
a time of rising deficits and fiscal restraint, they're
outraged at the price and have responded not only with an
avalanche of letters to the newspapers and their members of
Parliament but also by making their own copies, mocking
imitations, ranging from an exact replica painted by an
Ottawa Valley, Ontario, farmer (he says it cost him 480
Canadian dollars and he has it for sale for 1,000) to a
red-and-blue-striped cocktail concocted by a Montreal
barkeep. If, as the National Gallery's director, Shirley
Thomson, says, "the role of great art is to provoke," then
the Newman work is doing its job.
   Mr. Newman first developed ties with Canada in the early
'50s when he went to Emma Lake, Saskatchewan, to work with a
group of young artists. Several of them, including sculptor
Robert Murray and painter Guido Molinari, have gone on to
international reputations. The painter's widow, Annalee
Newman, says he always maintained sentimental ties to the
country, and when the National Gallery approached her in 1987
to purchase "Voice of Fire" for its handsome new building in
Ottawa she offered them a bargain. Her late husband, she
says, would have liked to see the picture hanging there.
   In the past three years the rocketing art market has seen
painting of a similar scale by Mr. Newman go for as much as 3
million Canadian dollars, in particular a painting that went
to the Kawamura Memorial Museum in Tokyo last year. Despite
this, and although it took the gallery nearly two years to
complete its complicated purchase procedures. Mrs. Newman
made no attempt to raise the price. The deal finally was
settled last summer but announced to the public only last
month.
   Since then a flood of criticism has engulfed the National
Gallery. Even senior federal politicians have gotten into the
act. The chairman of Parliament's cultural-affairs committee,
Felix Holtmann, a prairie pig farmer from Manitoba, told a
local radio audience there that "given two cans of paint, a
roller and about 10 minutes" he could produce the same thing.
Mr. Holtmann later turned up to chair the political committee
called to investigate the purchase wearing a red-and-blue
vertically striped Newman knockoff that he called his "Tie of
ire."
   At a more serious level, the national union of Canadian
visual artists, Canadian Artists Representation, has publicly
attacked the purchase on the grounds that the money was spent
on an American painting and not on Canadian art. Gallery
officials have tried in vain to explain that they saved up to
make the expensive buy and that, anyway, 42% of their total
annual acquisitions budget has been spent acquiring Canadian
works. (The Gallery also has important collections of
European and Asian art and an outstanding photography
collection, all of which must be maintained.)
   Three weeks ago the federal cabinet's powerful
expenditures-review committee finally responded to public
pressure and declared that it would scrutinize the purchase.
There have been dark hints that the financially pressed
government might try to reverse the deal or auction the
picture off for a profit. Any such move would be in direct
contradiction of federal law, which prohibits political
interference in the operations of the National Gallery or any
other federal cultural agency. A new museum act passed by the
same government just two months ago reinforced the point.
   Nevertheless, the federal minister responsible for
culture, Marcel Masse, felt compelled last week to turn up at
a gallery reception to reassure the guests that he, at least,
is a strong supporter of what is known in Canada as the
"arms-length" principle. Unfortunately, Mr. Masse also is
known to be often out of step with his cabinet colleagues and
was vague when asked if they were sympathetic to his views.
Nor could he be persuaded to give his opinion of the Newman
work, even though he is well known as an art lover.
   For its part, the National Gallery has made a stumbling
response to the furor. While director Thomson has defended
the picture bravely, much of the language she has used to
explain its importance has been couched in unintelligible art
jargonese. For ordinary Canadians looking at the three blank
stripes of color, being told that "the painting helps take us
away from the devastating cares of everyday life" has not
been enough.
   While the flap has brought a flood of new visitors to the
gallery, many of whom have never been inside a museum, there
has been no literature or curator available to explain what
Mr. Newman's life and work are all about. Only now, three
long weeks after the crisis broke, have gallery officials
decided to distribute a flyer to try and inform viewers about
the picture. Unfortunately, a draft version suggests that
even this will be alarmingly bogged down in the language so
favored by contemporary art experts.
   Brydon Smith, the gallery's assistant director and a
respected curator of contemporary art, is not renowned for
his gift with words. His text is peppered with references to
the picture as an "objectification of thought" that "floods
our consciousness with a sublime sense of awe and
tranquility."
   With greater clarity, director Thomson points out that in
1907 when the gallery first started to collect the flamboyant
impressionistic images of northern forests and sylvan lakes
created by what is now Canada's best-known group of artists,
the Group of Seven, there was a similiar if more muted outcry
from the public. "Great works aren't always instantly
appreciated" she says wryly, "but at least people are talking
about art."
   Entering the high gallery for the first time, the effect
is startling. The picture is awesome. It looks like a
modern-day stained glass window on the simple back wall of a
contemporary cathedral. Closer up, one sees how the artist
did it. Not with a paint roller, a la Mr. Holtmann, but with
a small paintbrush and tiny strokes, building up layer after
layer of color in painstaking hours and days of work. There
is a luminosity to the paint, just as the experts say. And,
maybe those worrisome thoughts of everyday life are forgotten
for a moment and one is suspended in time and space. Still,
back on Earth, it's comforting to know, as Mr. Smith told the
political committee, that the word "top" is marked on the
back of the picture so that anyone hanging it can be quite
certain which end is up.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed
sharply to $6.49 billion in February, the smallest monthly
imbalance since December 1983, the Commerce Department
reported.
   The $2.83 billion improvement from January's deficit came
from a 7.6% fall in imports, to $38.12 billion, the smallest
level of purchases from abroad in a year. But exports also
dropped; they slipped 1% from a record high in January, to
$31.63 billion. Only aircraft exports showed marked
improvement.

   Many economists were surprised by the extent of the
narrowing in the trade deficit. They said it stemmed from a
weak economy rather than growing attractiveness of
American-made products in the U.S. or abroad.
   "Declining trade deficits which are led by broad-based
declines in imports reflect either a weakening economy or the
recapture of market share by domestic producers; in this
case, I think it reflects a weakening economy," said Joseph
Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank in New York. "It
doesn't reflect a good and growing economy on our part."
   The drop in imports was led by a large decline in U.S.
purchases of foreign oil. The country's bill for imported
petroleum products declined by more than $1 billion, to $4.71
billion from $5.86 billion in January, according to the
report. Analysts said the drop partly reflected falling oil
prices. But the volume of oil imports also decreased -- to
243 million barrels from 291.3 million barrels in January.
   In January, oil imports had surged after extremely cold
weather in December boosted energy consumption, sopping up
U.S. oil supplies. Nevertheless, many analysts remain
concerned about the country's dependency on foreign oil.
   "Oil imports went down, but they are still well above last
year's average," said Gregory Fager, chief economist at First
City Bancorp. of Texas, in Houston. With domestic oil
production at its lowest level in years, he warned, "it will
become increasingly difficult to improve our external (trade)
accounts."
   The U.S. has made striking headway in reducing its massive
trade deficit over the past two years. Aided by a fall in the
value of the dollar through much of 1987, exports have soared
above their levels in the mid-1980s.
   Many economists expect the improvement to continue, but
they doubt gains will be very substantial in the coming
months. The dollar has been rising, making American goods
more expensive abroad and foreign goods cheaper here.
   "Certainly, overseas markets are stronger than ours, but I
think those could weaken a bit," Mr. Carson said. "We have
yet to see the dollar's impact on our export performance. I
don't think exports will be very strong over next quarter."
   Still, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher noted that
"1990 has begun with an encouraging 11.6% increase in exports
over the same two months of last year."
   "It is most encouraging," he added, "to note that over
half of the export increase is in advanced technology,
especially aircraft."
   But a number of analysts cautioned that much of the
February gains in aircraft exports resulted from Boeing Co.'s
shipping a backlog of orders. Boeing's production had been
severely hindered by a strike last fall.
   The Treasury, in a report that was ordered by Congress and
released yesterday, said, "Further improvement in the U.S.
current account position in 1990 is likely at best to be very
modest . . . (and) the possibility of deterioration . . .
cannot be excluded." The current account is the broadest
measure of the U.S. trade deficit. It includes trade in goods
as well as trade in services and financial flows.
   The Treasury said that the U.S. isn't likely to make as
much progress closing its trade gap with Japan in 1990 as it
has in recent years, and warned that "a modest widening" is
possible. The report added that the reunification of East
Germany and West Germany, by increasing domestic demand
within a united Germany, could help reduce the German trade
surplus.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, consistently the
largest the U.S. has with any country, accounts for half this
country's total trade imbalance. But while the gap edged
wider in February, to $3.12 billion from $2.86 billion in
January, it was substantially below the monthly average for
last year. The Bush administration has been employing heavy
pressure in Japan to open its markets to more American
products.
   Autos were one of the few categories of imports that
posted increase in February. Imports of industrial supplies,
consumer goods, capital goods and foods all fell.
   While aircraft exports doubled, exports of industrial
supplies and foods dropped and exports of cars and consumer
goods remained practically the same as the month before.
   Based on new data, the department revised upward its
estimate of January's trade gap, to $9.32 billion from the
$9.25 billion it calculated last month.
   All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

   The over-the-counter market followed the path of New York
Stock Exchange issues and the bond market, falling to its
lowest level since early March.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.9%, or 3.90, to 431.52.
Declining stocks led advancers, 1,119 to 787, and 134 issues
traded at new lows compared with 102 reaching new highs.
Volume was 149.7 million shares, up from 136.4 million.

   Despite the day's fall, PaineWebber's head of OTC trading,
Richard Bruno, called the decline "an orderly sell-off in a
market that's reacting to inflation fears." He added: "I see
a broad buying interest in this market that I don't think
will be swept away by one down day."
   However, there aren't many buyers for shares of small- to
mid-sized companies, said Walter Carucci, president of Carr
Securities, a wholesale market maker whose customers are
brokers and dealers trading largely in stocks of that size.
   "There's a definite stratifying of the market," Mr.
Carucci said. "It's very reminiscent of the mid-1970s, where
well-known stocks performed magnificently and the rest of the
universe did badly." However, that lack of demand should make
those shares attractive in six months or so, Mr. Carucci
said. "I'm beginning to see some real values in terms of
inherit asset value and underlying fundamental value."
   MCI Communications, which reported first-quarter earnings,
dominated the day's trading, falling 1 5/8 to 35 1/8 on
nearly 6.5 million shares. Although the earnings were in line
with analysts' expectations, some investors expressed concern
about the long distance carrier's near-term outlook after
company officials held a morning conference call with
portfolio analysts.
   However, two analysts -- Jack Grubman of PaineWebber and
Joel D. Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette -- said they
were puzzled by investors' reaction to the conversation with
MCI's chief financial officer, Daniel F. Akerson. Both
analysts said they weren't surprised by his indications that
second quarter earnings will be 64 to 68 cents a share,
compared with 62 cents reported yesterday for the first
quarter.
   Mr. Grubman, who expects MCI's earnings to grow at about
20% a year over the next few years, said that some "go-go"
fund managers who invest in companies with very high growth
rates are scaling back their MCI positions. He suggests that
for the next few months, MCI's investor base will "be in
limbo" as it shifts to more traditional money managers
looking for large, high-quality companies with solid growth
rates from more aggressive funds looking for more rapid
growth.
   Stocks continued to trade on earnings and earnings
forecasts. "We're starting to see people buy on good news and
sell on bad news, like they did years ago before all the
takeover and arbitrage frenzy," said Jerry Markowitz, partner
in charge of OTC trading at Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco.
   Microsoft, which reported strong earnings late Tuesday,
fell 1 3/8 to 60 5/8 on profit-taking. Merrill Lynch analyst
Melinda H. Reach reduced her investment opinion on the
software maker to an "attractive" rating from the firm's top
"buy" rating, according to another person at Merrill.
   Also active was Apple Computer, unchanged at 43 1/4 on 1.7
million shares. After the close, the computer maker reported
second-quarter earnings rose to $1.04 a share from 44 cents a
year before. Mr. Bruno of PaineWebber said he expects to see
strong demand for Apple's shares this morning.
   Other technology issues up on encouraging earnings were
AST Research, up 2 to 23 1/4, Pyramid Technology, up 2 1/2 to
32 and Linear Technology, up 3/4 to 10 3/8.
   Bogert Oil spurted 2 3/8 to 12 1/8, a 24.7% gain, after
the Oklahoma City company announced it's in talks to be
acquired for $13.20 a share by a subsidiary of Louis Dreyfus
Energy Corp.
   Among the day's most active shares was a new issue,
Sullivan Dental Products, a marketer of dental supplies and
equipment based in West Allis, Wis. An initial public
offering of one million shares was priced at $10 each through
Dain Bosworth. More than 1.2 million shares traded, closing
up 2 7/8 at 12 7/8.
   Exide Electronics topped the day's percentage losers,
falling 2 1/2 to 8 1/4, or 23.26%, after a jury awarded about
$14.9 million in damages to a plaintiff charging the maker of
power supply products failed to pay certain sales
commissions. The Raleigh, N.C., company said it will appeal
the verdict.
   Neutrogena slid 2 5/8 to 19 1/2 after announcing late
Tuesday that it expects net income for the second quarter
ending April 30 will be about 50% lower than a year ago.
Attributing the drop to softness in the retail market, the
Los Angeles-based maker of personal care products said that
1990 growth will probably be flat with 1989.

   One Sure Result of Airline Deregulation:
   Controversy About Its Impact on Fares

<LP>
   Ask a dozen researchers about the effects of airline
deregulation on fares, and you'll probably get a dozen
different answers.
   Since free enterprise in the skies entered its second
decade last year, at least 12 studies have tried to measure
its impact on fares. Though they may reach similar
conclusions on narrow points, the studies often clash on
broad issues: Some researchers pronounce deregulation a
smashing success, while others say consumer savings are
grossly exaggerated or nonexistent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's because the studies give different weight to
different factors. The most widely used yardstick is what
airlines call "yield," or the price charged a passenger for
each mile of travel. But researchers also may consider such
variables as airlines' changing costs, the rise of
hub-and-spoke systems and the impact of deregulation on
different types of travelers.
   In the end, how researchers view deregulation may depend
on how they treat the following factors.
                                                                                                       

   What's the Time Frame
                                                                                                       

   Almost no one challenges the idea that deregulation
brought immediate benefit to the consumer. In the years after
the Civil Aeronautics Board stopped setting fares, carriers
slashed prices. New entrants flooded the market offering
bargain-basement prices.
   But most discount airlines have since vanished, and the
airline industry has grown more concentrated. As a result,
studies that look at the entire period of deregulation tend
to find greater benefits than those that examine a more
recent time frame.
   Even critics of deregulation agree that real, or
inflation-adjusted, fares remain lower today than they were
in 1978 -- the last year of regulation. As of 1988, the
latest year used by most studies, real fares were still 20%
lower than 10 years earlier, according to a Transportation
Department study.
   But by 1988, when the industry's merger wave peaked, real
fares had stopped falling. Carriers had largely gotten all
the cost-cutting they could out of wage reductions and more
efficient, bigger jets. Moreover, with fewer competitors
vying for passengers, the airlines were under less pressure
to sacrifice profit margins to defend their turf.
   From 1986 to 1988, real fares dropped only 1% to 3%. Since
then, they have been edging up. "The trend line of the last
few years is quite different from what happened immediately
after deregulation," says Severin Borenstein, an airline
economist at the University of California at Davis. "The
longtime trend in falling prices came to an end."
                                                                                                       

   Distribution of Benefits
                                                                                                       

   National averages for air fares don't reflect what's
happened in many cities. As airlines went out of business and
gobbled each other up, many cities were left with only one or
two major carriers. The lack of competition at these airports
-- including Atlanta, Denver and Pittsburgh -- has produced
hefty fare increases, some studies show.
   The General Accounting Office, a congressional research
arm, found in 1988 that a flight from one of 15 airports with
one or two dominant carriers cost an average of 27% more than
one from an airport with more carriers. In a similar
analysis, the Transportation Department found that fares in
1988 were 18.7% higher at concentrated airports.
                                                                                                       

   Capacity Constraints
                                                                                                       

   As more travelers have taken to the skies, some airports
-- including New York's La Guardia and Kennedy, Chicago's
O'Hare and Washington's National -- have reached their
capacity limits in the past few years.
   So, supply and demand in these places has put upward
pressure on prices. This might have happened regardless of
whether the industry was deregulated -- and thus can't
necessarily be counted against the concept of free
competition.
   An Air Transport Association study last year concluded
that fares at those four airports were 7% higher than
average. Tickets at Orange County, Calif.'s, airport, which
is cramped due to noise restrictions, cost 6% more than
average.
                                                                                                       

   Business Travelers
                                                                                                       

   Airline deregulation has been a better deal for vacation
travelers than for people who fly on business. Runzheimer
International Ltd., a Northbrook, Ill., research company,
examined unrestricted coach fares, commonly used by business
travelers, on 20 heavily traveled routes. Its index of fares
on these 20 routes rose 96% during the '80s. That figure
isn't adjusted for inflation, which totaled about 50% during
that period.
   Runzheimer's study didn't compare business fares on those
20 routes with fares commonly used by leisure travelers.
                                                                                                       

   Carrier's Cost
                                                                                                       

   Factors other than deregulation have put downward pressure
on air fares, according to some researchers. Over the past
decade, they say, airlines have benefited from lower fuel
prices and more fuel-efficient jets.
   A study financed by the Economic Policy Institute, a
nonprofit Washington, D.C., organization, concluded that
lower fuel prices account for three percentage points of the
22% inflation-adjusted drop in ticket prices that it
estimates occurred in the first 10 years after deregulation.
   The study also concluded that fares in the 10 years before
deregulation, adjusted for inflation and changes in fuel
prices, fell 24% -- more than the comparable 19% drop since
deregulation.
                                                                                                       

   Roundabout Routes
                                                                                                       

   Yield -- the amount charged customers for each mile flown
-- is one of the most common fare measures. In a study based
on this measure, the Congressional Budget Office said in 1988
that fares had fallen "significantly" since deregulation.
   Some researchers, however, argue that this is misleading.
They say many travelers now must fly farther to reach a given
destination because of hub-and-spoke systems that collect
passengers from different cities, funnel them to a central
airport and then put them on flights to their final
destinations.
   The Economic Policy Institute says travelers now fly 5% to
30% farther than before deregulation, when flights were more
direct. So, yield can decline even though passengers are
paying more for their tickets. Taking increased circuity into
account, the institute argues, real fares actually rose 8% to
33% in the first decade of deregulation. There is, however,
little detailed research on this.
                                                                                                       

   The Bottom Line
                                                                                                       

   One piece of evidence that suggests passengers haven't
been gouged by carriers since deregulation is industry
profitability. If carriers were practicing oligopolistic
pricing, then presumably it would show up on their bottom
lines. So far, it hasn't happened.
   During the past two years, airlines were supposed to reap
the benefits of industry consolidation. But their average
profit margins in those years were only 1.8% and 0.4%,
respectively, according to Value Line Inc. -- well below the
average for most industries.
                                                                                                       

   Customer Value
                                                                                                       

   Fares may have declined -- but what do you get for your
money these days?
   Many travelers would probably consider this one of the
most important questions about deregulation -- yet, perhaps
because it's so subjective, studies overlook it.
   In the race to slash costs, airlines have jammed more
seats onto planes, shrunk flight crews and cut corners on
in-flight services such as meals. They have made it harder
for travelers to change reservations on some discount
tickets.
   It would be difficult, if not impossible, to measure what
this adds up to in terms of reduced value -- and to what
extent it offsets the $6 billion that Brookings Institution
analysts believe deregulation has saved travelers. The
Brookings analysts subtracted $500 million a year from
consumer savings as the cost of increased flight delays. But
they didn't account for other negative factors.

   USX May Fall Short in Attempt to Raise
   $1.5 Billion Through Sale of Properties

   HOUSTON -- USX Corp. may come up well short of raising the
$1.5 billion it hoped through an auction of oil and gas
properties -- a development that could fuel Carl Icahn's
campaign against company management.
   The bidding deadline passed at the end of March for the
reserves of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp., which USX put up for sale
last October. After examining the unit's data, many
oil-industry officials predicted the auction won't show the
strong bidding of other recent oil-property sales. They
doubted even whether the reserves, broken up into about a
half-dozen packages, would all be sold.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It isn't known when USX will announce results of the sale.
Last year, Chairman Charles A. Corry said the sale would be
completed in the 1990 first quarter and yield $1.5 billion or
more. But yesterday, the company said it is premature to talk
about what it expects to receive or when. "We're still in
detailed negotiations with prospective buyers and the timing
of {any transactions} is uncertain," a company spokesman said
in Pittsburgh.
   Still, many oil men said they view the properties as fully
explored and containing too many small wells to warrant
payment of top dollar. "We just looked and walked," said the
chief executive of one integrated oil company, echoing the
attitude of a number of others. "We look for acquisitions
that have upside, or exploratory, potential and the Texas Oil
&amp; Gas properties generally don't meet that criteria."
   In addition, USX decided to retain for itself a vital
Texas Oil pipeline system linked to the gas reserves, which
further reduced bidders' interest, industry officials said.
   "Had this sale gone smoothly and gotten good dollars, it
might have blunted Icahn somewhat," said an acquisitions
specialist from a midsized oil company.
   Mr. Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, has urged the
company to sell all its Texas Oil properties and spin off the
steel and oil businesses into separate corporations.
Shareholders are voting on the proposal at the annual meeting
May 7. Mr. Icahn declined to comment on signs the sale isn't
going well, other than to agree with oil experts that, "Texas
Oil &amp; Gas makes a very attractive package with the pipeline."
   If the sale doesn't look like it will live up to USX's
goal, the company is widely expected to hold off announcement
of results until after the annual meeting.
   But delays in completing the auction have already raised
questions about its progress and organization. "This is the
second or third time they've pushed this off," said Frederick
Leuffer, a securities analyst with CJ Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell Inc.
   USX still could generate a strong result; sales prices of
many energy properties over the past two years have exceeded
expectations. However, one person familiar with the Texas Oil
sale predicted only a few pieces would wind up being sold,
bringing $500 million to $700 million. Others concurred.
   "I doubt anybody will buy the whole thing," said Arthur
Smith, president of John S. Herold Inc., a Greenwich, Conn.,
consulting and appraisal company. "The properties don't look
as good" as some others that have fetched surprisingly strong
prices, he said.
   In fact, USX seems to be setting the stage for a
disappointing outcome. "This is not a fire sale," a company
official told a group of institutional investors in New
Orleans just a few days after bids were due. "I don't think
you can assume we'll sell all the packages."
   Prospective bidders did express strong interest in at
least one region. "Our conclusion was that the
highest-quality properties were in the Arkoma package," said
an official who headed up a bidding team at a large oil
company. "Our expectation is that's going to go for a premium
price." Arkoma is a natural gas field in Oklahoma and
Arkansas that is currently one of the country's hottest
drilling areas.
   But the other packages are viewed as less desirable. "The
catch on the rest of them is that they were made up of a
whole bunch of low-producing wells and no concentration in
any particular fields," contended an investment banker who
examined them. The trend among large oil companies has been
to sell off smaller, disparate wells to reduce operating
costs.
   In addition, many of recent sales were bonanzas partly
because buyers thought the properties contained a lot of
undiscovered oil and gas. But Texas Oil has a reputation for
wringing as much as possible from its properties. "They don't
have much exploration potential attached to these
properties," maintained an official of another company. "They
tried to indicate there was some, but most of our fellows
didn't agree."
   Not selling the Texas Oil pipeline, which links many of
the gas wells to processing facilities and then to larger
pipelines, also hurt because any new owners of the wells can
transport their gas through that pipeline only. USX has "sort
of a monopoly in the gathering system," the investment banker
said.
   USX had hoped that by retaining the pipeline, it would be
able to cash in on any upturn in the natural gas market. USX
acquired Texas Oil in an exchange of stock valued at $3
billion in early 1986, as the energy industry was skidding
into a severe slump. Though oil prices have recovered, gas
prices have remained low, depressing the profitability of
Texas Oil. Moreover, the acquisition doubled the number of
USX shares outstanding.

   Kidder Wins in Fight to Block Liability

   A federal judge ruled that Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. is not
liable for damages arising from alleged insider trading
related to Maxus Energy Corp.'s acquisition of Natomas Co. in
1983.
   Kidder Peabody, a unit of General Electric Co., had filed
suit in New York in 1987, seeking a declaratory judgment that
the firm has no liability to Maxus.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kidder's action came the same day that Maxus filed suit in
state court in Dallas, charging that alleged insider trading
between investment banker Martin A. Siegel, then with Kidder
Peabody, and Ivan F. Boesky forced its predecessor company,
Diamond Shamrock Corp., to pay too much for Natomas. Maxus
sought $1.6 billion in damages.
   Maxus alleged that Mr. Boesky, acting on inside
information about the transaction from Kidder's Mr. Siegel,
bought Natomas stock while Diamond Shamrock was planning its
purchase. Prior to the purchase, Natomas's stock price shot
up, leading Diamond to make an initial tender offer $300
million higher than necessary, the company had alleged.
   In a ruling last week, U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack
of New York said that Maxus had not suffered injury during
the Natomas transactions and was not entitled to make claims
against Kidder based on the alleged stock price run-up. Judge
Pollack wrote that Maxus had previously said it did not
intend to litigate such claims against Kidder but that he was
still issuing a ruling because Maxus's amended complaint
contradicted such assertions.
   Judge Pollack's ruling does not affect Maxus's efforts in
the suit to recover more than $4 million in fees and expenses
it paid to Kidder for the transaction. That portion of the
suit is still pending in Texas.
   "From the outset we regarded Maxus's legal and factual
position to be seriously flawed. We believe Judge Pollack's
decision completely vindicates our position," said Gary P.
Naftalis of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin &amp; Frankel, a lawyer
for Kidder Peabody.
   A spokeswoman for Maxus said the company would not appeal
because it does not believe the ruling will negatively affect
its case in Texas.

   THE FDIC is slapped with a default judgment for not
responding to a suit.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas E. Scott in Miami entered the
judgment against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. this
week for failing to provide a timely answer to a suit filed
by a company created by shareholders of Overseas Corp., a
Miami development company.
   If the default judgment stands, the government entity will
be held liable to Overseas Investment Recovery Corp.,
attorneys in the case said. The sole question remaining will
be how much, if any, in damages are due to the plaintiff.
"The FDIC has to play by the same rules as everyone else,"
said James F. Gilbride, a Miami attorney for Overseas.
   But FDIC says the rules are in fact different for it. It
claims that as a federal agency it has 60 days to answer a
complaint, not the 20 days afforded other litigants. "It's
not a matter of overlooking anything," said Jack Courtney, an
attorney with the FDIC in Dallas. "It's our contention we
have 60 days to answer suits because we're the U.S.
government."
   "I'll be happy to litigate that issue," responds Mr.
Gilbride, saying that the FDIC is a corporation, not a
government agency allotted the 60-day response time. Mr.
Gilbride contends that because of the manner in which the
FDIC is operated and managed, it isn't an agency. Among other
things, he says, since the executive branch does not exercise
any direct supervisory control over the FDIC, it doesn't fit
the definition of an agency. "It's something that will have
to be drawn out at a hearing," he says.
   Overseas Corp. has been in a heated dispute with the FDIC
over an Orlando, Fla., hotel-resort project that the federal
government foreclosed on after seizing fraud-riddled Vernon
Savings &amp; Loan Association in Dallas in 1986.
   Overseas Investment Recovery Corp., a company formed to
pursue litigation for Overseas Corp., claims the FDIC
breached its obligations to the borrower and reneged on
agreements to settle litigation on several occasions. The
developer claims it suffered $50 million in actual damages
and also wants $750 million in punitive damages from the
FDIC.
   FDIC officials in Dallas huddled in a meeting Wednesday
afternoon to review the judge's default. "Obviously this has
been a topic of discussion here today," Mr. Courtney said,
adding that the agency will attempt to convince the judge
that the FDIC is entitled to 60 days.
   The FDIC inherited the bitter squabble with Overseas when
the agency assumed the role of deposit insuror for the
defunct Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp. last year
following the thrift bailout legislation.

   BREW-PUB BAN in Michigan doesn't violate federal antitrust
laws, court rules.
   The Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling may make it
more difficult for would-be owners of such
brewery-restaurant-bar combinations in other states to fight
restrictions, attorneys say. Although the ruling doesn't set
a precedent in other circuits, other federal and state courts
probably will use it for guidance in absence of their own
precedent-setting cases, says Brian McCollam, attorney with
Cowen Crowley &amp; Nord in Chicago, who works with Illinois
brew-pub owners. "If I was a lawyer in Texas, I'd tell my
client the battle has become a little more difficult," he
said.
   Although 30 states have accepted brewery-restaurant-bar
combinations, the battle continues in some states, including
Texas and Georgia, over whether to allow a small brewery to
sell its own beer. Some state laws prohibit one entity from
owning more than one type of liquor or beer license,
restricting them to brewing, distributing or retailing. And
legislative efforts in several states to change the so-called
"three-tier" laws have been vociferously opposed by state
wholesale and distributor associations afraid of losing their
role as middlemen in the beer and liquor business.
   Thomas Burns Jr., attorney for the plaintiff, Traffic Jam
and Snug Inc., in the Michigan case, argued that the Michigan
law violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act. By dictating the
three-tier system and exclusive distributor territories, he
contended, the liquor statutes inhibit competition. He
further argued that the state liquor commission was engaging
in anticompetitive behavior by prohibiting Traffic Jam from
holding both a brewer's and retailer's license.
   But the appellate judges, in their ruling earlier this
month, agreed with a lower court's ruling that the
commission's action was "pure state action" and therefore
immune from federal antitrust regulation. Mr. Burns says his
client intends to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the
case.
   The Michigan Beer &amp; Wine Wholesalers Association, which
blocked legislative action that would have allowed brew-pubs,
applauded the decision.
   The association called the case "one of the most vicious
and far-reaching attacks on the legislatively mandated
three-tier distribution system."

   TENTATIVE $67.5 MILLION settlement reached in suits over
school bus crash.
   The agreement calls for Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. to
make payments totaling $4.5 million to each of the families
of 15 students who died in the accident near Alton, Texas. In
all, 21 students died and several dozen were injured last
September when a truck owned by Valley Coca-Cola ran into the
bus, knocking it into a water-filled pit. Numerous other
lawsuits still are pending against the company, located in
McAllen, Texas.
   Attorneys involved in the discussions declined to comment
publicly on the tentative settlement, noting that some
details still are being ironed out, and that any agreement
would be subject to court approval.
   The proposed settlement comes as controversy increases
over ambulance-chasing charges growing out of the bus
tragedy. At least three civil damage cases have been filed
alleging unethical conduct by Texas lawyers in the aftermath
of the bus crash. In two of the cases, attorneys are suing
each other, leveling charges of improper solicitation,
client-stealing and slander.
   Several Texas attorneys also have been indicted by a state
grand jury in Edinburg, Texas. They are charged with
illegally promoting and soliciting lawsuits after the bus
crash.

   Chrysler Is Recalling
   72,000 of '83 Models
   To Correct Emissions

   WASHINGTON -- Chrysler Corp. agreed to recall 72,000 of
its 1983 vehicles, because they fail to meet federal
emissions standards for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, the
Environmental Protection Agency said.
   The models being recalled have 2.2-liter engines and
manual transmissions. They include Plymouth Horizon, Turismo
and Reliant; Dodge Omni, Charger, Aries, 600ES and 400; and
Chrysler LeBaron.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency said Chrysler will modify the cars to increase
the amount of air that enters the intake manifold, which is
between the combustion chamber and carburetor. This will
reduce the amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons formed
in the combustion chamber, an EPA official said.
   Chrysler also will reset the ignition timing, so that the
fuel is ignited earlier, allowing it to burn longer and
resulting in more complete combustion and lower emissions,
the official said. In addition, he said, the company will
adjust the idle speed.
   A Chrysler spokesman said notification about the recall
has already been mailed. The company declined to say how much
the recall will cost.
   The spokesman for the auto maker said, "We've got to spiff
up the engine, so that we can meet the standards, which are
extremely stringent."
   The national emission standard for cars, established in
1981, permits the emission of 3.4 grams per mile of carbon
monoxide and 0.41 grams per mile of hydrocarbons, said an EPA
spokeswoman.

   EPA Plans to Reduce

   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency
announced that it plans to reduce indoor air pollution caused
by chemical emissions from new carpets and during carpet
installation.
   This announcement follows a Jan. 11, 1990, petition filed
with the agency by the National Federation of Federal
Employees. The petition charges that the health of agency
workers and union members has been hurt by carpet emissions
at the EPA's headquarters in Washington.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency has asked carpet companies to voluntarily test
all of their products for total chemical emissions and to
provide the public with comparative information on emissions.
The carpet industry has already promised to conduct voluntary
testing to identify specific chemicals emitted by new
carpeting.
   There is no scientific evidence on the health effects of
carpet emissions, the EPA said, although numerous chemicals
are emitted by carpets. The union identified
4-phenylcyclohexene as a cause of respiratory and other
illnesses, due to fumes from carpets installed in a poorly
ventilated area of the office.
   Conclusive evidence on the health hazards posed by carpets
won't be available soon, and the agency said it will continue
expanding its research into the health effects of complex
chemicals from all indoor sources.

   Your March 7 page-one article about the singles night at
the laundromat recalls a song I wrote in 1979 that I titled
"Queen of the Launderette." It would make an excellent
accompaniment to a sudsy wedding service.
   The song was:

   I went there in the evening at the closing of the day
   To do my weekly laundry and to wash my cares away,
   And there amid the washers was a girl I can't forget,
   The one I'll always think of as my
   Queen of the Launderette.

   When she poured the detergent my wish became urgent
   To soft-soap my Queen of the Launderette.
   When she loaded the dryer, my heart was on fire
   For my Queen of the Launderette.
   Some may use smoke rings to summon a dream,
   But my sweetest mem'ries rise up with the steam.
   Oh, that I had her even now at my side
   But when she was finished she went out with the Tide;
   That's how I lost her, so I sit here and bawl
   For I loaned her a quarter and gave her my All;
   My Queen of the Launderette.
   Now my tears make it damper as I empty my hamper,
   My Queen of the Launderette.

   Oh the world is full of women with washing to be done,
   But in my secret sorrows there is really only one.
   And now among the soapsuds there's a
   face that haunts me yet,
   The one I'll always think of as my
   Queen of the Launderette.

   TOKYO -- Tokyo's bears are turning bullish.
   Some of the same analysts who predicted the Tokyo stock
market's steep decline this year are now calling for a
strong, though selective, rebound in share prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A whiff of recovery blew through the Tokyo market on
Wednesday, as the Nikkei index of 225 issues jumped 787.46
points to close at 29249.06. Despite this 2.8% gain, the
index is down 25% since it closed 1989 at a record 38915.87.
   The primary reason for this decline is the weakening yen.
The Japanese currency has lost 9% against the dollar since
the start of the year, prompting monetary authorities here to
push interest rates higher in hopes of stemming the yen's
decline. The dollar topped 160 yen Wednesday in Tokyo before
finishing in New York at 158.10 yen. Key money-market
interest rates are now trading close to 8% -- almost double
their year-ago levels.
   Yet some once-pessimistic analysts are finding cause for
optimism in all the financial turmoil. "I'm bullish," says
Akira Suzuki, an executive director at Morgan Stanley Group
Inc.'s Tokyo office. His firm had been skeptical of Japan's
high-flying market long before it started crumbling in
January, and Mr. Suzuki predicted the market's imminent and
severe downturn just before it started. Now, he says, some
stocks are poised for recoveries of as much as 50%.
   At rival Salomon Brothers Inc., strategist Christopher M.
Mitchinson goes even further: "We expect Japan to offer the
best return prospects of any major world equity market by
year end," he wrote in a recent report to clients. "The worst
is behind us," he says now. Like Mr. Suzuki, Mr. Mitchinson
had recommended in January that his clients bail out of the
Tokyo market -- just before stocks began the nosedive that
wiped out more than $1 trillion of the market's
capitalization.
   Messrs. Suzuki and Mitchinson weren't the only analysts to
call the market's decline. Market analysts at other houses,
even some of Japan's usually optimistic brokerage firms, had
warned that a weaker yen, rising interest rates and slipping
corporate earnings could shatter the Tokyo market's five-year
rally. Lawrence S. Prager, chief strategist for Nikko
Securities Co., was quick to warn that the market's turmoil
of early January could turn into a rout, and he is only now
putting clients back into some stocks.
   Still, the prescience of the U.S. houses' predictions drew
a lot of attention, and they are now leading the pack in
recommending that clients get back into the market. But many
analysts remain gloomy about the Tokyo market, and even Mr.
Suzuki concedes that a recovery may be short-lived.
   "This may be a brief bull market in a long-term bear
market," he says. Still, Mr. Suzuki is urging his clients to
increase the amount of their Japanese investments held in
stock to 78% from the 31% he recommended last week. He says
he may increase the weighting to 85% next week.
   He cautions, though, that only certain stocks will be able
to muster rallies. He favors about 30 heavily capitalized
companies with large domestic business bases and solid growth
outlooks. Among his choices: Kirin Brewery Co., a beer maker;
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., a machinery and aerospace
company; Mitsubishi Estate Co., a property group; Sumitomo
Corp., a trading company; Marui Co., a department store
chain; and a utility, Tokyo Electric Co.
   Now that the dust has begun to settle after stocks dropped
during the first quarter, Mr. Suzuki figures there are
reasons to be optimistic about some companies' prospects. For
one thing, Japanese consumer spending doesn't seem to be
falling. For another, he predicts, the yen is approaching a
floor and interest rates have peaked.
   He expects the dollar to slide from about 160 yen now to
145 yen to 150 yen by the end of the year, and he doubts
predictions by some other economists that the Bank of Japan
will be forced to raise its discount rate, the amount the
central bank charges on loans to financial institutions, for
a fifth time since last May. The Bank of Japan's governor,
Yasushi Mieno, "says the stock and bond markets have
bottomed, and this time I believe him." Besides, he adds,
"The 40% drop in some of these stocks over four consecutive
months leaves significant room for recovery."
   Mr. Mitchinson bases his recommendation on similar ground.
"In our view, the near-term weakness will provide excellent
buying opportunities," he told clients. He warns that the
market remains risky, with the possibility of a total
collapse still present, but he adds: "We believe the reward
potential outweighs the risk."
   His prediction for the Nikkei index's year-end level:
35000. That would be a gain of some 25% from current levels.
Moreover, Mr. Mitchinson notes, if the market plummets to
20000 before then, investors buying in at the bottom could
realize gains of 75% by the end of the year. But investors
who want to make those kinds of gains have to be willing to
hold on to their stocks regardless of further short-term
losses.
   Other analysts who see a rebound in share prices tend to
focus narrowly on one sector or group of companies. Mr.
Prager of Nikko notes that while "there's a feeling of
support at these levels," his firm is recommending stocks
very selectively. Stocks of companies that stand to benefit
from a weaker yen, such as big exporters like auto and
electronics makers, are currently popular.
   Nomura Securities Co., the biggest Japanese brokerage
firm, is plugging the same kind of companies. To a lesser
extent, so are Daiwa Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities
Co., the other major Japanese houses.
   Some foreign anlaysts are critical of their posture,
though. Mr.Suzuki at Morgan Stanley calls their support of
yen-sensitive stocks "defeatist." If the yen remains weak,
some companies may export more. But expanding exports could
mean increasing trade frictions, and the weak currency could
force the authorities to raise interest rates. "That will
result in failure for the stock market," Mr. Suzuki says.

   JACKSON, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said first-quarter
earnings fell 2.8% to $103.3 million, or $1.27 a share, from
$106.3 million, or $1.29 a share, a year earlier. Revenue
fell 5.7% to $870.1 million from $922.6 million.
   The Jackson, Mich., utility concern said the earnings
decline resulted primarily from lower electric and natural
gas sales because of unusually warm winter weather. The first
quarter of 1990 was the warmest in lower Michigan in 69
years, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CMS said the warm weather reduced net income by $7.3
million, or nine cents a share. This was partially offset by
benefits from the company's stock buy-back program. CMS said
it continues to buy back stock under a previously announced
program.
   William T. McCormick, Jr., CMS chairman, said the utility
company is sticking with a forecast calling for 1990 earnings
to outstrip the $3.80 a share achieved in 1989. But 1990 net
could be lower in the event of possible non-cash, one-time
write-offs associated with regulatory matters arising from
CMS's Midland ventures.
   In 1984 CMS abandoned a nuclear plant project in Midland,
Mich., after spending $4.1 billion on construction. But CMS
converted the failed nuclear plant to a gas-fired
cogeneration facility, which recently began commercial
operation. CMS has a 49% interest in the cogeneration
facility.
   CMS stock rose 75 cents yesterday to close at $30 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   College Sports Test: Define Oxymoron;
   Answer: Student-Athlete

   DURHAM,N.C. -- We died a horrible death last month at Duke
University, one which was public in its humiliation and
intense in its pain. The Duke Blue Devils were not merely
beaten in the NCAA basketball tournament's final game by the
incredible team put together at that hotbed of
student-scholar athletics, the University of Nevada-Las
Vegas. They were routed, embarrassed, overpowered,
demoralized, out-coached and out-run. Since basketball to
Duke is akin to what the pope is to the Vatican, the whipping
was not merely a disaster. It was close to a mortal sin.
   Unfortunately for Duke, that visible collapse managed to
overshadow at least for a while the far more troublesome --
because enduring -- shame that is professionalism in college
sports. In too many places, not least in several Atlantic
Coast Conference schools, the athletic department tail has
been spinning the academic dog around its head for a long
time, and to the cheers of the crowd. What is truly pathetic
is not Duke's one-game collapse, which could not obscure the
remarkable and totally unexpected run this very young team
made at the NCAA championship, but the corruption of higher
education by the demands of the entertainment business that
big-time college and basketball have become.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Let us begin with the most obvious statement of the
problem. Coaches, athletic directors, university presidents
and cheerleading sports writers love to refer to the "student
athletes" who perform their gladiatorial duties with such
superb skill. Athletes they are. Students too few of them
ever become. The anecdotal, and deeply saddening, evidence of
individual professional stars who were never taught to read
in secondary school or college is well-known. Somewhat less
well-known is that only 30% of National Football League
players graduated from their institutions, and there is
reason to believe their graduation rate was somewhat better
than their less-talented teammates. Of the 97 major college
basketball programs, 35 have graduation rates of less than
20%.
   If the vast majority of the "student-athletes" don't go on
to the promised land of professional sports and large numbers
don't graduate, who or what is the beneficiary of their
undergraduate toll? One recent news report should help answer
the question. CBS has signed a $1 billion contract for the TV
rights to the NCAA's annual basketball tournament. That
illustrates the reality behind the fiction of amateur
athletics at many universities. There are seas of money to be
made from winning football and basketball, plus oceans of ink
and endless hours of air time. The money and recognition have
subverted academic standards, eroded integrity, generated and
rewarded hypocrisy and taken real control of athletic
programs from university presidents and given it to coaches
and athletic directors.
   What happens to coaches on their way in and their way out
is worth noting. At Clemson, under scrutiny for
corner-cutting in its football program, Coach Danny Ford was
forced out, but with a $1 million settlement to console him.
At North Carolina State University, the extremely engaging if
arguably amoral basketball coach Jim Valvano is departing, a
NCAA probation his legacy. The university paid him $238,000
to go without a major legal fight; the virtually autonomous
athletic booster organization, the Wolfpack Club, paid him
$375,000; the state's governor, James Martin, openly backed
him against the NCSU administration. When former University
of North Carolina football coach Dick Crum was let go in
1987, the deal was facilitated by an $885,000 payout by the
Rams Club, the university's independent sports boosters'
organization.
   Whatever the actual results, money is seen as the way to
buy success, particularly in the wake of adversity. The
University of Florida's football program has had repeated
scandals, suggesting something fundamental is amiss. The
university confronted it by paying its former Heisman Trophy
winner, Steve Spurrier, $2.1 million over four years to coach
the team. He will make $70,000 more a year if he improves the
team's graduation rate, low even by the abysmal standards of
the Southeastern Conference. The chancellor of the State
Board of Regents says Mr. Spurrier is being paid for his
integrity. "I can't put a price tag on integrity," Chancellor
Charlie Reed said. "It's just too important. Paying that out
is money well spent."
   It's a nice thought. The way to restore integrity in
athletics is to pay a coach more money than anyone else in
the college. It'll be interesting to see the value placed on
Mr. Spurrier's integrity if he doesn't produce a winning
team. What happened to the idea that it is the responsibility
of college presidents to ensure integrity in athletics, just
as they are responsible for integrity in the physics or
English departments?
   One sad -- because accurate -- assessment came recently
from the outgoing Sun Belt commissioner, Vic Bubas. "If
you're a president, how would you like to be trying to solve
some of these problems and not even know you have the support
of your board of trustees?" he said. "I know some schools
right now where if presidents took too active a position on
academics and jeopardized a little bit the chance of winning,
they'd get rid of the president."
   Hoping there is strength in unity, the Presidents
Commission, a sub-grouping of the National College Athletic
Association, is pushing more vigorously for reforms. The
NCAA's annual meeting took some steps in the right direction
earlier this year, including a requirement that universities
and colleges publish their athletes' graduation rates.
College faculties are beginning to speak up in forceful ways,
as the Chapel Hill faculty recently did in a wide-ranging set
of recommendations.
   But reform is a sometime thing, while money in basketball
and football is a rapidly multiplying reality. Alumni whose
values are warped demand winning as a goal in itself. Pro
basketball and football do not have minor-league teams and
use the colleges as farm clubs.
   The solution seems fairly obvious. Those universities that
want to have show biz athletic programs should be allowed to
run them with professional employees at every level. Their
employees would not have to masquerade as students. The other
institutions of higher learning would opt out entirely,
abandon preferential treatment and subsidies for athletes and
restore meaning to the phrase "student-athlete." That's what
the Ivy League did almost 40 years ago.
   The booster clubs would be happy. The
athletes-in-training, who could concentrate on their real
reason for being there in the first place, would be happy.
The coaches would be happy. And the universities would no
longer be forced to defend the academically indefensible.
   Anything short of that is almost certain to fail, just as
surely as Duke failed in its test with UNLV, a school that
hardly bothers to pretend it isn't running a training camp
for pros. There's too much money and too much pressure in
big-time college athletics to allow piecemeal reform to get
in the way of success. The handful of exceptions, where
big-league athletics and academics coexist, such as Duke,
only prove the rule. Admitting the obvious and making the
most of it is the only honest, and workable, way to go.

   MCI Communications Corp., Washington, reported
first-quarter net income increased 21% with strong growth in
revenue and long-distance telephone traffic volume.
   The long-distance carrier said net income grew to $163
million, or 62 cents a share, from $135 million, or 51 cents
a share, in the year-earlier quarter.

   Revenue increased 20% to $1.81 billion from $1.5 billion.
   Analysts said results were consistent with their
predictions. Joel Gross of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette said
MCI "is gaining market share and will continue to do so."
Jack Grubman of PaineWebber said results were "fine," but the
stock isn't going up because MCI "is getting penalized for
doing the right thing." He said the company is investing for
the long term in marketing, sales efforts, equipment and
network improvements.
   In national over-the-counter trading, MCI stock closed at
$35.125, down $1.625.

   Democrats on House Budget Panel Split
   Over Proposed Cuts in Military Spending

   WASHINGTON -- Military-spending provisions of the House
Budget Committee chairman's deficit-reduction blueprint ran
into dissension among members of his own Democratic Party.
   Only a few hours after House Speaker Thomas Foley
predicted that the fiscal 1991 budget resolution would pass
the House, committee Democrats huddled in private to discuss
vigorous demands by angry liberals that part of the military
spending budget be reduced even further than Chairman Leon
Panetta (D., Calif.) had recommended. Committee members gave
strong indications last evening that the spending-authority
portion of the military budget would be reduced.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But that change, if made, could alienate conservative
members of the Democratic Party and create additional
problems for the budget blueprint. The committee has
scheduled a drafting session for today to discuss the
document. The Republican minority on the committee is
expected to oppose the Panetta plan entirely, leaving its
fate fully in the hands of the Democrats. Whatever the
committee decides, amendments could also be made on the House
floor.
   As expected, the Panetta proposal calls for a cut in
military outlays of $11.5 billion and a tax increase of $13.9
billion.
   The contentious element in the military-spending debate is
a category separate from outlays, called spending authority.
The Panetta plan would set spending authority at $286
billion; the liberals are aiming to trim that number to $283
billion, which would have the effect of reducing outlays, or
actual expenditures, in future years. Actual military
spending under the Panetta plan would total $295 billion in
fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.
   The military-spending level is only one hurdle faced by
Rep. Panetta. The other is that it remains unclear at best
how much of the blueprint will ultimately be translated into
law. More than half the $36.2 billion in the deficit
reduction proposed in the document, including all of the tax
increase, is contingent on negotiations with President Bush,
and, so far at least, neither the president nor the
Democratic leaders in Congress have shown much more than
rhetorical interest in compromise.
   The goal of the budget resolution is to lay out a
blueprint for spending and tax legislation by other
committees. It is designed to reduce the deficit in fiscal
1991 to $64 billion from the projected deficit of $100.5
billion that would occur without new legislation.
   The resolution doesn't require the president's signature,
but Democrats made clear it will require his acquiescence if
it is to be put into effect. Speaking of talks with the
president, Speaker Foley, a Washington Democrat, said, "There
is a sense that we may become more engaged later on."
   In the meantime, Rep. Panetta, backed by the House
Democratic leadership, offered a plan yesterday that gets the
bulk of its savings from a combination of militaryspending
reductions that are deeper than the White House wants, and
tax increases that haven't yet been negotiated with a
president who is reluctant at best to accept any.
   In addition, the plan claims $9.1 billion in savings from
an amorphous cluster of proposals that are almost solely
reliant on actions by the executive branch and that
congressional Democrats had previously derided as illusory.
They include, for example, a $3 billion savings from a
reorganization of the Internal Revenue Service.
   The Panetta plan covers fiscal year 1991, but it also
purports to make recommendations for budget savings over five
years. It also urges removal of the Social Security trust
fund from the regular budget-deficit calculation under the
Gramm-Rudman law. Legislation to authorize that change is
likely to come later this year, Mr. Panetta said.
   The Panetta plan is the Democrats' first detailed response
to President Bush's own budget plan. Compared with the
president's plan, the Panetta plan seeks almost $8 billion
less in military outlays, far fewer cuts in nonmilitary
spending, especially in Medicare and farm subsidies, and also
recommends $6 billion in new spending on programs ranging
from child care to space exploration. Rep. Panetta said it
represents a transition from "a Cold War economy to a
peacetime economy."
   The Senate Budget Committee, its work delayed by the
funeral in Hawaii of Sen. Spark Matsunaga, is planning to
begin work on its budget resolution next week.

   General Dynamics
   And Northrop Post
   Increases in Net

   ST. LOUIS -- General Dynamics Corp., buffeted by lower
earnings in nearly all of its businesses, said operating
results for the first quarter fell 17.5%, but a $61.5 million
windfall boosted net income by 64%.
   The gain, which came from the settlement of an antitrust
lawsuit with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., lifted net
income to $123.7 million, or $2.97 a share. A year earlier,
the company earned $75.4 million, or $1.81 a share. Revenue
rose 5% to $2.49 billion from $2.36 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp.'s first
quarter net income soared to $96 million, or $2.04 a share,
from $9.7 million, or 21 cents a share. Earnings for the
latest period included $67.1 million from the sale of
Northrop's corporate headquarters complex.
   Northrop's operating earnings also increased sharply,
rising threefold as the company recovered from a year-ago
writedown in its electronics segment. Sales were flat at
$1.28 billion.
   In some ways, though, the tales of these two arms makers
showed how misleading quarterly figures can be in trying to
predict the future. Northrop, for example, turned in a
relatively impressive operating performance in part because
of stepped up production on the B-2 Stealth bomber. But that
programs seems, over the long term, to be in a particularly
precarious position with Washington budget-cutters.
   By contrast, General Dynamics is incurring squeezed profit
margins at its F-16 fighter factory because it is "staggering
under the work load" of trying to churn out several versions
of the plane simultaneously, James Cunnane, chief financial
officer, said in an interview here. He added that "there is
constant pressure" also being applied to meet schedules on
two other aircraft programs, the A-12 for the Navy and the
Advanced Tactical Fighter for the Air Force.
   At the same time, Mr. Cunnane pointed out, General
Dynamics is spending development dollars on the Atlas rocket,
but it won't begin to record income on the program until the
first launch, which is set for the third quarter.
   "We're suffering from the inefficiencies of expansion," he
said. "I expect that we're going to be in this mode for a
while."
   Northrop's real estate sale also helped it reduce debt to
$881 million from $1.12 billion at the end of 1989. The
balance of its after-tax gain, $22.8 million, will be
deferred and amortized into income over the 10-year lease of
the space in the building Northrop now occupies.
   Operating margins in this year's first quarter included
the recognition of $10.7 million in pension income, as
compared with $3.2 million in pension costs a year before.
   Profits in the aircraft group at Northrop slumped to $56.8
million from $79.3 million, which was in step with a decline
in F/A-18 fighter sales to prime contractor McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and 747 component sales to Boeing Co. Earnings on the
electronics side improved, however, to $8.4 million from a
$13.7 million loss last year when the company made a $26
million provision in connection with research expenses on a
system for the F-15 fighter.
   The biggest winner at General Dynamics was its Cessna
unit, which manufactures small planes. Earnings there leaped
to $16.5 million from $4.3 million.
   But, in the current environment, it would be incorrect to
describe any defense contractor as being in enviable shape.
"General Dynamics is just a microcosm of the defense budget,"
said George Shapiro, aerospace analyst at Salomon Brothers
Inc. "They're going to feel a steady deterioration in their
profit margins."
   He noted that in the first quarter, the company
experienced such problems on the Trident submarine. On top of
that, margins were tighter on the Standard, Phalanx and
Tomahawk missiles, where General Dynamics's role slipped to
that of a second-source supplier. The company once enjoyed
the lead on all of those projects.

   Defying expectations, a divided Supreme Court reaffirmed
the authority of courts to correct constitutional violations,
ruling that a federal judge may require a Kansas City, Mo.,

however, the justices said there must be limits on the
enforcement power of federal judges.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Stocks Fall as Interest Rates Surge;
   Retail, Technology Lead Decline

   NEW YORK -- The stock market suffered its worst setback in
nearly two months as a surge in interest rates sent prices
tumbling.
   Retailing and technology issues were among the major
casualties of the sell-off, which was fueled by
futures-related program selling that gained momentum as the
session progressed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Blue-chip stocks, which have generally been performing
better than the broad market lately, weren't able to maintain
their dominance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded
32.89 to 2732.88, and other market measures recorded
comparable losses.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 3.96 to 340.72, the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went down 1.98 to
186.93 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 3.61 to
317.47. Decliners led by 1,056 issues on the Big Board, over
477 advancers.
   Prices briefly moved higher in opening trading in response
to February trade figures, which was better than expected.
The data showed that the nation's trade deficit narrowed
sharply, to $6.49 billion from $9.32 billion in February.
   But as bond prices plunged for a second straight day amid
widespread speculation that Japanese investors were heavy
sellers of U.S. Treasury issues, stocks proved unable to hold
those gains.
   Sell programs resulting from stock-index arbitrage first
surfaced in the market at late morning, traders said. The
programs, involving the purchase of index-futures contracts
and the sale of baskets of stocks to profit from price
differences between them, struck again several times during
the afternoon.
   As the Dow industrial average posted its sharpest loss
since Feb. 20, when the 30-stock average declined 38.74,
trading activity on the Big Board swelled to its highest
level since April 4. Volume totaled 147,130,000 shares on the
Big Board, up from 127,990,000 Tuesday.
   Even so, traders said selling pressure didn't appear to be
especially heavy, as many investors remained out of the
market. "They don't want to get involved because they don't
know what's going to happen," said Kenneth P. Ducey, senior
vice president of institutional trading at S.G. Warburg.
   Prices on long-term Treasury issues fell 1 1/8 points, or
$11.25 per $1,000 face amount. The benchmark 30-year issue
had a yield of 8.83%, the highest since May of last year, and
up from 8.72% Tuesday.
   "The weakness in bonds over the last few days is taking
its toll on the equity market," said Peter VandenBerg, a vice
president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   Traders said the arbitrage-related selling in the
afternoon was concentrated in futures contracts on the Major
Market Index, a 20-stock average designed to mirror the Dow
industrials. The index includes 17 issues that are also in
the 30-stock average.
   Higher rates also encouraged market participants to take
profits stemming from the market's recent move toward the
upper end of the trading range that has prevailed since
January, traders said. The Dow industrials, at Tuesday's
close, stood just 1.6% below the record high of 2810.15, set
Jan. 2.
   Technology stocks, which had benefited recently from the
strong first-quarter results reported by International
Business Machines and Motorola, were among the most prominent
targets of profit-taking.
   IBM dropped 1 1/4 to 109 7/8 and Motorola fell 3/4 to 67
7/8. Among other issues, Digital Equipment retreated 1 7/8 to
80, Hewlett Packard slipped 1 1/8 to 43 1/2, Compaq Computer
eased 1 1/8 to 99 1/2, Cray Research skidded 1 3/8 to 45 1/2
and Texas Instruments fell 1 1/4 to 36 3/8.
   However, Tandem Computers rose 1 1/8 to 24 1/8 in Big
Board composite trading of two million shares as its earnings
report for the fiscal second quarter, ended in March, was
well-received. The company reported that net income rose more
than 59% from the year-ago period, and its earnings per share
of 25 cents was in line with analysts' recent forecasts.
   Among retailing stocks, another strong group recently,
shares of specialty retailers were hit the hardest. Tandy
declined 1 3/4 to 32 1/2, Limited Inc. dropped 7/8 to 41 3/4,
Gap Inc. fell 1 1/2 to 64 1/2, Circuit City Stores dropped
3/4 to 25 3/4 and Toys "R" Us slid 7/8 to 42 1/8.
   Woolworth, which owns several specialty chains, dropped
7/8 to 61 3/4. As for other major retailers, Dayton Hudson
fell 1 to 70 3/4, J.C. Penney fell 1 to 68 3/4, Wal- Mart
Stores declined 1 1/8 to 49 3/8 and Dillard Department Stores
dropped 2 3/8 to 72 7/8.
   McKesson, which said it is boosting reserves for accounts
receivable because of concern about the financial health of
some of its retail customers, tumbled 2 1/4 to 34 3/8. The
company didn't specify the amount of the increase, but said
its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended in
March will be below year-earlier levels.
   Merck, the best performer among the 30 stocks in the Dow
industrials, gained 5/8 to 74 3/8 after reporting
first-quarter earnings that exceeded the expectations of most
analysts. The company's net income rose about 19% from the
year-earlier level.
   Philip Morris, whose net for the quarter was also better
than expected, dropped 3/8 to 42 5/8 on 2.4 million shares
after trading at higher levels for most of the session. The
company's earnings rose 31%.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped 1 to 41 despite
reporting that first-quarter net was 11% higher than a year
ago. Analysts had expected a better performance. Among other
blue-chip companies issuing quarterly reports, United
Technologies dipped 3/8 to 57 and Coca-Cola fell 1 to 79 1/4.
   Stocks to benefit from positive earnings surprises
included First Interstate Bancorp, which rose 7/8 to 36, and
Phelps Dodge, which gained 1/2 to 61 7/8. Although
first-quarter net at both companies fell short of year-ago
levels, the declines weren't as sharp as had been expected.
   Conversely, Polaroid fell 1 3/4 to 43 3/4 after posting a
disappointing 23% rise in its first-quarter earnings. The
company also scaled back its projected earnings growth for
this year to "moderate" from "substantially higher"; it
didn't provide a specific forecast.
   Nervousness about the rate outlook proved favorable for
precious-metals issues, generally viewed as a safe haven for

   WASHINGTON -- Historic agreements between the U.S. and the
Soviet Union on Germany, strategic missiles and the
withdrawal of the Red Army from Eastern Europe seemed all but
assured in the early weeks of 1990. And then tiny Lithuania,
a Baltic state forcibly absorbed after the 1939 Nazi-Soviet
pact, declared its independence.
   The Soviet Union, after acquiescing in the dismemberment
of its Eastern European empire, now wants to slow down the
train of change. With the prospect of a Soviet blockade
threatening Lithuania's survival, President Bush has an
unenviable choice: support for the Lithuanian people
asserting a cherished American right of self-determination,
or support for Soviet President Gorbachev and the agenda of
historic changes he seems willing to negotiate with the White
House.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This agonizing dilemma turned more acute yesterday, when
Lithuanian officials reported that the Soviets have followed
through on their threats to shut off the supply of oil to the
Baltic republic. The Soviets also have threatened to cut off
natural gas supplies. Last night, the administration was
scrambling to verify the report of the oil cutoff, but an
official cautioned that even if it is confirmed, the U.S.
won't necessarily retaliate immediately. He said the Soviets
could reverse themselves.
   Lithuania has created deep tension between what Mr. Bush
wants to do and what events might force him to do: Impose
sanctions against the Kremlin for economically strangling the
Lithuanians. More than that, the issue pits some of the
Republican Party's most vocal conservatives against Mr. Bush
and his moderate supporters, whose first priority is to
support Mr. Gorbachev.
   To a surprising degree, the American people seem
overwhelmingly on the side of Mr. Gorbachev and the Bush
administration's efforts to avoid a fight over Lithuania.
Even if the Soviet Union violently suppresses Lithuania's bid
for independence, the American public opposes canceling next
month's planned summit talks between George Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev -- by a stunning 61% to 31%,
according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
   A surprisingly similar number of Americans think Mr. Bush
"shouldn't get involved" by recognizing Lithuania. They would
rather the U.S. stay on good terms with Moscow than support
the republic's bid to secede.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Bush appears to feel he may be forced to
do something to support the Lithuanians, even at the risk of
undermining Mr. Gorbachev and the chances for historic deals.
If Mr. Gorbachev presses the fuel embargo even further, the
administration has reluctantly concluded it would have to
hold up new trade pacts with the Soviets that Mr. Bush
ballyhooed at the Malta summit. And if the Soviets go so far
as to use force in the breakaway republic, the summit or the
arms control talks would probably be called off.
   The Lithuania crisis seems to have forced Mr. Gorbachev to
the right on arms-control issues as well. The Soviet military
apparently has forced an end to new concessions by Moscow in
the negotiations, at least for now. And if the new hard line
can't be overcome next month, when Secretary of State James
Baker flies to Moscow for crucial pre-summit talks, the
prospect of a summit deal could vanish.
   "Things have suddenly gotten much tougher," says Marshall
Goldman of Harvard's Russian Research Center. "Until now,
George Bush has had nothing but good news from Moscow. He's
been like an outfielder who just sticks out his glove and the
ball falls in. Now he has to chase those balls hard to catch
them."
   For now, the administration's goal is to keep focused on
the historic changes now within reach: deep arms cuts by
Moscow and plans for German unity and Eastern European
independence. The administration is determined not to allow
Lithuania to throw the process off track. So even if the
administration feels compelled to respond to a Soviet
crackdown by imposing sanctions, it will aim to make them as
minimal and cosmetic as possible.
   For instance, now that the Soviets have moved to cut off
fuel supplies, the U.S. probably will apply sanctions only in
the trade and economic area, leaving intact the chance of
achieving more far-reaching agreements on arms and political
reform of the Communist bloc. The trade pacts were in
jeopardy anyway because the Soviet government still hasn't
passed a law liberalizing emigration, long a key U.S.
condition for trade concessions.
   Meanwhile, administration officials are campaigning on
Capitol Hill and with reporters to convince people that the
arms-control deals are advantageous to the U.S., and
shouldn't be sacrificed to Lithuania. "Our policy toward the
Soviet Union is shaped by what is in the interest of the
United States of America," Secretary of State James Baker
told Congress yesterday.
   Moreover, America's European allies agree with American
public sentiment on Lithuania. The allies are pushing Mr.
Bush to keep broader superpower ties on schedule. Just this
week, Mr. Bush met with a few senators just back from a visit
to Moscow and hinted that he is getting pressure from
America's allies not to let Baltic unrest push the
superpowers off their track.
   Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker sense no public pressure for them
to do more, and they avidly follow poll readings on the
subject. The new Journal/NBC News survey will only reinforce
that feeling.
   "How do I account for the polls that suggest that we
should somehow not get involved in the question of the
Baltics?" Mr. Baker asks rhetorically. "I suppose that some
of it is a recognition on the part of the American people
that we have a lot of interests at stake here that are very
important to the United States of America."
   Washington bureaucrats have grown accustomed to having
ringside seats for wrangling between officials from the White
House and the State and Defense Departments over how to
handle basic superpower relations. But in this case, they are
surprised by the lack of debate. Administration officials
from often-combative agencies insist there isn't any
high-level internal challenge to their strategy of minimizing
the Lithuania issue.
   When some hawkish midlevel Pentagon aides recently
suggested that the administration should prepare to send
material assistance -- petroleum products or hard currency --
to Lithuania, the idea was slapped down. Indeed, some
officials felt the president went too far by publicly saying
last weekend that the threat of a fuel cutoff left him
"deeply disturbed."
   Such sentiments have produced a profound ambivalence
within the administration about the Lithuanians' pursuit of
independence from the Soviet Union, a cause the U.S.
technically supports. Nowhere was that ambivalence more
apparent than a few days ago, when Mr. Bush met privately
with leaders of the Baltic-American community.
   The Baltic-Americans, who had been clamoring for weeks for
a White House meeting, were delighted when Mr. Bush flatly
declared at the outset Lithuanian independence is inevitable.
"I underline the word inevitable, because that is the word
the president used," John Genys, a representative of the
Lithuanian American Council, says.
   But that happiness ebbed when Mr. Bush was pressed to
recognize Lithuania's government. The president responded
that he needed to move carefully and "sort out the
information" from Lithuania before taking such a step.
   Mr. Bush has made it apparent that he wants to pursue his
careful policy with discipline. Two weeks ago, without any
announcement, he sent Mr. Gorbachev a signal that he wouldn't
let the crisis in Lithuania block warmer ties, by immediately
agreeing to Soviet observer status in world trade talks.
Earlier, Mr. Bush had insisted that such status be denied
until 1991.
   The united moderate front has dismayed hard-liners. Frank
Gaffney, a former Reagan administration Pentagon aide who
heads the Center for Security Policy, says, "I'm firmly
convinced that nobody who matters is pressing inside the
administration to be tougher. The folks who brought you the
puerile sanctions against China are the same people who will
try to limit the response on Lithuania."
   Mr. Gaffney's group has called the potential trade talk
delays "Potemkin sanctions" and proposed instead a much
harsher list of economic measures, including fuel aid for
Lithuania and a cutoff of existing energy cooperation with
Moscow. But he admits that, on a recent speaking tour around
the country, he found that "nobody is talking about this
issue." He adds that "the American people have a tradition of
xenophobia, isolation and indifference" to foreign events.
   The real problem for the Bush White House lies inside the
Soviet Union. There, Mr. Gorbachev is assuring visitors he
wants to avoid a clash over Lithuania as much as Mr. Bush
does. But he has shown little sign that he knows how to do
so.
   When a group of American politicians saw Mr. Gorbachev in
the Kremlin last week, the Soviet president hinted he's
prepared over time to deal with Lithuania's quest for
independence -- but only on his terms. "He indicated that if
the Lithuanians want a divorce that they are entitled to
one," says Sen. Jim Sasser (D., Tenn.). But the Soviet leader
added that "even when you get a divorce, you're required to
go to court for a settlement."
   Behind that reasonable-sounding mien, the American
visitors sensed a seething anger. Mr. Gorbachev twice told
the senators Lithuania's independence-minded leaders have put
everyone in a "stupid situation." He mocked the Lithuanians'
political skills.
   That irritation is privately shared in the White House and
State Department, where there is a widespread belief that
Moscow will eventually let Lithuania secede, and that the
current confrontation might have been avoided by defter
handling by leaders of the Baltic republic.
   Still, if Moscow enforces draconian measures against
Lithuania, some sanctions will be imposed. "If you see
videotapes on TV of little children freezing or starving,
this administration will turn on a dime," says a senior
official at State.
   The administration could retaliate by cutting off talks on
several economic issues, including trade, taxes, civil
aviation, investments, and maritime transport. Officials had
hoped for agreements on the issues by the May 30 summit.
   The White House portrays all those negotiations as
primarily beneficial to the Soviets, at least in the short
run. In contrast, officials say, the talks on conventional
and nuclear arms, and on Germany, promise to seal a historic
retreat of Soviet power and armed force in Europe, and are
squarely in the American interest.
   While the current dilemma mainly stems from Soviet actions
and attitudes, Harvard's Mr. Goldman says, "We could have
made things easier if we'd moved on trade months ago."
   He says such a gesture then would have given Mr. Gorbachev
a concession that might have helped damp both military
pressure and secessionist sentiment. "If we'd helped him
then, it might have postponed these kinds of crises," he
says. "Gestures at this point are very important to Mikhail
Gorbachev."

   Keating Used Loans by Lincoln S&amp;L
   To Get Cash for Parent, U.S. Alleges

   WASHINGTON -- Charles Keating used loans by Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association to entice a business partner to
lend to Lincoln's cash-strapped holding company only weeks
before federal regulators seized the thrift last year,
lawyers for the government charged.
   Lincoln agreed in February 1989 to put up $13 million in
two business deals with Saudi European Bank, a frequent
business partner of Mr. Keating's. At the same time, the
government lawyers asserted in federal court here, the Saudi
bank agreed to loan $3.75 million to American Continental
Corp., Lincoln's parent. American Continental needed the
money because it was facing bond payments of about $5 million
in early April, the lawyers said. Mr. Keating is American
Continental's chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lincoln was taken over on April 14 of last year, and the
government has said it may cost more than $2 billion to bail
out the Irvine, Calif., thrift. Regulators said the thrift
was engaging in many such transactions that benefited
American Continental at the expense of Lincoln, which held
more than $4 billion in government-insured deposits.
   James Murphy, a lawyer for the government, described the
transactions with the Saudi bank as he cross-examined Mr.
Keating for a second day in Mr. Keating's suit to reverse the
takeover.
   Mr. Keating angrily denied that the three transactions
with the Saudi bank were related. "Mr. Murphy, that is not
correct," he said. "That is absurd."
   But Stanley Sporkin, the federal district judge presiding
over the trial, asked Mr. Keating whether having American
Continental and Lincoln do business with the same customers
didn't raise conflict-of-interest problems. "Sometimes you
wore a Lincoln hat. Sometimes you wore an (American
Continental) hat," Judge Sporkin said. "So didn't you open
yourself to these kinds of suggestions?"
   "Yes," Mr. Keating replied. But he maintained that he
didn't even know of Lincoln's transactions with the Saudi
bank.
   Mr. Murphy described an intricate series of transactions
in which he said Lincoln sold part of a profit participation
in a business run by British financier Sir James Goldsmith,
only to buy it back six months later. The transaction allowed
American Continental to book a $37 million gain for 1987.
Without the gain, American Continental would have had a loss
of $11 million for that year, the government said.
   Mr. Murphy introduced a Lincoln memo suggesting that the
buyer of the profit participation -- a subsidiary of Saudi
European Bank -- wanted only a "fee" and interest when the
participation was sold back to Lincoln. Mr. Murphy said that
this indicated the participation had been sold to the Saudi
bank subsidiary simply as a ruse to enable American
Continental to record the gain.
   In addition, Mr. Murphy said, the participation had been
sold for $59 million, when Mr. Keating had estimated its
value at about $75 million. Lincoln bought the participation
back from the subsidiary for $68.5 million.
   Mr. Keating said Mr. Goldsmith's business plans for the
unit, General Oriental Securities Limited Partnership,
changed and the Saudi bank subsidiary decided it no longer
wanted the profit participation. "They had no expectation I
would take them out of that transaction" when Lincoln
originally sold the participation, Mr. Keating said.

   McKesson to Take
   4th-Period Charge;
   Stock Falls Sharply

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Debt burdened retailers are giving
McKesson Corp. a big headache.
   Stock of the drug distribution giant plunged $2.25 to
$34.375 yesterday following an announcement that it was
taking a sizable charge against fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings because some of its highly leveraged retail
customers had fallen behind on their bills.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   McKesson declined to give a dollar figure for the
reserves. But the company said the charge would depress
earnings for the quarter ended March 31 "significantly" below
the $25.4 million, or 59 cents a share, it earned in the
year-earlier period. McKesson also said full fiscal-year
profit would be down "modestly" from year-earlier levels,
when it posted a profit of $100.6 million, or $2.28 a share.
   One analyst estimated the charge at between $10 million
and $15 million and said that while McKesson had forecast
problems with its accounts receivables, the size of the
reserves came as something of a surprise.
   "We expected McKesson to take a charge but weren't
thinking of anything this large," said David Keuler of Blunt,
Ellis &amp; Loew, a Milwaukee research concern. On the "positive
side, we think McKesson has pretty much taken all of the
reserves it's going to need" to cover the problem bills, Mr.
Keuler added.
   McKesson said it decided to take the charge against
earnings after a two-month credit review showed that some of
its retail customers had "employed excessive leverage in
recent years and are using their suppliers to supplement
their bank credit lines." McKesson declined to name the
retailers but analysts said they likely include a big East
Coast department store chain as well as a nationwide chain of
convenience stores that carry McKesson products.
   "Given the narrow margins inherent in the distribution
business, the risk-reward ratio for McKesson to act as an
unsecured creditor in those situations is not consistent with
prudent business practices," the company said.
   The negative stock market reaction to McKesson wasn't
helped any by a separate announcement that fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings for its 83%-owned Armor All Products
unit would be "disappointing." McKesson declined to elaborate
but analysts said results of the car-care products subsidiary
would likely be negatively affected by a recent change in
accounting for marketing costs, a change in buying habits of
automobile-care retailers and by a general slowdown in sales
of Armor All products.
   "Growth in Armor All is kind of slow," said Mr. Kueler of
Blunt, Ellis. "Cars these days are being built with better
finishes, which means people don't need as many products as
they used to."

   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a bill designed to make
it easier for discount retailers to sue competing retailers
and manufacturers that conspire to fix prices.
   The legislation, passed 235-157, has prompted threats of a
presidential veto from senior Bush administration officials.
The Senate Judiciary Committee has passed a similar bill,
which is expected to face stiff Republican opposition when it
goes before the full Senate later this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Proponents of the House legislation, led by Rep. Jack
Brooks (D., Texas), said it will facilitate lawsuits against
manufacturers and retailers that conspire to lock out
low-price retailers or to pressure discounters into raising
their prices. This illegal practice, known as resale price
maintenance, has become more prevalent because of lax federal
antitrust enforcement over the past nine years, according to
Mr. Brooks and his allies.
   The Justice Department hasn't brought a resale price
maintenance case since the beginning of the Reagan
administration. The department's inaction has inhibited
private lawsuits, according to proponents of the bill.
   The Supreme Court, in two decisions since 1984, has
increased the evidentiary burden on plaintiffs that claim to
be victims of manufacturer-retailer collusion. These
decisions, while not legalizing the practice, provided
considerable legal protection to defendants that conspire in
ways other than setting minimum prices, according to many
lawyers.
   The House bill and its Senate counterpart would clarify
that resale price maintenance is always illegal. In addition,
the bills would overturn Supreme Court precedent by
establishing that even without collusion on a specific price,
a manufacturer can't agree with one retailer to terminate a
competing retailer's supply contract.
   Consumer advocacy groups hailed House passage of the
legislation as a major victory. But the Justice Department
reiterated that it will urge President Bush to veto any such
bill that is sent to the White House. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh has warned that the Brooks bill would interfere
with "the freedom of a manufacturer unilaterally to decide
whether or not to deal with a distributor, {which} is an
essential part of our free enterprise system."
   The House approved an amendment to the Brooks bill that
would exclude retroactive application of certain aspects of
the legislation.

   Hytek Microsystems Inc. said its auditors expressed
reservations about the company's survival as a "going
concern." Separately, the maker of hybrid microcircuits said
it reached an agreement to sell the assets of its commercial
hybrid circuit-making operations at Los Gatos, Calif., and to
consolidate its remaining company functions at its Carson
City, Calif., military site.
   It declined to disclose terms. About 90 plant workers will
be affected by the sale: Some of those workers may be
re-employed at the Carson City plant, Hytek said. The company
currently has about 145 employees.
</LP>

   Hytek said the consolidation will free the company to
concentrate on its core business of manufacturing specialty
electronic circuits for military applications. The company
said that despite its auditor's opinion, the consolidation
and sale of assets should "provide the basis for a viable
entity."
   For the year ended Dec. 30, 1989, Hytek posted a net loss
of $5.4 million, or $1.93 a share, on revenue of $9.5

   TSI Inc., Shoreview, Minn., lowered its estimate of
per-share profit for the year ended March 31 to about 80
cents from its earlier projection of 90 cents to 95 cents.
   The measuring device maker said it expects to report
fiscal 1990 sales of about $37 million, compared with $34.8
million in fiscal 1989, when the company had net income of
$1.9 million, or 75 cents a share. The company said results
for fiscal 1990 will be released in June.

   Leroy M. Fingerson, TSI president and chief executive

shortfall in sales, resulting from reduced order bookings in
the fourth quarter.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, TSI
dropped $1 to close at $10.50.

   Earlier Wednesday the government said it has accepted a
number of parties as suitable potential bidders for shares in
Telecom, and will be giving them special access to

   Seized Giant Pipes Bound for Iraq
   Were for a Big Gun, Britain Says
   ----

   LONDON -- The British government said steel tubes seized
last week by customs officials were components of a mammoth
gun bound for Iraq.
   But experts remain puzzled by the actual workings of such
a weapon, which would be five times larger than any known gun
in the arsenal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or
the Warsaw Pact. Iraqi officials insist that the
controversial piping is intended for a petrochemical project,
and Sheffield Forgemasters, the British manufacturer of the
tubes, said it wasn't aware of the material's alleged
military use when it took the order.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the first high-level acknowledgment of the pipes'
military potential, Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas
Ridley told the House of Commons that the eight steel tubes
were "consistent" with designs by murdered international arms
dealer and weapons designer Gerald Bull. Because of that, the
trade secretary added, he was now "entirely satisfied" that
the pipes were part of a gun.
   Mr. Bull, a Canadian-born American regarded by arms
experts as a ballistics genius, was shot to death outside his
Brussels apartment March 22, apparently in a professional
hit. Sheffield Forgemasters said Mr. Bull's Brussels-based
company, Space Research Corp., had acted for the Iraqi
Ministry of Trade in arranging the contract for the pipes and
provided technical drawings for the production of the parts.
   "If it wasn't for the involvement of Gerald Bull, one
would have dismissed out of hand the possibility that these
tubes could be gun parts," said Michael Dewar, deputy
director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies
in London.
   Experts believe that the 132-feet-long pipes, which have a
bore of almost 40 inches, could be pieced together to form
the barrel of a gun capable of lobbing chemical or nuclear
shells several hundred miles. There has even been speculation
that the powerful weapon could boost satellites into earth
orbit.
   Though huge guns were developed by the British and Germans
in World War II, they proved inaccurate and unwieldy. Experts
say Mr. Bull's research on shells that shed part of their
bulk and weight after firing and his work on in-flight
boosters might have made such a weapon feasible. "But we here
at the institute don't know how such a weapon would work, and
I don't think anyone else does either," said Mr. Dewar. Other
strategic and armament experts in the United Kingdom agreed.
   The steel tubes, seized last Thursday at a port in
northeastern England, were the last of a 52-pipe order; the
other 44 were shipped to Iraq's Ministry of Industry and
Minerals. But British trade secretary Ridley said Iraq can't
complete the weapon without the seized pipes. "Let me make it
absolutely clear that the gun itself cannot be in operations
without all its parts," he told the Commons, "and it is a
great success on the behalf of this country to have been able
to prevent that happening."
   Mr. Ridley said his department had received a request in
1988 from Forgemasters asking if permits were needed to
export tubes to Iraq for use in the petrochemical industry. A
Birmingham company, Walter Somers Ltd., also queried the
government about an Iraqi order for specialized pipeline
equipment.
   "Until a few days ago, my department had no knowledge that
the goods were designed to form part of a gun," Mr. Ridley
said. "If my department had known that purpose, they would,
of course, have advised that licenses were necessary, and
they would not have been granted."
   Walter Somers, a subsidiary of Eagle Trust PLC, said it
may have been duped by the Iraqis into producing gun parts.
The hydraulic equipment was shipped to Iraq in October and
could have been part of a giant shock absorber, or recoil
mechanism, for a weapon.
   The company also received an urgent order earlier this
month to make a "positioning or aiming" mechanism that
"allows for a very substantial pipe-like device to be swung
through a 60-degree angle," according to Eagle Trust Chairman
David James. He added that "none of us have ever heard of an
oil pipe which requires a lateral movement of 60 degrees."
The company told the Iraqis it didn't have the capacity to
build the device and shared its suspicions with the British
Department of Trade and Industry.
   There have also been reports that Iraq contacted a Belgian
defense company, PRB, to help produce a shell for the alleged
gun. PRB is owned by British munitions company Astra Holdings
PLC.
   The gun controversy has worsened the already-strained
relations between Britain and Iraq. Last month, the Iraqis
hanged a London-based journalist whom they accused of spying.
In March, British customs seized parts for nuclear-bomb
triggers, bound for Iraq, and arrested five people. One was
deported, one released, and three await trial.
   Asked about the latest allegations on Wednesday, Iraq's
deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoon, pointed out in a
telephone interview from Baghdad that his country already has
long-range missiles and a powerful air force and has recently
launched a space rocket. "What's the need for that gun?" he
asked.
   He also termed "ridiculous" the speculation of arms
experts that such a gun could launch satellites.

   SEEQ Technology Inc., San Jose, Calif., said slumping
prices for its basic line of erasable programmable chips
resulted in a loss of $4.5 million, or 35 cents a share, in
its second quarter ended March 31.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the computer chip maker
posted a profit of $722,000, or six cents a share. Revenue
for the latest period slumped 25% to $11.5 million from $15.5
million a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   SEEQ said the declines reflect "continued competitive
pricing pressure" on its Eeproms, or electrically erasable
programmable read-only memories. These are specialized chips
-- with military, telecommunications and industrial
applicationsthat can be erased and reprogrammed for varied
uses. Despite the poor quarterly showing, SEEQ said it was
"encouraged" by a substantial increase in Eeprom orders in
the latter part of the quarter.
   For the six months, SEEQ posted a loss of $5.6 million, or
43 cents a share, compared with net of $1.8 million, or 14
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 20% to $23.8
million from $30 million.

   In addition, Overmyer cited a combination of business
factors underlying the situation, including losses at Premier

   Ashton-Tate Corp., Torrance, Calif., said it posted a

revenue plummeted 37% to $57 million. The company cited
continuing slumping sales resulting from delays in the

   The results had been expected. The firm in 1989 had a loss
of $28.7 million largely because of glitches in developing
the dBASE upgrade. Ashton-Tate said it still can't give a
delivery date for the upgrade, which many analysts had hoped
would be ready during the 1990 first quarter.
   "Many customers have delayed their purchases of dBASE IV
in anticipation of the shipment of the new version,"
Ashton-Tate said. It said it believes "this trend will
continue" until shipment of the updated version.

   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. said fiscal
second-quarter profit surged 134% as a result of improved
gross margins, brisk sales of new products and robust foreign
sales.
   The company posted net income of $131.8 million, or $1.04
a share, for the quarter ended March 31, up from $56.4
million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed
8% to $1.35 billion from $1.25 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the six months, Apple said net spurted 30% to $256.7
million, or $2 a share, from $196.8 million, or $1.54 a
share, the year earlier. Revenue rose 7% to $2.84 billion
from $2.65 billion.
   Analysts said they were expecting a strong quarter from
Apple but that the results exceeded even those expectations.
The key appears to have been Apple's ability to wrench its
profit margins up to a "spectacular 55%, which has to be a
record or a near record," said Steven Ossad , a computer
analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   The good news, however, was tempered by Apple's forecast,
delivered to analysts during a conference call on Wednesday,
that its profit margins would fall from those elevated levels
in the second half of fiscal 1990.
   The company also told analysts that it expects combined
second half domestic and international growth rates to be a
modest 7% to 10%. Indeed, despite the second-quarter showing,
Apple's stock closed unchanged at $43.25 a share yesterday on
volume of 1.7 million shares in national over-the-counter
trading.
   Apple said its results were greatly aided by record
international sales, which totaled 47% of all sales for the
quarter, which also set a record. Apple attributed the
increase to aggressive overseas marketing efforts coupled
with "the relatively higher growth rates the industry is
experiencing in markets outside the United States."
   Indeed, Apple said that while it remains "cautious" about
growth in the U.S. computer industry in coming quarters, "we
are optimistic regarding the level of international demand."
   Apple said profit also received a boost from improved
margins on its computer products, stemming from lower parts
costs and a more effective program of managing operating
expenses.
   The company added that results were aided by brisk sales
of upgraded models of its mid- and high-end Macintosh
computer introduced last year. The machines, notably the
Macintosh FE 30, 2ci and 2cx, retail between about $3,800 to
$8,600 depending upon the configuration.

   Central Power &amp; Light Co. to help financially strapped
customers took an unintended turn when the utility's
employees got involved.
   CPL serves southern Texas, an area with pockets of poverty
as severe as any found in the U.S. Late in 1988, as an
increasing number of the utility's customers began falling
behind on electricity bills, CPL came up with a deal: Let our
crews help make your home energy efficient -- and bring those
bills to a manageable level -- by caulking and
weatherstripping away drafts.
   Soon, and almost by accident, the program widened. CPL
meter readers suggested that some customers' homes needed
more than a window frame sealed. Other company employees took
up the challenge, offering to work on weekends, without pay,
to renovate homes in need.
   About 200 of CPL's 2,400 employees, ranging from clerks to
executives, now participate in the volunteer effort,
contributing their time while their employer and local
welfare agencies contribute construction materials.
   Employees in the program, dubbed "Reddy Neighbor," a play
on the electric-utility industry's Reddy Kilowatt logo, say
the satisfaction they get from helping their neighbors is
immense. Richard Earnest, CPL's southern region marketing
manager during the week and construction foreman on Saturdays
and Sundays, particularly recalls the work he and his fellow
employees performed for 80-year-old Eusebia Quiroz, a retired
field worker. Her four-room frame shanty was in such bad
shape that "at times we felt we had bitten off more than we
could chew," Mr. Earnest says. But after three weekends of
hammering and sawing by 50 CPL volunteers working under Mr.
Earnest's direction, the Quiroz home became a house, with a
new roof, new sheet-rock walls, new wiring, hot water and a
fresh coat of paint.
   All told, Mr. Earnest and his fellow volunteers repaired
12 homes last year, donating 3,000 hours of their time.
   Homeowners like the frail Miss Quiroz -- who spent her
working years picking okra, melons and other fruits and
vegetables -- are asked to sign waivers absolving the
volunteers and CPL from legal responsibility for the work
done. (Some of the volunteers are construction-trade workers
for CPL, but most work in other fields.)
   CPL, based in Corpus Christi and a subsidiary of Central &amp;
South West Corp. of Dallas, spent $12,000 last year on
materials and is careful to say that this nominal sum comes
from its "below the line" shareholder account. As a regulated
business, CPL wins rates based on the costs of providing
service, and not on the costs of improving customers' homes
or facilities.
   In return for this effort, CPL gains customer respect; it
also keeps customers. Robert Carey, CPL president and chief
executive officer, says that, among other things, the program
"gives us a chance to help some people who can use a hand."
But neither the utility nor its employees make a big deal of
it. Once a year, CPL throws a barbecue for its volunteer
workers and gives them a T-shirt bearing the program's "Reddy
Neighbor" logo.

   Last week, the La Jolla, Calif.-based partnership formally
asked Pic 'N' Save to adopt a resolution giving Girard
control of the board. The resolution would cut the size of
the board to five members, including three Girard appointees.
The board currently has seven members. Now the partnership
said it plans to solicit proxies to elect its nominees at Pic
'N' Save's 1990 annual meeting.
   The company hasn't set a date for the meeting, a spokesman
said. He declined to comment on the filing. Last year, Pic
'N' Save's annual meeting was held on May 18. Based in
Dominguez, Calif., Pic 'N' Save is a retail chain that buys
manufactuers' close-out merchandise and sells it at deep

   MURRAY HILL, N.J. -- C.R. Bard Inc. reported a 57% decline
in net income for the first quarter, reflecting the
health-care company's temporary withdrawal from the U.S.
market for coronary balloon angioplasty catheters.
   Profit fell to $9.2 million, or 17 cents a share, from
$21.3 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. The
results include a charge of $3.3 million, or six cents a
share, for costs associated with Bard's withdrawal of the
catheters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales fell 1% to $195.2 million from $197.2 million.
   The company recalled one version of the catheter last
August and two versions in February and March. The recalls
came after the Food and Drug Administration and Bard's own
internal inquiries had raised questions about the catheters,
which are used as an alternative to bypass surgery to open
blocked arteries in the heart. A Bard spokesman said the
coronary balloon catheters accounted for between 10% and 15%
of world-wide sales of $777.8 million in 1989.
   "This is a disappointing beginning to 1990," said George
T. Maloney, Bard's president and chief executive officer. He
noted strength in Bard's other product groups, which account
for more than 85% of sales. Mr. Maloney said the company is
working with the FDA to regain approval of Bard's balloon
catheters for the U.S. angioplasty market, but he couldn't
say when the approvals might come.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bard shares closed at $16.50, up 25 cents.

   Peugeot S.A., a French auto maker, said consolidated
profit grew 16% to 10.3 billion francs ($1.83 billion) in
1989 from 8.85 billion francs a year earlier.
   The result slightly exceeded analysts' previous estimates
of about 10 billion francs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The earnings advance came despite a strike at two assembly
plants of Automobiles Peugeot S.A. during September and
October that pared about 60,000 autos from 1989 production
and reduced consolidated revenue by about three billion
francs, according to company estimates.
   Revenue rose 10% to 152.96 billion francs last year from
138.45 billion francs in 1988.
   The company said its directors proposed a net annual
dividend of 16 francs a share. The proposed payout compares
with the 1988 dividend of 28 francs, which was made prior to
July's 2-for-1 stock split.

   By Japanese Investors; Treasurys Hit Hardest

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices tumbled for the second day in a
row on U.S. inflation fears and more selling by Japanese
investors.
   Treasury bond prices fell the hardest. Some actively
traded bonds dropped 1 1/8 points, or $11.25 for each $1,000
face amount. Their yield jumped to 8.83%, the highest in
nearly a year, and most short-term interest rates also rose.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Japanese selling is pummeling the U.S. bond market
especially hard because traders are bracing for an avalanche
of U.S. government borrowing soon. In the past, Japanese
investors eagerly have bought large amounts of U.S. bonds.
But this time around, the Japanese may not be so eager
because many have been jolted by plunges in Japanese stock
and bond prices.
   "The atmosphere in the bond market is terrible," said
Scott Pardee, co-chairman of Yamaichi International (America)
Inc.
   Joel D. Kazis, managing director of government bond
trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. agreed.
"Sentiment has turned overwhelmingly bearish as we head
closer and closer" to the Treasury's massive quarterly
financing next month, he said. There has been "sizable
selling from abroad," mostly from Japan. "So the Street is
wondering how it's going to take down all the new supply with
the foreigners selling," Mr. Kazis said.
   The U.S. Treasury probably will issue about $30 billion of
new notes and bonds early in May. Details will be announced
May 2. Most traders expect the department to sell $10 billion
each of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
All this borrowing is likely to drive up 30-year bond yields
to 9% or higher, several analysts said.
   But that's only part of the bond market woes. Investors
still are reeling from Tuesday morning's news that U.S.
consumer prices surged 0.5% last month. The increase was more
than twice as large as economists had expected, bringing the
first quarter's annualized inflation rate to a sizzling 8.5%.
   That news quickly extinguished hopes for a credit-easing
move by the Federal Reserve any time soon. Many analysts now
say the Fed's next step probably will be to push interest
rates higher. That speculation has intensified lately because
of indications that the economy is perking up. The consumer
price index report "really took the wind out of the market,"
Mr. Kazis said.
   "Inflation concerns are starting to re-emerge, and that's
a big concern," said Thomas R. Pura, a partner at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. "Then you top that off with rumors of potential
Japanese lack of interest" in U.S. bonds to be sold next
month at the Treasury's quarterly financing, "and you get a
market that trades pretty poorly."
   Rising Japanese interest rates may provide another reason
for Japanese investors to keep their money at home rather
than invest here. "On a comparative basis, Japanese bond
yields at 7.3% are more attractive to Japanese investors,
now, compared to U.S. bond yields than they have been in a
long, long time," Mr. Pura said.
   Several leading Japanese securities dealers here say
Japanese institutions are increasingly leery of U.S. bonds.
   "We have seen selling by investors, including those from
Japan," said Mr. Pardee of Yamaichi. "Japanese investors are
lying very low. They've had big problems in their own
financial markets, and they haven't shown any inclination to
buy Treasurys. If anything, they've been selling Treasurys to
take profits on the strong dollar."
   Mr. Pardee also said "there's beginning to be a feeling
among some Japanese investors that the dollar is peaking
against the yen so they're taking their profits now."
   Although U.S. bond yields have surged this week, neither
Japanese nor U.S. investors have any incentive to buy
securities ahead of the huge supply of new issues that will
hit the market next month when the Treasury holds its
quarterly refunding, Mr. Pardee added.
   Some Fed policy makers watch bond market trends closely to
gauge investor expectations of future inflation. Thus, this
week's bond debacle increases the likelihood of a Fed
credit-tightening move. But economic indicators still are
sufficiently ambiguous that key Fed policy makers may prefer
to wait for more data before acting.
   All this gloom easily overshadowed other news that many
traders initially thought would spark a bond rally. Early
yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit shrank to $6.49 billion in February
from $9.32 billion in January. That was the smallest gap
since December 1983. It was also smaller than most economists
had anticipated.
   But in yesterday's bond maelstrom, the trade report hardly
caused a stir. Traders also aren't reacting to recent
declines in oil prices, once watched closely as an inflation
barometer.
   "Nobody's even talking about oil anymore," said Mr. Kazis
of Smith Barney. "That shows you how bad the market's mood
is."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury bond market's slump deepened yesterday.
   Long-term government bonds, which dropped about one point
Tuesday, fell another 1 1/8 points yesterday. The
government's benchmark 30-year issue yielded 8.83%, the
highest since May of last year and up from 8.72% Tuesday.
   Rates rose again on short-term Treasury bills. The
Treasury's latest three-month bills were quoted late in the
day at a discount rate of 7.80% bid to yield 8.05%. Late
Tuesday, they were quoted at a rate of 7.76% to yield 8%.
   The Treasury's huge borrowing needs next month already are
weighing heavily on the markets. Moreover, the Treasury said
yesterday it plans to sell about $10.5 billion of new
two-year notes next Wednesday. That is up from the $10
billion of two-year notes sold late last month.
   The new notes will be dated April 30 and will be due April
30 of 1992. They will be sold in minimum denominations of
$5,000.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Corporate bond prices slumped again.
   Some long-term, investment-grade bonds lost as much as a
point. Prices also fell on corporate junk bonds, or
high-yield, high-risk corporate securities. Junk bonds of
Quantum Chemical Corp. fell by 1 1/2 points on news of lower
first-quarter earnings.
   But moving in the other direction were some bonds of RJR
Nabisco Inc. Prices of RJR's pay-in-kind bonds, which pay
interest in the form of additional bonds instead of cash,
have recently surged on speculation that Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. is snapping up the bonds. A spokesman for RJR,
which is controlled by Kohlberg Kravis, declined to comment.
   RJR Nabisco's 13.71% convertible pay-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, rose a point to 83 1/2 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the 13.71%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, rose
3/4 point to 70 3/4.
   Among new investment-grade issues, Ontario Hydro, a large
Canadian utility, tapped the U.S. debt market with $600
million of five-year notes. The notes were priced to yield
9.25% through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Ontario Hydro is the latest Canadian issuer to tap the
U.S. markets to take advantage of the relatively attractive
rates here. Despite the recent rise in U.S. rates, the
difference between U.S. and Canadian rates remains very
large. For example, Canada's 10 1/2% issue of June 1995
yields about 12.40%, while comparable U.S. Treasury notes
yield about 8.81%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals

   Prices of tax-exempt bonds were flat to off as much as 1/2
point yesterday.
   Among active issues, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20%
issue due 2018 fell 1/4 point to 97 1/8 bid to yield 7.42%.
Traders said the rout in the U.S. government bond market
helped depress municipal bonds.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese government bond prices rose, bolstered by the
yen's gain against the U.S. dollar.
   Traders also cited a decline in some short-term Japanese
interest rates as a factor in the bond rally. Japan's
benchmark bonds due in 1999 rose to 86.09 from 85.83 Tuesday.
Their yield fell to 7.345% from 7.39%. The price of the June
futures contract rose 0.18 to 93.55 to yield 7.103%.
   In other major markets, British government bonds slumped.
Traders said inflation fears were fanned by news that power
workers plan to strike unless the government meets their
demands for double-digit wage increases. Britain's benchmark
bonds due 2003-2007 fell 14/32 point to 96 9/32 to yield
12.28%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended 13/32 to 17/32 lower as Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage
Association issues were supported by demand spurred by two
new derivative deals.
   Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae 9 1/2% securities both fell
13/32.
   Two Freddie Mac real estate mortgage investment conduit
securities totaling $800 million were announced yesterday.

   Consolidated Rail Corp. blamed lower revenue plus
recapitalization costs for a steeper-than-expected 58% drop
in first-quarter earnings that sent the Philadelphia
company's stock tumbling.
   Conrail said net dropped to $25 million, or 43 cents a
share, from $60 million, or 88 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue fell 5.6% to $823 million from $872 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Conrail closed yesterday at $43.25, down $1.625, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Wall Street had been expecting a drop in Conrail's profit
because of lower traffic and a change in traffic mix. The
company had said that it carried higher volumes of
lower-revenue freight, such as coal, and lower volumes of
higher-revenue freight, such as autos.
   But PaineWebber Inc. analyst Anthony Hatch noted that
while Conrail's operating profit came in about as expected,
the "other income" category showed expenses of $20 million --
far higher than the $4 million or so he had expected. A year
ago, the railroad had $7 million in other income.
   A railroad spokesman attributed the $27 million swing to a
reduction in interest income of $6 million and an increase in
interest expenses of $8 million, both related to the
recapitalization. The quarter also included about $10 million
in litigation settlements, he said.

   Times Square Plan
   Advances as State
   Takes Properties

   NEW YORK -- In a move that will hasten a long-delayed $2.5
billion reclamation project for Manhattan's blighted Times
Square, the state took legal title to 34 properties in the
district.
   The acquisition of properties along 42nd Street was set in
motion by the signing of a condemnation order by State
Supreme Court Judge Stanley Parness. The order will allow
developers to clear the site and begin construction of office
towers and the renovation of historic theaters by next year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The action came after the project, sponsored by New York
City and New York State, withstood 42 legal challenges from
opponents who claimed it was too large and its tax subsidy
too great. The office tower developer is Times Square Center
Associates, a joint venture of Prudential Realty Group, a
subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of America; and Park
Tower Realty.
   Prudential is committing a $241 million letter of credit
to pay for the land purchase and is waiving its right not to
proceed with the project if significant litigation
interfered. The project has overcome obstacles in addition to
litigation.
   Last year, Chemical Bank withdrew from a plan to relocate
its headquarters to the site, and Chicago developer Joseph P.
Kennedy Associates was widely expected to commit to building
a two-million-square-foot merchandise mart. Three years after
beginning negotiations, there is still no deal. Most serious,
many thought the project would collapse under the weight of
New York City's soft economy.
   City and state officials immediately seized on the
condemnation move as proof that the local economy isn't as
damaged as recent reports would indicate.
   "This is a milestone for the economy of New York," said
Gov. Mario Cuomo. Mayor David Dinkins said: "The 42nd Street
Development Project has come to fruition as an economic
stimulus at just the right moment."
   The project still faces hurdles, chief among them the soft
real-estate market. Only five blocks north of the project,
about a half dozen new office towers are still struggling to
find tenants. Also, eight years after the project was agreed
to by the city and state, there aren't any final agreements
with the hotel or mart developer.
   Veronica Hackett, Park Tower executive vice president,
said the company was confident that by the time the new
towers are ready for occupancy in 1992 or 1993, the market
will have turned the corner.
   Most surprised by the move were project opponents who were
caught off guard last week when Prudential determined there
wasn't any significant litigation pending, even though two
cases have yet to be heard on appeal. Equally devastating to
opponents was Prudential's agreement to raise its letter of
credit to $241 million from $155 million to cover land
acquisition and theater-renovation costs.
   "This just proves that an obscene subsidy is being granted
to a single project if in this market they could go ahead and
build four million square feet of speculative office space,"
said Gary Rosenberg, an attorney who sued to stop the project
on behalf of Seymour Durst, a major New York City landholder
and developer. Mr. Rosenberg said he hadn't yet read the
condemnation order and will determine within 30 days whether
to appeal it.
   Carl Weisbrod, president of New York City Public
Development Corp., the city's real-estate arm, said the
latest development cannot be appealed. "This is the most
significant action both because Prudential is committing $2
billion, and because the opponents have exhausted their legal
challenges," he said.

   Maxus Energy Corp. said it registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission to offer nine million common shares
as part of a plan to restructure preferred stock held by
Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
   Under its agreement with Prudential, Dallas-based Maxus
said it plans to pay Prudential $67.5 million to repurchase
500,000 of the three million $9.75 cumulative convertible
preferred shares that Prudential owns and to make 750,000
additional shares non-convertible. The shares that won't be
convertible any longer will be entitled to an additional
annual dividend of $1 a share, Maxus said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prudential also will receive a $1.5 million restructuring
fee. Further, the agreement would allow Prudential to elect
two directors, instead of the current three, to the Maxus
board. However, the insurance concern hasn't exercised its
right to elect Maxus directors.
   Maxus said the transaction will reduce its preferred
dividends and cut Prudential's stake in the firm's fully
diluted shares to about 11% from 18.5%. Maxus has about 90.8
million common shares outstanding.

   Lehigh Portland Cement Co. agreed to a $5 million
settlement of National Labor Relations Board charges that it
engaged in unfair labor practices, the NLRB said.
   The settlement covers back pay for members of the
International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, the board said,
and stems from a case that was begun in 1984. Lehigh, based
in Allentown, Pa., is a subsidiary of Heidelberger Zement
A.G., Heidelberg, West Germany.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The NLRB concluded in November 1987 that Lehigh violated
labor law by putting contract proposals into effect
unilaterally, thereby changing the terms of an expired
collective-bargaining agreement without first bargaining to
an impasse with the union. The company and the union
eventually agreed to a new contract in October 1988.
   Under the settlement, the NLRB's Philadelphia regional
office will determine how the back wages will be distributed
among approximately 1,200 employees at the company's nine
plants.

   Asarco Inc. said it dropped a lawsuit against
Freeport-McMoRan Inc. over their 50-50 joint-venture
copper-mining research project.
   Asarco, which has interests in nonferrous metals and
specialty chemicals, filed the suit last month in New York
state Supreme Court challenging Freeport's plan to sell its
half-interest to Minorco S.A. as part of a broader
transaction involving the sale of a 61%-owned Freeport unit.
But before that transaction was completed at the end of
March, Freeport bought the venture stake from the unit for
$15 million, Freeport said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Asarco suit alleged that if Minorco became its new
partner, it could harm the venture. Asarco was concerned that
Luxembourg-based Minorco's South African ties might
jeopardize the venture's federal funding.
   The purpose of the venture, the Santa Cruz Project near
Casa Grande, Ariz., is to test the feasibility of new
technology to extract copper from a deep underground deposit.
   In late February, Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co., a unit of New
Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan Inc., agreed to be
acquired-along with its 50% stake in the Santa Cruz
Project-by Minorco for about $705 million in a $17-a-share
tender offer.

   Lukewarm Response of Three Big Oil Producers
   To the World Glut Triggers a Sell-Off in Markets

   The lukewarm response to the world oil glut by three major
Persian Gulf producers triggered a stunning sell-off in oil
markets.
   Prices plunged as much as 70 cents a barrel yesterday in
the wake of the Tuesday night meeting of the oil ministers of
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are held by many to be chiefly responsible for the
excess volumes of oil flowing into world markets at the
moment. As a result, oil-market participants had been
watching closely for any solid evidence that either planned
production cuts.
   But a Tuesday night statement released by the trio in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after oil markets had closed packed
little punch. It blamed overproduction for depressing oil
markets and called on OPEC members to abide by their
production quotas.
   The joint statement also appealed to non-OPEC producers
not to take advantage of seasonal demand increases to step up
output. And it said the three ministers would continue to
cooperate with their OPEC colleagues in efforts to restore
market stability.
   Meantime, a new survey of OPEC's production released
yesterday by the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report
showed total output for last month averaged 23.8 million
barrels a day. That was 1.7 million above the group's
self-imposed production ceiling. Some OPEC members failed to
produce as much as their quotas, but the average from Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates totaled 1.9
million barrels a day.
   Some oil analysts had suggested that the meeting of the
Persian Gulf oil ministers was intended to pre-empt a
possible emergency conference of all 13 oil ministers that
has been urged in recent days by others in OPEC as oil prices
plummeted. Whether that was the case or not, the analysts
said lack of concrete action by either of the three Persian
Gulf producers to slow the outpouring of oil from OPEC
further weakens the market.
   "The Big Three came up with only a Band-Aid, and it was
too small and too late," said Nauman Barakat, first vice
president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Yesterday's sell-off was evident in the Tokyo market and
then gained momentum as other markets opened. In European
spot markets, North Sea crudes fell at the start, ending the
day a sharp 45 cents to 70 cents a barrel lower. Then, West
Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery lost more than 50
cents a barrel in the first 15 minutes of trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   The May WTI contract, which has its last trading day
tomorrow, recovered some of the earlier losses but still
ended the day down 48 cents a barrel and below the
psychologically important level of $17. It settled at $16.96
-- the lowest close for a near-month contract since Dec. 29,
1988.
   The June WTI contract was down 30 cents to $18.09 a
barrel. Outer month futures closed down 21 cents to 34 cents
a barrel.
   Then, as a climax to yesterday's pricing melee, several
U.S. refiners lowered the prices they will pay in the field
for WTI by 75 cents to $15.75 a barrel.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COFFEE: Futures prices fell on the expectation that Brazil
will soon begin actively shipping coffee. The July contract
ended near the low of the day, with a loss of 2.97 cents a
pound at 94.89 cents. Brazil today or tomorrow is expected to
open the registration of coffee to be exported for the next
year, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton,
New York. Shipments are expected to begin immediately, she
said. The expected development caused selling in futures
because Brazil is believed to still have some seven million
bags of coffee from the 1989-90 crop and is expected to begin
harvesting the 1990-91 crop next month, she said. The
expected coffee exports "will be coming when the industry is
entering the slower-consuming summertime period, when demand
for green coffee seasonally is substantially reduced," she
said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices closed higher despite late
profit-taking that trimmed advances. The July contract
settled with a gain of 0.34 cent a pound to 15.56 cents after
trading as high as 15.69 cents. Some traders thought that raw
sugar supplies will be tightening in the near future because
of lower output from Cuba and Thailand, according to one
analyst. Also, the analyst noted, it won't be until June when
Southern Hemisphere nations, such as Brazil, Australia, South
Africa and Mauritius, will begin to harvest their crops. In
addition, the market was supported by the purchase of about
20,000 tons of refined sugar by Syria for May shipment and
reports that Iran had bought 10,000 to 30,000 tons of refined
sugar, analysts said. According to one sugar dealer, the
Soviet Union is expected to come into the market at some time
despite concluding an agreement with Cuba that will involve
the exchange of Cuban sugar for Soviet goods. China is also a
potential buyer in the world market because Cuban exports to
that country this year have fallen short of expectations, he
said.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of most cattle futures
contracts settled slightly higher as traders began to take to
the sidelines in anticipation of a government survey of
feedlots, which is slated for release tomorrow. Charles
Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago, said
he expects the report to show that a large number of cattle
will be ready for slaughter in May and June. These cattle
were placed into feedlots at an unusually young age late last
year when dry weather damaged much of the grazing lands in
the Southern Plains. Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter.
According to Mr. Levitt, the report might show that 6.2
million cattle might be sold by the feedlots in the second
quarter to slaughterhouses -- a record level of sales for any
second quarter. The movement of young cattle to feedlots has
slowed considerably in recent months as pasture conditions
have improved. Mr. Levitt said he expects the government to
report that placements of young cattle onto feedlots dropped
10% in March from the year-earlier month. Nonetheless, the
government is expected to report that it counted about 10
million cattle on feedlots in its 13-state quarterly survey
on April 1, up 1% from the year-earlier date. Prices of hog
futures contracts settled mixed.

   Led to Earnings Growth;

   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co. said first-quarter net income
climbed 9.1% to $283.5 million from $259.8 million, fueled by
a strong 9% growth in international volume, as measured in
gallon sales of concentrates and syrups.
   The soft-drink giant said gallon sales swelled 10% in
Japan, one of its biggest profit centers, as a result of new
packaging and additional flavors of noncarbonated products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Per-share earnings in the latest quarter rose 15% to 83
cents from 72 cents, in part because of a 5% drop in the
number of shares outstanding. Last year's quarterly results
included a gain of $15 million, or three cents a share, from
the sale of the company's coffee business.
   First-quarter revenue rose 12.4% to $2.15 billion from
$1.91 billion a year ago.
   The results, which were in line with most Wall Street
analysts' estimates, reflect Coke's reliance on its
operations abroad as the driving force behind its
profitability. International sales today account for 80% of
the company's soft-drink operating profit and 65% of
soft-drink revenue. Retail case sales abroad rose 10%.
   "These results are a hint of things to come," said George
Thompson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache. "With
international sales up 10%, Coke is at the higher end of its
8% to 10% long-range target for growth. In my opinion, that
can continue for some time."
   For all of the Pacific Rim, gallon sales increased 6%,
including an increase of more than 25% in Thailand because of
added equipment and successful marketing. Coke said
retail-case sales grew 13% in the Pacific.
   The one dismal spot abroad was Argentina, where gallon
sales plummeted 42% in the quarter as a result of the South
American country's economic morass. Even so, Coke was able to
post a 2% increase in gallon sales in Latin America as a
whole, with a good showing in Mexico and Brazil.
   The company said gallon sales in Europe soared 23% in the
first quarter, largely as a result of German bottlers
accumulating inventory and improved distribution in France.
Analysts say the spread of democracy in Eastern Europe bodes
particularly well for Coke. "With the walls coming down, Coke
is in excellent position to take advantage of trade abroad,"
said John Maxwell, an analyst with Wheat First Securities.
   By contrast, the company's domestic performance was
lackluster. Retail case sales in the U.S. increased 3%, with
fountain volume rising a meager 1%. Gallon sales of
concentrates and syrups in the U.S. increased 2%.
"Domestically, it's nothing to write home about," said
Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with PaineWebber Research in San
Francisco, who blamed continuing softness in fast-food
restaurant operations for the disappointing fountain results.
"The fountain is the drag here, and that's one-third of
domestic business."
   Coke's archrival, PepsiCo Inc., is expected to report that
it fared better domestically in the first quarter, with a 6%
growth in gallon sales, Mr. Goldman said. Among other things,
the Purchase, N.Y.-based company isn't as dependent on
fountain sales as Coke is and those restaurants where it is
sold, particularly its own Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains,
are generally enjoying heavier customer traffic. "Certainly
in the first quarter, Pepsi's numbers domestically will
outshine Coke," Mr. Goldman said. "But Coke's international
business is very strong, and that's where it makes its money
-- overseas."
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, the stock closed at $79.25, down $1.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Shell Canada Ltd. said it withdrew as
a 16.66% equity partner in the proposed $580 million Altamont
gas pipeline, citing conflicting contractual obligations with
Altamont rival Pacific Gas Transmission Co, a unit of Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric Co. of San Francisco.
   Analysts said the loss of Shell Canada strengthens the
position of Pacific Gas, which has proposed a competing $1.2
billion expansion of its Alberta-to-California pipeline
system.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pacific Gas has secured conditional contracts covering all
of its proposed additional pipeline capacity. The expansion
would allow the concern to move each day an additional 755
million cubic feet to California and 148 million cubic feet
to the Pacific Northwest.
   Altamont still has about 200 million cubic feet a day of
uncommitted space on its proposed pipeline, a spokeswoman
said. Its sponsors, led by a unit of Houston-based Tenneco
Inc. with a 40% interest, plan to transport as many as 700
million cubic feet of gas a day by late 1993 on their system.
It would extend from Alberta to Wyoming, where it would
connect with a separate Wyoming-to-California pipeline also
backed by Tenneco.
   Altamont said its remaining sponsors, including
Petro-Canada Inc., Amoco Canada Petroleum Co., a unit of
Chicago-based Amoco Corp., and Entech Inc., a subsidiary of
Montana Power Co., will absorb Shell Canada's interest.
Petro-Canada and Amoco Canada are major Calgary-based gas
producers.

   Ford May Buy
   Marine Midland
   Financing Arm

   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it is negotiating
to buy the auto finance operations of Marine Midland Banks
Inc., which in the 1980s led an unsuccessful rush of
commercial banks into the car-lending business long dominated
by auto makers.
   Ford didn't disclose how much it might pay for the auto
business of the Buffalo, N.Y.-based bank. But a Ford
spokesman said the No. 2 auto maker hopes to complete the
talks within a month and intends to keep Marine Midland's
operations separate from its Ford Motor Credit Co. unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With a portfolio of roughly $6 billion, Marine Midland is
the nation's fourth-largest auto lender behind the finance
arms of Ford, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. Marine
Midland is also one of the last major banks still competing
against the Big Three's credit companies.
   Marine Midland Automotive Financial Corp. thrived in the
1980s by signing finance agreements with car importers such
as Saab-Scania AB and by lining up credit agreements with
foreign car dealers who didn't have close ties with a Big
Three finance subsidiary.
   Just last August, Marine signed an agreement to form a
jointly owned finance subsidiary with the U.S. sales arm of
Jaguar PLC. The British auto maker has since been purchased
by Ford.
   Marine also has finance arrangements with Mazda Motor
Corp., in which Ford owns a 25% stake, and Hertz Corp., which
is owned by a company in which Ford has a 49% stake.
   The success of Marine Midland spurred other major banks,
including Security Pacific Corp. and Citicorp to try
developing sophisticated auto financing operations of their
own. But in recent years, the business soured on the
commercial banks.
   When most of the banks entered the auto finance business,
car sales had been surging for several years. But by the late
1980s, the U.S. car market was beginning to slump.
   In addition, the banks suffered because the Big Three
finance arms became more aggressive in lining up business
with import car stores owned by domestic car dealers.
Cut-rate financing programs employed by the Big Three hurt
the ability of commercial banks to keep pace. And many banks
saw default rates soar because they screened too loosely car
loan applicants.
   The difficulties forced commercial banks out as serious
competitors with the Big Three, although most banks still
offer some consumer car loans and dealer financing.
   An additional factor influenced Marine's decision to
consider selling its car-loan business: the low tolerance of
its parent, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., for sub-par
returns. Though Marine Midland's auto finance operations have
been very profitable in the past, margins have shrunk as
sales of high-priced foreign cars in the U.S. fell.
   For all of 1989, a large provision for loan losses pushed
Marine Midland's earnings down to only $13.9 million compared
to $160.5 million in 1988. In this year's first quarter,
Marine earned $6 million, far below the $40.2 million of a
year ago, due to restructuring charges.
   Marine Midland last summer tried to move its auto loan
operations into a joint venture with Aon Corp. of Chicago and
Orient Finance Co. Ltd. of Japan. But that deal unraveled
late last year, with Marine blaming uncertainty in the U.S.
auto market.
   Over the last year, Marine has sold its stakes in two
banks that it intended to acquire, put a lid on loan growth
and sold $160 million in students loans and its credit card
processing business for merchants.
   In part, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai appears to be shepherding its
resources in anticipation of some sort of closer union with
Britain's Midland Bank PLC. Hongkong &amp; Shanghai owns a
minority stake in the British bank, and a standstill
agreement regarding further purchases expires later this
year.
   A Ford spokesman said the auto maker isn't negotiating to
buy Marine's $6 billion in auto receivables. Marine
executives didn't return calls seeking comment.

   New Drug Shows
   Promise Treating
   Type of Leukemia

   A new cancer drug proved strikingly successful with very
few side effects in treating a relatively rare form of
leukemia, researchers said.
   The drug, called 2-CdA, was nearly 100% effective treating
12 patients with hairy-cell leukemia. The patients underwent
just one seven-day treatment and experienced almost none of
the debilitating side effects such as vomiting, hair-loss and
kidney and liver problems associated with other chemotherapy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results need to be replicated by other researchers
before definitive conclusions can be made, and the long-term
effect of the treatment remains unknown. But the initial
experience with the compound is especially promising, and an
apparent improvement over other therapy for the disease,
scientists said.
   "There aren't many {drugs} where you can administer one
course of treatment and have the disease go away and stay
away for as long as four years," says Lawrence Piro, chief of
cancer research at Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation, La
Jolla, Calif., where the drug was developed. "The leukemia
hasn't come back in any of the patients we treated." The
study is published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   "It is without doubt the most effective treatment for
hairy-cell leukemia, in terms of rapidity of response," adds
Elihu H. Estey, a cancer researcher at the University of
Texas-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. Dr. Estey
recently began treating patients with 2-CdA and has had
similar results with five patients. "It's a striking
finding," he says. "It's very unlikely to be a fluke."
   Hairy-cell leukemia, so-called because of the appearance
of the cancerous cells under the microscope, affects about
6,000 people in the U.S., with 600 new cases a year. As the
disease progresses, patients become anemic, are vulnerable to
infection and often need blood transfusions.
   Until the mid-1980s, treatments were ineffective, and
patients often died of blood problems and infections. Since
then, alpha interferon, a drug sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.
and Schering-Plough Corp. and an experimental drug called
deoxycoformycin have significantly reduced death rates from
hairy-cell leukemia. Hoffmann-La Roche is the U.S. subsidiary
of F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. of Switzerland.
   But neither drug is as effective as 2-CdA appears to be in
low doses and both can cause such side effects as nausea,
vomiting, skin rashes and nervous-system disorders,
researchers say. "With the lack of toxicity and the ease with
which people go into remission {with 2-CdA}, I think there's
something really going on here," says Ellin Berman, a staff
leukemia doctor at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,
New York.
   Scripps said it negotiated an agreement with a subsidiary
of Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., to produce and
distribute 2-CdA to other centers for broader clinical
trials. The researchers said the drug is easy to produce and
thus is likely to be less expensive than other cancer
treatments.
   In the 12-patient study, 2-CdA, short for
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, was administered continuously for
seven days to patients aged 36 to 61. Within eight to 10
weeks, 11 of the patients had no trace of cancer in their
blood or bone marrow; the 12th had a small amount remaining
in the marrow, but he declined further bone marrow
monitoring, Dr. Piro said. His blood tests are normal, Dr.
Piro added. None of the patients have had a relapse; complete
remission has lasted from seven to 46 months after treatment,
according to the study.
   "When you can make all the disease go away with a single
infusion of therapy, you have a disease which may be able to
be cured," Dr. Piro said. But because hairy-cell leukemia
proliferates slowly, a relapse could occur long after
treatment. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine whether
2-CdA actually cures the disease.
   The drug was first made about 10 years ago at Scripps by
Dennis A. Carson, who studied severe combined
immunodeficiency disease, made famous a few years ago by the
Texas boy that lived in a bubble. People with that disease
lack an enzyme that processes deoxyadenosine, a chemical
that, without the enzyme, builds up in infection-fighting
white blood cells and kills them. Since cancer patients have
the enzyme, Scripps scientists developed a compound that
mimics deoxyadenosine, but tricks the enzyme so it can't be
processed. The compound then kills the white blood cells,
including those that are cancerous. New, normal white cells
are then generated in the bone marrow.
   Because hairy-cell leukemia is rare, a 12-patient study
"is considered a pretty good series," says Sloan-Kettering's
Dr. Berman. "It's ironic that we have three active drugs for
a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common
forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments."
   Dr. Piro said 2-CdA has also been used effectively in
initial trials to treat more common cancers, including
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. About 50% to 60% of patients --
most of whom had failed other treatments -- responded to the
drug, some with complete remission, he said. "Now, we will
use {2-CdA} as a first treatment to see if response and
remission are higher," he said. Meanwhile, researchers at
University of California at San Francisco are testing 2-CdA
on AIDS-related lymphoma.

   EASTERN AIRLINES was turned over to a trustee by a
bankruptcy judge, who took control of the financially
battered carrier away from Texas Air and Chairman Frank
Lorenzo. Named as trustee was Martin R. Shugrue, who was
ousted last year as president of Continental Airlines, Texas
Air's other airline unit. Unsecured creditors sought a
trustee because they blamed management for Eastern's
ever-growing losses.

   Perrier Group of America Inc. agreed to drop the notation
of "naturally sparkling water" from its labels following a
ruling by the Food and Drug Administration.

   "We have a difference in opinion but the FDA feels

   The FDA action comes as claims for bottled water come

said recently that he might hold hearings into the marketing
claims of the bottled water industry.
   Perrier Group said its mineral water will be back on store
shelves beginning next week. The company said the revised
label will be on all bottles by July 31.
   In February, Perrier S.A. announced a world-wide recall of
its mineral water after minute levels of benzene, a known
carcinogen, was found in samples of the water. The incident
forced Perrier to disclose that benzene occurs naturally in
Perrier water.

<LP>
   A bankruptcy judge wrested control of Eastern Airlines
from its parent, Texas Air Corp. and its chairman, Frank
Lorenzo, appointing a trustee to take the helm of the
financially battered carrier.
   In a surprising move, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland named as trustee a man ousted only last year by Mr.
Lorenzo, Martin R. Shugrue. Mr. Shugrue had served one year
as president of Continental Airlines, Texas Air's other
airline unit. He had also been vice chairman of Pan Am Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In his decision, rendered late last night in New York,
Judge Lifland also released $80 million from an escrow
account to operate the airline for the current quarter.
Eastern had requested the money, but its creditors opposed
granting it as long as Texas Air and Eastern's current
management controlled the airline.
   Judge Lifland's decision is highly unusual. In major
bankruptcy cases such as this, management is often allowed to
chart the company's reorganization course. The judge's action
signals just how far Eastern had spiraled out of the control
of its managers. Unsecured creditors sought a trustee because
they blamed current management for ever-growing losses and
the airline's inability to attract passengers.
   Now that creditors have an apparent victory, it's unclear
if that will be enough to stem those losses and lure back
travelers.
   Under the judge's decision, there's unlikely to be an
immediate impact on Eastern's operations. Judge Lifland has
been adamant that any trustee would be charged with
continuing to operate the airline, rather than slowly
liquidating it.
   Losing day-to-day control of Eastern is a defeat for Texas
Air, no matter what happens in the long run. With its
acquisition of Eastern and its ownership of Continental,
Texas Air briefly ranked as the largest airline operator in
the U.S. But Texas Air has become ensnared in controversy and
suffered record losses of $718 million in 1988 and $886
million in 1989.
   Mr. Lorenzo had successfully used Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code to reorganize Continental into a low-cost
airline that emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings as a far
stronger carrier. He had hoped to repeat that with Eastern's
filing, but a vastly changed economy, an emotional labor
battle, and a more public bankruptcy-law case helped confound
Mr. Lorenzo's use of the process this time.
   Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under
protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan
to pay its debts.
   Judge Lifland's selection of Mr. Shugrue as trustee
puzzled many in the industry and triggered immediate
courtroom controversy. Eastern's attorney, Bruce Zirinsky,
asked the judge to wait before officially appointing the
trustee, arguing there might be a conflict given Mr.
Shugrue's departure from Continental.
   Judge Lifland refused, saying: "It's in the best interest
of this estate that there be no vacuum or no gap in the
management. . . . {Mr. Shugrue's} qualifications, at least on
paper, make his appointment in the best interest of the
estate."
   The judge said that given Eastern's problems, "it would be
inapproriate not to allow another management to address"
them. Mr. Shugrue will take over Eastern's reins today.
   One of five Continental presidents to serve between 1983
and 1988, Mr. Shugrue was squeezed out after Mr. Lorenzo
hired another executive over him as chairman. Industry
insiders said Mr. Lorenzo grew impatient with Mr. Shugrue's
methodical approach to improving that carrier's performance.
   Despite the circumstances of Mr. Shugrue's departure,
Texas Air late last night attempted to strike a conciliatory
pose toward him in his returning role. "We intend to work
with the trustee. We have high regard for Mr. Shugrue. He is
a recognized and highly qualified airline executive," a
spokesman said.
   The fate of Eastern's current top managers, including Phil
Bakes, its president, was unclear last night. Mr. Bakes, a
longtime colleague of Mr. Lorenzo and past manager for
various Texas Air entities, declined to say if he would
continue with Eastern.
   The appointment of a trustee apparently forces the
cancellation of a recent settlement Texas Air reached with
court-appointed bankruptcy examiner David I. Shapiro.
   Under that agreement, Houston-based Texas Air agreed to
pay $280 million, some of that in cash, to Eastern as
compensation for certain transactions that took place between
the two before the bankruptcy-law filing last year. After a
six-month investigation, Mr. Shapiro found that in 12 of 15
intracompany transactions, it could be argued that Texas Air
underpaid Miami-based Eastern.
   Following Judge Lifland's ruling last night, Joel Zweibel,
attorney for Eastern's unsecured creditors, said the
settlement no longer stands. But he maintained that the
creditors intend to secure at least that amount of money, if
not more, from Texas Air as the case continues.
   Earlier yesterday, before he issued his decision, Judge
Lifland had shown visible irritation with Eastern,
particularly when its attorneys tried to assert that Mr.
Lorenzo wasn't directly in control of the carrier. "If his
hand's not on the throttle, it hovers above it, with the
ability to adjust it whenever he wants," the judge said.
   In seeking appointment of a trustee, the unsecured
creditors, who are owed about $980 million, said repeatedly
they want to see Eastern continue to operate or be sold as a
going concern. They have argued that current management is
unable to make viable business projections and halt the
carrier's losses.
   Eastern, however, has painted a worst-case scenario,
maintaining that a trustee is essentially the first step
toward liquidation. If that were to happen, Eastern attorneys
have claimed, creditors would be repaid only the equivalent
of 6.7 cents to 14.3 cents on each dollar owed them -- far
below Eastern's most recent offers to them.
   Eastern has also produced witnesses who said appointment
of a trustee could hinder the pending $350 million sale of
its Latin American routes to AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.
The sale, which has received tentative approval from the U.S.
Department of Transportation, is considered vital to the cash
pool needed to repay creditors and reorganize Eastern.
   Earlier yesterday, before the judge made his ruling, Texas
Air made yet one more attempt to head off appointment of a
trustee by presenting a new, slightly sweetened settlement to
Eastern's unsecured creditors.
   Mr. Lorenzo, who took the stand late in the day for the
first time in the yearlong bankruptcy case, testified that
the latest offer is worth 30 cents on the dollar to
creditors: 23 cents in notes backed by Texas Air's
Continental Airlines; five cents in cash paid by Eastern but
guaranteed by Texas Air; and two cents payable in Texas Air
common stock, which would total about an 8% stake in the
company.
   The creditors, however, found the plan unacceptable,
according to Mr. Zweibel, and instead pressed on with their
fourth day in a row of arguments requesting the trustee.
   Even after the creditors spurned the offer, Mr. Lorenzo
told the court that as far as he was concerned, it was still
on the table, although he wasn't prepared to amend it. "If
the committee proposes to rearrange the deck chairs, we're
prepared to do that," he testified, "We're not prepared to
change the overall value."
   The most recent offer capped a series of proposals from
Texas Air in the past few days, some announced and some
unannounced. The company earlier this week offered a package
valued at 27.5 cents on the dollar. Two weeks ago it made an
offer valued at about 25 cents on the dollar that triggered
the unsecured creditors' serious push for a trustee.
   In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Bakes, the Eastern
president, maintained that appointment of a trustee would be
a signal to the travel industry that Eastern was going to be
liquidated. He added that Eastern employees would begin
leaving the company if a trustee was named. Indeed, a 23-year
Eastern veteran, Jose Smith, a vice president, resigned
yesterday to accept another job. Eastern executives blamed
the trustee hearing for the departure.

   Canada's Mulroney, Conservatives Fall
   To Record Low in Public Opinion Polls

   OTTAWA -- Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his
ruling Conservative Party have fallen to a record low in
public opinion polls because of voter grumpiness over issues
ranging from taxes to turbans.
   Fewer than one in six Canadians who state a preference now
support the Conservatives, according to the polls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   No governing party has ranked so low in Canada since the
Gallup Organization started polling Canadians on their
political party preferences in 1941. But the ruling
conservatives hope to bounce back before the next election
must be held, which by law is by the autumn of 1993.
   Political analysts say the Conservatives' unpopularity
could deter the government from taking further tough action
to deal with the country's economic problems, including the
government's big budget deficit.
   "The mood in the country is pretty sour," said Angus Reid,
president of Angus Reid Associates Inc., an opinion
researcher.
   President Bush observed the anti-Mulroney sentiment first
hand last week when he and Mr. Mulroney attended the Toronto
Blue Jays home opener against the Texas Rangers. When Mr.
Mulroney stepped onto the field for the ceremonial first
pitch, the big SkyDome stadium crowd booed loudly.
   Canadians are particularly upset over the government's
plan to introduce a 7% consumption tax Jan. 1 to replace a
more narrowly based manufacturers sales tax.
   Mr. Mulroney's government also is taking much of the blame
for a constitutional dispute that has rekindled fears about
Quebec's breaking away from the rest of Canada. The dispute
concerns a proposed amendment that would give increased
powers to the provinces and recognize largely French-speaking
Quebec as a "distinct society" within Canada.
   Canadians also are distressed over Canada's high interest
rates and pessimistic about Canada's economic prospects.
Short-term Canadian rates are more than five percentage
points above comparable U.S. rates.
   In addition, some Canadians have objected strongly to
recent government decisions to shut down much of the
country's unprofitable passenger rail services and to relax
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police dress code to permit
mounties of Sikh faith to wear turbans.
   Mr. Mulroney is sticking to his unpopular measures,
including the planned consumption tax, which has been passed
by the House of Commons but still needs to be approved by the
Senate.
   "Doing what is right for the nation often times means
doing things that are difficult and unpopular," he told the
House of Commons.
   Two Conservative members of Parliament were expelled from
the party caucus last week for voting against the consumption
tax. But caucus solidarity remains basically strong, mainly
because of fears that party squabbling would soon lead to the
government's defeat.
   "Mr. Mulroney has clearly established his authority over
the party caucus as no other Conservative leader has done in
a generation," said George Perlin, a Queen's University
political scientist.
   Dalton Camp, a former senior adviser to Mr. Mulroney's
cabinet, said that while Mr. Mulroney's leadership of his
caucus "continues to be masterful," the prime minister "has
only a tenuous grip on his party beyond Parliament Hill."
   Voter unhappiness is strongest in western Canada,
particularly the traditional Conservative stronghold of
Alberta. Many Albertans have switched to a new right-wing
party, the Reform Party, which had the support of almost a
third of the province's voters in a recent poll.
   Many Tory members of Parliament believe the Conservative
Party's current problems will fade away by the autumn of 1993
and the party will be able to repeat its feat of 1988 when it
bounced back from a slump to win re-election.
   The Conservatives have some grounds for their hopes, said
Mr. Reid. He predicted the consumption tax will be less
contentious a year from now and by election time the economy
should be healthier.
   But to get re-elected the Conservatives will need another
big issue like Canada's 15-month-old free trade pact with the
U.S., Mr. Perlin said. The trade pact, which was supported by
a majority of Canadians, was the main issue in the 1988
election.
   The Conservatives are expected to be able to counterattack
more effectively against their critics after the opposition
Liberal Party, at a June 23 convention, picks a new leader to
succeed John Turner, who is retiring. The new Liberal leader
will give the Conservatives a focus for their attacks on
Liberal policies. Jean Chretien, a minister in former Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau's government, is heavily favored to
win the Liberal leadership.

   Report Higher Net

   Merck &amp; Co. said first-quarter net income rose 19% on a
12% sales gain, aided by growth in new products from the big
pharmaceutical company. Pfizer Inc. first-quarter profit rose
4.6% on a 3.2% sales gain.
   Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., said net income rose to
$403.8 million, or $1.03 a share, from $340.4 million, or 86
cents a share. Sales rose to $1.76 billion from $1.57
billion; foreign exchange translations reduced sales by one
percentage point.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Results were a bit better than some analysts' estimates,
and Merck shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $74.375 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive officer,
said both domestic and international operations reported unit
volume gains. Sales outside the U.S. accounted for 45% of
first-quarter sales, compared with 49% a year earlier.
   Merck said its cholesterol-lowering agent Mevacor
continues to grow and holds a 57% share of the market. Other
strong sales leaders include Vasotec, a high-blood-pressure
and congestive-heart-failure drug; Zocor, another
cholesterol-lowering agent sold overseas; and Pepcid, used to
treat duodenal and gastric ulcers, which is "growing rapidly
in the U.S.," Merck said.
   The company said unit sales declined for a group of
longer-established human and animal health products, because
of competition.
   Merck said it had a $90 million pretax gain in the quarter
from the previously reported sale of U.S. rights to an
anti-depressant drug; the gain was offset by provisions for
additional environmental costs, and certain other costs
including expenses related to the 1992 relocation of
corporate headquarters.
   New York-based Pfizer said net income rose to $251.9
million, or $1.50 a share, from $240.8 million, or $1.43 a
share. Sales advanced to $1.48 billion from $1.44 billion.
Analysts had expected results to be about flat. A footnote to
the earnings report said first-quarter results "are not
necessarily indicative" of full-year results.
   In Big Board composite trading, Pfizer closed at $58.875,
up 12.5 cents.
   The latest quarter included a pretax gain of $39 million
on the sale of the DeKalb-Pfizer Genetics seed partnership.
   Pfizer said the stronger U.S. dollar reduced first-quarter
sales growth by 2%, while deconsolidation of the pigments
business, which is being sold, reduced sales another 2%;
without those factors, sales rose 7% in the quarter.
   Pfizer said health-care sales rose 5%; consumer products,
6%; and specialty chemicals, 5%. Animal-health sales were
flat, while specialty minerals sales fell 19% because of the
pending pigments-business sale.

   NEW YORK -- Federal regulators closed Seamen's Corp.'s
Seamen's Bank for Savings, one of New York's oldest thrifts,
and approved the transfer of 13 branches and $2.1 billion in
deposits to Chase Manhattan Corp., effective today.
   Chase, which will operate the branches as part of its
Chase Manhattan Bank, agreed to pay the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. $5 million for 161-year-old Seamen's
deposits, which represent 169,800 accounts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As part of the transaction, the FDIC has agreed to offer a
$2.1 billion short-term note to Chase, repay secured
borrowings of $450 million and retain assets of the failed
bank, chiefly mortgage-backed securities, totaling $2.4
billion.
   Late last year, the American Stock Exchange delisted
Seamen's, after the thrift reported a negative net worth of
$66 million. For its last publicly reported period, the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 1989, Seamen's reported a loss of $168
million, or $7.18 a share.
   For 1988, Seamen's reported earnings of $16.5 million, or
$1.02 a share, down 10% from $18.3 million, or $1.10 a share,
in 1987.
   In 1984, a group of Texas investors injected $75 million
of capital into the troubled mutual savings bank and
converted it to public ownership in 1985. The three
individuals -- Robert T. Enloe, Robert K. Utley and Jess Hay
-- together controlled 69% of the company's stock.
   In 1985, Seamen's shifted its strategy from the
traditional thrift role of originating residential mortgages
to one of investing in mortgage-backed securities, building
up a huge $3.5 billion portfolio. As part of that strategy,
Seamen's placed complicated hedges using mortgage-related
derivative securities on the portfolio to protect its income
from rising interest rates.
   However, those hedges relied on short-term interest rates
keeping their historical relationship to long-term rates.
That relationship changed, and Seamen's found itself paying
consumers more for their deposits.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Chase Manhattan shares closed at $27.25, down 50
cents.

   Two Teams
   Place Genes
   Into Corn

   Two biotechnology teams announced they have successfully
inserted foreign genes into corn plants, a major goal of
agricultural biotechnology.
   DeKalb Genetics Corp., a commercial seed producer, and a
joint U.S. Department of Agriculture-Monsanto Co. team both
announced they had successfully produced fertile, genetically
altered corn plants capable of passing their new genes on to
succeeding generations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The feat opens the way to making corn, the nation's
biggest crop, resistant to disease, drought and herbicides,
as well as to increasing its nutritional value.
   A similar bioengineering claim was made in January by
BioTechnica International Inc. Unlike DeKalb and the
USDA-Monsanto team, however, BioTechnica has declined to say
what genes it inserted into corn plants and what technique it
used.
   Getting new genes into corn also has implications for
other key grain crops such as wheat and rice. Until now,
inserting new genes into plants has been successful only in a
class of plants known as "dicots," those that produce two
leaf-like growths called cotyledons when their seeds first
sprout. Tomatoes, tobacco and rapeseed are among the dicots
that have been successfully engineered genetically.
   Corn, as well as wheat, rice and other cereals, is among
the "monocots" that produce only a single cotyledon on
sprouting and that have defied attempts at genetic
engineering. While scientists have been able to get new genes
into monocot plants, the plants previously have ended up
sterile and unable to pass the new genes on in their seed.
   DeKalb said its scientists had used a "gene gun" to fire
microscopic pellets into test-tube cultured cells of the corn
plant. The pellets were coated with a gene that produces a
resistance to the herbicide bialaphos. Cells that
incorporated the new gene were identified by the fact that
they survived treatment with bialaphos. The genetically
altered cells were then grown into full-sized corn plants
that, in turn, produced seed resistant to the herbicide.
   The bialaphos-resistance gene was used only because it
served as a "marker," enabling the scientists to track the
gene. The gene is of little economic importance in the U.S.,
where bialaphos isn't used, though it's used in Europe,
according to Thomas Rice, a DeKalb scientist.
   The DeKalb research was carried out at laboratories in
Groton, Conn., leased from Pfizer Inc. Earlier this year,
DeKalb bought out Pfizer's 30% equity interest in what had
been a joint venture, DeKalb-Pfizer Genetics.
   The USDA-Monsanto announcement said USDA scientists at
laboratories in Albany, Calif., had used a similar "gene gun"
to fire new genes into corn-cell cultures developed at
Monsanto's laboratories in St. Louis. The scientists inserted
two "marker" genes into the corn cells: one gene that allowed
the cells to grow in the presence of an inhibitor; and a
second gene, taken from fireflies, that causes the cells
incorporating the gene to glow under a special low-light
detector.
   The cells that incorporated the two genes were grown to
mature plants that were then pollinated. The resulting seeds
were planted in a greenhouse where a crop of seedlings is now
growing. The light-detector has found that about half the
seedlings have the firefly gene.
   The feats are a major technological advance, but
scientists cautioned it may be several years before farmers
will have genetically altered seed to plant. Not only must
scientists get the right genes into corn, but they have to
make sure the genetic alteration doesn't affect the yield and
other valuable attributes of the plant. It will take several
seasons of field-testing to produce useful genetically
engineered hybrid corn seed, Mr. Rice cautioned.

   Kenny Rogers, a mellow sort of fellow, this week finds
himself tangled in a decidedly unmellow dispute. Rolling
Stone magazine has named the bearded balladeer in its "Hall
of Shame" hit list of international environmental sinners.
The magazine also included the Journal's editorial page on
its roster -- a more predictable choice. But we were
surprised to find ourselves in such affable company. Rolling
Stone describes Mr. Rogers as an "ardent apologist for the
Los Angeles-based Summit Cement Company, which has sought to
dump toxic wastes from the U.S. mainland on Grand Bahama
Island." Rolling Stone says Mr. Rogers flew the Bahamian
health minister to Florida to help Summit.
   Wrong, says Kenny. He did fly ministers to Florida, but it
was because he was thinking of buying a hotel from the
Bahamian government. The singer is indeed a friend of
Summit's president, Finn Moller. But the only "help" Mr.
Rogers gave Mr. Moller was to aid him in investigating the
environmental safety of a plant Summit thought of buying on
Grand Bahama. In fact, charges Mr. Rogers, Rolling Stone only
heard about the matter because his own investigation was so
large.

   Mr. Rogers is on a 70-city concert tour with Dolly Parton.
But during a break he spoke with Amity Shlaes of the
editorial page by phone from his farm in Athens, Ga.
Excerpts:
                                                                                                       

   What did you feel when you saw your name in Rolling Stone?
   This kind of thing really takes the wind out of your
sails. It makes you wonder why you do things in life.
                                                                                                       

   What really hap pened with the ce ment plant in the
Bahamas?
   At the start I was interested in re searching whether the
plant would be safe because I was thinking of investing {in
the Bahamas} myself. What I found was there are already 15
cement plants of this type operating legally in the United
States. They use hazardous waste not toxic waste {as Rolling
Stone asserts}. Every one of those {plants} wrote me positive
letters. Then I call Greenpeace in San Francisco. I say to
them as a joke: "I know that you guys are the shark in this
situation" -- meaning that they are the hardcore people who
can answer. The guy says "off the record, I'm sure the plant
is safe but I still can't approve."
                                                                                                       

   What did he mean?
   It appears some people would rather win than be right.
                                                                                                       

   Why is it OK to build a plant that uses hazardous waste at
all?
   I am a strange kind of guy. In the world there are very
few things that are black and white. In this case the
hazardous waste, a petroleum byproduct, is used to make a
product that is safe. {In general} something needs to be done
with hazardous waste. Until we find an alternative source,
what do you do with that waste? This seemed a good use.
                                                                                                       

   Why do you think Greenpeace and Rolling Stone are picking
on you?
   They jumped on the bandwagon and used me because I get
more press than anybody else.
                                                                                                       

   What does Dolly think?
   She has never mentioned it. We usually run into each other
only on stage.
                                                                                                       

   Are you doing anything for Earth Day?
   In my business you learn early that you have to pick your
causes. Mine are world hunger and the homeless. Every year I
host a weekend here at my farm to raise money for the
homeless.
                                                                                                       

   Has environmentalism gone too far in America?
   I have never been a person who admires extremists in any
field.
                                                                                                       

   Robert Vare, the Rolling Stone editor who handled the
"Hall of Shame" section, says the magazine stands by its
report. Kenny Rogers never did buy the hotel on the Bahamas.
Finn Moller, the man who wanted to buy the cement plant, says
environmentalist roadblocks forced him to give up the
project, which would have brought 400 jobs to the
underemployed islands.
   As someone once sang: You've got to know when to hold 'em,
know when to fold 'em.

   U.S. Persuades Allied-Signal to End
   Unfair Trade Complaint Against Japan

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. persuaded Allied-Signal Inc. to
withdraw a trade complaint against Japan, at least
temporarily, while the two countries seek to negotiate a
solution.
   At issue are complaints by the U.S. company that Japan
restricts imports of amorphous metals, a high-technology
product used in electric-power transmission equipment. The
Bush administration's decision to negotiate the issue with
Tokyo, rather than launch a formal trade investigation that
could lead to retaliation, signals the administration's
intent to reduce the heat of the current trade dialogue with
Japan. U.S. officials said the Bush administration doesn't
want to give Japan a black eye so soon after that country
agreed to trade concessions in so-called structural
impediments talks with the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative, said
nothing about other U.S. trade complaints awaiting action,
the tone of her announcement suggested that the White House
is considering nonconfrontational solutions for them, as
well. At the end of this month, Mrs. Hills has to determine
whether to list Japan as an unfair trading partner under the
"Super 301" provision of the 1988 trade act.
   Mrs. Hills said that if bilateral negotiations aren't
successful in resolving the amorphous metals dispute within
150 days, the U.S. will invite Allied-Signal to resubmit its
petition for prompt action.
   In Morris Township, N.J., Edward L. Hennessy Jr.,
Allied-Signal's chairman and chief executive officer, said
the company will cooperate with Mrs. Hills. "The recently
announced progress in the trade talks between the U.S. and
Japan holds out the promise that trade issues between the two
nations can be resolved in a more businesslike and less
confrontational manner," he said. "We hope that
Allied-Signal's case will demonstrate that this process
works."
   Allied-Signal filed the trade complaint March 5, alleging
that Japan "has engaged in practices aimed at excluding sales
of U.S. amorphous metals." The U.S. company also charged that
Tokyo has blocked attempts to license technology to Japanese
companies. Mrs. Hills was required under the 1988 trade act
to accept or reject the complaint by today.
   Mrs. Hills has used similar tactics to deal with trade
complaints from other U.S. industries. For example, this past
summer the Shipbuilders Council of America, an industry
group, withdrew a trade complaint about government subsidies
to commercial shipbuilders in South Korea, Japan, West
Germany and Norway after Mrs. Hills promised that the U.S.
would seek to negotiate a broad international agreement to
restrict and eventually eliminate such subsidies.
   The U.S. negotiations with South Korea and member
countries of the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development on shipyard subsidies haven't
been concluded, although U.S. officials say they are making
progress and the talks should be completed next month.
   In its petition, Allied-Signal charged that Japanese
government agencies and businesses worked in concert to keep
the company's amorphous metals out of the Japanese market
while domestic producers tried to develop an equivalent
product. Amorphous metals are used primarily to improve the
efficiency of electrical transmission and have a world market
estimated at about $1 billion a year.
   Mrs. Hills's action drew a cautious reaction from
Congress. Rep. Helen Bentley (R., Md.) said the move was a
"Solomon-like decision." But Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.)
warned that the administration could be "falling into a
pattern of sidestepping U.S. trade law." He stressed that the
"bottom line has to be results in the form of exports for a
U.S. firm that is being shut out by Japan."

   Loral Corp. is the target of a suit filed in U.S. court in
New York by a defense subcontractor that claims it lost
business as a result of allegedly illegal activities by Loral
in winning an Air Force contract.
   The suit, filed by Anaren Microwave Inc. of East Syracuse,
N.Y., seeks $36 million in damages from Loral and William M.
Galvin, a former consultant to Loral who pleaded guilty to
federal bribery charges last month in connection with the
Justice Department's "Ill Wind" investigation into Pentagon
procurement. Also named as defendants are Louis H. Oberndorf,
a Loral executive under suspension with pay, and Victor D.
Cohen, an Air Force procurement official.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Loral, New York, pleaded guilty in December to conspiring
with Mr. Galvin to obtain the illicit assistance of Mr.
Cohen.
   A Loral spokeswoman said that, although the company hadn't
seen the suit, "we think it's utter nonsense."
   Anaren Microwave claims Loral unfairly won an Air Force
contract for radar warning gear for jet fighters in a
competition with Litton Industries Inc. in 1988. As a
supplier for Litton's system, Anaren Microwave said the
defendants' actions in effect robbed the subcontractor of
business.

   PITTSBURGH -- It promises to be a stormy end to a stormy
struggle. If it really does finally end.
   Allegheny International Inc. will duke it out in
bankruptcy court today with a brash hostile suitor, the
latest in a line of would-be buyers. To the victor will go
the dubious pleasure of trying to lead back to health what
remains of the once-stellar maker of Sunbeam toasters and
Oster blenders.

<TEXT>
   Allegheny faces its most combative adversary so far,
Japonica Partners. The partners, two former Goldman Sachs
merger specialists, have acquired enough bank claims to make
them the largest creditor. Their goal: to take over Allegheny
for $655 million in cash.
   It won't be pretty. Allegheny is seething over Japonica's
acquiring of the bank claims at a discount. And the Japonica
partners, two New York investors given to showing up at
meetings tieless and in baseball caps, have shown their
aggressive ways. They complained to Pennsylvania's legal
disciplinary board about the conduct of Allegheny's chief
bankruptcy lawyer. Then they wrote to Allegheny's lead lender
to suggest that a bank executive working on the case was
emotionally exhausted, say people familiar with the letter.
(A Japonica lawyer will say only that the letters speak for
themselves.)
   For the battle-weary appliance maker, this will be the
10th attempt to emerge from Chapter 11 since it filed for
protection from creditors two years ago. Nine other
reorganization plans have fizzled. Creditor groups have been
suing each other. At one point, the shareholder group backed
three different reorganization plans in the space of a week.
Suitors have been entertained and dropped by the company,
while its business and its stock price faded.
   Now Allegheny's fate seems finally ready to be resolved.
And who will end up with control? "The smart money is so
frustrated with this case that it's no longer in the betting
mood," says Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., who represents
Allegheny's unsecured creditors.
   The Allegheny story is a study of corporate mayhem and
bungled opportunities. The company was near ruin four years
ago when former chairman Robert J. Buckley quit amid
allegations that he had squandered corporate funds on shaky
real estate investments and even his own wine cellar. He left
behind $500 million in debt at the company, along with
devastated employees and a spate of shareholder lawsuits.
(The litigation includes a libel suit Mr. Buckley has filed
disputing the allegations.)
   A new management, headed by Oliver S. Travers, was brought
in. The low-key, 63-year-old chairman quickly sold a fleet of
jets and a company-owned mansion, dismissed chauffeurs and
froze executive salaries. To reduce the suffocating debt, he
also began shedding misfit operations like industrial magnets
and titanium.
   But it wasn't enough, and two years ago Allegheny ducked
into the bankruptcy court, hoping to emerge in less than a
year, stronger and relieved of the debt. This might have been
a garden-variety bankruptcy; there were no asbestos claims,
huge pension liabilities or militant unions involved. Instead
it has been more like a series of hostile takeover attempts,
with creditors, shareholders and management doing the
Virginia Reel, switching partners at seemingly every turn.
   Allegheny followed suitor Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities to the altar three times without getting hitched.
It adamantly refused to break up operations one month, then
agreed to sell Sunbeam and Oster to rival Black &amp; Decker the
next.
   "This case has had more twists and turns and
disappointments than any in recent memory," says Mr. Ross,
who has also worked on the LTV, Drexel Burnham and Eastern
Airlines bankruptcy cases.
   Not only couldn't this gang shoot straight, but some of
them were greedy to boot. Soon after Allegheny filed for
bankruptcy protection, six bidders dangled various deals
promising to pay virtually everyone in cash. But for
creditors, cash then became a mantra; they wanted 100 cents
on the dollar, plus interest and attorneys' fees too. As for
shareholders, who are often lucky to get any equity in a
reorganized company, they howled when offered only 40% of a
new Allegheny.
   "People had unusually high expectations," says Robert
Sable, an attorney representing unsecured creditors. "In
bankruptcy," he warns, "you never say it'll be quick and
easy, and you never say you can pay 100 cents" on the dollar.
   Allegheny has watched opportunity after opportunity for
turnaround parade by. In 1987, after the Buckley turmoil but
before the bankruptcy filing, First Boston Corp. offered to
buy the company for $500 million cash. Allegheny executives
eagerly worked to consummate a deal they thought was too good
to be true.
   But some shareholders didn't think it was good enough. The
New York investor group of Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg began
socking away Allegheny preferred stock, and soon said that
unless First Boston upped the ante, it wasn't going to tender
its shares. The investor turned out to be overplaying its
hand: Instead of offering more, First Boston walked.
   Allegheny management was stunned. "It was as if someone
let all the air out of the balloon," says a former Allegheny
executive. "From then on, things went downhill." Banks
tightened credit terms. Financial worries pushed aside
marketing and product development concerns. Key executives
left. Today Allegheny holds the distinction of having the
worst return to investors over a 10-year period among Fortune
500 companies. The common stock that First Boston offered to
buy at $24.60 a share in 1987 now trades at 50 cents.
   "The guys at First Boston should be buying Spear Leeds a
case of champagne every day for the rest of their lives,"
says Paul Levy, a New York investor.
   An official of Spear Leeds, which lost millions on its
Allegheny investment before reducing its stake last fall,
angrily resists blame. The shareholder group "didn't lead the
company into bankruptcy," he says. "Equity had nothing to do
with managing the company. We backed whatever plan we felt
would maximize the value."
   A year after the First Boston deal fell through, Allegheny
entered bankruptcy proceedings. It said it was on a "fast
track" and would emerge by the end of 1988.
   But it jumped the track. Within months, management lost
several board seats to Spear Leeds in a proxy fight. New
directors defied management and company advisers,
complicating efforts to agree on a reorganization plan or
takeover. Management couldn't rein them in.
   Consider Allegheny's fumbling of a hefty $812 million
Donaldson Lufkin offer. Management was all set to sign a
definitive merger agreement at a December 1988 board meeting.
But Spear Leeds directors pushed for a delay to consider a
last-minute rival plan, and accused various board members of
being DLJ stooges. Finally, other directors decided to
adjourn the meeting until January.
   DLJ representatives, waiting in a conference room to shake
hands on the deal they thought was done, were dumbfounded
when a company lawyer told them of the adjournment. "I said
`What do you mean they just left?' I was absolutely
incredulous," says a senior lawyer close to DLJ. "I've been
doing this for 17 or 18 years and I've never encountered
anything like that."
   A board member, Richard P. Farkas, explains that "at that
point we were trying to preserve some value to {shareholders}
just to make it fair."
   The adjournment set the stage for another fiasco. For the
next several weeks, a team of directors and Allegheny's
investment banker worked furiously to persuade the
shareholder group led by Spear Leeds not to scuttle the DLJ
offer. At noon Sunday, Jan. 8, 1989, the exhausted crew
celebrated. "We finally had everyone on board," says Nicholas
Sakellariadis, from Allegheny's investment bank, Smith
Barney, Harris Upham.
   But unknown to Allegheny, DLJ was also working round the
clock -- to revise its offer. DLJ senior vice president
Lawrence Schloss approached the investor group whose
last-minute rival bid had caused the board adjournment. That
group -- Paul Levy, Angus C. Littlejohn and Peter A. Joseph
-- wanted only Allegheny's lawn-furniture and gas-grill
lines, so DLJ drew up a plan to sell it those businesses.
That way, DLJ could hold down debt and save the crown jewels,
Sunbeam and Oster.
   A jubilant Mr. Schloss called Allegheny chairman Travers.
"We said, `We've got terrific news. We finally figured out a
way to do the plan,'" says a member of the DLJ team. "There
was silence. Then {from Mr. Travers}, `Oh no, you guys had
just won. Your original plan was recommended to the board
earlier this afternoon.'"
   Though the revised plan had attractive features, Allegheny
directors and executives were furious. They felt DLJ had
betrayed them by cutting a deal behind their back and
changing a plan for which they had painstakingly lined up
support. Worse, DLJ was now setting a tight four-day deadline
and asking a fee of $2 million a month until the agreement
cleared the courts.
   DLJ officials tried to make amends, flying to Pittsburgh
for a board meeting. But they were relegated to a conference
room 50 feet from the boardroom and refused an audience
despite handwritten pleas. Finally, Mr. Travers came in and
said the board had rejected the revised offer and had nothing
more to say.
   Then DLJ tried hunting down board members at Pittsburgh's
Duquesne Club to explain. Directors wouldn't listen. "They
were trembling with anger," says a DLJ man. Instead of
talking to DLJ, Allegheny sued it to void all agreements.
   What followed in 1989 was one try after another at finding
an acceptable reorganization plan. Allegheny, which had
stoutly resisted selling Sunbeam and Oster, suddenly proposed
selling it to Black &amp; Decker. That idea fell through when
those operations soured. Chastened, Allegheny went back to
DLJ. A new deal was struck, but now DLJ required Allegheny to
meet 95% of its own earnings target. It didn't, and that plan
dissolved in May. Then in June came a company plan, which
failed for lack of financial backing. Late summer saw still
another, backed by Wells Fargo &amp; Co. It fell through when the
bank took a close look at Allegheny's operations and withdrew
its lending commitment.
   As plan followed plan at Allegheny, tempers flared.
Creditors blamed shareholders for undermining DLJ.
Shareholders called creditors greedy. Unsecured creditors
accused bank creditors of forcing asset sales at distress
prices.
   Even bankruptcy judge Joseph Cosetti grew testy. He
likened creditors to a "bunch of surgeons in the operating
room deciding whether we put the legs on backwards or
forwards." At one point he said he wished he could send the
whole courtroom to Charleston for Hurricane Hugo.
   With management preoccupied, business decision making
ground to a virtual halt. Competitors took advantage, beefing
up their promotions. Rumors spread that Sunbeam plants might
close. Allegheny lost market share in irons and food
processors.
   It also lost executives. Almost the whole management team
of the Almet lawn furniture division switched to a
competitor. At Black &amp; Decker, executives cheered when
Sunbeam's respected marketing vice president, William Smith,
quit.
   Then Allegheny's 1989 results came out: a net loss of
$54.9 million, double the year before's, on a 3% sales
decline to $938 million.
   Despite all this, Japonica is proposing to pay $655
million in cash for Allegheny. Japonica's gum-chewing
partners, Paul Kazarian, 34, and Michael Lederman, 37, figure
Allegheny operations can generate enough cash to cover
interest payments.
   But the unconventional style of the partners, who declined
to be interviewed, hasn't won them many friends in
Pittsburgh. There's their costume, for one thing, favoring
Pittsburgh Steelers caps and unpolished loafers. And during
one deposition, say people who were there, Mr. Kazarian
pulled out a cigar, bit off the tip and spat it out on the
carpet.
   Has Japonica the financing to buy Allegheny? When asked in
court to identify its three bank lenders, according to people
present, Japonica's representatives replied: Bank 1, Bank 2,
Bank 3. A Japonica attorney, Herbert P. Minkel Jr., says the
group would have been able to produce financing by now but
has had difficulty getting information from Allegheny. "They
used excuses like the Xerox machine is broken," he says.
Allegheny denies being uncooperative.
   In bankruptcy court today, Allegheny will ask the judge to
approve its latest plan, in which it would keep operating
most businesses while paying creditors mostly in stock of a
reorganized company and giving warrants to current
shareholders. In March most creditors and holders approved
this, but Japonica, as the largest creditor, prevented the
needed two-thirds approval. Allegheny wants the court to rule
that Japonica's vote was invalid because the partners didn't
vote in good faith as a creditor, but rather to scuttle the
company plan and clear the way for their takeover bid.
   But Japonica wants the court to disallow all the votes for
the company plan. It claims the company has been secretly
offering certain creditors eventual cash for the stock they
would get in a reorganization, thus trying to buy their
votes. Allegheny says this is absurd.
   Meanwhile, there are indications Japonica might soon come
up with bank commitment letters to back its bid. Even if it
fails, the partners are likely to come out ahead, being paid
more than they spent for the nearly $70 million in bank
claims.
   Allegheny executives insist their latest plan is superior
and will prevail. "I believe that the company's plan of
reorganization is a fair one," says Mr. Travers, "and that it
will enable Allegheny to achieve a successful reorganization.
Such a reorganization is now in sight."
   But creditors have nightmares about neither plan being
approved, sending everyone back to Square One. "People
involved tell me there seems to be a devil in this case,"
says Mr. Minkel, the Japonica lawyer. "You don't assume

   Your Money Matters:
   Time for Short-Term Bond Funds,
   Often Overlooked, May Be Here

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)
</IN>
<LP>
   Most investors are familiar with money-market funds and
long-term bond funds. But many have given hardly any thought
to the short-term funds that lie between the two extremes.
   Those often-overlooked investments may be a timely choice
for a portion of the vast sums now parked in money funds,
some financial advisers say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yield is one reason. Short-term bond funds, which invest
in securities with maturities of one to five years, currently
offer yields that are around half a percentage point higher
than those of money funds.
   But a bigger reason to consider shifting some money-fund
dollars into short-term funds is that they return a lot more
than money funds when interest rates fall. And despite this
week's rise in rates, many financial advisers say the the
longer-term outlook is still for lower rates.
   "The risk in being in money funds at this point is that
you could see your income drop by 15% to 25%" over the next
year, says Hugh R. Lamle, executive vice president of money
manager M.D. Sass Investors Services Inc. in New York.
"People who are dependent on that income are taking a risk
that they may not be aware of."
   The monthly income delivered by short-term funds doesn't
decline as rapidly as money-fund payouts when interest rates
fall, because of the longer maturities of the investments in
their portfolios. Investors who sell their shares after a
rate drop are also likely to reap a profit.
   Still, the short-term bond funds involve risks not found
in money funds. Investors who don't understand the
differences could be in for "an unpleasant surprise," says
Timothy C. Medley, a Jackson, Miss., money manager.
   While money funds are designed to maintain a fixed,
$1-a-share price, the share prices of bond funds fluctuate,
rising when interest rates fall, and falling when interest
rates rise. Although the prices of short-term funds vary much
less than the prices of long-maturity funds, the swings can
be painful. As a result, short-term bond funds underperform
money funds in some periods of rising rates.
   Indeed, that's exactly what happened in the first quarter
of this year, figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services
Inc. show. The average short-term bond fund returned only
0.94% -- half the 1.89% delivered by the average money-market
fund. (Over the same quarter, long-term bond funds had losses
of 1.36%.)
   The short-term bond funds also lagged money funds over the
past three years. But they were winners over the past one
year and over five years.
   A number of financial advisers and money managers have
stepped up their use of short-term bond investments because
they expect rates to fall. For instance, Bailard, Biehl &amp;
Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., investment adviser, is using
funds with three-year to five-year maturities for about a
third of the client dollars earmarked for "cash equivalents."
   Individual investors who don't have a strong conviction
about rate trends might want to consider short-term bond
funds for some of the dollars they expect to keep in money
funds for at least several years. With a long time horizon,
it's more likely investors will be rewarded with higher
returns for taking the added price risk of the short-term
bond funds.
   Extending maturities can be even more remunerative with
tax-exempt municipal securities, says Ian MacKinnon, a senior
vice president at Vanguard Group of Investment Cos., Valley
Forge, Pa. That's because tax-exempt rates usually rise more
steeply than taxable rates as investors extend maturities.
   Over the past year, the Lipper numbers show, short-term
taxable funds outperformed taxable money funds by just over
three-quarters of a percentage point -- 9.37% vs. 8.58%. But
with tax-exempt investments, the short-term bond funds'
advantage was more than one and a half percentage points -- a
total return of 7.47% vs. 5.82% for tax-exempt money funds.
   Like money funds, short-term bond funds generally allow
investors to get at their money just by writing a check. But
investors who plan to write a lot of checks should stay away
from short-term bond funds. Because bond-fund share prices
fluctuates, each check written is likely to produce a taxable
gain or loss. "It can be a record-keeping nightmare," Mr.
MacKinnon says.
   Some financial advisers decry the use of short-term bond
funds as a money-fund substitute. "Short-term bond funds and
money-market funds are two completely different animals," one
an investment and the other a savings vehicle, says John T.
Blankinship Jr., a Del Mar, Calif., financial planner.
   Mr. Blankinship currently likes the short-term funds as
investments, however. "With a decrease in interest rates, you
should easily get a double-digit return" over the next year,
he says.
   Similarly Mr. Medley, the Jackson, Miss., money manager,
says he regularly uses bond funds with average maturities in
the 1.5-to-6 year range for the bond portion of his
portfolios. Over the past several decades, he notes,
five-year bonds have performed about the same as longer
securities -- and with less variability.
   "Once in a lifetime you'll have a bond market rally like
1982," when long-term Treasury bonds produced a 40% total
return, Mr. Medley says. "But generally, we've found
long-term bonds are just not worth the risk."

   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -- GF Corp. said it and its wholly owned
GF Furniture Systems Inc. subsidiary have filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.
   The maker of office furniture also said its
furniture-systems unit has agreed in principle to sell
substantially all of its assets, including manufacturing
facilities, trademarks and patents, to a private holding
company. The holding company will be formed by Cyrus Tang,
the owner of Tang Industries of Chicago, a $700 million
steel-service concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   GF has had trouble obtaining sufficient financing for
general working capital and to cover the closing costs of its
88-year-old Youngstown manufacturing plant. That plant had
been posting losses of between $9 million and $10 million a
year, because it wasn't producing enough to cover operating
costs.
   In its filing, the company listed total assets of $44
million and total liabilities of $57 million, excluding
certain health care and lease liabilities, which are listed
off the company's balance sheet.
   GF said the agreement to sell the furniture-systems assets
calls for the Tang group to provide new capital and pay off
about $22 million of bank debt, and make additional payments
to GF Furniture Systems during the next six years based on
earnings from furniture operations. The agreement doesn't
cover the unit's trade debt, liability for shutdown costs, or
health and other labor contract obligations.
   GF said its directors have approved the immediate
conversion of GF's Class B common shares outstanding into an
equal number of common shares. The company said the Class B
shares had superior voting power; otherwise, they were
identical to regular common.

   Merriman Is Named

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Savin Corp. said its top marketing
executive, Brian Merriman, was named president, succeeding
William T. Smith, who will become vice chairman and remain
chief operating officer.
   The appointments are effective May 16.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 52-year-old Mr. Merriman is executive vice president,
sales and marketing, at the marketer of copiers and facsimile
equipment, a post once held by Mr. Smith, 48.
   Savin credited Mr. Merriman with fostering closer ties
between the parent's sales organization and both independent
and company-owned sales offices. The executive vice
president's position will remain vacant for now, a
spokeswoman said.
   Separately, Savin declared a dividend on its Series A
preferred shares, payable May 1 to stock of record April 27.
   A proposal that shareholders approved last month allowed
Savin to pay the Series A dividend and arrearages with common
shares. Thus, Savin will issue 415,000 common shares to pay
the current dividend and about 7.5 million additional shares
to eliminate arrearages since November 1985. This means each
Series A share will receive about 1.6 common shares as a
current dividend plus 28.5 shares to cure the arrearages.
   Savin has 132 million common shares and 263,709 Series A
shares outstanding.
   At a special meeting of shareholders scheduled for
tomorrow, Savin will announce the results of further
balloting on four of eight proposals that didn't pass
previously. With the proposals, the company is asking holders
for more flexibility to pay dividends and for the right to
award certain options.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Savin shares closed at 25 cents, unchanged.

   American Toxxic
   Cancels Negotiations
   With Verit Industries

   American Toxxic Control Inc. directors said they canceled
negotiations with Verit Industries about the proposed
acquisition of American Toxxic by a Verit subsidiary.
   Last Thursday, Verit said its 80%-owned LaPointe
Industries Inc. unit, which recently emerged from
bankruptcy-court proceedings as a shell company, had agreed
in principle to merge in a transaction that would give
American Toxxic common stock of LaPointe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Verit said it expected LaPointe to change its name to
American Toxxic Control and apply for a listing on the
American Stock Exchange after the merger was completed. Verit
also offered to help American Toxxic restructure about $4
million of debt.
   American Toxxic, based in Whittier, Calif., is involved in
treating chemical-industry wastes.
   A statement issued late yesterday by Verit, based in
Phoenix, Ariz., described the negotiations as having been
"mutually terminated." But Ski Milburn, chief executive
officer of American Toxxic, said Verit was "trying to save
face" with that wording, which he said was inaccurate. "We
discontinued the negotiations. They said, `Oh, please no,'"
according to Mr. Milburn.
   Mr. Milburn, who said he had succeeded American Toxxic
founder and director Louis Purmort as chairman last year,
said Mr. Purmort had brought the Verit proposal to the
American Toxxic board originally. Mr. Milburn said, however,
that after the preliminary agreement had been reached, Mr.
Milburn had raised some "real questions about Verit's balance
sheet" last week.
   He also said a Wall Street Journal article on Verit
earlier this week presented information that the board
believed Verit should have made available previously to
American Toxxic.
