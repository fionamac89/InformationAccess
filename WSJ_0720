   NEW YORK -- American Express Co. reported nearly flat
second-quarter earnings on a small decrease in sales.
   Weighing down revenue was American Express's troubled
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. securities unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The travel and financial services concern said net income
was $319.6 million, up from $316.1 million in the
year-earlier period. Per-share earnings were 73 cents in both
quarters, reflecting in part the dilution created by the
recent sale of 20 million new shares. Sales fell 4.6% to
$6.06 billion from $6.36 billion.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
American Express closed at $31.25, up 25 cents.
   Although Shearson had net income of $51 million after two
consecutive quarters of operating losses, American Express
attributed the drop in revenue to Shearson. Revenue at the
unit slumped 20% to $2.62 billion, including a 41.5% plunge
in investment banking revenue to $154 million. In contrast,
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. earlier this week said investment banking
revenue grew 8.4% in the quarter. Shearson's net fell 8.6%
from the $55 million in profit a year earlier.
   Shearson doesn't appear overly optimistic about a
turnaround in investment banking. The transaction pipeline
"is fair, and perhaps improving," Shearson told analysts
yesterday.
   Shearson's Boston Co. money management unit, which serves
wealthy investors, had a pretax loss of $11 million on sales
of securities for the firm's own account.
   The news wasn't all bad for Shearson. Despite the downturn
in investment banking and brokerage commissions, which were
off 18%, Shearson trimmed operating expenses 20%.
   "They're doing what they can to reduce the size of the
organization, but it's a huge place," said John Keefe,
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "It's tough to unwind
that." Shearson, which employs nearly 33,000, will rename
itself Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. next month.
   American Express owns 68% of Shearson's common stock and a
60% stake overall. As part of the effort to shore up
Shearson's finances, American Express will acquire the rest
of the firm's common after a merger plan is approved at
Shearson's annual meeting Aug. 9. At that point, American
Express will own 92% of Shearson's voting shares, with Nippon
Life Insurance Co. owning the remainder.
   Earnings at American Express also were damped by higher
interest expenses associated with a $750 million capital
infusion into Shearson at the close of the first quarter.
Altogether, corporate expenses and equity investments in the
second quarter more than doubled to $61 million.
   Three of American Express' other operating divisions
reported record quarters, although earnings at American
Express Bank declined 10%.
   Travel Related Services earned $249 million, up 16%, as
revenue jumped 15% to $2.4 billion. American Express
customers charged $28 billion on their cards in the quarter,
up 11% from the year-earlier period. The number of charge
cards in use increased 7.8% to 36 million, while the number
of businesses accepting American Express cards jumped 14% to
3.1 million.
   IDS Financial Services earned $52 million, up 21%. The
division attributed the increase to growth in assets owned or
managed, which rose 16% to $50 billion. Sales gained 21% to
$561 million.
   American Express Information Services Corp. had profit of
$22 million, a 25% increase, as revenue grew 23% to $213
million.
   Earnings at the American Express Bank fell to $31.7
million. The bank said income from commercial services and
personal financial services for the rich and their businesses
rose 15% to $27 million.
   In the six months, American Express as a whole had a loss
of $300.2 million, or 75 cents a share, compared with profit
of $568 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. Sales
dropped 2.1% to $11.97 billion from $12.22 billion. The
company said the loss was largely attributable to the
restructuring and operating losses that Shearson recorded in
the first quarter.

   Bond to Quit

   Seeks Investor Support
   For Steps to Revive Firm

   LONDON -- Alan Bond will sacrifice himself in an effort to
save his ailing empire.
   The feisty Australian entrepreneur said he would quit as
chairman of his flagship Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., in
exchange for investors' support for actions crucial to the
survival of the troubled Australian company. Mr. Bond also
agreed to end his control of Bond Corp.'s board, appoint a
new chief executive and create a bondholders' committee, said
Peter Lucas, a director.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bond will step down after the investors approve the
critical decisions at a meeting Aug. 9, Mr. Lucas said at a
news conference here yesterday, following a meeting of the
investors. These bondholders have been asked to clear the
proposed sale of Bond Corp.'s breweries to its 58%-controlled
Bell Resources Ltd. unit, and to decide whether to waive
about 25 million Australian dollars (US$19.7 million) in
interest due on securities over the next year.
   The investors yesterday postponed votes on both decisions
until Aug. 9 so Bond Corp. can seek wider support for the
proposed management restructuring. Some bondholders said a
vote yesterday would have blocked the actions, possibly
crippling Mr. Bond's effort to save his deeply indebted
empire of brewing, media, property and natural-resources
interests. He has been trying to reduce the hefty debt by
selling assets.
   Mr. Bond's resignation marks a low point in his fortunes.
"I think it's a demonstration of the pretty desperate
situation he was in," said Douglas Newby, a mining analyst
for S.G. Warburg Securities in New York.
   It isn't clear whether the Australian businessman's
departure will satisfy investors. But investors represented
at the meeting made it clear that his move was necessary,
said Brian Keelan, executive director of investment banking
at Swiss Bank Corp., which has a small holding of Bond Corp.
bonds. "The feeling is that if an appropriately forceful and
independent chief executive can be found, the residual assets
may have a chance." The problem, the banker added, is that
"it may be more difficult to find someone to take on" the
chief executive's role.
   Although Peter Beckwith is Bond Corp.'s chief executive at
present, Mr. Bond "was really very much in control" of the
company, Mr. Newby said.
   The bondholders' committee being created probably will
seek a voice in selecting Bond Corp.'s new chief executive,
Mr. Keelan indicated. Despite the management shake-up, Mr.
Bond is expected to remain a member of Bond Corp.'s board,
Mr. Lucas said.
   Mr. Bond's power over Bond Corp. will shrink because his
Dallhold Investments Pty. Ltd., which controls 58% of Bond
Corp.'s share capital, will limit its votes to 25% pending
the company's reconstruction. Under the restructuring plan,
Dallhold also will be limited to a minority of board members.
These changes, as well as Mr. Bond's resignation, are to
occur within 30 days of the investors' vote next month on the
breweries sale and interest moratorium.
   Mr. Bond found it emotionally difficult to relinquish his
grip on a once far-flung empire that he amassed over many
years, Mr. Lucas told reporters. He added: "It's a lifetime's
work from which now . . . he is standing aside."
   At yesterday's meeting, Mr. Keelan said, Mr. Bond's words
"included statements of regret and apology."
   With cooperation from various investors -- including some
who weren't represented here yesterday -- a slimmed-down Bond
Corp. will survive, Mr. Lucas insisted. But "we won't be the
same organization."
   To survive, however, Bond Corp. also must complete certain
other asset sales and overcome legal battles with a group of
U.S. debenture holders. Bond Corp. has tried to head off the
holders' efforts to liquidate its Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd.
unit by offering to buy this debt back at a deep discount.

   Centex Reports
   Record Earnings
   In Its First Quarter

   DALLAS -- Centex Corp. reported record first-quarter
earnings at its annual shareholders meeting, where picketers
appeared to protest the construction company's planned
acquisition of home sites from the Resolution Trust Corp.
   Centex reported earnings of $16.5 million, or $1.05 a
share, on revenue of $565.9 million for the first quarter,
which ended June 30. Earnings for the year-earlier period
were $15.3 million, or $1 a share, on revenue of $464.6
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Laurence E. Hirsch, president and chief executive officer,
attributed the record results to a 29% increase in earnings
from the company's home-building and mortgage-banking units.
Those units reported earnings of $25.9 million on revenue of
$277.4 million for the first quarter. The year earlier, the
units reported earnings of $20.1 million on revenue of $203.4
million.
   One of the company's home-building units, Fox &amp; Jacobs,
has a contract to acquire 108 lots in a residential
subdivision of Arlington, Texas, from the RTC, which took
over the property after the failure of an Arlington thrift.
Fox &amp; Jacobs offered $1,890,000 in cash, or about $17,500 per
lot, for the property in the Parker Oaks Estates subdivision.
   But the sale hasn't closed because the Parker Oaks Estates
Homeowners Association is seeking a court order to force Fox
&amp; Jacobs to comply with deed restrictions that dictate the
style and size of homes to be built on the lots. The RTC has
joined the lawsuit, which is currently pending in federal
court in Fort Worth, Texas.
   About 15 picketers, representing the homeowners
association, marched outside the building where Centex held
its annual shareholders meeting yesterday. All were carrying
signs protesting Fox &amp; Jacobs's plans for the lots.
   "We've got an established character . . . of a custom-home
neighborhood," said John Ezell, spokesman for the homeowners
association. "Centex hasn't convinced us that they're going
to come out there and build the kind of home that's already
there."
   Mr. Ezell said the homeowners are also disturbed at the
$17,500 price tag that the RTC has placed on each lot to be
acquired by Fox &amp; Jacobs. Previous sales of individual lots
by the RTC brought $34,000 to $38,000 each, he said.
   Centex Chairman Paul Seegers was asked about the
litigation and the protest at the shareholders meeting but
declined to comment. "We're waiting for the outcome" of the
lawsuit, he said.

from May, the Department of Employment estimated.
   Without seasonal adjustment, unemployment was 5.5%,
unchanged from May but down from 6.1% in June 1989. The
number of jobless people on this basis was 1,555,610 in June,

   Unisys Earnings
   Plummeted 78%
   In 2nd Quarter

   Unisys Corp. said second-quarter earnings fell 78% on
lower revenue, but the computer company reiterated its hope
that a strong fourth quarter would put it in the black for
the year.
   The results came in slightly below expectations, however,
and securities analysts said Unisys has a tough row to hoe --
especially in light of the company's acknowledgement that
growth in its international business slowed while domestic
business remained depressed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You kind of feel for these guys," said Dan Benton of
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. "They're smart guys and they know what
they have to do, but they really have their work cut out for
them."
   Mr. Benton's comments reflected a new, almost sympathetic
attitude on Wall Street toward Unisys' woes, which have been
battering the Blue Bell, Pa., company's stock for more than a
year. Still, many analysts again cut their estimate of 1990
earnings, to deliver a new consensus of 50 cents to $1 a
share, down from 75 cents to $1.50.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Unisys shares closed at $12.75, up 12.5 cents.
   Second-quarter results showed progress in cutting
expenses, which dropped 5.2% from a year earlier. Operating
profit rose 36%, to $102 million, and Unisys' heavy debt was
trimmed by $265 million, with much of that reduction financed
by a $150 million sale of preferred stock to Japan's Mitsui &amp;
Co.
   But gross profit margins reversed the progress they made
in the first quarter, dropping to 37% from 39%, "not the most
encouraging sign," said Steve Milunovich of First Boston
Corp. And revenue was hurt by a tough comparison with 1989,
when a new line of mainframes rolled out to pent-up demand.
That momentum has faded, replaced by growth in more strategic
-- but currently unprofitable -- low-end products based on
the Unix operating system.
   Earnings in the quarter were $11.8 million, which
translated to a loss of nine cents a share after preferred
dividend payments. That compared with earnings of $53.6
million, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
Revenue fell 4% to $2.47 billion from $2.57 billion.
   In the first half, the company posted earnings of $8.6
million, which translated to a loss of 28 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $25.1 million, or 50 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue was virtually unchanged at $4.78
billion.
   "We are continuing to pursue our priority goal of
profitability for the full year, recognizing that based on a
seasonally weak third quarter this requires a strong fourth
quarter," James Unruh, Unisys' president and chief executive,
said in a statement.
   Because of the lackluster quarterly showing, Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it will consider lowering its ratings on
debt and preferred stock of Unisys and its finance
subsidiary. About $4 billion in debt is affected.
   S&amp;P said the review covers Unisys' triple-B senior debt,
triple-B-minus subordinated debt and double-B-plus preferred
stock, and Unisys Finance Corp.'s triple-B senior debt.

   Commodities:
   Prospect of Cool Weather in Brazil Spurs Coffee,
   But Most of the Gains Are Erased by the Close

   NEW YORK -- Prospects of cold waves in Brazilian
coffee-growing areas heated up coffee futures prices. But the
rally cooled, and most of the gains were erased.
   The September contract ended 0.90 cent a pound higher at
88.85 cents. It traded as high as 89.20 cents and as low as
87.50.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prices were strong initially on reports that a cold wave
was expected to come in from Chile and hit Brazilian
coffee-growing areas early this morning, a trade source said.
Later, the forecast was changed and the colder temperatures
are expected to arrive this evening and early tomorrow,
according to the dealer. He said another cold wave is
expected to hit Tuesday and a third on Thursday.
   According to Peter Leavitt, meteorologist for Weather
Services Corp., Bedford, Mass., the reports were basically
correct, but "I don't expect any freezing weather," he said.
   The strongest cold wave will be the first one, he said,
and temperatures in major coffee-growing areas such as Sao
Paulo, Minas Gerais and Parana are expected to range between
37 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday morning. The coldest
temperatures will be in the most southern areas such as
Parana.
   "Those temperatures will be the lowest, and the cold
movements next week will be mostly in Argentina and head east
rather than northward toward Brazil," Mr. Leavitt said.
   It is winter in Brazil, when that nation's coffee crops
are most susceptible to cold weather damage. July 15 is
generally regarded as the point of greatest danger, with the
likelihood of damaging frost receding after that. However,
there have been damaging frosts in late August and even at
the beginning of September.
   A major frost in July 1975 wiped out the coffee harvest in
the then-major coffee-producing state of Parana, which was
also the southernmost coffee-producing area. Since then,
coffee-growing has been intensified in more northern states
such as Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais.
   Arthur Stevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities,
New York, observed that the selling, which trimmed the early
gains, came mostly from producing countries, which were
selling contracts to lock in prices and take advantage of the
gains.
   "There also appeared to be some liquidation as it became
evident that there wasn't any damage in Guatemalan
coffee-growing areas because of the earthquake earlier in the
week," he said.
   There was some profit-taking following three days of
advances as well, he said. But, with the prospect of cold
weather on Sunday and next week, renewed demand developed and
helped firm prices toward the close.
   Stephen Platt, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago,
said that contributing to the recent strength in prices has
been strong rains, particularly in western sections of Sao
Paulo and Parana.
   "This has caused concern over possible deterioration of
coffee quality and some yield losses as well," he said.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices were strong. The October contract
rose 0.44 cent a pound to 11.43 cents. No fresh developments
accounted for the rally, analysts said. However, one analyst,
noting the October price had dropped five cents since the
beginning of May, said the market may have been oversold.
There was active buying of contracts by dealers, according to
the analyst, but it wasn't known whether the buying was
associated with transactions in the cash market. The recent
price declines were attributed mainly to the lack of demand
for sugar from major nations such as the Soviet Union and
China, excellent current crop progress and improved prospects
for the 1990-91 crop, according to Judith Ganes, analyst for
Merrill Lynch. However, Ms. Ganes said buying by smaller
nations cumulatively has surpassed expectations for the
season so far and to a large degree has made up for the lack
of major buyers. In the first 10 months of the 1989-90
season, which began last September, 34 countries bought a
total of six million tons of sugar. Ms. Ganes said the German
statistical firm F.O. Licht had predicted those nations would
buy just 6,250,000 tons over the whole season.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices declined. The September contract
was off 1.40 cents a pound to $1.1790. Expectations of a
strong rise in copper supplies and news that Asarco Inc. and
the United Steelworkers Union would resume contract talks
contributed to the easier tone, analysts said. Asarco and the
union will sit down together for the first time since July 3,
two days after the workers went on strike at the company's
mine in Arizona, a company spokesman said. The old contract
ran out June 30. One analyst said the general feeling is that
once the company and the union resume negotiations, a
settlement would follow soon. The increase in London Metal
Exchange warehouse stocks of copper is expected to range from
5,000 to 20,000 tons when it is announced today, analysts
said. Earlier in the week, there were predictions that the
stocks would increase by as much as 10,000 tons.

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of hog and pork belly futures
contracts retreated for the second consecutive day. Analysts
attributed the decline to signs that meatpackers are having
an easier time finding hogs to slaughter. Hog prices have
been strong most of the year because of tight supplies. At
the same time, high retail prices caused by those high hog
prices appear to be choking off demand for pork in the
supermarket. The contract for July delivery of pork bellies,
which are used to make bacon, fell its daily limit of two
cents to settle at 46.5 cents a pound. Prices of most cattle
futures contracts slipped in quiet trading.

games too easy to play. Nintendo, which recently has sued
other companies for alleged copyright infringements, worries
that its customers will get bored with its games if they are

   First City Bancorp
   Reports Its Earnings
   In 2nd Period Fell 30%

   HOUSTON -- First City Bancorp. of Texas said its earnings
fell 30% in the second quarter, marking the first such
decline since the bank was rescued in April 1988 by an
investment group led by A. Robert Abboud.
   The drop in net income, to $19.8 million, or 76 cents per
share, from $28.1 million, or $1.19 a share last year,
closely tracked a forecast by First City late last month.
That early warning took away most of the sting. First City
shares closed at $21.75 in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday, up 12.5 cents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts don't expect the bad news to be the last at First
City. Like most banks, the Houston bank is wrestling with
slow demand for credit and rising problem loans. First City's
nonperforming loans grew by $11 million, to $199 million, or
2.5% of its loan portfolio, the bank said. The rise reflects
continued problems in First City's $349 million in loans to
leveraged buy-outs. Such highly leveraged transactions are
the focus of national scrutiny by banking regulators.
   The sale of First City's credit card business also
contributed to the earnings decline. Mr. Abboud said the bank
was unable to replace earnings on that high-yield business.
"However, during the quarter the trend was favorable," he
said. The net yield rose in May and June and averaged 3.82%
for the quarter as a whole, down from 4.15% the first
quarter. "The decline in net margin is the primary difference
in the earnings shortfall," said Frank Anderson, an analyst
with Stephens Inc., a Little Rock, Ark., investment banking
firm.
   Mr. Abboud said that cost cutting is First City's first
priority. He attributed part of the earnings decline to a
consolidation of operations already underway.
   Separately, Citibank said First City had sold its credit
card processing business to Citicorp Acceptance Services.
Under the terms, the Citicorp subsidiary will take over
processing of transactions made at First City's 14,000
merchant locations. First City will continue to sell Citicorp
processing services on a commission basis.

   U.S. Senate's Vote
   On Textile Imports

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission condemned
legislation passed by the U.S. Senate this week that would
establish a highly restrictive quota system for imports of
textiles, apparel and footwear.
   A statement by the commission called the legislation
"overtly protectionist" and said it raised serious doubts
about chances of reaching an agreement to liberalize trade in
textiles during current negotiations within the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission said the bill passed overwhelmingly by the
Senate is "diametrically opposite" to the aims of GATT's
negotiating committee on textiles. The commission urged the
U.S. to drop its opposition to plans, supported by many other
GATT members, for the gradual freeing up of textile trade
through the phasing out of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, which
regulates world trade in textiles.
   The Senate's legislation is opposed by President Bush and
faces an uncertain fate in the House. The bill's sponsors
have said their aim is to maintain pressure on U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills not to allow greater access to the
U.S. textile market in return for concessions from trading
partners in other sectors under discussion in GATT.
   In comments on the GATT talks ahead of important
negotiations next week in Geneva, EC officials said they were
worried about the chances for success in the textiles sector,
given the U.S. approach to the issue. An American plan for a
global quota system to be set up is "totally unacceptable" to
the EC because it would mean the imposition of quotas on EC
textile exports to the U.S., the officials said. The EC's
textile exports to the U.S. currently are unrestricted, and
the EC would never accept the imposition of such curbs, they
said.
   The U.S. plan also would place greater restrictions on
textile trade world-wide, to the detriment of developing
countries, the officials said. This goes against the spirit
of the GATT talks, which are aimed at reducing levels of
protection in 15 different sectors, they contended.
   The officials also expressed worries about talks in
agriculture trade, which have been marked by repeated
confrontations between the EC and U.S. over the level of aid
to farmers, especially export subsidies. The EC is preparing
to make more specific proposals on how to cut farm subsidies,
the officials said.
   But they defended the EC's contention that elimination of
agriculture subsidies isn't realistic. "Farming isn't
industry. You have to have managed markets" to protect
against uncontrollable factors such as the climate, one
official said.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Europeans Have the Edge

   St. Andrews, Scotland -- Arriving at the British Open golf
tournament here from the Wimbledon tennis festivities, where
a Swede beat a German in the men's final and an ex-Czech
whelmed the women, I found in the press tent a missive from
Sony, a Japanese electronics concern. It bore the news that
its ranking system, which is suitably complex, identifies
Greg Norman, the fair-haired Australian, as the world's best
golfer, and that of the next best five, two are Englishmen
and two are Spaniards.
   Clearly, something has happened on the country-club-sport
front, and it has not been good for the U.S. of A. Our
well-to-do class has let us down, big time. Congress should
investigate. Maybe even George Steinbrenner. He has gumshoe
experience with our Olympic Committee, you know, and may be
at liberty soon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Well, okay, I suppose that's excessive, especially the
part about George. I wouldn't wish him on anyone.
Furthermore, it's probably untrue, as well as uncharitable,
to blame any particular segment of our population for our
athletic shortcomings. Genius of all sorts seems to be
sprinkled randomly among nations and social classes, needing
only the slightest of nurture to bloom. I guess the European
gene pool hit a few winners, golf- and tennis-wise.
   Such conclusions seem inescapable as the Sans-a-belt set
tees off in the British Open, golf's most international go. A
scan of the entry list reveals contestants from no less than
14 lands, and possibly more. (Is Dalmahoy a country?) The
host nation is pleased to call the event, simply, "The Open,"
and it's bad form to demur within its citizens' hearing.
   Many of the players are more than happy to go along. "The
Open is The Open; it's the major major," said Norman on
Tuesday. He also declared "The Open is open," meaning that he
thought just about anyone could win it. That's something
coming from a guy who looks like he never should lose, like
Boris Becker in tennis.
   In fact, though, the Open may not be so open, and the home
team, meaning the Europeans, may have an edge at St. Andrews
in the unexpectedly warm and sunny weather that has the Scots
tickled over their pink foreheads. After all, they know best
the lay of the Old Course, where the undulating fairways look
like an elephants' graveyard and steep-sided "pot" bunkers
wait to ensnare errant or unlucky tee shots.
   "St. Andrews doesn't share the Americans' fetish for
watering their golf courses, so where the ball lands is not
where it stops," noted Norman, the 1986 titlist, who was full
of wisdom this week. "Experience counts for more here than in
other places."
   Norman's assertion was disputed by Mark Calcavecchia, an
insouciant Yank whose opinion must be counted because he won
this thing last year, at Troon, to end five years of
uninterrupted non-U.S. possession of the winner's silver
pitcher. That reversed the pattern begun in 1961, when Arnold
Palmer led a U.S. rediscovery of this ancient event and 16
wins by Americans followed in a 23-year period. Sadly, and
perhaps fittingly, Palmer, now 60, has said that this British
Open will be his last.
   Calcavecchia showed up Tuesday and said he thought a
couple of practice rounds would suffice to refresh his memory
of the course. "I played here last fall in the Dunhill Cup
{an international match-play team tourney}, and kept my
yardage book," he grinned. "They say they haven't changed the
place in 150 years, so it oughta still be good."
   He added: "We Americans are smart enough to figure out how
to get around a golf course. You stay away from the traps,
and if it's windy you keep the ball low and bump it up. I've
never heard that the ball bounces worse for us than for
anybody else."
   So maybe talent also has something to do with it, but on
this score, too, the Europeans are unrelenting. A brochure
distributed by the European PGA cheekily heralds its
tournament circuit as "The Tour of the 1990s." It buttresses
the claim by recounting its members' more notable recent
achievements, including their British Open glory, three
straight U.S. Masters' titles, victories in the 1985 and '87
Ryder Cups and a tie in the 1989 renewal of the biennial U.S.
vs. Europe competition that both continents' golfing
mercenaries regard with surprising seriousness.
   If you count Norman, who used to tour in Europe but now
plays, and leads, the U.S. PGA circuit, the American golfing
slump would be severe, but even if you don't it's still
significant. The No. 2 guy in the Sony rankings is Nick
Faldo, the tall Englishman who'd be No. 1 if only recent
majors were counted. Besides winning the 1987 British Open at
Muirfield, and the 1989 and '90 Masters, Faldo forced Curtis
Strange into a playoff at the 1988 Colonial (oops, U.S.)
Open, and came within a stroke of joining Hale Irwin and Mike
Donald in the one that decided this year's edition.
   "I channel all my thoughts toward the majors -- that's
what golf is all about," avers Faldo, with an eye toward
history that's appropriate for one whose titles include an
MBE.
   And if a longish shot is more to your liking, you might
fancy a shortish Brit, Ian Woosnam. This former Welsh farm
boy, who stands but 5 foot 4 and weighs a chunky 11 stone 7
(161 pounds), has been the hottest thing in Europe next to
the sun of late. He cashed a final-round 60 in winning the
Monte Carlo Open in early July, and posted a 62 in his
triumph at the Scottish Open at Gleneagles last week.
   Woosy stands No. 6 in the Sony but No. 1 in the hearts of
the many galleryites who like to see a wee mon succeed. He is
practical about his aim in golf, which is to "make enough
money to live on for the rest of my life," but says that his
homeland's title would suit him fine, MBE or no, and that a
bit o' St. Andrews wind might not hurt.
   "Maybe a short player would have an advantage then," he
surmises. "A taller player can get blown about and more can
go wrong with his swing. When you are smaller you're more
compact in the wind."
   Makes sense to me.

   BRUSSELS -- U.S. and European trade officials say they're
closer than they've been in four years to settling their
broad differences over Airbus Industrie subsidies.
   But now that things are looking up, a new type of state
aid -- an exchange-rate guarantee introduced last year for
Airbus's West German partner -- is threatening to scuttle the
whole deal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   U.S. trade officials say that if a comprehensive agreement
isn't signed by the end of this month, they will take their
complaint on the German aid to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. They say they may even pursue the GATT
complaint if an agreement is reached.
   "We held off (going to the GATT) in February so that
people wouldn't appear to be negotiating under the gun," says
one U.S. official familiar with the dispute. "But Aug. 1 is
the cutoff. After that, we'd feel free to ask for a GATT
dispute-settlement panel."
   If the U.S. does that, says a French government official
involved in the negotiations, all bets will be off for an
agreement with the Europeans.
   The U.S. contends that such government guarantees of
exchange rates are illegal under the GATT code on subsidies.
The European Community and the four Airbus nations all are
signatories to the code.
   Although the money Bonn will have to pay
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. to cover some of its
Airbus risks probably won't be enormous, "it sets a
precedent," says one U.S. official. And for West Germany, the
world's largest exporter, to give exchange-rate subsidies to
its industry is "patently ridiculous," he adds.
   The problem cropped up last year when carmaker
Daimler-Benz AG took an initial 30% interest in
state-controlled MBB, whose Deutsche Airbus unit holds a
37.9% stake in Airbus. As a condition of the takeover and of
Daimler's eventual assumption of majority control of MBB,
Daimler insisted that it not be stuck with MBB's Airbus
losses.
   Thus Bonn pledged to cover a portion of MBB's share of
losses on aircraft sold if the mark's value is between 1.6
and 1.8 to the dollar, under certain conditions. Aircraft
normally are sold in dollars. The program, which will be in
effect until 2000, would shift the burden back to MBB if the
rate passes 1.6 to the dollar. But if that were the case,
"we'd have to consider whether a European aircraft industry
is viable anymore," says one German official.
   The exchange-rate aid was part of the price Bonn had to
pay to bring a private investor into MBB, says Hans Birke,
Deutsche Airbus's senior vice president for corporate
development. "It is a once-only measure without
precedent-setting effects," he says, adding that Bonn "would
certainly say no" to other German companies that asked for
similar assistance.
   A senior West German official concurs. "There has been no
other application by German industry for the same scheme," he
says. And although Bonn will have to pay MBB something -- he
couldn't say what -- for the Airbus program for 1989, the
amount "does not correspond to our worst scenario."
   Airbus's other partners, Aerospatiale of France, British
Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain,
receive no equivalent aid. But it doesn't appear that they
would squawk if the MBB subsidy dooms a peaceable settlement
to the Airbus dispute.
   The French official says Paris regards the German subsidy
as "a deal between the German government and its industry. .
. . a question of sovereignty." A draft settlement prepared
by the Europeans would prohibit exchange-rate guarantees on
all future Airbus models but would give grandfather rights to
the MBB plan and to all existing models or those now under
development, the French official says.
   The Airbus dispute dates to 1986, and it has blown hot and
cold over the years. In short, the U.S. contends that
government subsidies that Airbus receives allow the
consortium to build airplanes that may not be commercial
viable and to sell those airplanes at prices that bear little
relationship to costs. The Europeans counter that the U.S.
aircraft industry is hugely and indirectly subsidized through
defense research contracts and that the U.S. dominance of the
world airline market is a distortion of trade.

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it is recalling about
656,000 1988-1990 model cars to fix defects that could cause
shoulder safety belts to fail in an accident and, in separate
cases, engine fires.
   Separately, Ford Motor Co. said it is recalling 110,000 of
its 1989-90 model E- and F-Series 4x2 trucks to correct a
defect in the transmission. The problem could cause the truck
to roll after being parked on a slope without the parking
brake engaged, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both GM and Ford said they are telling owners about the
recalls by mail. Dealers will make the necessary repairs at
no charge, the companies said.
   GM said it is recalling about 616,000 midsize cars to fix
shoulder belt assemblies that could break in a severe
accident. The recall affects two-door versions of the 1988-90
Buick Regal, Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Cutlass
Supreme cars, as well as 1990 model Chevrolet Lumina coupes.
Four-door versions of these cars aren't affected, the company
said. GM isn't aware of any accidents or injuries resulting
from this defect, a spokesman said.
   In a separate action, GM is recalling nearly 40,000
1988-90 Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro models that
could have defective fuel hoses. A faulty hose could leak
gasoline, and that could result in a fire under the hood, the
company said. GM said it knows of one fire resulting from a
faulty fuel hose but is unaware of any injuries resulting
from the problem.

   CINCINNATI -- Former Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose was
sentenced to five months in prison for two felony charges of
filing false tax returns.
   S. Arthur Spiegel, a federal district judge in Cincinnati,
also ordered Mr. Rose to spend three months in a halfway
house, perform 1,000 hours of community service, and pay a
$50,000 fine and $100 in court costs. Under federal
guidelines, Mr. Rose faced a recommended sentence of 8 to 14
months in prison.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutor William Hunt, an assistant U.S.
attorney, said he was satisfied with the sentence.
   "The court treated Mr. Rose like it would treat anyone
else," he said.
   Mr. Rose's attorney, Reuven J. Katz, said Mr. Rose does
not plan to appeal.
   Mr. Rose, who holds baseball's record for the most hits,
was sentenced for failing to report $355,000 from the sale of
baseball memorabilia, from appearances at baseball card shows
and from gambling. As part of a plea-bargain agreement, Mr.
Rose paid $366,000 in back taxes and penalties in April and
federal prosecutors agreed not to pursue further charges.
   Mr. Rose's tax troubles came to light in February 1989
when major league baseball began an investigation into
allegations that he had bet on baseball games. The
investigation ended 11 months ago when Mr. Rose was banned
from baseball for life.

   WASHINGTON -- Treasures sometimes turn up in the most
unexpected places.
   In U.S. Government Bookstores, for example, nestled on the
shelves among "Mineral Facts and Problems" and "A Basic Guide
to Exporting," is a 520-page tome entitled "Respectfully
Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations Requested from the
Congressional Research Service."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The book contains 2,100 quotes on topics ranging from
"Abolition of slavery" to "Youth" that the Library of
Congress has researched over the years. The research service
says it gets more than 1,500 congressional inquiries of all
types daily, including requests to verify statements for use
in campaign speeches and debates in Congress.
   Some quotes offer insight into an issue that is on
everybody's lips today: taxation. "A government which robs
Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul,"
quipped George Bernard Shaw. And there's notable commentary
on the U.S. legislative process. "Congress is so strange. A
man gets up to speak and says nothing. Nobody listens -- and
then everybody disagrees," observed Boris Marshalov, a
Russian visitor.
   There are classics, such as President Truman's account of
Joseph Stalin's famous question to Winston Churchill: "How
many divisions did you say the Pope had?" And there are
boners, such as the remark Alan Greenspan made in 1974, more
than a decade before he became chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board: "Everybody is hurt by inflation. If you really
wanted to examine who percentage-wise is hurt the most in
their incomes, it is the Wall Street brokers."
   Trivia buffs will be able to annoy their friends with some
of the book's findings. For instance: Pro football coach
Vince Lombardi said, "Winning isn't everything; it's the only
thing." Right?
   Wrong. Red Sanders, a Vanderbilt University coach, said it
and didn't get the credit. But as President Kennedy, not
President Carter, said, "Life is unfair." (Mr. Carter's
observation was that there are "many things in life that are
not fair.")
   The quotes indicate that there's not much said that's
really new. The library's researchers traced the modern
commandment "Do your own thing" to the 14th-century writer
Geoffrey Chaucer, who put it this way: "Dooth with youre
owene thyng."

   Getting the Australian Ballet on Its Toes
   ----

   After a career of dancing difficult roles, Maina Gielgud
is playing her most challenging part -- artistic director of
the Australian Ballet.
   The Australian WHAT?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Well, that's part of the challenge, the elegant
British-born administrator allows during an interview to
promote the company's U.S. tour, its first in 14 years. She
hopes the three-week showcase, which opens Monday at New
York's Metropolitan Opera House and continues on to
Washington, D.C., and Costa Mesa, Calif., will go a ways
toward dispelling the notion that Aussies and ballet are
about as natural a combination as Mel Gibson and toe shoes.
(The company appears at the Met July 23-29, at the Kennedy
Center July 31-Aug. 5 and at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center Aug. 7-12.)
   The company arrives here on a wave of successful
appearances from London to Leningrad. Not bad, especially for
an outfit that was -- to put it politely -- down at the heels
when the auburn-haired dancer/choreographer took charge in
December '82. The Melbourne-based troupe, Australia's
national classical company, had been wracked by a strike the
year before. Many dancers left during the dispute over
administrative and artistic policy; the most talented ones
routinely left anyway. After all, this was a place where,
according to one local critic, "A dancer had practically to
fall on her backside for the audience to notice anything was
wrong or for the administration to care."
   Older and wiser types might have hesitated. But at 37 and
with just one year of semi-administrative experience -- as
rehearsal director of the London City Ballet -- Ms. Gielgud
saw a calculated risk. What convinced her to take the gamble
were the dancers.
   "There was all this potential in the corps de ballet;
there were seven or eight men, several women who could
clearly make it to principal," recalls Ms. Gielgud, herself a
former star with Maurice Bejart's Ballet of the Twentieth
Century and the London Festival Ballet.
   But there's lots of difference -- and loads of work --
between a promising corps dancer and a principal able to
command the stage for a three-act ballet. Ms. Gielgud, who'd
disregarded her uncle John's advice to switch to acting
because "ballet is too much like hard work," knew she was up
to the challenge. She wasn't too sure about her charges.
   To promote the work ethic she wanted the new director
dangled a carrot -- opportunity. "She's willing to give
younger dancers a go," says wide-eyed Lisa Bolte, a
23-year-old soloist who beguiled London critics in the title
role of "The Sleeping Beauty." Indeed, on the U.S. tour only
two of the four Giselles will be principals.
   Ms. Gielgud also offered the company a powerful role model
-- herself. However demanding she is of the dancers -- and
"demanding" seems to be her middle name -- she's even tougher
on herself. From the start she's been a full-time, hands-on
presence: teaching class, coaching rehearsals, watching and
critiquing all 200 performances a year. Says Noel Pelly, who
became the company's chief administrator just before her
arrival, "Maina works six days a week and on the seventh day
she does her homework."
   To develop the dancers, Ms. Gielgud initiated a number of
programs. She began to import outstanding guest teachers. She
coaxed celebrated artists to serve as coaches, among them the
Bolshoi's legendary Galina Ulanova. She started sending young
dancers abroad every winter to see how other troupes function
(and hopefully to recognize that the grass was pretty green
back home at the company's new $17.4 million ballet center).
And when her proteges were ready, she arranged exchanges with
such premiere companies as the Kirov and the Royal Danish
Ballet.
   Ms. Gielgud also fed her dancers a nourishing repertoire.
It includes classics such as "The Sleeping Beauty" and
"Giselle," both of which she's restaged, as well as
contemporary pieces based on classical technique. Only
recently has she felt the dancers were "ready to experiment
and to be experimented on" and started to seek out local
choreographic talent.
   As U.S. audiences will gather from her "Giselle," Ms.
Gielgud's approach to the classics is, well, classic. No
Wilis on the outback or Albrechts with boomerangs. "I think
it's important with all the classics for the Australian
Ballet to show them in their most traditional way, because
we're the only company in the country able to do them at the
moment," she says. "It doesn't mean they have to be museum
pieces, because I think they come to life through the
individuality and the personality of the dancers." So expect
the dramatic Fiona Tonkin's Giselle ("her mad scene is very
special") to be very different from Lisa Pavane's "pure
classicism."
   "I've never tried to make an Australian school, so to
speak, because I think one of their greatest qualities is the
fact that they can adapt to different styles," Ms. Gielgud
says of the 60-member company, about 75% of which she's
selected. "But I think what one does see is an enormous
vitality and energy, a lack of inhibition and an
expansiveness of movement."
   This dynamism will be spotlighted in the U.S. premiere of
Hungarian Laszlo Seregi's "Spartacus," a dramatic work
designed "to show off the men." Unfortunately, one of the two
planned Spartaci, Adam Marchant (who Ms. Gielgud laughingly
calls "the male principal with the greatest sex appeal"), is
hors de combat with a broken foot. But audiences here will
get to see Steven Heathcote ("our best actor-dancer"). In
fact, they've already seen quite a bit of him -- he appears
as a scantily clad Spartacus in an eye-catching ad for the
troupe's tour.
   And no matter what the program onstage, there will be a
willowy redhead down front. "As a dancer I felt very cheated
if the director wasn't there," Ms. Gielgud explains. "And the
other side is that I simply love it. I wouldn't miss a
performance for anything."

   BUSH LACKS a strong national theme as he plunges into this
year's campaigns.
   With the loss of the anti-Communist and no-new-taxes
issues, the president is likely to emphasize local issues in
his travels for GOP candidates, such as offshore drilling in
California. Otherwise, he will stress such fallback issues as
education and drugs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some national GOP strategists say privately that Florida's
Gov. Martinez is doing so poorly that the White House may
eventually limit its efforts there to focus elsewhere. In
Texas, on the other hand, the White House is comfortable for
now with the prospects of gubernatorial candidate Williams
and isn't planning a major push -- but is ready to turn up
the energy if he runs into serious trouble.
   HUD chief Kemp is the cabinet member most in demand by GOP
candidates; others often requested are Dole, Yeutter and
chief of staff Sununu.
                                                                                                       

   BRADY'S STOCK rises somewhat on Capitol Hill.
   Both Democrats and Republicans at the budget summit pay
the Treasury secretary greater heed, noting his personal ties
to Bush and his role in getting the president to sign on to
last month's statement on higher taxes. Budget chief Darman,
finding his reputation as a schemer hard to shake, enlists
Brady to help court Bentsen and other key Democrats.
   Brady aides, accustomed to criticism of their boss,
delight in reports that summit deliberations on taxes were
deferred because he was out of town. But his newfound
credibility does little to help him on other issues: His plan
to shift jurisdiction over stock futures to the SEC from the
CFTC finds little enthusiasm.
                                                                                                       

   NUNN'S PRIORITIES on defense spending face rising
opposition.
   The Senate Armed Services chairman faces sharp criticism
for his $289 billion spending bill. Republican Wallop
complains it cuts too deeply into SDI and nuclear weapons.
But Nunn's biggest headache is fellow Democrats like Levin
and Dixon, who want deeper reductions.
   Strategists see a series of close votes when the bill hits
the Senate floor, especially on further SDI cuts, on the
Milstar satellite communications system and on U.S. troop
levels. Lawmakers looking for quick savings might also go
after the maintenance and training accounts, where Nunn
managed to fend off deep cuts.
   The House is bound to vote deeper cuts, setting up a tough
fight for Nunn when the bill moves to conference.
                                                                                                       

   NUMBERS GAMES: Democratic charges that the FBI has a
backlog of more than 20,000 unaddressed S&amp;L fraud cases don't
mention that most of them involve less than $25,000. But
despite Attorney General Thornburgh's contention that all
"major" cases are under investigation, FBI field agents say
that in some notorious centers of S&amp;L failures, such as
Southern California, dozens of $1 million-plus cases are
backed up.
                                                                                                       

   MISSING PERSON: Who doesn't appear in Sen. Helms's new TV
ads? Helms himself. The ads, aimed at portraying the
controversial North Carolinian as a mainstream Republican,
consist entirely of footage from a Bush appearance last
month. "I need Jesse Helms," says the president. Except for
the disclosure of who bought the ad, Helms's name never even
appears on screen.
                                                                                                       

   A NATIONAL SALES TAX is quietly promoted by corporate
lobbyist Charls Walker as a way for interest groups that may
be targeted for specific tax increases, such as the
securities industry, to spread the pain to a broader group.
Some GOP budget summiteers discussed the notion with Walker
and have brought it up in the talks. But even Walker says, "I
don't think the time has come yet."
                                                                                                       

   NASA'S NEXT big project, approved by Congress just nine
months ago, already hits major snags. Space agency officials
say that the $1.6 billion project to send separate robot
crafts to Saturn and a comet by 1996 is already $70 million
over budget, and that they may have to drop some of the
experiments they had planned to include.
                                                                                                       

   FARM INTERESTS BRACE for bloody clashes on the House floor
next week.
   Even as the Senate continues to debate the new farm bill,
a House coalition of conservative Republicans and urban
Democrats makes plans to derail costly provisions. One goal:
a means test that would deny so-called deficiency payments to
any farmer who makes over $100,000. Another: a 10% trim in
sugar price supports as the first step in a gradual
phase-out. Peanut subsidies will also be targeted.
   In response, Agriculture Chairman de la Garza and ranking
GOP committee member Madigan appeal for a united front by
farmstate lawmakers and lobbyists. The message: Stop
squabbling and take an all-for-one, one-for-all stand. But
some GOP leaders, including Senate leader Dole, mull a
one-year extension of the current law to put off messy fights
until after this year's elections.
   The administration still favors a five-year bill, but
would accept a one-year extension.

LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)
</IN>
<LP>
   The recent proposal to amend the Orphan Drug Act, now
pending before the House of Representatives, raises new hopes
for thousands of Americans about health-care costs and
quality. One provision of the proposed amendment is that
drugs will lose their marketing exclusivity if they are no
longer rare (i.e. affect more than 200,000 people).
   The Orphan Drug Law as it has been applied over the past
seven years has clearly served the 20 million Americans who
suffer from rare diseases. In that time, 330 drugs have been
developed and 45 have been marketed under the Orphan Drug
designation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We question, however, the current use of the law to
maintain marketing exclusivity for drugs that are in
practical medical terms prescribed for far more than 200,000
people. Drugs used in treating HIV-positive individuals have
been given orphan-drug status even though it is very clear
now that within several years more than 200,000 people will
have AIDS.
   If the proposal is passed, one preventive treatment that
will become more accessible is aerosol pentamidine.
Prophylactic use of aerosol pentamidine can prevent PCP
(Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), a potentially lethal
opportunistic infection for people with AIDS. Currently, only
one version of the drug, manufactured by LyphoMed, is allowed
on the market, since it has orphan-drug status.
   However, another company, Fisons, has developed a delivery
system that is quite different from the current FDA-approved
product. It is easy to use, more efficient and portable,
allowing patients to self-manage care at home. Home treatment
can greatly enhance a patient's sense of control over the
infection and quality of life. By reducing the need for
clinic administration, costs are reduced significantly;
furthermore, Fisons has pledged to sell the drug at half the
cost of the currently marketed product.
   According to the Centers for Disease Control, 945,000
individuals are infected with the HIV virus. Many of these
people would benefit from early prophylactic use of aerosol
pentamidine before an incidence of PCP occurs.
   The AIDS epidemic deserves to be fought on all fronts --
political, medical, and research and development. The
proposed amendment to the Orphan Drug Act will help AIDS
patients get the treatment they so desperately need at a
price they can afford.

   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- MCA Inc. reported second-quarter
net income of $44.8 million, or 54 cents a share, an increase
of 7% from year-earlier net of $42 million, or 58 cents a
share.
   MCA said the fall in per-share profit results from the
issuance of about 10 million shares in connection with the
acquisition last March of Geffen Co., which MCA says cost it
$435 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, MCA said it agreed to acquire a minority stake
in Harvey Comics Entertainment. The Santa Monica, Calif.,
company publishes cartoon characters including Casper the
Friendly Ghost and Richie Rich.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but closely held Harvey was
purchased last year by an investor group led by 25-year-old
Jeffrey A. Montgomery for $8 million; Mr. Montgomery is the
son of Great Western Financial Corp. Chairman James
Montgomery. MCA's stake is said by individuals close to the
transaction to be in the 20%-30% range. MCA's Universal
Pictures is in talks to develop a film based on the Richie
Rich character and the company said it would attempt to
exploit Harvey's characters in film, television, home video
and theme parks.
   MCA revenue increased about 15% to $949.9 million from
$828.3 million. Revenue from theatrical films provided the
biggest boost, resulting from the successful film releases
"Bird on a Wire" and "Back to the Future III" and from home
video revenue.
   Operating profit was down slightly, primarily owing to
MCA's share of a $6 million loss registered by Cineplex Odeon
Co., the movie theater chain of which MCA owns a 49% stake.
This was somewhat offset by lower interest expenses owing to
lower rates.
   Theme park revenue was down, partly because last year's
quarter saw the opening of the popular "Earthquake"
attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood. Results from
Universal Studios Florida, which opened in June and is
getting off to a slow start because two of the major
attractions haven't opened as planned, weren't included in
the second quarter results. Operating profit improved at the
company's New York-area television station, WWOR, and its
50%-owned USA cable television network, but pay television
suffered from the lack of a contract for certain new films.
Those films have been sold directly to CBS Inc.'s television
network and the ensuing revenue will show up next quarter, a
company spokesman said.
   "There's a lot to look forward at this company," said
analyst Lisbeth Barron of S.G. Warburg &amp; Co., citing improved
performance in the music division when the Geffen acquisition
takes hold next year, and the Florida theme park. She said,
"it's got the most potential of any company in the
entertainment industry" and called the stock an "attractive
buy within a few points of 50 {dollars a share}."
   MCA shares closed yesterday at $52.25, up $1.25.

   SEC Inquiry
   Looks at Issues
   Of Accounting

   Focus Is on How to Reduce
   Expense and Complexity
   Of Rules for U.S. Firms

ACCOUNTING (ACC)
</IN>
<GV>
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
</GV>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Securities and Exchange Commissioner Philip R.
Lochner Jr. has launched an inquiry into ways to reduce the
complexity and cost of accounting rules for U.S. companies.
   While, at this point, the SEC hasn't begun an official
proceeding into accounting rules, Mr. Lochner said his
exploration has the backing of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We've got a set of accounting rules that are so
complicated and so costly . . . there may be a significant
detriment to U.S. business," Mr. Lochner said in an
interview. "You end up with an accounting statement which
ordinary investors don't use." He said he is concerned that
companies are churning out more and more information that
isn't particularly understandable.
   Commissioner Lochner already has raised the issues with
members of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
rule-making body for the accounting profession. Mr. Lochner
emphasized that his purpose in launching the inquiry is to
"urge the FASB to focus on cost-benefit analysis" in creating
new rules and amending others.
   Of particular interest to the commissioner are issues
relating to accounting for income tax, post-retirement
employment benefits, pensions and leases. The FASB is
currently considering rule changes on several of these
issues.
   Accounting rules, which often address very complex issues,
are of great concern to companies, because in some cases
their adoption can result in huge costs. For example, a
pending rule on accounting for retirement benefits other than
pensions will require companies for the first time to reflect
on their books the present and future costs of benefits, such
as medical and insurance coverage, that employees will
receive after they retire. The total cost has been estimated
at $400 billion.
   Although the FASB "by and large has done a good job," Mr.
Lochner said he undertook his effort to make the SEC's
feelings known. He emphasized that he would accomplish this
through continued discussions with the FASB, particularly on
costbenefit analysis and coordination of U.S. and foreign
accounting rules. Mr. Lochner is scheduled to attend a
meeting of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory
Council next Tuesday to discuss the impact of accounting
standards on U.S. competitiveness abroad.
   Last month, Mr. Lochner wrote to members of the
accounting-principles task force of the Business Roundtable,
a group of chief executives, to solicit suggestions on how
current U.S. accounting rules relate to "the competitiveness
of U.S. businesses in the international marketplace."
   Mr. Lochner also has spoken privately to chief financial
officers and at least one accounting firm.
   He said that he hopes an outgrowth of the discussion would
result in a greater attempt to coordinate U.S. and foreign
accounting principles, which are generally perceived as less
costly to business.
   The accounting inquiry by the commissioner is part of a
broader focus by SEC Chairman Breeden that is concerned with
the competitiveness of U.S. business and the U.S. capital
markets.
   Mr. Lochner emphasized that he doesn't want to see the SEC
taking over the function of drafting accounting standards,
although he said, "theoretically, the SEC could get into the
business of setting standards itself rather than endorsing
the FASB. I don't think that would be a healthy development."
The FASB is a privately financed organization that is
recognized by the SEC as being the official standard setter
for accounting. On rare occasion, the SEC has declined to
endorse an FASB recommendation.
   The FASB in recent months has come under increasing
pressure from business groups. In May, the FASB's oversight
body made it more difficult for the FASB to issue
accounting-rule pronouncements by boosting as of Jan. 1,
1991, the voting approval requirement for the seven-member
FASB to 5-to-2. Currently, only a simple majority is
required.
   Dennis R. Beresford, chairman of the FASB, said he has
been discussing accounting issues with Mr. Lochner. Although
Mr. Beresford said the FASB wants to support the
competitiveness of U.S. business, "we don't believe financial
reporting should favor or disfavor any particular business."
   Mr. Beresford, who opposed the tighter voting approval
requirements for FASB, said the board was concerned that
"taken to some extreme the argument might be made that we
have to loosen accounting standards in the U.S. to make
companies more competitive." But he added that accounting
standards "to be most useful must be cost effective," and
said the board would be open to considering whether the cost
of rules exceeds the benefit.

   A Simple Compound Is Shown in Tests
   To Block AIDS Infection of Immune Cells
   ----
   By David Stipp

<LP>
   BOSTON -- Researchers here discovered a compound that, in
test-tube studies, blocked the AIDS virus from infecting
human immune cells.
   The compound appears to work like the experimental drug
CD4, which sticks to the virus's outer coat and prevents it
from attaching to T cells, its main immune target. But unlike
CD4 -- a large, genetically engineered protein -- the new
compound is a small, simple molecule. Called CPF, it can be
made cheaply and easily by routine chemical synthesis, giving
it special promise as a drug candidate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The compound's chemical simplicity, however, may also be
its main drawback as a potential drug, researchers cautioned.
CPF has only two amino acids, or protein building blocks.
Such small molecules are especially vulnerable to breakdown
by enzymes in the body, so the drug may not last long enough
in the bloodstream to have much anti-viral effect. Major
questions also remain about its toxicity and ability to block
different strains of the AIDS virus.
   Still, "CPF is a promising forerunner to a drug that
inhibits" AIDS infections, said Steven J. Burakoff, a
researcher at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who led
in the CPF discovery with Dana-Farber's Robert W. Finberg and
Harvard University chemist Stuart L. Schreiber. The test-tube
studies with CPF, Dr. Burakoff added, indicate it doesn't
interfere with T cells' function -- an encouraging early sign
the drug won't have serious immune-system side effects.
Moreover, the studies showed CPF binds tightly to the
AIDS-virus coat protein, called gp120, suggesting the drug
would have specific, potent anti-viral effect if significant
levels of it can be attained in the blood.
   The CPF finding is reported in today's issue of the
journal Science.
   Dr. Burakoff said CPF showed no signs of toxicity in a
preliminary study in which the scientists injected high doses
of it into mice. He added, however, that "a lot more tests"
must be done before the drug can be tried in humans. A
probable next step, he added, will be tests of CPF in mice
with an AIDS-related disease.
   In separate studies, he said, researchers will try to find
chemical cousins of CPF that best resist breakdown in the
body. The compound's structural simplicity should enable
researchers to easily spin out "analogs" of CPF in that
search, he added.
   Dr. Burakoff said a large drug company has expressed
interest in CPF, but no contracts have yet been signed for
its commercial development.
   Like CD4, the new compound appears promising partly
because its mode of action is different from that of AZT, an
AIDS drug that works by inhibiting replication of the virus
within infected cells. Thus, it may work synergistically with
AZT and help fight AZT-resistant strains of the AIDS virus.
   Additionally, CPF may offer some advantages over CD4. The
new compound probably could be given orally, Dr. Burakoff
noted, compared with CD4, which is injected. Moreover,
researchers now believe that to get anti-viral effects with
CD4 in patients, they will need to use much higher doses of
it than have been tried so far in clinical studies. But
making large amounts of CD4 has proved difficult and
expensive -- problems that shouldn't apply to CPF.

year-earlier spending after a 3% consumption tax was
introduced in April 1989.

yen, up 5.2% from a year earlier, despite a 3.6% drop in real
income to 408,312 yen in the month. Families' disposable
income declined 6.1% to 323,224 yen, because of a change in
the quarterly distribution of government social insurance
payments. Spending by independent business owners and their

   AMSTERDAM -- Buhrmann-Tetterode N.V. is frustrated.
   The paper wholesaling, packaging and office supplies
company has remodeled itself over the past 18 months with 15
small to mid-sized acquisitions. It has sold most of its
laggardly operations and reduced its dependence on the Dutch
market to less than one-third of sales. Earnings per share
have grown an average of 31% annually over the past six
years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet many outsiders continue to view BT as a
run-of-the-mill paper manufacturer -- in fact, it doesn't
make paper but merely distributes it, mainly to printers --
and the company's shares trade at a pedestrian
price-to-earnings multiple.
   "I don't think it's normal at all," says Robert van Oordt,
a former McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant who became president of
the executive board Jan. 1. Mr. van Oordt acknowledges that a
low share price makes it hard to use BT equity to pay for
acquisitions, particularly outside the Netherlands. But he
says the stock market eventually will understand BT better
and accord it a higher rating.
   Given BT's recent transformations and the highly
specialized nature of its businesses, it isn't surprising
that the market is somewhat confused.
   The company was formed from the 1963 merger of a
distributor of printing equipment and a wholesaler of
printing paper, both of them about a century old. Since the
merger, BT has striven to reduce reliance on printing
equipment. Despite those efforts, the division that
distributes and services printing equipment, copiers and
other office machines accounted for 57% of 1989 operating
profit, which equaled $196 million, and 37% of BT's total
sales of $2.76 billion.
   Although distributing Heidelberg, Linotype and other
printing equipment has long been highly profitable for BT,
Mr. van Oordt says it would be risky to remain so dependent
on that business.
   BT's first round of diversification proved disappointing.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company moved into the
manufacture of packaging and the wholesaling of toys and
sporting goods. It also acquired two chains of bookstores and
dabbled in publishing.
   The packaging business thrived, but the other initiatives
floundered. BT discovered it was much better at predicting
what kind of machinery printers would want than guessing
which toys would excite children. In the early 1980s, profit
plunged, hurt by a deep recession and the costs of closing a
factory in Belgium. Since then, BT has sold most of the
companies acquired in the initial round of diversification.
   At the same time, it has expanded its packaging
operations, becoming a big producer of air-bubble envelopes,
foam and other protective packaging. It also makes display
boxes for vegetables and flowers and provides packaging for
such items as Pampers disposable diapers in Europe and the
U.S.
   BT also has rapidly built up a network of office-supply
distributors in the U.S., the Netherlands and West Germany.
In the U.S., BT over the past three years has bought five
office-supply companies, including Summit Office Supply, a
major New York-based supplier. Mr. van Oordt says BT is
bringing its distribution skills to bear on a highly
fragmented market, ripe for consolidation. The company sells
directly to big offices in large volumes, bypassing
traditional office-supply stores.
   BT also is broadening the geographical spread of its
traditional businesses. In April, it bought Robert Horne
Group PLC, a British paper wholesaler, for $281 million. That
purchase raised a few eyebrows: Herman van Everdingen, an
analyst at Van Meer James Capel N.V., calls the price
"ridiculously high" at 16 times Horne's 1989 earnings. The
purchase also raised BT's debt to about 96% of equity.
   But Mr. van Oordt argues that BT needs greater bulk in
paper wholesaling to maintain its purchasing power with the
huge paper makers being created by a wave of mergers in that
industry.
   Last year, BT created a stir by snapping up about 51% of
the non-voting share certificates of Ahrend Groep N.V., an
Amsterdam-based office furniture and supplies company.
Friendly mergers are still the rule in the Netherlands, and
BT's strong-arm attempt to push Ahrend into a deal provoked
an angry reaction. "They have nothing to offer to Ahrend, and
they know that," says Hans Koenders, Ahrend's chairman.
   Even so, Mr. van Oordt stresses that he is on good terms
with Mr. Koenders and predicts the standoff will be resolved
before year's end. Some analysts expect BT to give up and
sell its Ahrend stake; Mr. van Oordt says he still hopes for
a merger.

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Providence Energy Corp. named James H.
Dodge its president and chief executive officer after a
yearlong search.
   Mr. Dodge, 50 years old, has been president and chief
executive officer of Vermont Gas Systems. He succeeds Louis
R. Hampton, who remains chairman of Providence Energy, a
natural-gas service concern. Mr. Hampton had held the chief
executive officer post since the resignation of William S.
LaLonde in April 1989.

   Peter Magowan's response (Letters, June 15) to the
Journal's May 16 article on Safeway made very interesting
reading. There is one point on which I would very much like
to hear from Mr. Magowan. He was the chief executive of the
company for many years prior to the leveraged buy-out, during
which time, according to his letter, labor costs were out of
line. Mr. Magowan justifies his action after the LBO as
"taking the painful measures you know are necessary to ensure
the health of the business in the future," and on behalf of
"shareholder value." Why did it take the Hafts and an LBO to
enable the chief executive of the company to address its most
critical problem? If he had taken those actions while the
company was publicly owned, other shareholders would have
derived the value.
   This is an underlying question and argument that has
bedeviled the LBO picture generally. Perhaps Mr. Magowan can
help clarify the matter.

   PARIS -- Air Inter, France's main domestic airline, said
it canceled 25% of its flights today and tomorrow, because of
a scheduled 48-hour strike by pilots and navigators who are
seeking more pay.
   The airline said its small number of flights outside
France and its service to Corsica wouldn't be affected. No
French city served by the airline will be completely cut off,
Air Inter said.

   From Attending Pacific Economic Talks

   Singapore said that it won't allow correspondents from The
Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review
to cover a meeting of the Asian-Pacific economic forum that
begins in Singapore on July 29. It also said yesterday that
it isn't yet prepared to relax its restrictions on those
publications.
   Singapore has refused to allow the Asian Journal, which is
majority-owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co., the publisher of this
newspaper, to base a reporter in the country since mid-1988.
It has refused to let the Review, which is owned by Dow
Jones, base a reporter there since 1987. Reporters from both
publications also have been denied entry into Singapore for
short-term assignments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government said it has refused to allow reporters from
the Asian Journal and the Review to attend the ministerial
meeting despite a formal request from the U.S. government to
allow the publications access to the international meeting.
The economic forum has been launched by 12 Asian-Pacific
nations to foster economic development in the region. Its
first meeting was in Australia last November.
   "As Dow Jones had not demonstrated full acceptance of
Singapore's position on foreign publications, the government
could not" comply with the U.S. request, Singapore said. It
noted, however, that reporters from the U.S. edition of The
Wall Street Journal and the AP-Dow Jones News Service are
being allowed to attend.
   AP-Dow Jones is a joint venture of the Associated Press
and Dow Jones. Late last year, the Singapore government
denied AP-Dow Jones permission to station a foreign
correspondent in Singapore.
   Both the Asian Journal and the Review have been "gazetted"
by Singapore, with the result that the Asian Journal's
circulation in Singapore has been limited to 400 copies a
day, while the Review has decided to circulate no copies in
the country. The dispute stems from Singapore's insistence
that foreign publications restrict their coverage of
Singaporean affairs.
   Singapore's statement yesterday was accompanied by copies
of correspondence between Dow Jones's vice president,
international, Karen Elliott House, and Singapore First
Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who is scheduled to
succeed Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew later this year. The
correspondence followed discussions in Washington between the
two over Singapore's restrictions on foreign publications and
Dow Jones's request that both the Review and the Asian
Journal be permitted to cover the economic forum.
   In New York, a Dow Jones spokesman said in a statement,
"For reasons that are unclear, the government of Singapore
has chosen to escalate its dispute with The Asian Wall Street
Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review. The ability of
the Asian Journal and the Review to cover this meeting is
important to these publications and to their readers
throughout Asia. The meeting has nothing whatsoever to do
with their dispute with Singapore. It appears the government
of Singapore is extending its long asserted right to restrict
coverage of Singapore for Singaporean readers to restrict
coverage of international economic meetings for all Asians."
   In its statement, the government said it had been prepared
to consider relaxing the restrictions on the Asian Journal
following meetings and the correspondence between Mr. Goh and
Ms. House. But actions taken by Dow Jones's lawyers in libel
suits brought by Prime Minister Lee against Dow Jones and
Peter R. Kann, Dow Jones's president and chief operating
officer, blocked such consideration, it said.
   Prime Minister Lee is suing Mr. Kann; Barry Wain, the
Asian Journal's editor; and Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia)
Inc. for libel in Singapore and Malaysia. He also is suing
Mr. Kann and Review editor Philip Bowring in Malaysia. The
suits stem from comments by Mr. Kann, which were reported in
the Asian Journal and the Review, criticizing a Singapore
court's libel judgment against the Review in a case brought
by Prime Minister Lee.
   Singapore's government stressed that the restoration of
the two publications' unrestricted status in Singapore hinges
on Dow Jones's affirmation of Singapore's policy on foreign
publications. The policy includes requirements that foreign
news organizations "report events in Singapore as outsiders,
for outsiders," and states that "it is not their
responsibility to protect Singapore citizens against what
they may perceive to be an authoritarian government, or to
ensure the functioning of a `healthy' democracy in
Singapore."

   Your Money Matters:
   Tax Planning During the Summer
   Could Pay Off Come April 15th

   So you're finally going on vacation. Along with the golf
clubs, tennis racket and swimsuit, you might pack a
calculator, copies of your 1989 tax returns, and your 1990
financial records.
   Summer is a great time to do some planning that could
lower your tax bite next April, or at least make it easier to
pay what you owe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "People wait until the last minute and it becomes a crisis
situation," says George E.L. Barbee, executive director of
personal financial services for accountants Price Waterhouse.
"If you (plan) in July, you get yourself into a feeling of
being in control."
   There are, of course, some major unknowns. Some members of
Congress are pushing to raise the top tax rate to at least
33% from 28%. President Bush himself has backed away from his
"no new taxes" pledge. There also is talk of lowering the tax
rate on capital gains.
   But the pros say uncertainty about what's happening in
Washington is no excuse for not planning. "Work up some
reasonable estimates for what the year is going to be like,
and factor in changes that are likely to happen," suggests
Edward D. McCarthy, a financial planner in Providence, R.I.
   Here are several areas taxpayers can think about in their
midyear review:
                                                                                                       

   INCOME AND DEDUCTIONS: The first task probably is to
estimate annual income and deductions. In the past,
especially before tax-law changes of the past few years, it
was common for financial planners to advise clients to defer
income and accelerate deductions, so they would pay the
lowest possible tax. This year, with all the talk about
possible tax increases, it may be worthwhile to consider the
opposite strategy.
   Tax "rates certainly are not going to get any lower," says
Martha L. Jay, a tax partner with accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick. And if rates go up, any deductions will be taken
against higher rates.
   People who own their own businesses and self-employed
professionals are usually the ones with the discretion to
accelerate income. But many salaried employees have
flexibility with deductions, such as medical expenses and
charitable donations. Estimating medical expenses, for
example, can make a difference; they're deductible only if
they total 7.5% or more of adjusted gross income. You may
want to defer expenses if they aren't going to reach that
total, or push them into the current year if it's close.
   But while it's important to plan, financial advisers say
you can wait until later in the year, when the tax outlook is
more certain, to take action. "It's a matter of projecting
what this year is going to look like, when there's plenty of
time left to set things in motion," says Judy Walsh, national
director of executive financial planning for accountants
Deloitte &amp; Touche.
                                                                                                       

   ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX: A good estimate of annual income
also helps a taxpayer know whether the alternative minimum
tax will be a factor this year. Under that tax, a taxpayer
pays at a rate of 21% but loses many deductions, such as for
state and local income and property taxes.
   The tax is usually triggered by big deductions for such
things as certain interest payments or charitable donations
of appreciated property; calculations are based on a ratio of
income to deductions. Taxpayers who may be subject to the
alternative minimum tax usually want to accelerate income and
defer deductions.
   It may pay to think beyond 1990, however. Waiting until
next April to pay state and local taxes on a big capital gain
this year, for instance, could increase your 1991 deductions
enough to trigger the alternative minimum tax for the 1991
federal taxes.
                                                                                                       

   CAPITAL GAINS: Despite movement in Washington toward
lowering the capital gains tax rate, financial advisers
generally recommend that investors base their decisions on
economic considerations rather than possible changes in the
tax law. Capital gains currently are taxed at the same rates
as ordinary income.
   There are too many questions about "when and if and how"
the rate would be lowered, says Ms. Jay of Peat Marwick. For
instance, she says, it's possible that assets purchased
before a new law is passed wouldn't be eligible for a lower
rate. Her advice: "The investment decision should clearly
govern."
                                                                                                       

   DEBT: Just 10% of interest on credit cards and other
consumer debt is deductible this year, and none of it will be
deductible next year. Mortgage interest, investment interest
and interest on home equity loans as much as $100,000
generally are fully deductible.
   For the most part, financial planners advise paying off as
much consumer debt as possible, as well as converting
consumer debt into debt with deductible interest. A home
equity loan could be used to pay off a car loan, for example,
or borrowing for investment purposes could replace borrowing
for consumer items.
                                                                                                       

   WITHHOLDING: Think about any significant changes in your
life -- a baby, a bigger mortgage -- and adjust the amount
withheld from your paycheck. Overwithholding amounts to an
interest-free loan to the government; having too little
withheld means a big tax bill in the spring.
   Changing the amount withheld from your paycheck requires
filling out a new form W-4 for your employer. The form
includes a table to help calculate the number of exemptions
that is appropriate. The Internal Revenue Service also offers
Publication 919 ("Is My Withholding Correct for 1990?") to
help taxpayers compare the amount they are having withheld
with their estimated total annual tax.
   Don't forget adjustments for state and local taxes, which
aren't automatically made with changes in federal
withholding. Most state forms also have tables to help
calculate the appropriate number of exemptions.
                                                                                                       

   RECORD KEEPING: Many people discover when they're filing
their tax returns in April, or worse yet, when they're
audited months later, that they don't have critical receipts
for a business trip or documentation for a charitable
donation. "Just keeping records is important," says Ms. Jay.
Even a shoe box is fine, she says, if it's a "record keeping
system that's easy to maintain and you're going to keep."
   People who travel a lot should have a system for keeping
receipts and other documents accumulated while on the road.
Mr. Barbee of Price Waterhouse, for instance, says he keeps a
separate file folder in his briefcase.
   Midyear tax planning "gets people thinking about doing
some planning all year 'round," says Mr. Barbee. While you're
at it, he suggests, talk to your spouse about retirement and
estate planning. "Many couples don't get that much time
together, except on vacation," he says.

   Paisley's Lawyers Discussing Plea Pact
   In Pentagon Investigation, Officials Say

   WASHINGTON -- Attorneys for Melvyn Paisley, the former
Navy research chief at the center of the Pentagon bribery and
influence-peddling scandal, are discussing a plea agreement
with federal prosecutors, according to law-enforcement
officials and others familiar with the talks.
   Mr. Paisley hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, and a
final agreement hasn't been signed. But if the talks, as
expected, produce a settlement, it would be the climax of the
government's much-publicized investigation of Pentagon
procurement fraud dubbed "Operation Ill Wind." Some
law-enforcement officials said they expect an agreement by
the fall.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Paisley's attorney, Lawrence Barcella, who has
maintained in the past that his client didn't violate any
laws, declined to comment on any discussions with
prosecutors. "It rarely serves anyone's interests to discuss
whether or not a target" of a criminal probe or his attorney
are "having conversations with the government," Mr. Barcella
said earlier this week. The settlement discussions were first
reported by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
   The talks picked up steam in the past few weeks, according
to law-enforcement officials, as investigators pored over
statements and other evidence provided by William Galvin, a
former close associate of Mr. Paisley. Mr. Galvin, who was
one of the most influential and highly paid defense-industry
consultants, pleaded guilty four months ago to bribing Mr.
Paisley and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
   Federal investigators and court documents have described
Mr. Paisley as the alleged centerpiece of various schemes
that improperly supplied bid-related information to certain
consultants and tried to steer lucrative contracts to several
of the concerns they represented. Officials familiar with the
case said prosecutors have considered seeking bribery,
conspiracy, fraud and other charges against Mr. Paisley, who
was a Boeing Co. executive before he came to the Pentagon in
President Reagan's first term.
   Relying partly on Mr. Galvin's cooperation, prosecutors
also continue to assemble evidence against Victor Cohen, a
senior Air Force acquisition official and the other
individual who remains a major target of the long-running
Alexandria, Va., grand-jury inquiry. Mr. Galvin, as part of
his guilty plea, admitted to conspiring to bribe Mr. Cohen as
part of an influence-peddling scheme.
   Mr. Cohen still works for the Air Force but has been
removed from acquisition decisions. Since his name surfaced
in the investigation, he has denied any improprieties. Some
law-enforcement officials insisted that Mr. Cohen, too, has
been considering a plea agreement. But in a brief interview,
Mr. Cohen said: "I can assure you there is no negotiation or
plea bargaining under way."
   Prosecutors have secured more than 30 convictions in the
three-year-old inquiry, including several prominent industry
consultants, a number of midsized defense contractors and
some relatively low-level Pentagon officials. If Mr. Paisley
agrees to cooperate with the government, investigators hope
to learn more about the role of major contractors, senior
defense-industry executives and Pentagon higher-ups in the
scandal.

   Fujitsu Bids for U.K. Computer Giant
   In Effort to Enter European Market

   LONDON -- Fujitsu Ltd. is negotiating for control of
Britain's largest computer maker in a move that could sharpen
competition for International Business Machines Corp. and
other U.S. and European companies in the European market.
   Fujitsu, Japan's leading computer company, is set to take
a majority holding in International Computers Ltd., a unit of
U.K. electronics concern STC PLC. While neither Fujitsu nor
STC would comment on the deal, which was initially reported
in London's Financial Times, officials at both companies
confirmed that discussions are taking place. A formal bid is
expected within three weeks, and analysts estimate its value
at up to #600 million ($1.08 billion).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fujitsu's bid would represent the first major move by a
Japanese computer company into Europe. If the pattern in
other industries holds, more Japanese computer companies
could follow Fujitsu's lead.
   "I think IBM may have to be a little worried about its
future in Europe," said Mamoru Miki, managing director of
Cores Europe Ltd., a London-based market consultant with many
Japanese clients. Mr. Miki mentioned Hitachi Ltd., which
already has links with Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. and other
European companies, as another major Japanese player that
could move aggressively into Europe. Among other Japanese
computer companies, NEC Corp. already has a 15% stake in a
subsidiary of the French company, Cie. des Machines Bull.
   Fujitsu has been supplying semiconductors to ICL since
1983, so initially the bid for ICL "secures a captive market
the Japanese already have," said Phillipe de Marcillac, a
Paris-based analyst with Dataquest Inc. But the move also
would end speculation about ICL's future and give it a parent
company with much deeper pockets than STC, "which means that
ICL's existing customers are more likely to remain loyal,"
Mr. de Marcillac added. Fujitsu might also use ICL as "a
launch pad for its midrange computers," which it has thus far
failed to market significantly outside Japan, he said.
   Currently, ICL's strength is in mainframes; it is a major
supplier to both the U.K. government and leading U.K.
retailers. It has a market share in the U.K. of about 20%,
second only to IBM. ICL is weak on the Continent, though it
has had an office in the Soviet Union for 30 years and now
has several joint ventures there and in Poland. These also
could prove useful to Fujitsu as the Eastern European market
opens up.
   "This industry is market-driven now," observed George
Verghese, electronics analyst at the securities research unit
of Deutsche Bank AG in London. "Fujitsu has the technology,
but it needed a company like ICL that has the market
know-how." He calls ICL the best-managed computer company in
Europe.
   However, a spokesman for Bull, the French computer group,
said ICL's linkage with Fujitsu might also open up the U.K.
market for other producers. "ICL has always been very strong
in the U.K. government market, almost a national champion,"
he said. "Now, with Fujitsu as a primary partner, they become
more like everyone else." Some analysts also speculated that
the deal could be held up by security considerations, as ICL
is a major supplier of Britain's defense ministry and other
sensitive departments. There could also be political
objections, on the grounds that a flagship British company
shouldn't fall into Japanese hands.
   "There is going to be a certain loss of indigenous
technology, which is symptomatic of a government that has
focused on service industries rather than technology," said
Jane Doorly, a London-based computer-industry analyst with
Dataquest.
   She added, though, that consolidation in Europe was
inevitable because "this arena just can't sustain so many
players with the levels of (research and development) needed
to chase the Americans."
   Possible partnerships between ICL and other European
players have long been rumored, and many analysts expected
Fujitsu to purchase a minority stake in ICL. But they were
surprised by the report that the Japanese company now seeks
50%-60%. With profit margins in Europe shrinking and the
falling U.S. dollar making American products more
competitive, "STC could see they were facing very high costs
to keep up," said Richard Harwood, U.K. head of research at
Schroder Securities Ltd., London.
   Mr. Harwood estimated that ICL accounts for 55% of STC's
earnings. ICL's half-year results, due later this month,
could be disappointing, he added, "because they have recently
launched products that won't be shipped until the second half
of the year. Their order book, though, is very strong." STC
shares were up 24 pence in late trading in London to 281
pence, having soared to 295 pence earlier in the day.
   Spokesmen for IBM in both the U.S. and Europe declined to
comment on the deal, as did Munich-based Siemens AG, which is
supplied in part by Fujitsu. The ICL deal is not expected to
affect Fujitsu's relationship with Siemens as there is very
little overlap between ICL's and Siemens' markets.

   The Resolution Trust Corp. opened the books yesterday on
its $3.7 billion portfolio of high-risk "junk" bonds it
inherited from dead and dying savings and loans. It wasn't a
pretty sight.
   Wall Street analysts said the RTC's hoard of junk may be
valued at just 50 cents on the dollar, and taxpayers could
end up paying for $1 billion or more in losses.

   The government agency said it holds 483 different issues
of high-yield junk bonds, all acquired as part of its rescue
operations for insolvent thrift institutions. These junk-bond
holdings include some valued at just three cents on the
dollar, as well as others valued at 80% to 90% of the initial
issue price.
   The RTC's junk portfolio, one of the nation's biggest, is
filled with "poorer quality issues," Joseph Bencivenga, head
of high-yield research at Salomon Brothers Inc., said. "That
was the preference of portfolio managers at savings and
loans. They wanted higher current yield, and it pushed them
into risky paper."
   The RTC's largest three junk issues by face value are
$75.5 million of Cooke Media Group bonds, $66.2 million of
Integrated Resources Inc. bonds and $50.7 million of Busse
Broadcasting bonds. Traders yesterday said that they hadn't
any idea what the value of the rarely traded Cooke Media
bonds might be, but that the Integrated bonds trade at three
cents on the dollar, while the Busse bonds command all of 15
cents on the dollar.
   Nearly all of the RTC's large holdings are bonds
underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the one-time
junk-bond powerhouse that is in liquidation.
   The portfolio does include small positions in bonds of RJR
Nabisco Inc., Revlon Inc. and other relatively healthy
companies. "But some of this stuff isn't going to be worth
anything," Mariel Clemensen, director of high-yield research
at Citicorp, said.
   Over time, the RTC is committed to selling off its
junk-bond holdings. Yesterday, though, Elisabeth Spector,
director of the RTC's finance and administration division,
indicated she may take a go-slow approach. "We don't intend
to sell these securities for less than fair value," she said.
"Fair value may not necessarily be reflected by recent sales
or offers."
   A few months ago, market specialists feared that an RTC
liquidation of its huge junk holdings could send prices
skidding even further in the battered junk-bond market. More
recently, though, this concern has lessened, as the junk
market has improved.
   "This is a smarter time for the RTC to be selling than six
months ago," Robert Long, director of high-yield research at
First Boston Corp., said. By his calculations, the total
return on junk bonds, price changes plus interest, was a
respectable 5.5% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, $7.5
billion of junk bonds have been retired this year by the
corporations that initially issued them, while scarcely any
new bonds have been issued. "The supply of junk bonds is
shrinking by more than enough to offset any RTC selling," Mr.
Long said.
   RTC officials had debated for weeks whether publishing the
list would help the government's efforts to sell its junk or
hurt the value of the portfolio by depressing prices further.
Ultimately, officials decided that "we needed to get the
information out for the markets to work," said John Bovenzi,
a top aide to William Seidman, chairman of the RTC.
   The RTC's Ms. Spector also said that if the agency hadn't
published its list, negotiating large sales "would have
required releasing a lot of confidential information" to
prospective buyers that could have given them an edge in the
junk market.
   Now the agency hopes its list will spur interest in the
portfolio. Mr. Seidman said the RTC has received offers for
large chunks of the portfolio from "the big money boys," whom
he wouldn't identify. But he said the agency faces a big
problem: Because so many of the issues are so thinly traded,
it is nearly impossible to gauge the fair value for many of
them.
   Citicorp's Ms. Clemensen estimated that the RTC will do
well to get 50 cents on the dollar for its entire junk-bond
portfolio. Salomon's Mr. Bencivenga was a little more
optimistic: He believes it could fetch $1.9 billion to $2.5
billion, or 50 to 70 cents on the dollar.
   To a small extent, the RTC's $3.7 billion valuation for
its portfolio overstates what thrift institutions initially
paid for the junk bonds. This is because about 15% of the
bonds are zero-coupon issues that don't pay interest. Such
bonds were initially sold to all buyers at a discount to face
value.
   But even after adjusting for the zero-coupon issues, Wall
Street analysts expect that the RTC's eventual proceeds could
fall $1 billion or more below what S&amp;Ls paid for the bonds.
Taxpayers will pick up the difference.
   As big as this shortfall may seem, it is just a small part
of the overall tab for the savings and loan industry's
troubles, First Boston's Mr. Long noted. Junk bonds amount to
just 2% of the RTC's holdings. "At least bonds are liquid,"
Mr. Long said. "You can always find some price for them. The
big challenge will be selling the RTC's real estate."
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association, a Beverly Hills,
Calif.-based insolvent thrift that has a junk-bond portfolio
with a book value of $2.9 billion, isn't in the adjacent
table because it is selling the bonds itself.

   TOYOTA CITY, Japan -- A couple of years ago, flush with
the success of its extraordinary two-decade climb, Toyota was
beginning to get just a wee bit fat and happy.
   "We had become a bit self-satisfied," says Shoichiro
Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp. "Perhaps arrogant."
Other auto companies, adds the 65-year-old grandson of
Toyota's founder, "were trying hard." So, Mr. Toyoda says,
Toyota decided "we had to try harder."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That isn't good news for the competition.
   Now, a rededicated Toyota is preparing to launch a
full-scale attack on one of Detroit's biggest money-makers:
the booming European market. There, Toyota is spending more
than $1.5 billion, setting up an assembly plant and an engine
factory in the United Kingdom and a European design center in
Belgium.
   Toyota also has set its sights on the U.S. market for
full-sized pickups. This, too, is a Big Three cash cow, and a
segment the Japanese have so far never cracked.
   Meanwhile, on Toyota's hotly competitive home front, it is
riding a wave of new products. With 13 new car and truck
models rolled out in the past 18 months, it has managed to
hold onto a commanding 40% of the Japanese market despite
gains from a resurgent Nissan Motor Co.
   Toyota's factory workers seem to have caught the spirit.
Plant workers in Japan wear heart-shaped badges reading: "Are
you satisfying the customer?" Banners stretching across the
factory walls shout such slogans as "Good Thinking, Good
Products."
   As Toyota redoubles its efforts, increasing numbers of
auto-industry analysts, including executives of No. 1 auto
maker General Motors Corp., are convinced that the Japanese
company has set its sights on the ultimate industry goal:
world pre-eminence in automobiles.
   Toyota executives haven't stated such a goal publicly.
And, today, they remain a long way from it.
   General Motors continues to produce far more vehicles. GM
built 7.6 million cars, trucks and vans world-wide last year.
Toyota built 4.6 million. Toyota's stated production aim is
to hit six million vehicles late in the 1990s.
   As for market share, GM now holds 16% of global car and
truck sales. Toyota has about 9% and is aiming for 10% by the
mid-1990s.
   More significantly, over the past five years Toyota's
global vehicle production has surged 16.7% while GM's has
slipped 16.9%. In the U.S., Japan's largest auto maker has
moved into a virtual tie for third place in car sales with
Chrysler Corp. and Honda Motor Co.
   If dominance is indeed Toyota's goal, says GM President
Lloyd E. Reuss, his company "is prepared to meet all
challengers as we enter the '90s." But GM no longer has the
full confidence of industry experts in this regard. Analyst
Neal Doying, of Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd., looks at what
the Japanese company is doing these days and declares:
"Toyota is destined to become the world's leading auto
company."
   Toyota's new Lexus luxury car is a smash hit. Its restyled
Previa minivans and sporty Celica compacts are overcoming a
reputation for stodgy styling. And it is building a radically
new sports car called the Sera, with "gull-wing" doors that
fold up instead of out.
   Now, Toyota makes three of the four cars with the fewest
defects sold in the U.S., says a study released early this
month by J.D. Power &amp; Associates of Agoura Hills, Calif. The
Cressida was first, the Kentucky-built Camry third and the
Lexus LS400 fourth.
   Moreover, Toyota holds $15.62 billion in cash, more than
four times the liquidity that once-cash-heavy Ford Motor Co.
now enjoys. As a result, it can get ultra-low-interest loans
and reinvest the proceeds at higher rates. Toyota had global
sales of $55.7 billion and earned $2.4 billion in the year
ended June 30, 1989; fiscal 1990 results aren't out yet.
   Even as Toyota is bursting on the world auto market, the
world is intruding on Toyota's cozy cocoon. Toyota's biggest
problem, in fact, may be a fondness for its parochial,
oft-stifling traditions.
   When Fujio Cho agreed to head Toyota's new assembly plant
in Georgetown, Ky., he expected culture shock, but not to
stay awake all night. Fretting executives 13 hours away in
Toyota City repeatedly telephoned him during their office
hours -- his sleeping hours. They questioned the need for
community donations, second-guessed dealings with American
parts-suppliers and even rebuked him for not using a Shinto
priest to dedicate the plant.
   They "didn't understand this country," says Mr. Cho, the
president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A. "They demanded
to do everything the Toyota way." Now, the nitpicking has
stopped. "Things aren't so new and foreign," he explains.
   Toyota remains a corpocracy, though, conservative and
reluctant to innovate. Honda, Nissan and Mazda Motor Co. all
built U.S. plants before Toyota did. And only now, after long
resistance, are Toyota plants beginning to use "doors-off
assembly," in which a car's doors are removed while the
vehicle moves down the assembly line. This technique lets
workers install interior parts more easily and without
scratching the doors. Although several other auto makers,
including Ford and Honda, have used the technique for several
years, Toyota held back, fearing that the fit of the doors
might be compromised.
   Executives at the Kentucky plant, and at the joint venture
with GM in California, proudly note that they park their cars
in the same lots as all workers, and whoever arrives first
gets the best space. Back at Toyota City, though, parking
spaces still are assigned according to rank.
   What's more, as Mr. Cho's experience shows, Toyota
executives are most comfortable managing things they can see
from their Toyota City windows. As the company grew, it
clustered most of its facilities around Toyota City in
Japan's Aichi Prefecture to ensure prompt delivery of
materials and equipment. This allowed the company to perfect
"kanban," or just-in-time inventory delivery, especially
because hundreds of auto-parts suppliers also located there.
   In the process, Toyota City has become more than just a
place; it's a state of mind as well. More than half the
population has some connection to Toyota or a supplier.
Employees and their families still shop at company-sponsored
stores and relax at the company's huge sports center. And
members of the founding Toyoda family (the spelling of the
company name was changed in 1936 because it sounded clearer
in Japanese) command the respect normally accorded royalty.
The top floor of the Toyota City Hospital, for example, has a
special wing for senior executives.
   But now, Toyota City is a jam-packed boom town with an
acute labor shortage, and major expansion there has become
impractical. Moreover, the all-embracing conformity of Toyota
City doesn't appeal to today's young Japanese recruits.
Despite the company's stellar profits and stability, they
prefer the bright lights of Tokyo.
   Toyota executives recognize these problems. They're
drawing up blueprints for new plants in Hokkaido and Kyushu,
Japan's northernmost and southernmost major islands, mostly
to supply the domestic market. The step was once
unimaginable, but "we have reached the limits" in Toyota
City, says Tadaaki Jagawa, who oversees production.
   Besides, the Kentucky plant's success has eased many
fears. "We aren't so worried," President Toyoda says, "about
producing cars far away now."
   Increasingly, this means very far away. Overseas plants
will spearhead Toyota's program to expand its overall
production. Besides the new British facilities, Toyota plans
factories in such places as Turkey and Pakistan in its
campaign to push its production into areas where it has had
little presence.
   In the U.S., Toyota, which has been selling about 950,000
vehicles a year, expects to push U.S. sales to 1.5 million
cars and trucks by 1995. It also expects to build about half
of those vehicles, or about 750,000, in the U.S. and Canada.
   Meanwhile, Iwao Isomura, managing director for personnel,
is trying to eliminate what he calls "big corporation
disease." Last year, Toyota wiped out a layer of middle
management, mostly by eliminating titles and cutting back the
signatures needed for decisions. Employees no longer must
address superiors by titles. The Japanese characters on all
business cards are now written horizontally instead of
vertically -- a symbol of the effort to create a less
hierarchical environment.
   All this is radical stuff for Japanese executives who took
two years before agreeing with their U.S. subordinates that
the leather interior in the Lexus LS400 should be wrinkled
instead of smooth. But global growth is forcing Toyota to
decentralize, albeit in ever-so-methodical fashion.
   Working at Calty Design Research, Toyota's Southern
California design center, used to mean little clout and lots
of frustration. In 17 years, Calty had fully designed only
one car. Designers fought with head-office officials about
whether to paint sports cars black. The Japanese insisted
black was strictly for limousines and big executive cars; the
Americans argued it could also be sporty. Eventually, Toyota
City gave in.
   "Six years ago, after I got here, I pushed the message
that our styling had to improve," says Robert McCurry, the
aggressive executive vice president of Toyota's U.S. sales
operations. "Americans have long bought Toyotas for their
quality, but now they want more. After all these years,
they're listening in Japan."
   Now, Calty can boast that it designed Toyota's futuristic
Previa minivan, which is already a hit in the U.S. and Japan.
"If we'd done the Previa 10 years ago, it wouldn't have been
accepted," says David Hackett, Calty's director. "The company
wasn't ready for that sort of thing to come out of America."
   Calty also is helping design the next generation of the
family-sized Camry, expected to be a 1992 model. The version
sold in the U.S. will be wider and longer than the Japanese
one, with sportier performance, handling and appearance. So
different will it be that Toyota is considering shipping it
to Japan and selling it as a car distinct from the Japanese
Camry.
   Besides expanding Calty and building in Brussels, Toyota
has just opened a new design center in Tokyo. "We have to
develop cars for each region using the talents of the people
there," Mr. Toyoda says. "They know what's best for their
market."
   The Tokyo design center is a more radical step, in a way,
than the ones overseas. To spur creativity, the 30 designers
who work there are encouraged to take in concerts or just go
exploring. Working hours are flexible, and the dress is
casual. "The values and life styles are completely different
in Tokyo," says Kazuo Morohoshi, a Calty alumnus who now is
the general manager of the Tokyo center. To many executives
at Toyota City, he adds, "Tokyo is another foreign place just
like California or Europe." Yet Mr. Morohoshi's team claims
much of the credit for the Sera, the new gull-wing sports
car, which is to be sold only in Japan.
   While Toyota struggles with global expansion, rival auto
makers are puzzling over how to compete with the company. Not
only is Toyota's market share rebounding in Japan; it's
surging in the U.S. Toyota captured 8.8% of U.S. car sales in
the 1990 first half, up from just 6.4% a year before. With
Camrys pouring out of Kentucky, Toyota is discounting prices
and invading markets it long ignored, notably rental fleets.
Lexus nearly outsold BMW in the first half and beat Porsche,
Jaguar, Audi and Sterling combined.
   The Lexus experience illustrates that although Toyota can
stumble, it isn't afraid to address problems head-on. Last
December, Toyota had to recall the LS400 to fix three
different defects, including one that could cause the
cruise-control system to stay on after the driver tried to
turn it off. The defects were dismaying in a just-launched
sedan costing $38,000 or more.
   Each owner, though, got a personal phone call, and two
choices: Bring the car in yourself to be fixed on the spot,
or have Lexus pick it up at night and return it ready-to-go
the next morning. Either way, Lexus not only fixed the defect
but also washed the car, cleaned the inside and filled it
with gasoline. Some dealers even placed a small gift, such as
an ice scraper, on the front seat. Owners were mollified, and
many were impressed.
   "They went the extra mile, more than any other
manufacturer, to make sure I was completely taken care of,"
says William Beatty, a St. Louis doctor whose family owns
three Lexus cars. "I mean, nobody has ever washed my car or
filled my tank when it was taken in for repairs."

   CHINA PLEDGED to maintain its aid for Cambodia's Khmer
Rouge guerrillas.
   Criticizing a U.S. decision to hold talks with Vietnam on
Cambodia's civil war, and to no longer support awarding
Cambodia's U.N. seat to a three-party coalition that includes
the Khmer Rouge, Chinese officials said they will "support
the Cambodian people in their resistance" as long as Vietnam
doesn't withdraw all troops from Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk,
who heads one of the two non-Communist factions in the
coalition, called the U.S. policy reversal "an act of grave
injustice" and said it would make his group "more firm and
fierce" in fighting against the Cambodian government.

a reprimand of Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat,
for his relationship with a male prostitute, according to a

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed widely mixed as a rally in
oil stocks and waves of futures-related buy programs offset
further selling inspired by disappointing earnings.
   The technology and retailing sectors were hit especially
hard as Tandem Computers and U.S. Shoe, respectively, joined
the list of stocks to be battered by earnings-related
sell-offs.

   But the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which showed a loss
of more than 23 points at midday, bounced back to finish with
a gain of 12.13 at 2993.81. Five of the 30 component stocks
in the average are players in the oil industry; without the
gains in those issues, the industrial average would have been
little changed.
   Broader indexes also managed to close on the plus side, as
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index tacked on 1.10 to 365.32,
the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 0.86 to 339.05 and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.55 to
199.38.
   Declining stocks outpaced advancers by 858 to 621 on the
New York Stock Exchange, reflecting the broad-based selling
that hit the market through the first half of the session. A
midday flurry of sell programs tied to stock-index arbitrage
helped send prices to their lows.
   "A lot of the volume started to dry up when we were at the
bottom," said Dale Tills, manager of institutional equities
trading at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., San Francisco. "There
weren't a lot of people hitting the exits."
   Once the arbitrage selling subsided, oil stocks began to
show strength and the market's rebound got under way. Among
the oil issues in the Dow industrials, Exxon advanced 1 1/2
to 50, Texaco gained 1 3/4 to 61 1/2 and Chevron added 1 1/2
to 76 3/4. Du Pont, the parent of Conoco, went up 1 to 40
3/4; USX, the owner of Marathon Oil, gained 3/4 to 34 3/8.
   Market indexes then turned higher in the final hour amid
index-arbitrage buying, which involved the purchase of
baskets of stocks and the sale of index-futures contracts to
lock in profits from short-lived differences in price between
the two.
   Traders said the buy programs focused on the Chicago Board
of Trade's Major Market Index futures, a target of program
trading earlier in the week as well. The MMI, when active,
has a major impact on the Dow industrials because it includes
17 of the average's 30 stocks.
   July contracts on the MMI expire at the close of trading
today. As of Tuesday's close, there were still 9,606 of the
contracts outstanding; the so-called open interest in the
futures has been rising in recent weeks, rather than falling
in advance of the expiration, as is usually the case.
   Against that backdrop, the late wave of arbitrage buying
represented "just the lead-in to the expiration," said
Christopher Pedersen, head of trading at Twenty-First
Securities. He added that some institutions "are lining up to
be sellers" of the MMI futures late today, based on the
assumption that index-arbitrage buying will allow them to
sell easily.
   Tandem skidded 1 7/8 to 19 5/8 and ranked as the most
active Big Board issue; composite trading totaled more than
4.8 million shares. Although its net income for the June
quarter rose 5.5% from a year earlier, earnings per share
dropped slightly, rather than rising as analysts had
expected.
   International Business Machines, boosted by the market's
late recovery, rose 1/8 to 120. But elsewhere in the
technology sector, Compaq Computer fell 7/8 to 63 1/2 on 1.4
million shares, Digital Equipment lost 5/8 to 82 7/8,
Motorola slid 1 1/8 to 84 3/4 and Hewlett-Packard eased 1/4
to 47 1/4.
   U.S. Shoe plummeted 4 1/4 to 18 on two million shares --
nearly 10 times the stock's average daily volume. Citing
weaker sales at its LensCrafters subsidiary, the company said
second-quarter earnings may fall short of the year-earlier
level.
   Wal-Mart Stores fell 1/4 to 33 1/2 on 3.3 million shares.
Among other retailing issues, Limited Inc. dropped 5/8 to 23
as 1.1 million shares changed hands, TJX eased 1/2 to 14 3/8
and Circuit City Stores skidded 1 7/8 to 26.
   Environmental stocks, especially popular lately with
investors looking for growth areas, ran into selling despite
earnings reports that were in line with analysts'
projections. Waste Management eased 1/8 to 42 5/8 and
Browning-Ferris Industries dropped 1 7/8 to 43 5/8.
   BankAmerica, whose second-quarter earnings fell 12% from
the year-ago level, lost 7/8 to 26 3/4 on 2.8 million shares.
HomeFed plunged 4 3/4 to 14 1/4 after posting a loss of
$108.2 million for the second quarter, reflecting a
surprisingly large provision for loan losses.
   Another California-based financial institution, First
Interstate Bancorp, fell 2 7/8 to 37. The company disclosed
to analysts that the state's real-estate market is beginning
to show signs of weakness and that nonperforming assets at
its California operations "are likely to increase" if the
pattern continues. In the wake of that assessment, Wells
Fargo fell 1 7/8 to 76 7/8, and Security Pacific lost 1 1/8
to 34 3/4.
   American Express, whose second-quarter earnings were on
the high end of expectations, added 1/4 to 31 1/4. The
company reported that net income rose 1.1%, with its Shearson
Lehman brokerage unit posting a $51 million profit for the
period.
   But Primerica, whose net jumped 53% in the quarter,
declined 1 5/8 to 34 5/8. The U.S. attorney in Jacksonville,
Fla., is investigating life-insurance sales practices at the
company's ALW Marketing unit.
   The oil-stock rally came amid news that the amount of oil
carried through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is being cut by 25%
to 1.2 million barrels a day. The prospect of reduced supply
pushed August crude-oil futures up 44 cents a barrel, to
$18.99, in New York trading.
   Mobil climbed 2 1/4 to 65 3/4 and Amoco added 1 5/8 to 54.
Schlumberger, which reported a 58% increase in second-quarter
operating earnings, added 1 1/8 to 64 1/4; among other
oil-services issues, Baker Hughes gained 1 to 29 1/2,
Halliburton went up 1 to 51 3/8 and and Parker Drilling rose
1/4 to 9 1/2.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.22
to 361.84. Volume totaled 12,110,000 shares.

   MOORPARK, Calif. -- Terminal Data Corp. said it "accepted
the resignation" of David W. Krar Hutton as the company's
president and chief executive officer.
   The designer and maker of electronic document imaging
systems said Mr. Hutton agreed to serve as chief operating
officer, a new post, until the company names a successor.

   Richard M. Drysdale, who was named chairman in April, said
he will assume the additional responsibilities of chief
executive officer until Mr. Hutton's successor has been
selected.
   Mr. Drysdale said Mr. Hutton's departure "was a mutual
agreement. Both the company and Hutton felt some different
capabilities were needed." Mr. Drysdale added, "Clearly the
performance of the company over the last couple years hasn't
shown the improvement we would like."
   In an interview, Mr. Krar Hutton would say only that he
"resigned to pursue other interests."
   For the six months ended March 31, the company posted a
net loss of $1.5 million, compared with a loss of $861,000 a
year ago.

   Law:
   More Judges Punish Frivolous Litigants

   When a disgruntled fan jeered John McEnroe during a
championship match several years ago, the tennis pro strode
over to where his antagonist was seated and threw a raging
fit.
   Mr. McEnroe went on to win the match, but his tantrum had
unexpected consequences: The fan filed a suit in Nassau
County, N.Y., claiming $6 million in damages. It was, says
the judge assigned to the case, "a really good example of a
lawsuit that should never have been brought."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But was it frivolous?
   More and more, judges are asking that question about
lawsuits and pleadings. The reason is a growing movement in
state and federal courts to punish litigants who make
frivolous arguments by slapping them with fines and other
sanctions.
   In June, the U.S. Supreme Court gave added impetus to the
trend by upholding a $21,000 fine against a Washington, D.C.,
law firm that withdrew an antitrust suit against a clothing
maker only five months after filing it. The allegations
turned out to be groundless. Such penalties are needed, the
court ruled, as a means "of curbing abuses of the judicial
system."
   But the trend, welcomed by some as a way to help judges
weed through mounting caseloads, is fueling one of the
hottest legal debates today. Judges, lawyers and legal
academics are split over what constitutes frivolous
litigation and under what circumstances fines should be
ordered.
   In the McEnroe case, Nassau County Supreme Court Judge
Francis X. Becker had no trouble finding the lawsuit
frivolous and throwing it out. But he says he is reluctant to
define frivolous litigation or to impose sanctions.
   Lawyers complain that there is little uniformity from
court to court on the subject and that judges are arbitrary
in their decisions. Fear of being fined for raising
innovative arguments or bringing unusual suits, critics say,
will make lawyers overly cautious, chill imaginative advocacy
and constrain access to the courts. Experts agree the problem
is particularly acute in areas of the law that are constantly
developing, particularly civil rights.
   "Today's frivolity may be tomorrow's precedent," says Sol
Wachtler, chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals.
"There has to be a great deal of care paid to {avoid}
stifling a lawsuit before it has had time to develop."
   New York is among 28 states where judges can order lawyers
to pay fines or legal fees to defendants named in frivolous
suits or court pleadings. The standard most often used is
similar to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
which provides for disciplinary sanctions against lawyers and
litigants in federal court. The rule was toughened in 1983
and now requires lawyers to certify before they file a suit
that they have conducted a reasonable inquiry to make sure it
is well grounded, both in fact and in legal theory.
   Before 1983, judges issued only a handful of sanctions
because the rule permitted them only if it could be shown
that lawyers had made arguments in bad faith. Since the rule
was broadened, federal judges have issued 688 published
opinions on motions by attorneys requesting sanctions against
opposing counsel, says Fordham Law School Prof. Georgene M.
Vairo. The requests were granted or strong warnings given in
nearly 60% of the cases.
   Even so, federal judges remain divided on when they should
crack down on litigants, and do so with varying frequency.
New York and Chicago account for nearly one-third of the
reported cases, says Ms. Vairo.
   State judges are equally uncertain about how to handle
suits that could be considered frivolous. Take the case of
Judith R. Haimes, a professional psychic in Philadelphia who
underwent a CAT scan of her brain in 1976. The procedure, she
claimed in a lawsuit, left her with blinding headaches and
unable "to read auras."
   Sound dubious? Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Leon Katz
thought so, but he says he still wouldn't have sanctioned the
lawyer who brought the case. "Who are we -- the judges -- to
determine in retrospect whether a lawyer should take a case?"
asks Judge Katz.
   Last month, two Nassau County men went to trial before
Judge Becker over a fight that took place five years ago when
both were in high school. The plaintiff claimed he was
"sucker punched" in the nose by the defendant. He named his
old nemesis for throwing the punch and the school for not
providing adequate supervision.
   "I thought it was frivolous," says the judge. Not the
jury. It awarded the plaintiff $25,000, of which $5,000 must
be paid by the school.
   "At the early stage, it's difficult to tell cases that are
just idiosyncratic from those that may take awhile but will
sink in on people as truly having merit," says Marc Galanter,
director of the Institute for Legal Studies at the University
of Wisconsin, in Madison. Claims such as intentional
infliction of emotional distress, theories of product
liability and numerous civil rights arguments that are now
woven tightly into law could easily have been dismissed a
generation ago, Mr. Galanter says.
   "If we could go back 40 years, the thought of a black
person at a lunch counter suing because he was refused a meal
would have appeared frivolous," adds James A. Henderson Jr.,
a professor at Cornell University Law School.
   Critics of Rule 11 say they are most concerned that the
sanctions are being used disproportionately against
plaintiffs in civil rights cases. A year-long study of 121
motions seeking Rule 11 sanctions filed in the Third U.S.
Circuit concluded that plaintiffs and lawyers in civil rights
cases were sanctioned five times as often as their
counterparts in other cases.
   The cases ranged from a husband seeking to set aside a
state-court divorce settlement to a former federal employee
claiming wrongful discharge. None involved allegations of
race, sex or age discrimination, and in all of them, the
sanctions appeared appropriate under the rule, says Stephen
B. Burbank, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor
who drafted the study report.
   Nevertheless, the study warned of the chilling effect the
rule might have on imaginative civil rights suits."When you
have a Rule 11 sanction staring at your throat, it gets very
scary when you bring these suits," says Jon Green, a lawyer
at Smith, Mullin &amp; Kiernan in West Orange, N.J., which
specializes in civil rights.
   Most often, sanctions are applied in cases without major
policy implications where the abuses appear extreme. They
frequently involve individuals who are acting as their own
attorneys. A case in point is James L. Cheek, a pilot for
American Airlines who filed a lawsuit in 1985 claiming that
the withholding of federal income and Social Security taxes
amounted to the unconstitutional taking of property.
   Mr. Cheek was no stranger to representing himself. In 1983
he sued the IRS claiming invasion of privacy. Three years
later he sued Cook County, Ill., for payment "in gold or
silver" for serving on a jury. A federal judge finally
lowered the boom on Mr. Cheek in 1986 for his tax suit and
slapped him with an $11,500 fine. (The amount was later
deemed excessive by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago and reduced by $5,000.)
   Another extreme case involved Bruce A. Coane, a Houston
lawyer who was ordered to pay more than $16,000 in fees and
costs last month by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New Orleans. Mr. Coane alleged that he broke a tooth when
he bit into a cookie from a Houston bakery. Seeking to settle
out of court, Mr. Coane used various tactics to drag the case
out for three years in federal court, then withdrew the suit
and refiled it in state court, according to the appeals court
opinion.
   Ordered by the federal judge in the case to pay $9,184,
Mr. Coane appealed. But the appeal judges were equally
outraged. Citing "unprofessional and improper motives," they
slapped Mr. Coane with $6,921 in additional sanctions for
arguing a frivolous appeal. "Mr. Coane's efforts to justify
his misconduct taxes our credulity," they wrote.
   Lawyers who don't adequately investigate whether they have
a valid complaint also don't get much sympathy from judges.
In the case recently before the U.S. Supreme Court, the
Washington, D.C., firm of Cooter &amp; Gell filed an antitrust
suit against Hartmarx Corp., a men's clothing manufacturer.
The suit alleged a nationwide conspiracy to fix prices and
eliminate competition. The problem was the law firm surveyed
only four Eastern cities before making the allegation.
   "{Sanctions} are a useful instrument to make sure lawyers
think more about their obligation to their work," says
William W. Schwarzer, director of the Federal Judicial
Center, the research arm of the federal court system's
administrative office.
   But critics argue that judges faced with frivolous
pleadings have always had the power to dismiss a case or send
more creative signals.
   When a divorcing Long Island couple sued over who would
get custody of tickets to the New York Islander play-off
games, New York Appeals Judge Anthony DiPaolo was incensed.
But even now he's not sure he would have fined the couple. A
better solution, he says, would have been to keep the tickets
and delay a decision until after the hockey play-offs.
"That," says the judge, "would have been poetic justice."

   LOS ANGELES -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
filed a motion for civil contempt against Richard G. Reynolds
for failure to comply with a court order to pay $5.7 million
related to his alleged sale of unregistered securities.
   In December, a federal judge here found that Mr. Reynolds,
an investment advisor, and his firm, raised some $3.8 million
from the sale of unregistered securities. Mr. Reynolds, who
has denied the allegations, is appealing the court's ruling
to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pending the outcome of the appeal, Mr. Reynolds and the
SEC stipulated in February that he and his firm, R.G.
Reynolds Enterprises, would disgorge funds raised from the
securities sales, plus interest. The funds were to be
invested in an interest-bearing account until the appeal is
resolved.
   "The defendants have failed to pay any part of the
disgorgement and have not provided the commission with any
evidence demonstrating their ability to pay," the SEC said in
its filing in federal court Wednesday.
   The motion, set to be heard on Sept. 24, asks the court to
find the defendants in contempt and to incarcerate Mr.
Reynolds and/or assess a daily fine against him and his firm
until they pay the $5.7 million. Neither Mr. Reynolds, nor
his attorney, could be reached.

   Western Europe's Base-Chemical Makers
   Face Tough Hurdles During the 1990s

   Western Europe's base petrochemical industry seems to have
touched the bottom of the current business cycle, and it
wasn't as deep a fall as had been expected, industry
officials and analysts say.
   But, they warn, that doesn't mean that it's smooth sailing
ahead for the industry in the 1990s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Growing environmental pressures, an increasingly global
marketplace and capacity overhang threaten to erode already
tight profit margins for base chemicals producers over the
next couple of years.
   Makers of major base chemicals, such as ethylene,
polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chlorides (PVC),
have seen rapid demand growth and high profit margins since
the mid-1980s, after a painful slump earlier in the decade in
which much capacity was closed.
   High demand and strong global economic growth helped the
industry avoid a major drop after the boom of 1987-88, when
earnings and demand reached record levels.
   "The outlook for 1990-91 is certainly better than we
expected six months ago. The future holds more favorable
possibilities," says a senior official at Shell International
Chemical Co., the petrochemical arm of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group.
   According to price indices of olefins, aromatics,
intermediates and polymers prepared by petrochemical
consultants Tecnon (UK) Ltd., the overall petrochemical index
for the current cycle, which is based on July 1986 equals
100, peaked at 205.66 in November 1988 and began to decline
in early 1989.
   The drop reached a low of 140.38 last October. A slight
recovery is now taking place, with the index at 146.32 at the
end of June.
   Many analysts don't expect prices to soar or drop much
from these levels until the mid-1990s. Some estimates see
total base chemicals demand rising only 11.5% by 1994,
against an estimated rise of about 20.4% in West European
capacity over that period.
   But the main sectors of the base petrochemical industry
haven't all seen the same recovery and don't all enjoy a rosy
outlook.
   Ethylene, the major building block of most petrochemical
products, could suffer from extreme pressure on prices as
major new projects, on starting production, threaten to glut
the market.
   With international demand down, Western European chemical
exports are expected to lag behind import growth.
   One market Western European producers hope to tap is
Eastern Europe, where political changes have opened markets
to Western concerns. Western petrochemical companies hope
growing demand for consumer goods and construction materials
will offset their own nations' sluggish demand.
   But while the potential of the new market is enormous,
many analysts are cautious about the implications of Eastern
Europe as a new trading partner.
   Several of the former Soviet-bloc states have their own
petrochemical plants, but most are antiquated, inefficient
and polluting.
   The other pressing challenge facing the industry in the
1990s comes from growing concern over the environment and
perceptions that chemicals are main contributors to the
depletion of the world's ozone layer.
   "The image of the industry is not a very good one. We have
to demonstrate what we do is good and change the public's
perception," a Shell official says.
   But analysts say it will take major investments to change
the general "anti-chemical" view of the public.

   Panel Considers a Uniform Trial System
   For Libel, Stressing Truth Over Damages

   A proposal to establish a national libel law will be
considered today by a group appointed by the nation's
governors to draft model legislation that can be adopted in
any state.
   The so-called Uniform Defamation Act would establish a
nationwide system for resolving libel disputes by placing the
emphasis on determining the truth or falsity of a statement
rather than on awarding damages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Over the past five years, lawyers have made several
proposals to change libel law. But this is the first major
effort to draft and implement uniform state libel
legislation.
   Media defense lawyers say that defending a libel suit is
extremely expensive. And plaintiffs' lawyers complain that
the current system doesn't adequately protect citizens from
harm to their reputations.
   Under the proposed act, libel trials would be divided into
two stages. The first would be limited solely to the question
of the truth or falsity of the disputed statements. Only in
the second stage would the question of damage awards be
addressed and the media allowed to raise constitutional
defenses.
   News organizations could limit their liability by offering
to publish a retraction and pay plaintiffs' legal fees at the
end of the first stage of the trial.
   Supporters of the draft say libel trials tend to place
less emphasis on truth than on issues such as whether the
plaintiff is a public figure or the defendant acted with
malice.
   "The law is designed to provide someone a means of
receiving vindication for reputational harm. It turns the law
on its head to in effect eliminate the question of falsity,"
says Randall P. Bezanson, dean of Washington and Lee
University School of Law and a draftsman of the bill.
   But media defense lawyers have greeted the proposal with
alarm. In a report prepared by members of the Libel Defense
Resource Center, defense lawyers said the proposed
legislation would allow plaintiffs to circumvent
constitutional privileges the media has under the First
Amendment and a line of U.S. Supreme Court cases.
   The bill rests on the assumption that "what most libel
plaintiffs want is a quick setting-of-the-record straight and
not damages. That has not been my experience," says Lee
Levine of the Washington firm of Ross, Dixon &amp; Masback, who
worked on the report.
   While no one is certain that plaintiffs would settle for a
retraction and legal fees, "the bill would give them the
option to stop" the litigation, says John J. Walsh of the New
York law firm of Cadwalader Wickersham &amp; Taft, who has
represented plaintiffs in libel suits.
   The 350-member National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws will discuss the bill and consider
changes. A vote is not expected before next year.
   Harvey S. Perlman, dean of the University of Nebraska
College of Law and chairman of the drafting committee, says
he expects to hear "whether we're marching along the right
path or if it's so offensive we should change directions or
give up."

   Tales of Trump's Support
   Were Greatly Exaggerated

   Last month, USA Today carried a major article reporting
that a call-in poll found widespread support for troubled
tycoon Donald Trump. Yesterday, the newspaper said, Oops,
never mind.
   The article last month reported that 81% of the 6,406
50-cent calls to a 900 number agreed with the statement
"Donald Trump symbolizes what makes the USA a great country."
The article carried a three-column picture of Mr. Trump, with
the headline "You like him] You really like him]"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday, however, Gannett Co.'s USA Today reported that
"you" turned out to be one person. It seems financier Carl H.
Lindner Jr. stacked the deck in Mr. Trump's favor.
   Fully 72% of all the calls in the poll came from two
numbers at Great American Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Mr.
Lindner's American Financial Corp. Without those calls, the
results would have been solidly against Mr. Trump -- who said
at the time that he was "greatly honored" by the tally and
looked forward to "justifying the public's confidence."
   The initial USA Today article had cautioned that the
calling patterns suggested someone might be stuffing the
ballot box and said that such unscientific polls were
"strictly for fun, anyway." Peter S. Prichard, editor of USA
Today, said in an interview that the skewed results would
make the paper more careful about how it handles call-ins in
the future, especially if anything unusual appears in the
results. He added, though, that the paper, which has done
quite a few call-ins, still feels that they "are a good way
to involve readers and see what their sentiments are on some
issues."
   Yesterday's article quoted a spokeswoman for Great
American Insurance as explaining the calls by saying, "Trump
is one example of the entrepreneurial spirit. . . . We
disapprove of an attitude that we think is harmful of that
entrepreneurial spirit and disapprove when the media and
other parties continue to discredit unnecessarily the people
that are visible leaders of this country."

   AT&amp;T Earnings
   Show a 6% Drop

   In Long-Distance Sales

   NEW YORK -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., hurt by a
slide in long-distance revenue and sluggish equipment sales,
said net income fell 6% in the second quarter on a 2.5% drop
in sales.
   AT&amp;T said it also paid heavily trying to keep up with
demand for its new Universal credit card, which has garnered
at least two million cardholders since its unveiling in
March.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Net fell to $657 million, or 60 cents a share, from $699
million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to
$9.03 billion from $9.26 billion.
   In the first half, net rose 2.4% to $1.33 billion, or
$1.22 a share, from $1.29 billion, or $1.20 a share, the year
before. Sales of $17.92 billion were unchanged.
   AT&amp;T's results were expected after it announced last month
that earnings would decline. Since that announcement, the
company's stock, which had been hovering in the low 40s, has
fallen to the mid-30s. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, AT&amp;T rose 50 cents to $37.625 on volume of
1.9 million shares.
   Despite the bland profit performance, AT&amp;T Chairman Robert
E. Allen said, "We still expect 1990 to be better than 1989,
a record earnings year. These results don't alter our
confidence in our direction or our future prospects."
   Included in the results were charges of about $100 million
to cover consolidations, layoffs and other costs in AT&amp;T's
services businesses, including long-distance and maintenance
and installation.
   AT&amp;T also took a charge of about $290 million to cover
consolidations and personnel reallocations in microelectronic
parts and systems and for reclaiming scrap metal.
   All this was offset by a credit of $400 million, which
came from a net reduction in the reserves set up in December
1988 associated with modernization of AT&amp;T's network. AT&amp;T
attributed the reduction to lower removal and disposal costs
of obsolete equipment. The company said the reduction would
have been even greater if not for increased costs from force
reductions and facilities closings.
   Sales of equipment continued to be hurt by a slowdown in
the business market. While sales of switching and
transmission equipment to phone companies inched ahead 1.8%
to $1.8 billion, other equipment sales suffered. Business,
data and consumer equipment revenue fell 11% to $1.7 billion.
AT&amp;T doesn't break out its profit for its equipment
businesses, but analysts estimate the company is losing more
than $300 million a year on office phone systems and computer
equipment.
   On the services side, long-distance revenue fell 3.9% to
$4.8 billion from $5.02 billion. AT&amp;T attributed the decline
to $100 million in additional payments to the local phone
companies for completing long-distance calls over their local
networks, and a shift by an undisclosed number of business
customers to newer, lower-priced communications services.
   Still, Morris Tanenbaum, AT&amp;T vice chairman and chief
financial officer, was optimistic about long-distance
operations. He noted that AT&amp;T's traffic volume grew 7%, an
indication that it has begun to stanch a loss of business to
its primary competitors, MCI Communications Corp. and US
Sprint Communications Co., a unit of United
Telecommunications Inc.
   "We don't see any decrease in overall strength of the
market, said Mr. Tanenbaum. "And our profitability remains
strong."
   Jack Grubman, analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said the
quarter "was probably better than expected," given that
product sales decreased a meager 2% in a very tough pricing
environment and "their margins of 43% are the highest they've
been in three years." Moreover, he said AT&amp;T's long-distance
volume grew 15% to 20% in the small-business arena, where MCI
and Sprint have experienced sluggishness.

   Measure Aimed at Shifting Regulation
   Of Index Futures to SEC Is in Trouble

   WASHINGTON -- The administration's bill to shift power to
the Securities and Exchange Commission from commodities
regulators is in severe trouble, and key backers in the
Senate are scrambling to find a compromise.
   When the bill comes before the Senate, probably later this
year, it may not include a provision to shift oversight of
stock-index futures to the SEC from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. That's partly because heavy lobbying by
the futures industry and what critics consider a weak push by
the administration has failed to convince most senators of
the provision's usefulness. Moreover, some senators believe
the current regulatory structure is better for the futures
markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Administration officials, led by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, contend that
the split regulatory clout of the SEC and CFTC encourages
stock-market volatility and hurts enforcement efforts. The
SEC oversees stocks and options, and the CFTC regulates
stock-index futures.
   Those futures, which are primarily used by large
institutional investors for hedging purposes, allow investors
to bet on the movement of a basket of stocks without owning
the shares. They are frequently used in computerized program
trading strategies.
   Sen. John Heinz (R., Pa.), a staunch supporter of the
administration's bill, said he is seeking a "compromise that
will solve the major issues."
   Another backer, Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.), said he
was "disappointed" by the administration's efforts on behalf
of the bill. "I don't see any great momentum here," he said.
"The case hasn't been very well made by the administration."
   Some Senate aides fear that negotiations over a compromise
are hurting the bill's chances because they indicate a lack
of support for the administration's proposal. Several aides
even noted that draft proposals without an index-futures
shift are in the works.
   A Treasury official denied that the administration's
efforts have been weak and said Mr. Brady strongly supports
all parts of the bill.
   "Some people have been offering compromises from the
beginning," the official said. "We think the administration's
proposal is what needs to be done." He added: "There's
obviously very strong opposition on the other side. It's a
jurisdiction issue: Those are the toughest issues on the
Hill."
   Vote counts show that the bill would have a tough time
passing if the Senate voted today. But a huge number of
senators haven't made a decision about the administration's
proposal. A compromise clearly would give them two benefits.
First, it would relieve the senators of having to learn the
nuances of complex markets, and second, it would allow them
to tell constituents that they voted against volatility.
   The draft bills specifically focus on one of the
administration bill's key proposalsgranting oversight of
futures margins to a federal agency. Currently, margins --
the good-faith money needed to trade futures -- are set by
the exchanges and can't be changed by the CFTC or any
regulator except in emergencies. Messrs. Breeden and Brady
contend that low margins in the futures markets helped
exacerbate the market drops of October 1987 and October 1989.
They contend that unless federal oversight of margins is
ordered by Congress, the futures exchanges will once again
bring them down to what Mr. Breeden calls "dangerously low
levels."
   Mr. Breeden appears to be focusing almost exclusively on
the margin question. In testimony yesterday before the Senate
Banking Committee, Mr. Breeden repeatedly decried "excess
leverage" in the futures markets that he said threatened the
stock investments of 50 million Americans.
   Senate staffers said the compromise measure also will
focus on a clause in the Commodity Exchange Act that requires
any new product with elements of futures contracts to be
traded on a futures exchange and regulated by the CFTC.
   Sen. Wirth also criticized the White House's renomination
of Wendy Gramm as CFTC chairman. "The single most important
statement they are making is reappointing the person" who
most staunchly opposes a shift of jurisdiction, he said.
   In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Breeden expressed caution
about the proposed stock transfer excise tax, which would put
a 0.15% surcharge on the sale of investments. Although it
hasn't been brought up at the summit table, the proposal is
one of several being discussed by the administration and
Capitol Hill leaders currently negotiating budget accords.
   Mr. Breeden refused to criticize the excise tax
explicitly, but he told senators, "We have to be
extraordinarily careful in creating taxes on capital
formation." Saying that U.S. securities taxes are higher than
those in many other countries, Mr. Breeden said he is
concerned about taking "steps to drive trading offshore."

   The Shining Path Fights On in Peru

   LIMA -- On June 4, I was among a group of journalists who
were told that the war against the Shining Path ("Sendero
Luminoso") guerrillas had almost been won. Lucky punches
sometimes win wars, and maybe this was the case. We had been
allowed into a "safe house" that, according to Interior
Minister Agustin Mantilla, had been used as headquarters by
the leaders of the Marxist guerrilla movement. The police had
discovered the house in one of Lima's affluent neighborhoods
just two days earlier. This was the underground
organization's central nervous system, commented
investigative Police Chief Fernando Reyes Roca, a short man
who is a consummate bureaucratic survivor. Interior Ministry
spokesman Fernando Yavera joked that this find was going to
put Shining Path watchers (such as myself) out of business.
   Alas, as it turned out this was not the rebel
organization's headquarters, nor its central nervous system,
but more of an archive and memorabilia repository.
Nevertheless, it was a very important and unexpected police
coup against the Shining Path -- one that probably could have
brought dramatic results if President Alan Garcia had not
decided to make public the operation so soon after the first
police intervention, in order to score a quick propaganda
gain. This impulsiveness gave full warning to the guerrillas'
entire clandestine apparatus, allowing them to limit
considerably the damage inflicted on them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As Alberto Fujimori prepares to take over as Peru's next
president on July 28, the question of whether the Shining
Path will hound his administration as it has the previous two
ranks high among his concerns. Among Shining Path watchers
("Senderlogos") there is strong disagreement on fundamentals:
Is the Shining Path getting stronger or weaker? Is it making
progress or losing ground among the population? And finally,
who is actually winning the war? There are no easy answers.
   There is not much of a dispute on the basic data, however.
The Shining Path went to war in 1980, on the same day Peru
was holding general elections after 12 years of a military
dictatorship. Its first actions were cautious, modest and
often ludicrous in a crazy way (like hanging dogs from
lampposts, with scribbled insults over them to Chinese
Communist martyrs). But the actions intensified and soon
became quite lethal.
   While President Fernando Belaunde's regime did what it
could to maintain democratic legality at first, it was quite
unprepared to deal with any insurgency -- especially with one
that had been meticulously planned and organized several
years before the first shot was fired.
   In October 1981, emergency laws were imposed for the first
time on part of Peru; they covered only 2% of the population.
Now about 50% of all Peruvians live under emergency law. In
10 years, the war between the Shining Path and the government
has cost about 20,000 lives. Damages are estimated at $16
billion, or about 85% of Peru's annual gross national
product.
   If the armed forces have been rightly accused of
systematic violations of human rights (Peru ranks as one of
the world's worst human-rights offenders), the military
faults the civilian authorities for failing to provide
much-needed leadership. Mr. Belaunde (the first to deal with
the problem), who tried to ignore the insurgency out of
existence, is regarded as a well-meaning but inept leader.
   There are no kind words for Mr. Garcia, on the other hand.
In the first weeks of his mandate, he made several right
moves -- like emphasizing his role as commander in chief of
the armed forces and reorganizing the corruption-ridden
police. But things began to unravel soon after. At first, he
tried a liberal approach, looking for a dialogue with the
fanatical Shining Path, and sending scores of young
professionals to the emergency areas to attack what he said
were the "root causes" of the insurgency. But dialogue was
disdainfully rejected: Dozens of these professionals were
assassinated, and the armed forces slowed down their actions,
while the rebels made largely unimpeded progress.
   Then, Mr. Garcia tried a tougher approach, and
human-rights violations surged to their current level. And
for the first time, death squads -- linked by some analysts
to Mr. Garcia's APRA Party -- began to contribute to the
killing. Midpoint during his term, Mr. Garcia lost all hope
of defeating the Shining Path, and decided just to coexist
with it, says Rafael Merino, a respected analyst on security
matters.
   Not even in that was Mr. Garcia successful, as violence
climbed steadily during the second half of his term. In 1988,
1,986 people were killed as a result of insurgent or
counterinsurgent actions; in 1989, 3,198 were killed; and
1,730 during the first six months of 1990.
   How well is Mr. Fujimori expected to deal with the
insurgency? His campaign pitch advocated an approach closely
resembling that of Mr. Garcia's first year. According to
Francisco Loayza, Mr. Fujimori's adviser on internal-security
matters, military actions against the Shining Path should be
subordinated to economic-development initiatives. "{The
military} should mainly provide security for development
projects," Mr. Loayza says. He stressed that the main thrust
of Mr. Fujimori's "pacification" policies would be to address
the "structural violence {read: social injustice} that makes
subversion possible." Mr. Loayza says that President Garcia's
approach failed because of corruption and ineptitude. He also
feels that the Shining Path is weakened, and that an
important Shining Path faction would be willing to engage in
peace talks.
   This is only wishful thinking, according to Mr. Merino:
"If President Fujimori thinks he'll finish the war through
those `pacification' policies, it will be like riding into
battle with no better dress or weapons than a tuxedo."
   Actually, Mr. Fujimori might end up implementing internal
war policies that would be quite different from those
advocated during his campaign. At least, that's what seems is
going to happen with the economy, where the vote-getting
populist message appears in the process of being replaced by
a far more orthodox approach. Free-market economist Hernando
de Soto, who has been advising Mr. Fujimori during the past
month, thinks that might be the case. "He learns fast," Mr.
de Soto told me recently, "and he has all the right
instincts."
   Even if Mr. Fujimori proves to be a quick learner, he will
have his work cut out for him. Running against all major
trends of contemporary history, the insurgents have followed
Shining Path founder Abimael Guzman with the commitment that
the faithful reserve for their prophet. This was evident when
walking through their safe house in Lima. It looked, said a
Peruvian journalist, like the seed for the future "Museum of
the Revolution" -- wood carvings; woven baskets; tapestries;
paintings; chiseled stone; all meticulously, lovingly crafted
with the mythified motifs of the internal war. There were
also the hagiographic representations of Mr. Guzman himself,
in the various postures that endeavored to combine the heroic
with the intellectual. A whole closed, inbred culture,
developed in the underground and unnoticed by most Peruvians
-- except when it explodes in their faces.

   BETHESDA, Md. -- It is a day like many others in the
search for a cancer cure: Steven A. Rosenberg will take two
steps forward and one step back -- if he's lucky.
   At the National Institutes of Health hospital here, the
prominent researcher approaches a middle-aged man sitting up
in bed. "We think we've got some excellent cells for you," he
says. "Yes sir," the patient, a military officer, snaps.
"I've been waiting a long time for this." Nurses hook up
intravenous tubes to the man's arms, and let flow a milky
fluid containing 200 billion immune cells that were harvested
from the man's body and steeped in interleukin-2 to enhance
their cancer-fighting power. (Within two months, his
metastatic melanoma -- a rampant and fatal skin cancer --
regresses 80%. But it doesn't disappear.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Down the hall, a young woman and her parents meet with Dr.
Rosenberg, who explains that his unorthodox treatment carries
a 1% mortality risk, with no guarantee her melanoma will
respond. "But I will," she insists. "She's our diamond in the
rough, doctor," her mother appeals, her eyes bright with
pain. Dr. Rosenberg, the chief surgeon at the National Cancer
Institute, accepts the woman into his program. (Her immune
cells mysteriously refuse to grow, however, and the treatment
fails.)
   So it is that, five years after headlines in magazines and
newspapers across the U.S. proclaimed Dr. Rosenberg's work a
"Cancer Breakthrough," there is no breakthrough. Dr.
Rosenberg became something of a media darling when his work
with interleukin-2 became public. But for all the elegant
clinical tests in hundreds of patients, no miracle has yet
been found to stop the nearly 500,000 cancer deaths a year in
this country.
   Instead, there have been slow, incremental steps in
treating the disease. "This is research, not a cure," says
Nathaniel Berlin, a cancer specialist at the University of
Miami Medical School who recruited Dr. Rosenberg to the
National Cancer Institute in 1974.
   Still, while public expectations may have been raised too
high in the early days, Dr. Rosenberg's treatments have
brought undeniable, if modest, help to certain cancer
patients once classed as incurable. They have shrunk tumors
in 25% to 50% of kidney cancer and melanoma patients for whom
all conventional treatments had failed. And though gains are
often partial and temporary, the treatment has caused total
remission in a few patients.
   Now, Dr. Rosenberg is hoping that, later this month, two
new developments will advance his work further. First, Dr.
Rosenberg will ask the National Institutes of Health to
approve a plan to add a new gene therapy to his current
experimental treatments. And second, a Food and Drug
Administration panel will begin considering market approval
for interleukin-2, a protein made by Cetus Corp. that Dr.
Rosenberg uses to propagate immune cells and make them more
potent. So far, it has been approved only for experimental
use; FDA approval would broaden its availability.
   "I'll do whatever it takes," the intense Dr. Rosenberg
says. "It's clear surgery isn't enough," nor are chemotherapy
or radiation, which kill good cells with the bad. His
immunotherapy approach, on the other hand, can rally the
patient's own immune system "and strengthen the body so it
can win the battle against cancer," he insists.
   Dr. Rosenberg's daring experiments and his list of
prominent patients, such as Ronald Reagan, have prompted
admiration and envy from his colleagues. Among his private
patrons is Armand Hammer, the chairman of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., who has backed Dr. Rosenberg's work like a
modern-day Medici, helping make his research the best funded
in the field.
   The 49-year-old physician-researcher, who was born in New
York and educated at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, made his
first crude attempt at immunotherapy in 1968, when he was
still a surgical trainee. While performing a routine
gallbladder operation at the Roxbury, Mass., Veteran's
Administration Hospital, he met a patient who 12 years before
had beaten a terminal stomach cancer. Believing the
spontaneous remission stemmed from a potent immune defense,
he tried giving a second cancer patient a transfusion of the
survivor's blood. The experiment failed. He pressed on with
his research, using pig lymphocytes, or white blood cells,
but this failed, too.
   His immune treatments languished until the 1976 discovery
of interleukin-2 by National Cancer Institute colleagues, and
its large-scale synthesis by Cetus, of Emeryville, Calif.
Armed with the protein, Dr. Rosenberg was able to begin
growing cancer-fighting blood cells by the billions outside
the body.
   However, his first 39 patients on IL-2 alone failed to
respond. Likewise, patients infused with lymphokine activated
killer (LAK) white cells steeped in IL-2 went on to die of
their cancer. But when he put the two agents together in
infusions, there was a different response.
   First, a tumor in a man with colon cancer shrank. Then, in
a case that elated the Rosenberg team, a 34-year-old female
Naval intelligence officer, whose melanoma had shortened her
life expectancy to three months, experienced total remission.
   The treatment was very toxic, however. The Naval
commander, who stands just 5 feet, 2 inches tall, gained 50
pounds of liquid weight from water retention and blacked out
during infusions. "Did you ever see the movie
`Ghostbusters'?" the woman, who asked not to be named, asks.
"Well, I looked like Mr. Stay-Puft, the giant marshmallow
man."
   Less sturdy patients have died from side effects, though
Dr. Rosenberg's claim of a 1% mortality rate compares
favorably with the 5% death rate from some aggressive
chemotherapies. The Naval officer rode out the side effects
and, over the next few months, her tumors began to dissolve.
She recently celebrated the fifth anniversary of her
remission, and is cancer free.
   Another success story is Kathy Donohue, a 34-year-old
professional with advanced lymph cancer. She had failed five
different chemotherapy regimens and was near death when she
came to Dr. Rosenberg as a last resort.
   The IL-2-LAK treatment would take its toll: Ms. Donohue's
blood pressure plunged, she swelled grotesquely and had to be
admitted to intensive care. Yet, she says, "I had the feeling
the {treatments} were working with my body instead of against
it."
   At one point, she was wheeled into surgery grand rounds on
a stretcher to describe to 200 NCI researchers how the
treatment felt. "I told them blinking my eyes was an effort.
It was like being hit by a Mack truck." Over the course of
five treatments, her solid tumors vanished. Because her bone
marrow has never cleared of microscopic cancer traces, she
has had recurrences. But she also experiences longer and
longer well periods between treatments, and at one point went
two years without a recurrence. She surprised everyone.
   "One {family} doctor saw me and said, `You're not dead
yet?'" she says.
   Some researchers, however, have doubts about the
treatment. Most prominent among them is Charles Moertel, a
professor at the Mayo Clinic. His skepticism turned to rage
five years ago during the wave of uncritical publicity about
the work.
   "Anecdotes don't count in our business," he says. "The
American public is very vulnerable, and you've got to have
proof before we can assume a position of advocacy in the
press." He claims he has achieved equally dramatic tumor
shrinkage using the ulcer drug Tagamet. Besides, he adds,
"Tumor shrink rates vary all over the map."
   True enough, Dr. Rosenberg's IL-2-LAK success stories are
rare. Only one patient in 10 enjoys complete remission. And
all too often the recoveries are temporary.
   These limited results led the Rosenberg team back to the
lab to concoct a second-generation treatment. Instead of
simply using common white blood cells steeped in the IL-2
protein, he now goes right to the scene of the cancer to find
a more potent weapon.
   Under this treatment, called IL-2-TIL for
"tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes," doctors harvest cells that
are already fighting the tumor, bathe them in IL-2 until they
number in the hundreds of billions, and then reinfuse them
into the patient.
   In lab and animal tests, this strategy looked 100 times
more potent. But in people, the gains fell short of
expectations. Of 50 melanoma patients put on the treatment,
half showed some tumor shrinkage. However, the rate of
complete remission remains stuck at 10%. Though Dr. Rosenberg
says he is undeterred, even his biggest supporters are
disappointed.
   "I don't think TILs have been as effective as I thought
they'd be," admits Vincent T. DeVita, former NCI director and
now physician-in-chief at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center. But he adds: "The worst thing we could do
would be to say it's a failure, and let's drop it."
   "There's something there," adds Ronald Levy, a Stanford
University cancer researcher. "I think everybody wishes the
results were better, given the money and publicity it's
received." But, he says, "we ought to magnify our leads, not
shoot them down."
   Now, Dr. Rosenberg is preparing to face regulatory
scrutiny of a proposed third-generation treatment: gene
therapy. He and collaborator William French Anderson, a
gene-therapy pioneer at NIH, propose to splice into immune
cells the gene for tumor-necrosis factor, a protein that
kills tumor cells. While the agent can cause the body to
begin wasting away when administered generally, the two
believe that having immune cells deliver tumor-necrosis
factor directly to a tumor will prove safer. The team has
done preliminary safety checks, but now wants permission to
begin testing the treatment on cancer patients.
   Already, there has been some outcry from critics of gene
splicing, who worry that the new treatment would prove a
precursor to eugenics, or the attempt to perfect the human
race by influencing genes. Jeremy Rifkin, head of the
Foundation on Economic Trends, has been particularly active
in trying to block experiments.
   Now, the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA
Advisory Committee will decide later this month whether the
treatments can begin. "I think we'll succeed," Dr. Rosenberg
maintains. "I've never submitted a protocol that wasn't
eventually approved."
   Dr. Rosenberg's old mentor, Dr. Berlin, applauds the
innovation but cautions against high expectations, such as
those that surrounded the first use of interleukin-2. "People
must remember this is research," he warns. "The press has run
farther and faster with this than the science warrants." And
when that happens, he says, "we -- the cancer people --
appear to have promised much and delivered less."

   MOSCOW -- The Soviet government, revising its program of
economic changes, temporarily shelved plans to raise the
price of bread and other goods. Instead it is emphasizing the
need to press ahead with the denationalization of state
assets.
   An outline of the new-look program is due to be presented
by Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov to a meeting of the
Presidential Council today. If approved, government officials
expect Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to take swift action
to implement parts of it, using his powers as president to
issue binding decrees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The overall contents of the revamped program aren't
expected to differ substantially from Mr. Ryzhkov's earlier
proposals, which caused national uproar when announced in May
and were later sent back by the Soviet Parliament for
revision. Many key provisions, such as an overhaul of the
nation's banking system and the creation of social programs
to compensate for job losses, are likely to remain intact.
   But the new plans will have a different emphasis,
according to Andrei Orlov, deputy head of the government's
commission on economic change. Rather than proceeding first
with attempts to overhaul the nation's topsy-turvy pricing
system, the revised program will stress the need to turn
state-owned factories over to the public. This will be done
mainly by leasing factories or converting them into joint
stock companies with shares being sold to the work force.
   "It's a question of accelerating plans for privatization,"
Mr. Orlov said.
   As part of its attempts to provide private-sector
competition to big industrial monopolies, the government also
has drafted new legislation allowing the creation of small
and medium-sized enterprises. Mr. Orlov said the draft is
close to being completed.
   The program is supposed to end decades of central planning
and turn the Soviet Union into a more market-oriented
economy. Reformers inside and outside the government are
hoping it will contain provisions that explicitly legalize
private property, something still fraught with ideological
problems here.
   They say Mr. Gorbachev appears to be more free to take
such an important step following the broad endorsement of
market-oriented changes by the Communist Party Congress
earlier this month.
   Official data underscore the pressing need for urgent
measures to overhaul the Soviet economy. The State Statistics
Committee said industrial production fell 2% in June from a
year earlier, while wages continued to soar. In the first six
months, industrial output declined 0.7%, whereas wages rose
12%, far above the planned 7% growth.
   The statistics, published in the Izvestia daily, showed
that the decline was largely driven by falling oil and coal
production. The decline in oil production contributed to a
50% increase in gasoline prices in Czechoslovakia this week,
and Hungary has said its oil supplies from the Soviet Union
have been cut.
   Izvestia also said 10 million man-days were lost to
strikes, and it also blamed ethnic tensions around the nation
and "a lack of discipline" for the dismal figures.
   Following the Presidential Council meeting, Mr. Ryzhkov
and his aides are expected to finalize details of the new
program over the next six weeks and then present them for
approval to the Parliament. Many here believe that the prime
minister's political future could hinge on the outcome. He
faced numerous calls to resign when his program was first
announced, largely because it proposed doubling or even
tripling prices of many staples, including bread.
   Mr. Orlov said plans to raise bread prices, a move
designed to conserve grain and reduce the Soviet budget
deficit, will now be considered only after this year's
harvest. Price rises for other goods have been shelved for
longer, probably until next year, when much of the package is
supposed to be implemented.
   The postponement of price overhaul means that a planned
devaluation of the Soviet ruble against Western currencies is
also likely to be delayed, Mr. Orlov said. Finance Minister
Valentin Pavlov and other senior officials have been pressing
for a ruble devaluation as a way to boost foreign trade. Mr.
Pavlov originally wanted such a step to be taken this month.
   After the criticism over Mr. Ryzhkov's original proposals,
the Kremlin set up an "alternative" commission on economic
change to work alongside the government. But Soviet and
Western officials say this now appears to be a token gesture
designed to assuage government critics.
   The commission will only hold its first meeting today, at
the same time as the Presidential Council, following the
return of its chairman, economist Abel Aganbegyan, from a
trip abroad. Mr. Orlov said it isn't likely to work out a
comprehensive program of its own to rival Mr. Ryzhkov's
plans, but will merely act as a channel for various ideas
from dissident economists.
   One Western diplomat who has spoken to many of the
commission's members says they aren't taking the panel
seriously. Most plan to go on vacation instead of staying in
Moscow over the summer to think up a new package, he says.

   The Housing Market Will Rise Again

HOME CONSTRUCTION (HOM)

<LP>
   This week's news that housing start figures have fallen
set off another round of panic among real-estate
professionals. Some of them were already worried about
slowing home-price growth along the Eastern seaboard. Now
Chicken Littles are predicting a nationwide collapse in home
values. Many are arguing that price declines could last up to
20 years, erasing half of the value of the housing stock.
Homeowners are rightly concerned with the integrity of an
asset that typically constitutes more than 60% of their
household wealth. Financial institutions with loans
collateralized by homes, and mortgage insurers, including my
employer Freddie Mac, would also feel the crunch.
   But as with Chicken Little, the alarmist talk is overblown
generalization. In fact, we are seeing confirmation of a
widely observed but only reluctantly accepted fact --
regional economies can cycle out of sync with the nation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Let's start with the East Coast, where prices are reported
to be falling. But, "falling" against what? When an
overheated market cools down, tantalizing stories of 200%
capital gains are replaced by "ordeals" of 20% price cuts.
   Even in the Northeast, that center of panic, the averages
are not really that bad; they certainly do not mean the
entire country is on the ropes. Statistics support a much
less alarming view. One reason for the concern may be that
the problems have finally hit the people who do the writing
-- many of America's housing analysts live in the Northeast]
   Something that is obvious from the outside, but hard to
see when it is going on around you, is that a housing market
can turn very quickly from a rapidly expanding speculative
market to "normal" or, more likely, overbuilt status.
   Since they last a long time, houses act as both a
consumption and investment commodity: They provide a
continuing flow of services to a resident without being fully
consumed in the process. Buying a house is just like buying a
stock that pays a dividend. You are willing to pay a price
for the house that represents the value of services -- the
dividends -- received and the price upon resale. If you
expect to hold the house a long time you will care more about
the services than the resale price. But if you are investing
for only a short time, the resale price becomes more
important than the services for determining the price you
will pay today. In both cases, the more you can get at the
time of resale the more you will pay for ownership today.
Still, speculators will be more sensitive to expected future
price movements than the "buy-and-hold" owner.
   Price speculation will eventually reach an upper limit,
when an owner cannot find a buyer. Typically, this occurs
when buyers approach the limit of their income and
downpayment potential. If higher-income buyers do not
materialize to pay a price with a built-in expectation of a
hefty appreciation, then prices decline. If the last buyers
pay a price based on the value of services they seek to
receive, and not speculative gain, prices can stabilize.
   The greatest threat to the growth of house prices occurs
when incomes decline during an economic contraction. A weak
economy will likely reverse expectations of rising incomes
and hence price appreciation.
   California house prices are a good example. They sagged in
the early 1980s as much because the rapid appreciation of the
late 1970s outran income as because of a mild economic
slowdown. The Midwest experienced price declines in the 1980s
without a previous run-up in prices because income fell at
the same time as jobs left the area. Finally, the Southwest
has seen the greatest price declines because it went through
an extreme boom period that came to a halt in 1983, followed
by an extreme economic bust in 1986. All three of these areas
are now seeing price increases. According to the National
Association of Realtors, house prices in the West, Midwest
and South have risen 8.4%, 7.5%, and 1.7% respectively over
the four quarters ending in March.
   What about the current status of the Northeast? The
National Association of Realtors reports that the median
sales price of homes in the region rose 1.5% in 1989 from a
year earlier; prices in both the greater New York area and
Boston were unchanged, while Washington was still rising at a
9% clip. This information, of course, is now a little old. If
one instead looks at the past six months, then median prices
in all three metropolitan areas have fallen 2%-5% -- partly
because smaller houses are being traded.
   Independent information analyzed internally at Freddie Mac
is consistent with the recent Realtors' data: Our numbers
show prices flat to declining over the past six months in
Boston and Washington, and down 5% in the past year in
northern New Jersey. Nationally, we see prices still rising
at a 4% to 6% rate; regionally, the only area to see anything
less than a 4% gain is the Northeast with a 2% increase.
   What then about the next 20 years? The reversal from baby
boom to baby bust, leading to a decline in the number of
first-time homebuyers during the 1990s, has lead to questions
about future returns on today's housing investments. But past
trends in consumption point to a continued increase in the
per-capita demand for housing services by the 35-54 age
group, which continues to grow. A consequence is that the
total level of demand for housing services will not decline,
only its rate of growth will slow.
   The pace of new construction, the price of undeveloped
land, and the wage and employment levels in the homebuilding
industry will all provide a price cushion for this slowing
demand. In fact, the process has already begun with the news
of recession-style levels of new construction. Overbuilding
of apartments and some single-family homes, together with a
more conservative credit environment have created supply-side
problems for the industry. But beyond their potential
contribution to a nationwide recession, the current travails
of the homebuilding industry should only affect property
values modestly.
   Those still unconvinced of the durability of home price
levels should look at statistics on home price movements over
the past 20 years, when the baby boomers entered the housing
market and drove up both the rate of new construction and
relative housing prices.
   The best measure of price movements is the government's
price index for a home of constant quality. It attempts to
remove the effects of changes in new home prices arising
simply from improvements in construction quality and size,
and permits focusing on "pure price" inflation.
   The annualized increase in this index from 1969 to 1989
was 7%, a mere 0.7 percentage points greater than the annual
increase in the consumer price index over the same period.
The relationship has recently reversed. The CPI has risen
more than home prices over the past 10 years. So while there
are some technical limitations with the constant quality
index, these numbers show there has been little "excessive"
inflation that needs to be reversed. And if home prices
haven't risen excessively over the past 20 years when there
was a hefty increase in demand, there is not reason to expect
a sizable decline in demand in the next 20 years.
   The average price of houses actually sold increased at an
8.7% annual rate over the past 20 years. But because that
figure does not reflect the quality of houses being sold,
that is clearly the wrong number to use in the current
analysis.
   There will not be a nationwide collapse in home prices.
Still, price inflation is likely to slow. Someone will have
to buy the houses the trade-up buyers are selling, and the
incomes of those buyers -- some of whom appear to be
currently frozen out of the market -- will limit the sales
prices of the boomers' outgrown homes and hence their capital
gains. Reduced demand will eventually mean lower total
appreciation. So the dynamics of demand and supply should
work well, and without catastrophe, over the next 10 years.
   Which leads us back to the children's tale mentioned at
the start, in which a number of other birds take up Chicken
Little's cry that the sky is falling. The unsuspecting
followers get eaten by a wolf -- except for Chicken Little,
who escapes to spin her tale another day. As in the fable, it
is the investors who believe the sky is falling who will have
to bear the costs.

   Nynex Corp., BellSouth Corp. and Ameritech posted solid
gains in second-quarter profit, spurred by cellular and
access lines growth. But Southwestern Bell Co. reported flat
earnings, and Pacific Telesis Group posted an 8.9% drop.
   Results were generally what analysts anticipated. "Growth
is very much in line with expectations," said Frank
Governali, an analyst with First Boston Corp. "Ameritech was
the only one with any surprise at all."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nynex, which took a $39 million onetime charge for an
early retirement program, reported a 7.7% increase in net
income due to gains in its telephone operations, mobile
communications and software subsidiaries. Revenue rose to
$3.44 billion from $3.3 billion. About 4,000 managers of New
York-based Nynex signed up for the special early-retirement
program. "It looks like Nynex had slightly more and earlier
cost reductions than expected," said Dan Reingold, an analyst
at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Profit of Chicago-based Ameritech surprised some analysts,
surging 11.3% with strong volume growth in access lines, toll
calls and minutes of use. A tight rein on costs helped to
boost net income to $352.3 million. During the quarter,
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp., along with two New Zealand
companies, were chosen by the New Zealand government to buy
the state-owned telephone company for about $2.4 billion.
   BellSouth's net income rose 6.5%, but revenue growth, up
5.7%, was damped by rate reductions in several Southeast
states. The Atlanta-based company's cellular unit added
62,355 customers in the quarter and reported income of $13.1
million compared with a $2.6 million loss the year earlier.
   Southwestern Bell's net income edged up 0.4%, despite a
1.9% drop in phone company income due to rate cutbacks and a
one-time $18.1 million pretax charge for inventory. Results
were helped by 71,000 new cellular customers added during the
period, more than twice the number of new customers that
signed up the year before. Without the write-down for
inventory, St. Louis-based Southwestern's earnings would be
90 cents a share, compared with 83 cents the year before.
   Pacific Telesis blamed a new rate structure in California,
investment in network improvements, labor contracts and
depreciation of equipment. Earnings for the quarter were $287
million, or 72 cents a share, compared with $325 million, or
79 cents a share, the year before. Pacific Telesis, based in
San Francisco, reported revenue of $2.43 billion, vs. $2.4
billion.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Nynex closed at $77.75, down 37.5 cents; BellSouth
closed at $52.25, down 25 cents; Southwestern Bell closed at
$53.875, unchanged; Ameritech closed at $60.625, up 50 cents,
and Pacific Telesis closed at $43, down 12.5 cents.

   Occidental Petroleum Chief
   Says Late Wife Intended
   To Reject Claims on Art

   LOS ANGELES -- A legal dispute involving hundreds of
millions of dollars in art, a museum funded by shareholders,
and a battle with his late wife's estate is all a mistake,
said Armand Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of
Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   In an interview, the 92-year-old executive said his wife,
Frances Tolman Hammer, intended before her death in December
to clarify an apparent contradiction involving community
property and the art collection valued by some at as much as
$400 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I think it was just a question that she overlooked this,"
Dr. Hammer said. In other remarks, Occidental's chief
executive said for the first time that his early investments
in the company's drilling were made with loans from his wife.
   The late Mrs. Hammer's will leaves open the possibility
that her estate retains rights to much of the art collection
now being donated by Dr. Hammer to a new museum that will
bear his name and that is being built by Occidental.
   A $400 million lawsuit filed last week by the executor of
Mrs. Hammer's estate has challenged ownership of the art and
other assets, saying that the estate is entitled to part of
their value under community property laws. Dr. Hammer and his
attorneys have countered that Mrs. Hammer, on at least three
occasions in nearly 15 years, rejected any claim to the art
collection.
   Dr. Hammer appeared tanned and fit amid the outbreak of
family feuding. Dressed in a blue, pin-striped suit, blue tie
and with a tiny, red French Legion of Honor pin stuck in his
lapel, he discussed wealth, wills and lawyers.
   In his ruminations, the nonagenarian executive turned back
to the 1950's, when he courted his wife and they invested in
oil drilling that led to his control of Occidental, the Los
Angeles-based oil, chemical, pipeline and
agricultural-product concern with which he is identified. His
recollections were somewhat at odds with his tale as told in
"Hammer," his autobiography that was published in 1987.
   In his book, Dr. Hammer wrote that he fled a tangled
divorce proceeding from his second wife. The new Mrs.
Hammer's long-dead first husband "had left Frances with a
substantial fortune, and, together with my millions, we had
far more money than we would ever need or want to spend," he
wrote, adding that he was ready for quiet retirement.
   But instead of the idyllic merger of two equally wealthy
senior citizens of his autobiography, Dr. Hammer sketched a
different tie to the wealthy widow who became his third wife
in 1956.
   "When I married Mrs. Hammer and moved out {to Los Angeles
from New Jersey}, I was strapped for cash," Dr. Hammer
recalled. Despite his recent sale of about $7.5 million of
assets, "I had a lot of debts and most of my cash went to
cover those debts."
   Short of investment funds, he borrowed from his wife.
"Mrs. Hammer offered to make loans to me, which I was happy
to accept," Dr. Hammer recounted. Luck was with the new Mr.
and Mrs. Hammer. The money Dr. Hammer insisted was spent on
oil drilling for a tax break turned up a series of gushers
and the second-largest natural gas field discovered in
California. Investment in tiny Occidental, a nearly moribund
concern that did the drilling with the Hammers as partners,
soon followed.
   According to the lawsuit filed by Robert S. Weiss, as
executor of Mrs. Hammer's estate, Dr. Hammer borrowed more
than $300,000 from his wife at an interest rate of 2%. The
loans remained outstanding for nearly two decades at that
rate, the suit alleges, arguing that Dr. Hammer's personal
fortune was built on borrowings from his wife and cannot be
separated.
   Dr. Hammer, with his attorney, maintained that these were
commercial transactions very much apart from matrimonial
money-handling. Dr. Hammer also contends that he boosted Mrs.
Hammer's net worth from $3 million when he married her to $15
million at her death.
   The late Mrs. Hammer wrote two wills, Dr. Hammer said --
one around 1970, which bequeathed all her assets first to
him, and then, should he have predeceased her, to other
members of her family. The second will was written in 1988 by
Mary Creutz, a Los Angeles lawyer who Dr. Hammer said was
engaged by Robert Weiss and his wife, Joan Weiss, who became
respectively Mrs. Hammer's executor and sole beneficiary
under the new will. Joan Weiss is the late Mrs. Hammer's
niece.
   Dr. Hammer said he believes that his wife made Mrs. Weiss
the sole beneficiary of her estate because Mrs. Hammer was
"very fond" of Mrs. Weiss's two sons. "That's why, I think,
she agreed to sign a new will," he said.
   The new will contains a clause that Mrs. Hammer retained
her rights to the Hammers' community property. However, said
Dr. Hammer, Mrs. Hammer then sent the will to the Chicago
lawyers who had represented both of them in personal matters
for decades. A partner in the Chicago firm of Lewis, Overbeck
&amp; Furman then told Mrs. Hammer that there was a conflict
between the new will and Mrs. Hammer's previous refutation of
community property claims to the Hammer art collection.
   "So then, Mrs. Hammer realized that she had made a
mistake," her husband said.
   Richard Cleary, an attorney for the Weisses in the
litigation disputed suggestions that the late Mrs. Hammer
intended to refute or change part of her will. "The will has
been admitted to probate, and no one, including Dr. Hammer,
has questioned that." Mr. Cleary added that those on the
Weisses side "believe that the will accurately represents
Mrs. Hammer's desires as to how her property should be
distributed at her death."

   Sarah Flores's American dream may be shattered next week
in a federal courtroom. Starting as a secretary, she worked
her way up to a top post in county government. Now she is
favored to win a November runoff and become the first
Hispanic or woman ever elected to the powerful Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors.
   But federal Judge David Kenyon is likely to cancel that
election to, remarkably, correct discrimination against
Hispanics. The day before her first-place finish last month,
Judge Kenyon struck down the existing districts, saying "an
Hispanic candidate is unable to be elected to the board"
under them. He ordered the board to create an
Hispanic-majority district, and indicated he would cancel the
November vote and call a new one. In response to his
anti-gerrymandering order, the supervisors have concocted the
district pictured alongside.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The problem, of course, is that while Mrs. Flores is a
longtime Hispanic activist, she is also a Republican. The
fact that she won 68% of the Hispanic vote last month is
ignored by those who want to cancel the fall vote and draw a
new Hispanic seat. The battle over the Flores seat has less
to do with discrimination than it does with pure politics.
Since 1980, the Board of Supervisors has had a 3-to-2
conservative majority, and the lawsuit before Judge Kenyon is
intended to reverse this.
   The local ACLU chapter and the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEV), sued in 1988 -- seven
years after the lines were drawn -- claiming they
discriminated against Hispanics. By the trial date, two of
the five districts were 47% Hispanic and Mrs. Flores was the
leading candidate in one of them. But, as a Republican, she
was unacceptable to liberal activists who want control of the
board. They want to end her career before she becomes a role
model for other Hispanics who want to escape from the Liberal
Barrio.
   Under court order, the Board of Supervisors created a 74%
Hispanic-majority district, an octupus-shaped creature that
has tentacles reaching out to scoop up Hispanic voters.
Liberal groups don't object to the district's bizarre
contours, but to the fact that the Hispanic seat includes the
home of a liberal Anglo supervisor. An Hispanic could defeat
him, but that would not shift the board's ideological makeup.
   MALDEV has submitted two plans that create a 71%
Hispanic-majority seat and have boundaries almost as
torturous. But they both exclude Mrs. Flores's home and
political base, making it unlikely that she could win. Mrs.
Flores opposes both the board and MALDEV plans and has asked
Judge Kenyon to let this fall's election proceed under the
old lines.
   Next year, she wants a new plan drawn using the new 1990
Census data and expanding the board to seven members. ACLU
attorneys oppose this, saying Mrs. Flores ignored warnings
not to take her case to the voters while their lawsuit was in
court, and that her interests are secondary to those of the
Hispanic community.
   But which community? The Hispanic voters who back Mrs.
Flores, or the liberal activists who pretend to speak for
them? The liberal groups insist the first Hispanic supervisor
be drawn from their ranks. Until that happens, the 70,000
voters who want Sarah Flores to represent them will have
their votes thrown out.
   The Flores case is the opening round in what will be a
series of bitter struggles next year over the redrawing of
thousands of congressional, state legislative and
supervisorial districts. Both political parties want to use
the expanded Voting Rights Act to redraw the country along
ethnic and racial lines. Republicans, for instance, want to
help black legislators craft majority-black districts that
will make it easier for the GOP to win suburban seats.
   Back in 1982, when the Voting Rights Act provisions that
practically mandate racial gerrymandering were passed, we
doubted they would serve American democracy any better than
the Jim Crow districts of a previous era. Districts should be
drawn to keep communities of interest largely intact and to
give voters real choices.
   Surely it is bizarre for judges to cancel the election of
minorities on the grounds of discrimination. This has to
mean, as in the Flores case, that the real issue is politics.
The rights of minorities are not advanced by frustrating the
will of minority voters.

   Europe Offers Expanding Opportunities to Franchisers

   IFA's Arthur Karp Finds a Growing
   Market and Aggressive Bank Financing

   Opportunities for American franchisers are expanding
substantially in both Western and Eastern Europe, says Arthur
Karp, chairman of the International Franchise Association.
Very small franchisers, as well as the giants, can benefit,
he believes.
   As head of the leading trade group of U.S. franchisers,
Mr. Karp recently led a group of American franchise company
executives through England, West Germany, France, Switzerland
and Spain to meet with investors and explore franchising
opportunities in Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Karp himself this year agreed to sell his 300-unit
chain, the Great American Cookie Co. in Atlanta, to a Belgian
investment group. On a recent trip to New York, he discussed
European opportunities with The Wall Street Journal.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: How big, potentially, is the European franchise
market?
   A.: Franchising already accounts for 10% of retail sales
in France and 11% in England. There's no reason to assume
that it won't at some point approximate 25% to 30% in each of
those countries. I don't know if it will ever be 50% of all
retail sales, as we expect it to be in the United States.
Only time will tell. But there's no doubt that there is a
level of acceptance that was not dreamed of five years ago.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: What's driving the expansion of U.S. franchisers in
Europe?
   A.: With the unification of the Common Market in 1992,
franchising regulations could be even more uniform than in
the United States, where 14 states require independent
disclosures separate from what the Federal Trade Commission
requires.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: There also is the emergence of Eastern Europe as a new
marketplace. Only Hungary has enabling legislation that will
allow franchising. But the German Franchise Association, with
the French and the Americans, is putting together a trade
mission to Budapest to begin the process of bringing
franchising to other Eastern bloc countries you visited
officially demonstrated a desire for franchising, but who is
going to buy the franchises?
   A.: It is going to take some time to develop, but the
desire to be your own boss, to control your own destiny, is
universal. My sense is demand for franchises far exceeds
supply. In Madrid, the 14 franchising companies that were
with us on the trip had two days to meet with people. We made
close to 250 appointments.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: How will U.S. franchisers finance their European
expansion?
   A: It's much easier to put the financing together in
Europe than it is in the U.S. Banks are much more aggressive
and more forward-thinking in finding ways to create financing
for franchising.
   Let me give you an example. A U.K. bank proposed providing
me with a $10 million pool of money to give to individual
franchisees who would put up 10% of whatever we lend them.
So, if it cost $150,000 to open a franchise, and the
franchisee came up with $15,000, that would give us {Great
American Cookie Co.} the right to issue them a $135,000 loan
against this $10 million line of credit.
   How can the bank take that kind of risk? They require that
we, the franchiser, guarantee 10% of the money they make
available to us. So if they make a $10 million fund
available, that's $1 million in losses I would have to pay.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: Have other foreign banks made similar offers?
   A.: Banks approached us in virtually every country we went
to. In Geneva, they hosted a breakfast for the franchisers
and made presentations offering their services and money.
They even offered to find us franchisees.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: You're obviously very bullish about expanding in
Europe. But what are the pitfalls?
   A.: Every seminar that the IFA has ever done on
international franchising tells franchisers that it's going
to cost more money than you expected and more of your
people's time than you expected to create a successful
franchise system in the international marketplace. All of the
rules by which the game is played are different.
   We investigated franchising in the Netherlands and learned
that there were vast differences in the way you function in
that country.
   They had a rule where companies with over 100 employees
had to create a council of 10 of their employees who would
have to approve major decisions made by the management of the
company. It's a socialistic concept. That may change with the
unification of the Common Market. Certainly not all of the
countries will agree to those kinds of restrictions.
   So step one is making sure that your system will function
successfully in the host country. Then choose an experienced
partner. Most franchisers select a master licenser who
becomes the franchiser in that country.
   The feeling is you need a local resident who understands
the folkways, the mores, the labor laws -- the things that
are different from country to country. I would think the way
to do it would be to have a local partner in each country.
There are a number of companies that have approached
licensers and suggested they have the entire Common Market.
Personally, I think that's a mistake.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: How do you go about finding a partner?
   A.: The IFA has 14 affiliated organizations, like the
French Franchise Federation and the Portuguese Franchise
Association. So the first thing we do when we want to go into
a market is contact our affiliate organization, which might
recommend master licensers for us to pursue. Secondly, there
are the traditional kinds of sources: bankers, accountants,
lawyers. There are also the U.S. embassies, which have a
commercial officer in any major city. They have a service,
which you can buy, for negotiating an arrangement.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: How will disputes be resolved?
   A.: A presentation by a law firm in Madrid talked about
that very issue. Most contracts are drawn to require that the
dispute is resolved under American law. They {the Madrid law
firm} thought a judgment entered in a U.S. court would be
difficult to enforce and that it might be more favorable for
a franchiser to resolve differences under the host country's
law.
                                                                                                       

   Q.: But doesn't a foreigner tend to fare worse in a
foreign court?
   A.: That's always been our feeling, and that's the reason
most contracts are written the way they are. Personally, I
would prefer to have the franchise established under American
law, just because I'm more comfortable in my own culture.

   NEW YORK -- Primerica Corp. reported second-quarter
earnings climbed 53% on 11% higher revenue, led by the
consumer finance operations, where profit rose 29% on a
revenue increase of 37%.
   The financial-services company's net income reached $96.9
million, or 84 cents a share, from $63.4 million, or 65 cents
a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue advanced to
$1.55 billion, from $1.40 billion. Shares outstanding grew
19%, to 117.9 million, as Primerica issued stock to buy the
30.2% minority interest in its A.L. Williams insurance
subsidiary.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The range of estimates had been 75 to 82 cents" a share,
so the quarter "clearly was better than expected," said
Allerton Cushman Jr., analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Primerica's latest results reflect gains of $9.7 million
from the sale of 6.3 million shares of its Fingerhut Cos.
subsidiary in a May initial public offering, and $2.6 million
from the sale of part of its investment in reinsurer
Transatlantic Holdings Inc., which also completed its first
public offering during the quarter. The bottom line also
includes $11.1 million of losses in Primerica's investment
portfolios.
   "The only place where earnings came in below target," Mr.
Cushman said, was in specialty life and health insurance,
which posted a 27% drop. The segment, which includes auto
insurance, was hurt by weakness in the auto industry and by a
higher tax rate; it also faced comparison with a strong
year-earlier period. Primerica has been examining the cost
structure and taking other restructuring measures at the
segment, a spokesman said.
   Traders worried, however, about an inquiry by the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Jacksonville, Fla., into life-insurance
sales practices at A.L. Williams. Primerica's shares fell
$1.625, to close at $34.625 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.

   THE EC AND PERSONAL DATA

   The European Community Commission is seeking to protect
personal data against abuse.
   Five EC members -- Italy, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and
Greece -- lack legislation protecting an individual's right
to control personal information in private or public data
banks. Worried that varying levels of protection throughout
the EC may obstruct the flow of information, the commission
has proposed a directive based on a Council of Europe
convention already ratified by seven EC states.
   The directive would give individuals the right of access
to information about themselves and the right to correct
erroneous data. Data relating to race, health or political
opinions would receive extra protection against unauthorized
use.
   Filippo Pandolfi, commissioner of science and research,
says he fears that modern telecommunications technology means
there is a greater risk that sensitive information will be
misused or stolen.
                                                                                                       

   KAIFU ADMINISTRATION IS POPULAR
                                                                                                       

   Public support for the administration of Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu registered 60%, according to a survey
taken last weekend by Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. The
support rate for Mr. Kaifu was the second highest in postwar
Japan, ranking after the 60.5% rate of former Prime Minister
Kakuei Tanaka's cabinet in a 1972 survey. The newspaper said
the support rate for Mr. Kaifu, which was up 3.6 percentage
points from a similar survey in June, was the highest since
he took office in August 1989.
                                                                                                       

   SAVING THE WORLD'S CORAL

   The Swiss-based World Conservation Union will launch a
program to conserve coral at its November meeting in
Australia. The organization said scuba divers and
indiscriminate developers are destroying the world's coral
reefs. It said hundreds of thousands of divers breaking off
small samples and locals harvesting coral to sell are
chipping the reefs away. The organization aims to increase
public awareness of the endangered reefs and the importance
of not buying coral necklaces and shells. It will also try to
encourage countries with reefs to allow diving only in
certain areas or at certain times.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH CAR-IMPORT LIMIT
                                                                                                       

   French Premier Michel Rocard, on a visit to Tokyo,
defended his country's limits on Japanese automobile imports
by saying France's auto makers were too important to
sacrifice, the Japanese Foreign Ministry reported. Mr. Rocard
told Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu that both
countries advocate free trade but still hold to some
protectionist policies, ministry officials said. France has
advocated a 10-year transitional period to protect national
car industries before the integrated European market is fully
open to car imports. France limits Japanese car imports to 3%
of its total market.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREAN-SOVIET VENTURE
                                                                                                       

   South Korea and the Soviet Union have agreed to open the
first regular shipping service between the two countries. The
line will run between the South Korean port of Pusan and
Vostochny in the Soviet Far East, said officials of the South
Korea Maritime and Port Administration. They said the regular
container service is expected to start in October. They said
the accord calls for splitting profits from the operation
equally between the two sides. Only one container ship is
expected to be used initially.
                                                                                                       

   SWISS CIGARETTE RULING
                                                                                                       

   A chain smoker may be addicted, but cigarettes are not
drugs, according to the Swiss Supreme Court. The court's
ruling upheld a lower court that had ordered a
health-insurance company to pay sick benefits to a heavy
smoker who had fallen ill. The insurers had refused payment,
arguing that their contract didn't provide for sick-benefit
money for illnesses caused by abusive use of drugs or
medicines. The high court said while smoking may lead to
addiction, cigarettes cannot be legally categorized as drugs.
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN IN ITALY'S MILITARY?
                                                                                                       

   Women could volunteer for service in Italy's military, one
of the last all-male armed forces in Europe, under
legislation approved by a parliamentary committee.
   Increasing numbers of Italian women have been joining
police forces in recent years, but the armed forces have
remained closed to them.
   The bill would open up the Italian services to women as
volunteers and offer careers to them as officers and
non-commissioned officers. However, women would still be
excluded from combat roles.
   The bill, passed by the Senate Defense Committee, must go
before the full Senate and then to the Chamber of Deputies.
It also would reduce the draft for men from 12 months to 10
months and offer alternative service in such fields as civil
defense and environmental protection.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Mikhail Gorbachev's 79-year-old mother, Maria Pantelyevna
Gorbachev, only recently got a color television to replace
her old black-and-white set, bakes her own bread and
complains her son never visits, said an article in the Soviet
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. . . . Roofers working atop
St. Peter's Cathedral in Cologne, West Germany, will get a
bathroom of their own, 200 feet above the nave. The Bild
newspaper said the $160,000 facility, which will have a
heated floor and warm running water, is "Germany's most
expensive toilet."

   Reorganization Plan

   PHOENIX -- The federal government and a committee
representing unsecured creditors of American Continental
Corp. provided details of a proposed reorganization plan
under which American Continental would be liquidated, Charles
A. Keating Jr. and other executives would be ousted and
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association would be dropped from
creditors' claims.
   The settlement agreement provides about $21 million for
creditors and in return insulates the government from certain
claims by these creditors. "This provides the {ACC}
bondholders with sure recovery of some assets, when they
faced dismal prospects, and it relieves the government of
exposure to litigation," said Michael Tucci, senior counsel
for the Resolution Trust Corp. "This will eliminate a lot of
attorneys' fees."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement, if approved, would also have the effect of
preventing Mr. Keating from retaking control of Lincoln, the
thrift seized by federal regulators last year a day after
American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection. ACC has unsecured debt of about $350 million;
about two-thirds of that comes in the form of junk bonds,
many sold through Lincoln branches.
   In an interview, Mr. Keating said he'd "personally argue"
against the plan and also formally introduce a proposal in
federal bankruptcy court to buy back $500 million of
Lincoln's assets for no down payment, then manage it himself
so the U.S. doesn't lose money and creditors get another $50
million.
   The plan, which a U.S. District Court judge in Arizona
would hear arguments on in September, also provides that
Lincoln and its subsidiaries, which filed for bankruptcy
protection along with ACC, would be dismissed from bankruptcy
protection.
   Furthermore, the RTC, which oversees the U.S.'s thrift
bailout, would remain in control of Lincoln Savings even if
U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin, in Washington,
D.C., gives Mr. Keating approval to take Lincoln back.

   The Quintessential English Romantic
   ----

   To his lifelong friend Charles Lamb, he was "an archangel
slightly damaged." To his early disciple turned vociferous
critic William Hazlitt, he was a man "sunk into torpid,
uneasy repose, tantalized by useless resources, haunted by
vain imaginings, his lips idly moving." To almost everyone
who encountered him, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) was
a dazzling force of nature. Part poet, part orator, part
metaphysical seer, he was a wordsmith who invariably beguiled
his auditors with an unstoppable stream of brilliant,
intoxicating talk.
   The cataract of talk even reached into posterity. "He
seems not a man," wrote Virginia Woolf, "but a swarm, a
cloud, a buzz of words, darting this way and that,
clustering, quivering, and hanging suspended." Yet Coleridge
was much more than a fountain of words. As his biographer,
Richard Holmes, shows in his superlative account of
Coleridge's early life, "Coleridge: Early Vision" (Viking,
409 pages, $22.95), he was in many ways the quintessential
English Romantic.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More than the grim and prosey Wordsworth, perhaps even
more than the flamboyant Byron or the ethereal Shelley,
Coleridge incarnated the spiritual aspirations of his age.
That he also incarnated its excesses and liabilities is only
too familiar. Coleridge the stalled writer, the irresponsible
dreamer, the shameless plagiarizer; Coleridge the opium
addict and burnt-out case: All that is as much a part of our
literary folklore as Coleridge the author of "Kubla Khan" and
"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."
   In this first of two projected volumes, Mr. Holmes takes
us from Coleridge's birth at Devon to the eve of his
departure for Malta in 1804. He chronicles, in other words,
the career of the visionary Coleridge: the radical utopian
schemer and poetic innovator who dreamed of a commune by the
Susquehanna River in America and who collaborated with
Wordsworth on "Lyrical Ballads."
   He also writes of Coleridge the unhappy and perpetually
absent husband, the unrequited lover, the increasingly
despondent and drug-sodden waster. Still to come are
Coleridge the great literary critic, the religious thinker,
the public philosopher.
   The youngest of 10 children, Coleridge found his bucolic
home life shattered when his father -- a learned minister and
schoolmaster -- died in 1781. The young boy was promptly
packed off to school at Christ's Hospital in London, a
brutalizing place that nonetheless provided him with a good
grounding in classics and, eventually, a scholarship to Jesus
College, Cambridge.
   Coleridge was ferociously precocious, able to read a
chapter of the Bible when only three and blessed with an
extraordinary memory. But he proved to be a dilatory student
at best. Already at Cambridge his vacillating and irresolute
character was on full display. Mr. Holmes duly reports the
"wild expenditure on books, drinking, violin lessons, theater
and whoring . . . alternating with fits of suicidal gloom and
remorse." "Coleridge was," he notes, "a man who could confess
spiritual despair at midday; and dine out brilliantly at
midnight."
   But in truth it was restlessness, not sloth, that was
Coleridge's besetting vice. Would that more of us were as
productive as he] Always a prodigious walker, he once covered
263 miles in eight days. He was capable of writing 76
newspaper articles in five months or composing 50 blank verse
lines of a translation of Schiller's "Wallenstein" in a
single day.
   Yet he could not stay put. A planned three-month trip in
Germany with the Wordsworths stretched on for 10 months. As
usual, his wife, Sara, remained impatiently behind with the
children, one of whom died while his father was away.
Coleridge was as addicted to drawing up lists of impossible
works and projects as he was to opium. "He dreamed more than
he planned," writes Mr. Holmes, "he planned more than he
could execute {and he was} never still or concentrated for
more than a few weeks at a time."
   Mr. Holmes does not attempt to excuse Coleridge's
failings. But his enthusiasm for this damaged archangel
remains undiminished. Rather, like Coleridge himself, he
understands -- and lets us understand -- that "the hope of
recreating himself imaginatively out of the sense of failure
itself" early on became one of Coleridge's chief spurs to
creativity and reflection.
   In this, Coleridge could not have been more different from
Wordsworth. While Wordsworth was composing his great
Immortality Ode, with its vision of the past as a "perpetual
benediction," Coleridge wrote "Dejection: An Ode," meditating
on "A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief,/ Which finds no
natural outlet, no relief."
   This account of the young Coleridge is a fit sequel to Mr.
Holmes's magisterial biography of Shelley (1974). Perhaps its
greatest achievement is to have reminded us of how complex
Coleridge was, how he managed to salvage an enlivening
passion even from disappointment and dissipation. "If he does
not leap out of these pages -- brilliant, animated, endlessly
provoking -- and invade your imagination," Mr. Holmes writes
in his preface, "then I have failed to do him justice." Few
readers, perhaps, will close this book unexasperated by
Coleridge's foibles; I think none will come to the end
unmoved by his painfully expansive genius.

estimated six million customers when Lotus introduced the
new, improved Release 3.0 version last June. But older, less
powerful PCs couldn't use Release 3.0, so Lotus came out with
another updated version, Release 2.2, a month later.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Then two months ago, it said it will come out with yet
another new version, Release 3.1, which will offer fancier
printing capabilities that customers wanted but which Lotus
didn't include in its Release 3.0 product.
   Confused? So are a lot of Lotus's customers. Lotus's
effort to provide a different product for everyone, while
perhaps sounding good in theory, has prompted many to just
sit tight with their old program. Lotus's strategy and its
results with customers point up the marketing problems that
dominant companies have in defending their market positions.
   Until this week, everything looked fine, with Lotus
showing spectacular earnings gains for the past four
quarters. But late Wednesday, it disclosed that earnings may
decline in the current quarter, and that it isn't on the
strong growth path most analysts had forecast. Executives
conceded for the first time that competitors' spreadsheets
are cutting into its dominant market share.
   That announcement caused Lotus's stock to take a terrible
beating yesterday. It plummeted $6.125 to close at $25.125 in
national over-the-counter trading. More than 10 million
shares changed hands as technology investors bailed out of
Lotus and moved on to faster-growing PC software stocks. To
many, Lotus now looks like a mature company nursing a cash
cow without the prospects for spectacular growth that other
personal-computer software firms offer. Despite repeated
efforts to move beyond spreadsheets, Lotus still lacks any
other fast-growing programs with significant sales.
   Lotus became the paradigm of an explosive growth company
after it introduced 1-2-3 in 1983 and racked up $63 million
in sales in its first year. Until 1988, it remained the
biggest company in the PC software industry, with 1-2-3
accounting for two-thirds of its sales. Although far
surpassed in size and growth rate by Microsoft Inc. in recent
years, it remains No. 2 in the industry. And 1-2-3, by most
estimates, still captures 60% to 70% of all spreadsheet
revenue.
   However, at a time when the PC business is booming and
many other software companies are soaring, Lotus is now
floundering. Even beyond the issue of quarterly earnings,
"there are many questions about Lotus," says David Readerman,
an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   For one thing, its core strategy of introducing a plethora
of versions of 1-2-3 turns off some users. Ronan McGrath,
vice president for accounting at Canadian National Railways
in Montreal, who supervises some 2,000 PCs running 1-2-3
spreadsheets, says that only 40% of his users have upgraded.
Overall, analysts say that upgrades have fallen far below
expectations.
   Moreover, Lotus still lacks a 1-2-3 version for Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, and it doesn't have a version
specifically designed to work with Microsoft's Windows, a new
operating system to which many users are switching. Lotus
promises such a version in the future. Frank King, senior
vice president of the software business group, says that for
now it will advertise Release 3.1 as a Windows product,
because it can work with Windows.
   Meanwhile, the competition is getting tougher. Robert
Schechter, chief financial officer, says Lotus is holding on
to its traditional customers, but that many customers in new
markets, such as small business and home businesses, are
buying competitors' products.
   Borland International Ltd., for example, has sold many
copies of its Quattro Pro spreadsheet in a promotion under
which 1-2-3 users can send in the cover page of their Lotus
manual and get Quattro Pro for $99, less than they would pay
to upgrade to a new Lotus product. Quattro Pro also has the
advantage of running on older PCs while providing the
good-looking printouts that users want.
   "There's definitely an effect from competition," says
Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. He
estimates that recently Lotus has been selling an average of
120,000 copies of 1-2-3 a month and 25,000 upgrades, with
Borland selling 45,000 copies of Quattro Pro and Microsoft
selling 35,000 copies of Excel.
   Mr. King of Lotus says that in the past, Borland and
Microsoft attempted unsuccessfully to dislodge Lotus on its
main turf, the large corporation. Now, he says, Borland in
particular is trying to establish brand new markets. "Last
year, they came straight up the beach at us. Now they're
trying a flanking move," he says. "It's war. No doubt about
it."
   To counter, Mr. King says Lotus has established new
territorial sales representatives to market 1-2-3 to smaller
companies and software stores. It also has devised a way to
identify where individual software products end up so that
territorial representatives can be given commissions.
   Lotus also maintains that Borland is cheating. It has sued
Borland, charging that Quattro infringes its copyright on
1-2-3. "They've used our intellectual property," Mr. King
says.
   Lotus has managed to keep the loyalty of the corporate
data-processing managers who buy 1-2-3 in bulk by introducing
1-2-3 on mainframes and minicomputers. It also outlines
longer-term plans to let users get information from corporate
databases. But the repeated slip-ups with bringing out a core
version of 1-2-3 are embarrassing. "They're like the man who
has his eye on the stars and slips in a mud puddle," says a
corporate customer who remains loyal.
   But some erstwhile fans say Lotus has made a mistake by
concentrating too much on the big corporations. Michael
Kolowich, a former Lotus executive who is now publisher of PC
Computing, a magazine for users, says: "In concentrating on
the very large corporate sites with an approach that is
reminiscent of IBM's account control strategy, Lotus has
probably lost some of its magic with the end users." Mr.
Kolowich says that individual users remain the driving force
in buying new software programs. "Lotus has lost a lot of
support at the grass roots," he adds.

   LOS ANGELES -- NHI Nelson Holdings International Ltd.
announced several senior executive changes, including staff
cuts, in its Nelson Entertainment Group as part of its
previously announced restructuring plan to focus on making
and marketing movies.
   The company's shares fell 75 cents to $4.375 in composite
trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company issued a statement saying it believed the
staff cuts had been "misinterpreted."
   Nelson said it decided to consolidate its international
sales and marketing operations in its London office. Massimo
Graziosi was named president and chief operating officer of
the group's Nelson Entertainment International, a sales and
marketing arm. He was formerly senior vice president of the
unit.
   He succeeds Ian Jessel, who held the same title but at
Nelson's offices in Los Angeles. The company said Mr. Jessel
resigned after learning that Nelson planned to move the
operations to London. Nelson also said that Ian Scorer,
executive vice president of Nelson Entertainment
International in London, also resigned. Messrs. Jessel and
Scorer couldn't be reached for comment.
   The company also said that Steve Sohmer resigned as
president of Nelson Television, another unit of Nelson
Entertainment Group. The company said it will de-emphasize
its operations in television development and production.
   Nelson Entertainment Group is one of a dwindling number of
independent movie producers. The company co-produced the
highly successful "When Harry Met Sally" and released "Bill
and Ted's Excellent Adventure." The company has seven movies
in the pipeline including "The Taking of Beverly Hills," a
movie in which all the homes and stores in Beverly Hills are
robbed.
   Analysts note that the executive changes and the
restructuring follow the company's loss in the first quarter,
reflecting a dearth of releases. "The company is trying to
recapitalize its financial balance sheet and this is a
good-faith effort to lower the overhead as much as they can,"
said Jeff Logsdon, senior vice president of Seidler Amdec
Securities in Los Angeles.
   NHI Holdings also holds a 69% stake Nelson Vending
Technology. In the first quarter of this year, NHI Holdings
reported a net loss of $3.2 million on revenues of $18.9
million, compared with a net loss of $4.8 million on revenues
of $16.3 million in the year-earlier quarter.

   Navistar Weighs
   Making an Offer
   For Mack Trucks

</IN>
<LP>
   Navistar International Corp. is considering a bid for Mack
Trucks Inc. that would compete with one already under way
from Renault Vehicules Industriels S.A.
   Renault Vehicules already owns a 45% Mack stake, and it
recently launched a $6-a-share, or $99 million, tender offer
for the 55% of the Allentown, Pa., truck maker it doesn't
currently control.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Navistar, among the U.S.'s biggest truck manufacturers,
approached a committee of Mack's directors to express
interest in a possible bid that would exceed Renault's offer.
   However, Navistar said it couldn't proceed with an offer
unless Renault decided to dispose of its interest in Mack, an
action Renault said in a news release that it "has no
interest" in taking.
   Moreover, the truck-making unit of Regie Nationale des
Usines Renault could increase its stake in Mack to 61% from
45% by exercising a warrant and converting certain debentures
it owns.
   In Allentown, a Mack spokesman declined to comment beyond
the joint statement with Renault. Officials at Renault, based
in Paris, couldn't be reached for comment.
   Navistar confirmed that it had made the overture and said
it will need to make a comprehensive due-diligence
examination of Mack "to determine whether to make a firm
offer and a specific per-share price."
   The Chicago-based truck and diesel-engine maker declined
to elaborate on its possible interest in financially strapped
Mack.
   Mack's board, four of whose nine members are Renault
officials, hasn't responded to Renault's offer. Renault has
said it wants to take full ownership of the company because
of Mack's deteriorating condition and the need to refinance
its debt.
   Yesterday, Mack, which still faces a sagging market for
its heavy-duty trucks, reported that it had a loss of $63.3
million, or $2.13 a share, in the second quarter on sales of
$400.9 million. In national over-the-counter trading, Mack
common closed unchanged at $7.125. The Mack statement came
out after the market closed.
   Like Mack, Navistar has seen sales and earnings suffer
from a deep industry slump. In its first quarter, ended Jan.
31, it had a loss of $18 million, or 10 cents a share;
second-quarter earnings were down 77% at $8 million, or one
cent a share. Its six-month sales were off 11% at $1.81
billion.

   Short Interest
   Declines 2.8%

   But Figure Climbed 4.2%

   NEW YORK -- Short interest for the month ended July 13
fell 2.8% on the New York Stock Exchange but advanced 4.2% to
a record on the American Stock Exchange.
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co., the Indianapolis pharmaceutical
manufacturer, took over the top Big Board short-interest spot
with 13,737,401 shares, unseating Varity Corp. Short sellers
appear to have targeted Lilly for the past few months as
media reports raised questions about the company's prominent
anti-depressant Prozac.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New York exchange short interest eased to 642,585,339
shares at the July 13 settlement date from 661,212,877 shares
at mid-June. On the Amex, short interest climbed to
77,026,110 shares from a revised 73,950,683. The month
included the 19 trading days through July 6.
   At mid-July 1989, short volume was 484,818,847 shares on
the Big Board, indicating a 33% advance, and 48,922,594
shares on the American exchange, indicating a 57% rise.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio leaped back up to 4.53 from mid-June's
3.86; the figure stood at 4.61 in mid-May. The ratio is the
number of trading days at the exchange's average daily
trading volume that would be required to convert the total
short interest position. Average daily New York exchange
volume for the 19 trading days was 141,937,207 shares. Some
analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has weakened in
value as an indicator because options and other products can
be used to hedge short positions.
   A spokesman for Eli Lilly said the company's policy is not
to comment on matters involving its stock.
   For the 16th consecutive month, Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc., formerly Texas Air Corp., led the Amex
short-volume list, this month with 7,285,188 shares, down
3.3%.
   Two closely watched issues on the Big Board dropped:
International Business Machines Corp. volume fell 14% to
4,198,541 shares, while Exxon Corp. slipped 15% to 4,662,310
shares.

   The Episcopalian Goes the Way of the Dodo

   The religious makeup of the American population is
changing -- slowly but discernibly. By the year 2000, the
U.S. will be a far more pluralistic country than anyone would
have imagined in 1950 -- and vastly more pluralistic than it
was in 1783, when Yale President Ezra Stiles pictured a
future America divided about equally among
Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians.
   The big story is the continuing, long-time decline of the
Protestant majority, to 57% in 1987 from 67% in 1952. At the
present rate of decline, Protestants will be barely a
numerical majority of the American population by the year
2000.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Not all Protestant denominations are declining equally
fast. Since the middle-1960s, Methodists have declined to 9%
from 14%, Lutherans to 6% from 7%, Presbyterians to 3% from
6% and Episcopalians to 2% from 3%. Mainline Protestant
losses have been largely among the young who have either
turned to other faiths, or simply dropped out of religious
institutions entirely.
   The only large Protestant denomination to remain stable is
the Baptists, due mainly to the staying power of the
evangelicals and fundamentalists within the ranks of the
Southern Baptists. Along with Southern Baptists, other
conservative Protestant groups, such as the Assemblies of
God, the Seventh-Day Adventists and various Pentecostal and
holiness groups, continue to flourish. Three in 10 Americans
are evangelicals, or born-again Christians. Enthusiasm,
certainty of belief, moral passion, and institutional
commitment -- all are attributes that engender evangelical
growth and vitality. But not to be overlooked are the
demographics.
   Conservative Protestants hold on to their young much
better than mainline Protestants. Young conservative
Protestants are less likely to quit their parents' faith;
perhaps most important of all, conservative Protestants have
more young in the first place -- birth rates for evangelicals
and fundamentalists are significantly higher than for more
liberal Protestants.
   The mainline churches are also having trouble maintaining
their distinctiveness. Denominational lines are blurring
among them, while distinctions among the conservatives --
such as evangelical, fundamentalist, holiness, Pentecostal
and charismatic -- have taken on new meaning.
   Roman Catholicism has grown in almost the same proportion
as Protestantism has declined: to 28% of the nation's
population from 25% over the past 30 years. Historically,
Catholics have had a higher birth rate than Protestants, but
the gap has narrowed in recent decades. A more important
factor accounting for Catholic growth is the immigration of
Hispanics, who make up 17% of all American Catholics. Because
Hispanics have a higher birth rate than other Catholics, we
can expect their presence within American Catholicism to
become even larger. But Hispanics are also being recruited
into Protestantism, especially evangelical Protestantism, in
record numbers: 18% of Hispanics now belong to Protestant
denominations.
   Jews as a proportion of the American population have
declined since mid-century -- to 2% from 4%. This shift
largely is a result of two factors: a low birth rate and a
high rate of interfaith marriage. The Jewish proportion has
held steady at 2% since the early 1970s, which may indicate a
stable pattern for the foreseeable future.
   Two groupings have grown more rapidly over the past 40
years than any others: "other religions" and the
disaffiliated. "Other religions" include a broad array of
groups, some that have long been present on the American
scene, such as the Greek and Russian Orthodox, who have
dwindled as a proportion of the total population from 2% in
1950 to less than 1% today. Other groups that have long been
present have grown enormously since World War II, such as the
Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses.
   Perhaps the fastest-growing religious faith, though, is
Islam. There are now roughly as many Moslems in the U.S. as
there are Episcopalians. There are also large numbers of
Buddhists in America's cities, especially Los Angeles, as a
result of heavy emigration from Asia in the past two decades.
Hundreds of religious and spiritual groups new to the
American scene have emerged: Eastern mystical faiths, with an
emphasis on meditation and reincarnation as well as groups
drawing upon a wide assortment of older, more primitive
traditions recast in new form, such as nature religions,
Native American practices, theosophical beliefs, goddess
worship and other New Age spiritualities. Today 4% of the
population claims a religion outside the major traditions. In
the 1950s, only 1% did.
   The religiously nonaffiliated have grown to 9% today from
2% in the early 1950s. As their numbers have increased, their
cultural characteristics have changed: No longer a small
marginal group of atheists and social dissidents,
nonaffiliates today are predominately young, white,
well-educated and socially mobile.
   Many within this group have dropped out from the mainline
Protestant and Catholic churches. They are perhaps better
described as privately religious than as irreligious or
anti-religious. The rise of this sector points not only to a
growing secular constituency but also to the greater ease
generally with which Americans move in and out of religious
affiliations.
   In the next decade, we can expect an increasingly
pluralistic religious environment. The great divide between
religious liberals and religious conservatives within major
religious communities will persist and maybe even intensify
over issues such as abortion.
   We can expect the boundaries of "conventional" religion to
continue to expand: Faiths once thought of as foreign, such
as Buddhism and Islam, will take their place in the canopy of
American religious pluralism.
   We can also expect greater religious voluntarism: People
will pick and choose beliefs and practices from the various
religions, creating their own synthesized versions, making
for more personal, individualistic styles of faith.

   George Bush didn't get the civil rights bill he wanted
from the Senate this week, but not for lack of trying.
   Mr. Bush claimed to want "desperately" to sign a bill, and
his opponents sensed his political hunger. They held their
positions, while Mr. Bush gave more ground than the Italian
Africa corps. He stopped just short of accepting
unconditional surrender in the form of racial quotas. Mr.
Bush's reputed homeland -- the ground of equal opportunity,
not equal outcomes -- looks ravaged nonetheless.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Kennedy-Hawkins bill that passed the Senate 65-34
illustrates the growing failure of the White House political
strategy of splitting the difference with Congress. Mr. Bush
is doing all the splitting. Chief of Staff John Sununu "did
everything but jump through hoops" to get a deal with Sen.
Ted Kennedy, say several Senate sources. His pre-emptive
concessions even undercut an anti-quota alternative by Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) that was drawing Democrats.
   Mr. Bush wants a bill -- he doesn't want to veto anything
labeled "civil rights" -- but Democrats want both a campaign
issue and a bill. Black voters are a core Democratic
constituency, their last one other than unions. The thought
of Mr. Bush getting 20% of the black vote in 1992 terrifies
them. Even a veto threat provides welcome publicity. So Mr.
Kennedy kept waiting, and Mr. Sununu kept giving.
   The two thought they had a deal last week, until Mr.
Kennedy reneged Monday. Mr. Sununu called a press conference
to complain, but he was still willing to carry one more
concession back to the Hill. President Bush even put in a
personal call to Majority Leader George Mitchell's office
Tuesday night to urge the senators on. But Mr. Kennedy was
saying privately he had no reason to compromise. He figures
the White House will return with more concessions after the
House passes a similar bill this summer.
   This is also the strategy of the civil-rights industry --
now more conglomerate than cause -- and its curly-haired CEO
Ralph Neas. Mr. Neas has an engaging public demeanor that
masks an iron fist. He's his own good cop-bad cop. He
choreographed this week's moves for Democrats, much as he did
the Bork and Lucas nomination fights.
   He and his allies spurned the usual Senate reception room
and massed, like a panel of judges, just outside the Senate
chamber. When their troops -- the senators -- won a vote to
cut off debate, they gave a cheer that carried halfway across
the Capitol. Mr. Neas thinks he has George Bush rolled, too.
   "Kennedy wasn't running this show," says a White House
negotiator. "We'd think we had a deal, then he'd come back
and there'd be no deal. These civil rights groups want all or
nothing."
   What they want is to bring civil-rights lawsuits into the
trial lawyers' lottery. Heretofore, damages in bias suits
have been aimed at reconciliation -- reinstatement and back
pay. Kennedy-Hawkins opens the door to sky's-the-limit
judgments. More lawsuits will be filed, many of them
frivolous, and employers accused of bias will want to settle
rather than gamble on a multi-million dollar payment. This
will enrich the civil-rights bar, though how it will serve
racial harmony is a mystery.
   The entire bill is a lawyers' feast. No one else can
understand it. Weeks of debate have focused on legal jargon
like "business necessity" or the "Griggs" decision. Yet it's
crucial jargon because the civil-rights lobby has based its
entire strategy on the courts. Lawsuits, not economic
self-help or education, are its thing. But suits are blunt
instruments, even in a good cause.
   The Kennedy-Hawkins language puts the legal burden on
employers to prove in court that they didn't discriminate --
simply because they may have hired fewer Hispanics or women
than in the surrounding population. So any sane employer who
wants to avoid a suit will simply hire by statistics -- by
using quotas. Mr. Sununu's compromises would have ceded too
much of the Kennedy language.
   Everyone claims to hate quotas, of course, and Mr. Kennedy
even put in a clause saying the bill doesn't "require" them.
But, as Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) points out, this is
"worse than phony." The issue is whether the incentives in
the bill make it all but certain that employers will use
quotas in practice.
   Just how much all of this has strayed from the original
civil rights vision is clear enough from a letter Mr. Bush
received last month from Morris Abram. Mr. Abram is a hero of
the original civil-rights days who argued the one-man,
one-vote case before the Supreme Court. He didn't release the
letter, but a copy was obtained by the Forward, a Jewish
weekly.
   Mr. Abram wrote that Kennedy-Hawkins "is not a civil
rights bill but a quota bill because it will achieve
precisely what the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act stood
four-square against." He added, "Abraham Lincoln's great
friend Frederick Douglass understood the divisive and
destructive influence of proportional representation based on
race. `Equality of numbers,' he wrote in 1871, `has nothing
to do with equality of attainments.'"
   Mr. Bush agrees with this philosophy, because he quoted
that last passage in a speech this Wednesday. If he pressed
these arguments, maybe Ted Kennedy would be making the
concessions.

   Federal Express Faces Problems Overseas

   Decline in Trans-Pacific
   Shipping Adds to its Woes

<LP>
   Last week, Federal Express Corp. broke a string of five
consecutive quarters of year-to-year profit declines.
   But while news of its fourth-quarter results boosted the
express-delivery giant's sagging stock price for a day,
Federal still faces serious problems in its overseas
operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the earnings gain, Federal reported a 7% drop in
operating income for its fourth quarter, ended May 31,
compared with a year earlier. That slide, analysts say, means
that the company is still losing as much as $3 million a week
from its operations abroad. Federal's own executives concede
that a turnaround is nowhere in sight.
   "We've got a lot of work to do," says Thomas Oliver, the
company's senior vice president of international operations.
   Since entering the European market in 1986, Federal's
executives have warned that the company's international
expansion was a "long-term investment." But now, with
trans-Pacific shipping falling off, air-freight competition
intensifying and volume growth in its U.S. market slowing,
some of Federal's own customers are wondering if the company
knows what it's doing.
   "You do have the feeling that there's a lack of
knowledge," says Manfred Engst, executive vice president of
Schenkers International Forwarders Inc., a Frankfurt-based
freight broker, whose U.S. offices give Federal some $10
million a year of business. "Federal Express says, `If you
want to use us, you use our system.' They don't go a step
further to meet larger customers' needs."
   Many of Federal's problems seem to stem from an identity
crisis. In purchasing Tiger International Inc. for $880
million last year, Federal acquired 6,000 employees, 41
airplanes and airport facilities on five continents, all
geared toward what is known in the air-freight industry as
the wholesale business -- the movement of heavy cargo from
airport to airport.
   Federal itself, however, has always been a retailer -- a
specialist in overnight, door-to-door delivery of small
packages. The differences in operating demands between the
"back-door" and "front-door" businesses -- that is, between
wholesale and retail -- have proven difficult for Federal to
reconcile.
   Harsh words have been exchanged between former Tiger
managers and their new bosses; several senior Tiger
executives, including the concern's top officer in Japan and
its chief liaison to U.S. freight forwarders, have quit. And
some of the acquired airline's biggest customers have fled to
other carriers.
   In all, says Edwin C. Laird, director of Air Cargo
Management Group, a Seattle-based consulting firm, Federal
has lost more than $200 million a year of the revenue that
Tiger had been earning. "They don't understand the
heavyweight business," he says.
   Two years ago, $40 million of that Tiger business came
from one customer, Columbus, Ohio-based retailer Limited
Inc., the world's largest air-freight shipper over the
Pacific, says Mr. Laird. But shortly after acquiring Tiger,
which had a large hub in Columbus, Federal lost most of
Limited's business to competitors because Federal insisted on
altering the route used to fly Limited's Asia-made clothes to
Columbus, says James Murray, former director of Tiger's
Columbus hub.
   Despite pleas from Limited's executives, Federal
consolidated Tiger's Midwest operations in Indianapolis.
After several weeks of less timely or unpredictable service,
Limited took most of its business -- projected at more than
$60 million last year -- elsewhere, Mr. Murray says.
   "The Limited saw something they had spent so many years
building up fall apart in a night," says Mr. Murray. A
Limited spokeswoman declined to comment.
   Mr. Oliver, Federal's senior vice president, says Federal
let some of its Limited business go because rates were too
low. In retrospect, he says, given the downturn in
trans-Pacific shipping this year, "We should have been more
aggressive in trying to keep it."
   Federal's identity problems have also hurt its
relationships with freight forwarders, the middlemen who book
door-to-door transportation for their clients' goods. Such
freight brokers had been Tiger's main customers, but many,
especially in Europe where Tiger isn't as entrenched as in
Asia, have refused to deal with Federal because they see it
as a possible door-to-door competitor. Though Federal has
promised forwarders it won't offer door-to-door delivery for
goods weighing more than 150 pounds, suspicion lingers.
   "It's just human nature to feel leery of supporting a
competitor," says Jack Cella, executive vice president of
Airborne Freight Corp., a freight forwarder and a Federal
Express rival in the U.S. express-delivery market. Mr. Cella
says Airborne has awarded roughly $8 million a year, or 30%,
of its former Tiger business to other carriers.
   "What's to stop Federal from saying, `Hey, I'm not going
to be a nice guy any more'?" Mr. Cella asks.
   That may have already happened. Mr. Engst of Schenkers
International says he has heard from several of his salesmen
in the field that Federal has been calling on Schenkers
customers. And Jerry Sannebeck, station manager for Circle
Air Freight, a San Francisco-based forwarder, says Circle's
salesmen have found themselves selling directly against
Federal in the past few months.
   "At the branch level, we can't see ourselves even
associated with Federal in a couple of years," says Mr.
Sannebeck, who currently uses Federal on a number of routes
to Asia. "All things being equal, I'd use another carrier."
   Federal's Mr. Oliver says the company's relationship with
forwarders is "steadily improving." He says Federal's main
problem with its heavy-cargo operations is a slowdown of
U.S.-bound shipments from Asia caused by the softening U.S.
economy. "Unfortunately, we got ourselves into a situation
where capacity went up a bit when the market was going down,"
says Mr. Oliver.
   Federal's costly foray overseas would probably raise fewer
concerns if the company's domestic business hadn't slowed so
significantly. Since April, Federal's average daily volume of
express packages has been rising about 11% from a year
earlier. For some time before then, average daily volume was
generally up 16% to 20%.
   "They've got their cost problems under control" since the
Tiger purchase, says Kevin Murphy, transportation analyst
with Morgan Stanley. "But now they've got a revenue problem."
   Mr. Laird of Air Cargo Management says the U.S. market's
sluggishness must be particularly worrisome to Federal, given
the threat it faces from giant United Parcel Service Inc.
It's only a matter of time, says Mr. Laird, until UPS goes
after Federal's bread and butter: its premium overnight
service with pickup and delivery on demand.
   "When UPS becomes more user-friendly, it could eat very
seriously into Federal," Mr. Laird says.
   But Mr. Smith, Federal's chairman and chief executive,
professes not to worry. He declined to be interviewed for
this story, but he told a trade journal recently:
   "If you dissect the numbers and see how Federal Express is
doing with its traditional U.S. franchise -- market share is
going up, margins are improving, service levels are getting
better, (even) with the aberration of the international
stuff. So people are saying, in the last analysis, if
everything else fails they could just stop doing the
international, and (Federal Express) is still a damn good
thing."

   More than 10,000 people including George Bush, Ronald
Reagan and Gerald Ford turned out yesterday for the opening
of the Richard Nixon presidential library in his birthplace
of Yorba Linda, outside Los Angeles. As always with Mr.
Nixon, there's something a little unusual about this library.
Unlike other presidential libraries, this one doesn't contain
Mr. Nixon's official papers. Congress seized some 42 million
pages of documents and thousands of hours of tapes when Mr.
Nixon left office. These remain in a Virginia warehouse.
Maybe someday Congress will decide to free these hostages.

   U.S. Shoe's Stock
   Falls on Problems
   At Lenscrafters

SPECIALTY APPAREL RETAILERS (SAP)
</IN>
<LP>
   U.S. Shoe Corp. said falling sales in its once-invincible
Lenscrafters unit will torpedo second-quarter earnings. The
announcement rattled investors who viewed the specialty
optical chain as the one strong horse in the company's
otherwise erratic stable of businesses.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, U.S. Shoe stock tumbled 19%, or $4.25 a share,
closing at $18. The stock plunged 9.2% Wednesday on rumors of
an earnings dropoff.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts blamed the sales drop on increased competition
among optical retailers. While no other national chain offers
the type of one-hour turnaround service that Lenscrafters
does, more local optical centers are opening up, with
aggressive marketing and discounting strategies.
   Bannus B. Hudson, U.S. Shoe's chairman and chief executive
officer, said Lenscrafters' problems reflect slack demand
industrywide. Despite a strong first quarter, sales for
eyeglasses are down between 14% to 16% for the quarter, he
said. Mr. Hudson had no explanation for the sudden decline.
   "There's nothing going on to explain this," he said. "But
we don't view it as a long-term change in the market."
   Lenscrafters is also in the midst of an expensive
expansion -- it plans to add 100 stores this year -- but Mr.
Hudson said there are no plans to change that plan.
   Whatever the cause, the falloff was a blow to U.S. Shoe,
which has relied on Lenscrafters' double-digit growth over
the past several years to compensate for inconsistent
performance in the company's specialty apparel and foot
divisions. With $520 million in sales last year, Lenscrafters
accounted for 21% of sales and 37% of earnings.
   What's more, Lenscrafters has been the hook upon which
many on Wall Street hung their investments. "Lenscrafters is
the one rock on which the valuation of the company is based,"
said Barry Bryant, a retail analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities. "People who like the stock think Lenscrafters is
worth what the whole company is selling for."
   U.S. Shoe said its second-quarter earnings would be below
the year-earlier net of $2.6 million, or six cents a share.
Those are restated to reflect accounting irregularities
discovered this year in a shoe import unit. Prior to
restatement, the company earned $5.9 million, or 13 cents a
share.
   Besides Lenscrafters, U.S. Shoe is struggling to
revitalize its specialty retail unit, which hasn't kept pace
with such giants as Limited Inc. and Gap Inc. The company
shoe business saw a sharp drop in operating earnings late
last year but rebounded in the first quarter.

   LSI Logic Chips
   To Clone Mips
   Workstations

   MILPITAS, Calif. -- LSI Logic Corp., in the latest move
toward ever-cheaper workstations, unveiled a set of chips
that will let computer makers clone workstations based on
Mips Computer Systems Inc.'s popular computer architecture.
   The "chip set," called Mipset, could spark a proliferation
of inexpensive Unix workstation clones, much as earlier chip
sets helped computer makers in the mid-1980s clone
International Business Machines Corp.'s personal computers
from off-the-shelf parts. "It's an important first step
toward lowering the barrier to entering the workstation
market," said Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor
Report, a newsletter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new chip set also places LSI Logic in a unique
position to tap the booming market for workstations, powerful
desktop machines used most often by engineers but
increasingly popular for business applications as their
prices fall to compete with personal computers. LSI Logic
already makes a chip set for clones of Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s machines, which, along with Mips-architecture
machines, hold the lion's share of the market for
workstations using reduced-instruction-set computing, or
Risc, technology.
   The LSI Logic chip set squeezes into five chips the
circuits that normally occupy more than 40 chips in
conventional Mips machines. The chip set would allow a
manufacturer to build a workstation without spending the time
and money to design it from scratch.
   "All they need to do is put a box around it, add a screen
and a keyboard, and they're in business," said Keisuke
Yawata, president of LSI Logic's Japanese subsidiary, which
designed the chip set and manufactures it in Japan.
   One of the first users of the chips will be Japan's
Brother Industries Ltd., which is building a laptop
workstation without any prior experience in making computers.
Four other Japanese and U.S. companies plan to build the
chips into laser printers and computers, Mr. Yawata said.
Japanese engineers designed the chip in Japan to help attract
buyers among Japanese electronics companies, which are more
comfortable with chips produced in that country, he said.
   LSI Logic said it will begin shipping immediately samples
of its Mipset and will produce mass quantities by the year's
end. The chips are available in two versions, a $704 version
operating at 16 million and a $1,097 set running at 20
million instructions per second, LSI Logic said.
   The new chip set is also important to Mips, which has
licensed a broad range of companies to make and use its chips
as part of its battle against Sun and others to establish the
Mips chip as a de facto standard for Unix workstations. Sun
is also in the unlikely position of encouraging clones of its
machines in order to woo computer users into its camp.
   LSI Logic gets the best of both worlds as the only big
maker to produce both Sun and Mips chips under license. "From
their point of view, it's an awfully comfortable position,"
said Mr. Slater. Still, he said, the financial success of LSI
Logic's chip sets depends on its customers' ability to eat
into the personal computer market, which is much larger than
the Unix workstation market. "They've got to get onto
mainstream business desktops; that's where the volume is," he
said.

   HILTON HOTELS Corp. said it filed a registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed
offering of notes, due in 2005, with a principal amount of
$650 million. The Beverly Hills, Calif., owner and operator
of hotels and casinos said the notes are zero coupon, so the
offering is expected to result in proceeds to Hilton of only
$270 million. The notes will have a principal amount when
they mature of $650 million, representing a 6% yield to
maturity. The notes also are subordinated and convertible
into Hilton common. Hilton said it will use the proceeds for
general cororate purposes, possibly including repayment of
debt.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   U.S. to Raise Fees
   For Concessions
   At National Parks

   WASHINGTON -- Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan announced a
new policy that will allow the government to pocket a greater
share of tourist dollars spent on food, lodging and other
concessions at national parks.
   The department intends to raise the franchise fees that
private companies pay the government for the right to operate
concessions ranging from luxury hotels to souvenir stands to
canoe rentals at parks, historical battlefields and
recreation areas managed by the National Park Service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There have long been complaints that some of the fees paid
by more than 560 private contractors are too low. At Yosemite
National Park in California, for example, a subsidiary of MCA
Inc. pays the government only 0.75% of gross revenue from
concessions that yielded it revenue of about $85 million last
year. Its franchise fee, among the lowest, hasn't been raised
since 1963, although the company currently is negotiating a
contract with a higher fee.
   Mr. Lujan also said he will seek legislative changes to
inject greater competition in the awarding of concessions
contracts.
   The move was hailed by conservation groups that have been
critical of monopolistic concessions contracts they feel were
too favorable to private concerns. "For too long now, too
many concessionaires have been getting a sweetheart deal,"
said Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and
Conservation Association. He called Mr. Lujan's new policy
"right on target."
   In 1988, private companies took in about $500 million from
providing services at the parks, of which the government
received $15 million.
   The average franchise fee is now 2.5% of gross receipts.
As contracts come up for renewal, Mr. Lujan said, he hopes to
raise the fees to as much as 22%, depending on the size and
profitability of the concessionaire. The formula for setting
a new fee is to be worked out on a contract-by-contract basis
that provides contractors "a reasonable opportunity for
profit." About 25% of the contracts outstanding come up for
renewal in the next few years.
   To increase competition in contract renewals, Mr. Lujan
said he will push to change provisions in current law that
give contractors preferential rights to renew their
contracts. He also indicated he favors changes to keep
concessionaires from demanding such steep compensation for
improvements they have made on the premises that it blocks
new bidders from buying out the interests.
   The secretary didn't take any action on a National Park
Service recommendation to reduce concessionaires' ownership
interest in park facilities such as hotels and restaurants
and eventually turn over ownership to the government. A
spokesman said the recommendation is still under
consideration.

CONGRESS (CNG)

<LP>
   On Tuesday the House came within seven votes of passing a
balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. The amendment
won 43 more votes than in the last attempt in 1982. No doubt
Members who voted in favor will trumpet that support
throughout their fall campaigns. But many of them will have
paid only lip service to what voters really want: a balanced
budget that restrains the uncontrolled growth of the federal
government.
   The House considered two balanced-budget amendments. The
one that came close to being adopted was sponsored by Texas
Democrat Charles Stenholm and Idaho Republican Larry Craig.
It required a balanced budget unless a three-fifths vote of
both houses declared otherwise. However, to raise taxes to
balance the budget only a simple majority was required. That
created a procedural path of least resistance in favor of tax
increases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Before the vote on the Stenholm-Craig proposal, the House
considered a substitute amendment by GOP Rep. Joe Barton of
Texas. The Barton amendment was similar to Stenholm-Craig,
but also limited increases in government revenues to the
growth in national income unless a three-fifths vote of
Congress decided otherwise. That limitation mirrored several
found in state constitutions.
   By requiring the same super-majority to raise taxes and
increase spending, the Barton amendment leveled the playing
field. It made it unlikely that Members of Congress could
raise taxes by majority vote and use the three-fifths
requirement to violate a balanced budget as the excuse: "The
Constitution made me raise your taxes."
   While Stenholm-Craig was favored by 279 to 150 -- still
not the required two-thirds -- the Barton substitute lost by
244 to 184. The Members who voted against both obviously have
no interest in changing the system that got us into the
current mess. The 95 Members of Congress -- 74 Democrats and
21 Republicans -- whose names appear below voted for
Stenholm-Craig but against Barton. In effect, they are trying
to have it both ways. Those Members wanted to be recorded as
supporting a balanced budget, but at the same time make
certain they buried the amendment that would have put a real
crimp in the spending habits that create deficit spending.
   Members have become masters at using House rules to
obfuscate votes and confuse voters as to their real stand on
issues. No doubt many of these 95 Members will have
interesting explanations for why they opposed a
balanced-budget amendment with teeth:

   AMSTERDAM -- Dutch industrial production in May declined
1% from April, the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics said.
   But in the first five months of the year, output grew 5%
from a year earlier, when the year-to-year increase was 4%.
The latest five-month pace was led by the electrical
engineering, rubber and synthetics, and metals industries.

   Schering-Plough Corp. posted a 20% profit gain for the
second quarter, and Becton, Dickinson &amp; Co. reported a 46%
drop in net income because of a gain in the year-earlier
period.
   Schering-Plough, Madison, N.J., said net increased to
$144.1 million, or 64 cents a share, from $120.5 million, or
53 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 7% to $864
million from $805.5 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said the biggest reason for the gain was
growth in its pharmaceutical business in the U.S. and
overseas. If not for a 1989 divestiture of a majority stake
in a Brazilian venture, pharmaceutical sales would have
increased 18% in the quarter, the company said.
   Schering-Plough's Maybelline cosmetic business did poorly,
although the company noted that business was sold this month.
In addition, sales of health care products declined 8% in the
quarter. Still, the company said its total sales would have
increased 12% in the quarter if not for the Brazilian
divestiture and the sale last year of the company's European
cosmetics operations.
   In the first half, the company said net rose 20% to $294.5
million, or $1.30 a share, from $246.2 million, or $1.09 a
share, as sales increased 6% to $1.73 billion from $1.64
billion. The company reiterated its prediction that per-share
earnings for the year will grow by 18% to 20%.
   At Becton Dickinson, net declined in its third quarter,
ended June 30, to $46.7 million, or $1.20 a share, from $86.4
million, or $2.19 a share. But that drop occurred solely
because the year-earlier period included a substantial gain
on the sale of an industrial glove business. If not for that
gain and the profit from those operations in the year-earlier
period, profit in the latest quarter would have been up 20%.
Sales rose 12% to $496.6 million from $442.8 million.
   Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J., said the results
show that its operating margins are improving and that sales
growth is increasing. It said that international sales
growth, at 18%, was especially strong in the quarter.
   In the nine months, net dropped 25% to $120 million, or
$3.07 a share, from $159.1 million, or $4 a share. Earnings
would have risen 16% without the profit and gain from
discontinued operations in the year-earlier period. Sales
climbed 10% to $1.45 billion from $1.31 billion.
   The strong results continue a recent string of impressive
reports from drug makers.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Schering-Plough shares slipped 25 cents to $49.875, while
Becton Dickinson stock climbed 87.5 cents to $74.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices fell sharply at first, as
investors fretted about corporate earnings disappointments,
then bounced back with help from program trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average squeezed out a
12.13-point gain in the last hour of trading, closing at
2993.81 in moderately active trading. The average had been
down 22 points in the morning.

   Bond prices drifted slightly lower in light trading, and
the dollar ended mixed. Both bond and currency markets were
languishing in the aftereffects of Wednesday's
worse-than-expected inflation news and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's murky comments about monetary
policy.
   In the stock market, prices fell through much of the day,
led by a rout in technology stocks that was sparked by
disappointing earnings news. Many of the same issues later
retraced part of their lost ground, followed by a rally in
oil stocks stemming from news that less petroleum will flow
through the Alaskan pipeline.
   Near the end of the session, program traders swooped in to
buy the stocks in the Major Market Index, which mimics the
Dow Jones industrials.
   Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty-First
Securities, said the price of the MMI futures contract that
expires today on the Chicago Board of Trade rose to a premium
big enough to prompt program traders to sell the futures and
buy the 20 underlying stocks, 17 of which are also in the Dow
Jones industrials.
   Today's expiration of the MMI contract could cause erratic
stock market action, cautioned Robert S. Robbins, market
strategist at Robinson-Humphrey Co., Atlanta. Added Donald
Selkin, head of stock-index research at Prudential-Bache
Securities: "Fasten your seat belts."
   Bond investors were still digesting the spate of economic
news Wednesday, said John Slosberg, senior fixed-income
analyst at Thompson Financial Networks, Boston. "The market
was suffering sort of a hangover from the previous day's
steep drop," he said, adding that inflation has reemerged as
a major concern.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on volume of 162 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading, where declining issues
outnumbered advancers, 858 to 621.
   Bond prices eased less than an eighth of a point, or less
than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.55%.
   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6410 marks and 148.10 yen, compared
with 1.6480 marks and 147.75 yen Wednesday.

   `Pen' Makes Injections
   Easier for Diabetics
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   FOR DECADES, diabetics who require regular insulin
injections have faced double trouble: coping with undesired
attention and lots of paraphernalia when applying vital
injections.
   Both problems are addressed by the Novopen, a
simple-to-use injection device produced by a unit of
Denmark's Novo Nordisk. The Novopen is compact and nonmedical
in appearance and does away with most of the gear previously
needed by diabetics.
   A user doesn't have to bother with vials of insulin; the
dose is in cartridges that fit into the body of the penlike
device. Dosage is regulated with a twist of the Novopen's
cylindrical stem, and the injection is given with a push of a
button.
   "People like it because of sheer convenience and the fact
you don't look like a drug addict," says Bernard Sams, 59
years old and principal designer at London's Sams Design, who
led the team that developed the pen.
   Jorgen Elnegaard, Novo Nordisk's president of diabetes
care, says nearly 10% of the developed world's diabetics have
switched to the pen-delivery system in the past several
years. Competitors are devising similar devices, some of
which -- including the Novopen -- are available in the U.S.
   The Novopen and other finalists in a BBC design
competition reflect a renaissance in British industrial
design. Buoyed by the nation's economic and industrial
turnaround of the '80s, the return to international
prominence follows years of such disasters as the
cockroach-shaped British Leyland cars of the 1970s.
   The three finalists described here underscore British
skill at using common materials -- such as plastics and
unalluring metals -- in economical and user-friendly ways.
The winners will be selected in a BBC special Sunday.
                                                                                                       

   Computer Hopes It Has
   Keyboard to Success
                                                                                                       

   THE AGENDA, a new entry in the "palmtop" computer market,
replicates a court stenographer's keyboard to speed typing.
But with the market already crowded, Microwriter Systems
faces an uphill battle.
   The Agenda is a checkbook-sized computer whose 32
kilobytes (20 typed pages) of standard memory are expandable
to 96 kilobytes. It's an electronic organizer, calculator and
word processor.
   Agenda's edge -- and drawback -- is its quick-entry text
system. It has a normal 26-character keyboard, but also
features a text-entry system called microwriting, which
allows users to type faster than most touch typists by
mastering a system of keystrokes on five extra keys.
   Learning the system takes at least several days of
diligent study. Mastering the Agenda also means learning a
new operating system, the basic instructions on which a
computer runs, which many PC users could resist. "People who
find it is important to them learn quickly," says Sir Mark
Weinberg, Microwriter chairman. He adds that with optional
software, an Agenda can be easily hooked into an office
personal computer.
   Though its nifty design distinguishes the Agenda from its
competitors, Sir Mark concedes that the greater marketing
muscle of such rivals as Sharp puts closely held Microwriter
Systems at a disadvantage. Microwriter is considering a joint
venture or sale of a large stake to one of a number of larger
computer markers.
                                                                                                       

   Trying to Change
   Image of Microscopes
                                                                                                       

   IN VICTORIAN times, says British businessman Keith
Dunning, most middle- and upper-class British households
proudly displayed a microscope in their living rooms. But the
device's design "has changed so little over the past hundred
years that it no longer has much appeal as an object," he
says.
   Mr. Dunning's company, Science of Cambridge, is trying to
change that. Earlier this year it began making the Lensman, a
pocket-size microscope. The Lensman magnifies images
horizontally, through an origami-like system of folded
mirrors, rather than vertically as in most microscopes.
   The battery-powered Lensman, which weighs less than nine
ounces and is four inches wide, magnifies at 80 times and 200
times, about half the usual college-laboratory maximum.
Students are an obvious market, but Mr. Dunning hopes for
more interest from such professionals and hobbyists as
veterinarians, police officers and environmentalists who
could use portable magnifying power in their work.
   But the Lensman has drawbacks. Many professionals need
more power than it can provide, and its light source is too
dark for some uses. Still, Mr. Dunning says Science of
Cambridge is working on both lower-powered and higher-powered
models. He says his company has sold several hundred Lensmen
since May.

   LONG ISLAND LIGHTING Co. (Hicksville, N.Y.) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it raised its ratings on $4.3
billion of securities of this utility. The rating concern
cited a rate settlement, a financial restructuring and the
removal of potentially substantial liabilities related to
charges filed against Lilco under anti-racketeering statutes.
Moody's upgraded its ratings on Lilco's first mortgage and
general and refunding bonds to Baa-3 from Ba-1; debentures
and unsecured pollution-control bonds to Ba-1 from Ba-2; and
preferred stock to Ba-2 from Ba-3.

   NEW YORK -- Lancer Industries Inc. said it received $135
million in new credit, mostly from banks, to refinance a
bridge loan made in its acquisition of Fairfield
Manufacturing Co.
   The new financing consists of $105 million from a group of
banks led by Bank of America, and $30 million in subordinated
debt issued to institutional investors, Lancer said. The
bridge loan is with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lancer, formerly known as McLean Industries Inc., said it
also completed a $25 million financing with Westinghouse
Credit Corp. by issuing subordinated notes.
   Lancer Chairman Paul S. Levy said the new financing lowers
the company's debt service levels and provides "long-term
financing for future operations and our acquisition program."
The company's businesses include specialty packaging and
textile printing.

   Fraud Is Called Small Factor in S&amp;L Cost
   ---
   Consultant's Study Cites Real
   Estate Values, High Rates

   WASHINGTON -- You wouldn't know it from listening to
Congress and the Bush administration these days, but only a
small part of the billions of dollars in savings-and-loan
losses went to fraud, an industry consultant says.
   The "S&amp;L crooks" being pilloried on Capitol Hill actually
are responsible for $5 billion, or roughly 3%, of the losses
now being absorbed by taxpayers, according to
savings-and-loan consultant Bert Ely of Ely &amp; Co.,
Alexandria, Va. Most of the losses come from falling real
estate values and from excessive interest rates paid by sick
thrifts to attract depositors, he calculates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Ely estimates the federal government's total losses on
S&amp;Ls at $147 billion, excluding interest based on current
borrowing. The administration's latest forecast puts the
losses at between $90 billion and $130 billion, not including
interest. Economists project that the final bill over 40
years, including interest, could exceed $500 billion.
   Mr. Ely, a frequently quoted analyst and consultant, was
among the first to estimate how high the thrift losses would
actually pile up. His study, he says, is a rough answer to
the question: Where did the S&amp;L money go? It is a question
that was being asked with increased urgency in recent weeks
as it became clear that the S&amp;L cleanup was having a
devastating effect on the federal budget.
   Using admittedly imprecise estimates based on reports that
the S&amp;Ls themselves submit to government regulators, as well
as other macroeconomic data, the study nonetheless carves the
S&amp;L puzzle into pieces that can be compared by size. "I don't
think anyone has tried to put all the numbers together in a
meaningful way," Mr. Ely says.
   Some loss categories are relatively easy to ascertain, Mr.
Ely says. For example, the thrift industry's junk-bond
holdings amount to about $3 billion in losses. The study
assumes a 20% loss on $15 billion, the most that S&amp;Ls
invested in the high-risk, high-yield instruments at any one
time. That represents losses on both the market value of the
bonds and the bond issuers' defaults.
   "To listen to some people on Capitol Hill, you would think
junk bonds caused the end of Western civilization," Mr. Ely
says. "That's just not true."
   He estimates that because pre-1983 losses weren't
addressed at the time, an additional $43 billion in interest
costs piled up. The next biggest chunk of losses, $28
billion, stems from real estate, including falling property
values, poor judgment in evaluating loans and the physical
deterioration of repossessed real estate.
   A further $25 billion stems from S&amp;L losses prior to 1983.
Millions of homebuyers acquired fixed-rate mortgages while
overall interest rates rose during the 1980s. They benefit
every month, while the thrifts lose money.
   About $14 billion went straight into the pockets of
depositors at insolvent institutions. To attract deposits,
those ailing thrifts, with roughly $350 billion in deposits,
paid interest rates one-half to three-quarters of a
percentage point higher than healthy competitors paid --
knowing that even if they failed, the government would pick
up the tab. That cash also benefited deposit brokers, who
routinely moved around $100,000 blocks of government-insured
money to chase the highest rates.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. said yesterday that it expects
to bring major fraud actions at 40% of the roughly 450 failed
savings and loan associations. But even so, industry and
government sources say the government will recoup far less
than $1 billion. Nonetheless, assailing S&amp;L fraud has been a
recurring theme in Congress, and it prompted President Bush
last month to hold a virtual pep rally with several hundred
federal prosecutors to encourage them to catch S&amp;L looters.
Neil Bush, the president's son, is facing administrative
charges over alleged conflicts of interest at an insolvent
S&amp;L where he was a director.
   Economists say that government officials attribute the S&amp;L
mess to fraud because it's easier to do so than to explain
why they delayed the cleanup and added to the costs. "If
there was so much fraud," asks James Barth, an Auburn
University economist formerly with the thrift regulatory
agency, "why are we just hearing about it today? If it was
there for all those years, who is committing the fraud, the
government or the people at the institutions?"

   Mattel Close
   To Toppling
   No. 1 Hasbro

   With Barbie flying high and G.I. Joe stuck in the
trenches, Mattel Inc. may be on its way to recapturing the
crown of world's largest toy maker from rival Hasbro Inc. for
the first time since the mid-1980s. Clearly Mattel will end
the year as the world's most profitable toy company.
   Beyond satisfying some corporate egos, the mythical titles
can mean extra clout with the world's toy sellers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Being the world's largest tends to give a company some
extra shelf space and shelf life for their new products,
although the long-term results still depend on a toy's play
value," says David S. Leibowitz an analyst with American
Securities.
   While pinning the ups and down of the toy giants on just
two toy lines is a bit simplistic, it's clear that Hasbro's
major toy line for boys has continued to be hurt by the
staying power of Nintendo and other video games, while Barbie
has flourished more than at any time since her birth in 1959.
   Both Mattel and Hasbro reported second-quarter results
yesterday. While Mattel's sales rose 17% to a record $318
million, Hasbro's were down 8% to $277.3 million. Hasbro
still held a narrow lead for the first half, but the gap is
clearly narrowing and many Mattel employees think they'll
capture the gold ring by year end. Mattel's second-quarter
net income rose 22% to a record $20.3 million, while Hasbro's
plummeted 50% to $8.7 million.
   Hasbro's chairman and chief executive, Alan G. Hassenfeld,
says that if anticipated improvements in customer order
trends occur and response is positive to some new toys being
shipped this quarter, full-year results should be about the
same as in 1989, when Hasbro earned $92.2 million, or $1.56 a
share, on revenue of $1.41 billion.
   John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive,
said the company is continuing to gain market share. The toy
maker, which recently resumed dividend payments on common
stock for the first time in seven years, previously projected
double-digit sales growth for 1990. Last year Mattel had
sales of $1.24 billion.
   Hasbro grew rapidly in the 1980s, largely from
acquisitions but in part by spotting hot toys and marketing
them aggressively. Transformers and My Little Pony were
megahits, the kind of toys that children nag their parents to
buy. While Mattel had hot toy lines, especially He Man and
the Masters of the Universe, it took years to recover from a
disastrous plunge into electronics that resulted in a $394
million loss in 1983.
   Hasbro's sales grew to $1.23 billion in 1985 from $107.4
million in 1981, surpassing Mattel, with its 1985 sales of
$1.05 billion, for the first time. Since then, Hasbro has
grown modestly, as it has failed to come up with any new
megahits while its hot toys of the past showed signs of
aging.
   In reporting the 50% decline in second-quarter earnings,
for example, Hasbro's chairman cited weakening sales of two
mainstay toy lines, G.I. Joe and Transformers, which are both
suffering at the hands of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Hasbro also plans to discontinue its Record Breakers race-car
line, which failed to meet its high expectations.
   While Hasbro strived for volume, new Mattel management
under Mr. Amerman criticized past managers' "top line"
orientation -- which led to several years when retailers were
stuck with tons of unsold Mattel toys after Christmas -- and
concentrated on steadily improving the company's
profitability.
   Mattel remains the largest toy company in terms of sales
outside the U.S., where many analysts see the industry's
largest growth coming this decade. Despite its general
weakness in the U.S., Hasbro says its international business
is going strong.
   Mr. Leibowitz, the analyst, thinks it's still too early to
predict who will wear the 1990 toy sales crown. "As things
stand today it will be a very close race, and the reorders
late this quarter and early in the fourth quarter will tell
the story," he says.
   James Eskridge, Mattel's executive vice president and
chief financial officer, is also leery of making predictions.
"Since Mattel has been at the top of the industry for so
long, it's not nearly as important for us to be called No. 1
in sales," he says. "Look, I worked for General Motors for a
lot of years, and while people can say GM is the largest,
Ford laughs all the way to the bank."
   Likewise, says Mr. Eskridge, Mattel clearly expects its
income from operations to top Hasbro's this year. "We'll have
a very good second half, and Hasbro is saying things will
have to break right to even equal last year."
   What if it gets down to the wire and a shipment of another
$25 million in December will win back the sales title for
Mattel? "If it means risking profitability and leftover
inventory," says Mr. Eskridge, "there's no way we'd ship it."

   OTC Focus:
   Technology Stocks
   Take a Beating
   On Earnings News

   Investors took technology stocks to the woodshed
yesterday, following unexpectedly negative profit news from
Lotus Development and Apple Computer, and nowhere were the
beatings worse than in the over-the-counter market.
   "It was tech-wreck day," said Mitchell Meiser, senior vice
president of OTC trading at Lehman Brothers. Like traders at
PaineWebber in New York and Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta, Mr.
Meiser said that sellers dominated activity much of the day
before buyers ventured back in during the afternoon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the bargain hunters trimmed the day's worst losses,
the OTC market failed to rebound into positive territory as
New York Stock Exchange issues did. The Nasdaq Composite
Index fell to its lowest level since June 27, dropping 2.65,
or 0.58%, to 458.17; it had been down about six points at
midday. Volume was a brisk 182.6 million shares, and
declining stocks outpaced advancing issues 1,116 to 791.
   Lotus was the most active OTC issue, plummeting 6 1/8 to
25 1/8 on 10.3 million shares; it didn't recover much from
its day's low of 24. The Cambridge, Mass., software concern
shocked analysts Wednesday by announcing its third-quarter
earnings may fall short of year-earlier profit.
   Apple Computer also contributed heavily to the
technology-stock dive, falling 2 7/8 to 41 3/4 on 5.2 million
shares; it traded as low as 40. The Cupertino, Calif.,
computer maker cautioned analysts that earnings in its
current fiscal fourth quarter might trail year-earlier
results.
   Though other technology companies didn't join in the
disappointment chorus, their stocks were hammered, too. Sun
Microsystems fell 3/4 to 34; Conner Peripherals lost 1/2 to
29 3/4; Intel sank 3/4 to 47 3/4; Seagate Technology fell 5/8
to 13 5/8, and Autodesk dropped 7/8 to 56 5/8.
   The Nasdaq Industrial Index, which includes most
technology shares, lost 4.07 to 496.59, or 0.8%, recovering
from a midday low of 493.32. That index just reached an
all-time high of 510.61 on Monday.
   Despite the heavy selling, managers of OTC and technology
portfolios at several mutual funds said they don't believe
the day's losses signal a long-term setback for technology
issues.
   "It's a typical correction in the land of technology,"
said Richard Frucci, senior vice president for Putnam
Information Sciences Trust in Boston. "I don't think it will
lead the market down," he said, adding that he still expects
technology issues this year will outperform both the Nasdaq
Composite Index and the larger Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index.
   Alan Radlo, portfolio manager of the $734 million Fidelity
OTC Portfolio, said he believed the day's sellers consisted
of a number of investors who climbed onto the technology
bandwagon late in its mid-year climb to levels well above the
broader Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P indexes.
   "I think it's a setback for people who threw money {at
technology stocks} and didn't know what they own," he said.
"You get these whipsaws and they're expected."
   Like Roger McNamee, manager of the T. Rowe Price Science
and Technology Fund, Mr. Radlo said he was taking advantage
of the overall decline in technology issues to buy some of
his favorite stocks.
   However, analysts said they don't expect Lotus's shares to
bounce back soon. Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Michele Preston said
she expects Lotus to recover next year as it introduces new
versions of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet software. After yesterday's
drop, she said, the stock is selling at a relatively low nine
times her 1991 earnings estimate of $2.60 a share, which she
lowered yesterday from $2.90 previously. Ms. Preston said she
lowered her Lotus earnings estimate for 1990 to $2.10 a share
from $2.30 previously.
   Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund said in an interview
he is maintaining his "sell" recommendation on Lotus and
doesn't expect the software developer to recover until it
brings out a version of its spreadsheet software that is
compatible with the well-received new Windows 3.0 software
recently introduced by Microsoft. The analyst added that he
doesn't expect Lotus to introduce that product until the
middle of next year and predicts "the market will pass it by"
until the new version is available.
   Despite yesterday's sell-off, analysts say they don't
expect technology stocks to follow the pattern of recent
years: good performance until mid-year, followed by
underperformance for the remainder of the year, caused
largely by a seasonal slowdown in business.
   This year will be different, analysts assert.
   "We're about to embark on one of the most important new
product cycles in the industry's history," said Ms. Preston
of Cowen, though that transition will bring both good and bad
news. Companies such as Apple and Lotus may stumble as they
adapt to the transition, she said. But in 12 to 18 months,
with new products on the market, she expects growth at those
companies to accelerate.
   Leading the way in the new product cycle is Microsoft,
with its much-touted Windows 3.0 software. The software is
based on what is known in computer jargon as "graphical user
interface," or the use of pictures, rather than characters,
on computer screens to guide users.
   "Going from the character mode to the graphics mode is a
big hurdle," agrees Mr. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs. He adds
that companies such as Lotus will have to scramble to come up
with products that adapt to the new standards.
   "Rapid and evolutionary and revolutionary changes are
occurring in technology," said Mr. Radlo, adding that he
believes U.S. companies are in the forefront of those changes
and will benefit, particularly next year, as the new products
are introduced and sold overseas.
   But companies with good earnings news weren't punished
indiscriminately. American Ecology rose 2 to 10 1/4. The
Agoura Hills, Calif., waste disposal company Wednesday
reported net income for the second quarter of 57 cents a
share, compared with a loss a year earlier of 94 cents.
   SynOptics Communications rose 1 7/8 to 59 after the maker
of computer network systems surprised analysts with second
quarter net income of 34 cents a share, up from 13 cents a
year earlier.

   Anxiety Grows as Comecon's End Nears

   Trading System's Demise
   Could Hit East Bloc Hard

   BUDAPEST, Hungary -- When Eastern Europe's new leaders
called in January for the end of Comecon, the Communist
bloc's ramshackle trading system, it seemed that another
Stalinist edifice was about to crumble amid rejoicing.
   But six months into mapping the postComecon world,
anxieties and second thoughts are spreading. Here in Hungary,
which enjoys a head start in cultivating business ties with
the West, companies are bracing for potentially devastating
shocks next year, when Comecon is supposed to be buried so
that free-market trading can come to life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The widest grins at Comecon's funeral are likely to be
worn not by the Eastern Europeans but by the Soviets, who
stand to gain as much as $16 billion a year when their former
satellites begin paying real money for Soviet oil and gas.
   Talks with government officials, foreign investors and
company managers here drive home the point that four decades
of enforced economic dependence can't be waved away with a
few bold declarations. Without the Soviet energy supplies
that come into Szazhalombatta via the "friendship pipeline,"
Hungary's already weak industrial base would collapse.
Without Soviet markets, Hungary's enterprises would go
begging for customers -- and won't find many in the West
until their products and production methods are overhauled.
   "I believe the breakup of the Comecon market has come too
soon," says Harold Codd, general manager of Ganz-Hunslet, a
Budapest rail-car manufacturer acquired late last year by
U.K.-based Telfos PLC. "There's nothing to replace it."
   For all the worries, no one wants to return to Comecon's
artificial economy, where a centrally planned quota system
has dictated the exchange of energy supplies, industrial
machines and consumer products -- all for a phony currency
known as the "transferable ruble." What Hungarian officials
and other Eastern Europeans are trying to negotiate with
their Soviet trading partners are ways to soften the impact
of the shift.
   At the moment, though, any grace-period arrangements seem
elusive, and the Eastern Europeans are poised to be the big
losers during the transition. By shifting the East bloc's
trade to hard-currency settlements and world-market prices,
the Eastern Europeans will get hit with a double whammy: They
will pay more for the oil and gas they buy from the Soviet
Union and get less for the consumer products and industrial
equipment they sell.
   David Roche, a strategist for Morgan Stanley Co. in
London, predicts that, all told, the death of Comecon will
mean losses for the Eastern European countries equal to as
much as 4% of their gross domestic products. Meanwhile, the
Soviets should gain 0.5% to 1% of GDP from the oil-price
increases alone. Mr. Roche estimates that the higher energy
costs will slug Eastern Europe "with the equivalent force" of
the world-wide energy crisis of 1973 -- but with the East
bloc countries far less able to withstand the blow than
Western industrial nations were then.
   For the Soviets, behind in payments to Western companies
by about $5 billion, the switch to hard currency and market
prices for oil and gas could be a godsend. But for Hungary,
Poland and Bulgaria -- already reeling under whopping debt
burdens -- the change could chew up around 20% of their
hard-currency reserves.
   The situation raises troubling questions about the money
that Western governments and such international institutions
as the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
plan to pump into Eastern Europe. A hefty chunk of it will
flow out to the Soviet Union in the form of higher energy
payments. "You give {the Eastern European countries} money,
the Soviets will take money out," Mr. Roche says. "There's no
conspiracy; that's just how the trade patterns work."
   Roger Robinson, former director of international economics
for the U.S. National Security Council and now a consultant
in Washington, predicts a "major Soviet siphon effort." He
reasons that "the Soviets are in a payments crisis, and
they're going to ask for cash on the barrel." When the U.S.
Congress comes to ratifying and appropriating funds for the
bank, he argues, it should include "a creative building of
safeguards to take account for an ambitious Soviet strategy
that, more often than not, will be adverse to Eastern
European recovery."
   Though pressures for such safeguards will emerge in
Washington, it will be difficult for Congress to put too many
barriers around the $12 billion reconstruction bank. The
institution has been embraced as the West's main vehicle for
helping the reforming East bloc, and U.S.-imposed constraints
will be unpopular in Europe. It also would be awkward for the
U.S. -- the world's main champion of free-market principles
-- to try to bar the Soviets from charging market prices for
energy.
   U.S. and Eastern European officials are hoping the Soviets
will take a lenient attitude and permit a gradual transition.
Allowing cash settlements at the end of a year, instead of
insisting on regular payments upon delivery, would help. But
such leniency is far from assured.
   This year, Tadeush Teodorovich, head of policy planning at
the Soviet Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, said that
-- theoretically, at least -- the Soviets could replace 70%
of the machines and equipment they buy from Eastern Europe
with superior, and often cheaper, items from the West. The
Soviets won't necessarily do that, but Eastern European
officials say they are still negotiating future trade
arrangements.
   Steven Bina, who manages a Schwinn-Csepel joint-venture
bicycle plant in Budapest, says he has been dropping Comecon
suppliers because "we can buy lower-priced, higher-quality
goods in convertible-currency countries." Once Comecon
transactions switch to hard currency, more East bloc
enterprises are likely to opt for Western suppliers.
   According to Oxford Analytica, a research and consulting
company based in Oxford, England, the shift to hard-currency
trade will cost East Germany about $3 billion a year because
of higher energy costs and lower prices on industrial goods
exported to the Soviet Union. The company estimates that the
change will cost Czechoslovakia $2.7 billion, Poland $2.6
billion, Bulgaria $2.5 billion, Hungary $1.9 billion and
Romania just under $1 billion.
   The costs aren't summed up that simply, of course. East
Germany's escape from Comecon will be made both quicker and
easier by unification with West Germany. By contrast,
Hungary's situation is made more severe by the fact that much
of its hard currency goes to servicing its $20 billion
foreign-debt burden, the biggest per-capita debt in Eastern
Europe.
   Energy dependence varies, but analysts say Eastern Europe
counts on the Soviet Union for about 50% of its energy needs.
Moreover, the Soviet Union provides nearly all of the high
end of the energy mix in Eastern Europe -- namely, its oil
and natural gas. For much of Eastern Europe, this dependence
may increase, since the main alternative is locally mined
brown coal, which emits heavy quantities of sulfur dioxide
and is a major culprit in the region's environmental crisis.
   At the same time, however, the Soviet Union's own
worsening economic chaos has sown fears that the onetime
senior Comecon partner is becoming less reliable. Soviet
energy production has hit snags in recent months, for
example. And East bloc enterprises are anything but
encouraged by this year's spectacle of Western companies
waiting months for billions of dollars owed them by the
Soviets. If the payments crisis persists after post-Comecon
trade begins next year, East bloc companies may find
themselves at the end of what is even now a lengthy queue,
waiting to get paid.
   Ikarus, Hungary's beleaguered bus-making company, is one
of the businesses to get an early taste of life without
Comecon. In January, the Hungarian government, awash in
transferable rubles from the Soviets, ordered a moratorium on
sales for such currency. Buses ready for delivery to the
Soviets piled up, filling all the available space in the
company's sprawling plant at the edge of Budapest. Desperate,
Ikarus arranged to roll hundreds of the vehicles into a
nearby stadium.
   In late February, Ikarus received licenses to sell about
1,000 buses to the Soviets, and the following month it got
permission to sell 1,500. That helped, but overall Soviet
deliveries this year are expected to sink to 4,500 buses from
a recent peak of 7,600 annually. Next year, sales are
expected to drop further. On top of lower volume, Ikarus
officials say, prices will come down as well, although
payments will be made in hard currency.
   As the Soviets cut back orders, other Comecon customers
are looking shaky, too. Leipzig, for example, is slated to
receive its 35,000th Ikarus bus in coming weeks -- an
occasion that the company plans to recognize with an official
ceremony in the East German city. However, Ikarus officials
worry that, with Comecon disintegrating and unification with
West Germany pending, Leipzig authorities may switch to
Volkswagen or Mercedes.
   The only hope, says Jozsef Brumbauer, the company's deputy
director for business development, is to scramble for more
business outside the Comecon alliance. To that end, he
recently helped negotiate $100 million of sales to three
Turkish cities. Ikarus is also shipping 170 buses to China
this year in exchange for Swiss francs, and 500 bus bodies to
Baghdad, where they will be outfitted with separately
purchased engines and parts. Despite these successes,
non-Comecon sales will account for only about 17% of the
company's revenue this year.
   The anxieties at Hungarian enterprises notwithstanding,
official statistics show that the country's non-Comecon
exports jumped 16.5% in the first four months of this year
over the comparable period a year earlier. If the increases
continue, they will help shield Hungary from the fallout from
Comecon's dismembering.
   Istvan Tamas, commissioner for Comecon relations at
Hungary's Ministry for International Economic Relations, is
philosophical about it all. "It's a 40-year relationship that
we have formed," he says. "We have to bear the burden and the
consequences. We don't want to be dependent on a market of
Comecon countries."

   Heard on the Street:
   A Curious Bull Market: Bloodletting Doesn't Stop

   NEW YORK -- Is this any way to treat a stock in a bull
market?
   In two blistering days of selling this week, United
Telecommunications lost nearly 30% of its value after a
disappointing second-quarter earnings report.
Building-materials chain Lowe's Cos. tumbled nearly 20% in
the same period when Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst Bruce Missett
downgraded the stock. Lotus Development fell 26% in two days
after telling analysts this week that their third-quarter
profit estimates were too high.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flirting with 3000
after racking up a string of record highs this year. Yet even
as the average is climbing the stairway to heaven, some
individual stocks are sliding into the abyss.
   "It is shades of 1974, shades of 1987 -- and it is the
strangest thing I've ever seen," said Dudley Eppel, head of
equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "The selling
is so indiscriminate; there is such a panic."
   It isn't surprising to see a stock sell-off after a bad
earnings report. What is amazing to Mr. Eppel and several
other big traders on Wall Street is that the selling doesn't
stop.
   "In this market, when they kill a stock it's not over;
they beat it into a thousand deaths," said John B. Burke, an
independent trader on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange. For a bull market, that kind of selling is very
uncharacteristic.
   On various trading desks yesterday, dealers described the
activity in U.S. Shoe, Tandem Computers, HomeFed and Lotus
Development, to name a few, as "merciless"; "aggressive"; and
"amazing."
   The selling storm in certain stocks tells traders that
even though benchmarks are touching the clouds, many
investors think stock prices have to come back to earth.
Buyers aren't satisfied with the market's first attempt at
valuing a stock after bad news.
   No longer do they suddenly term the shares a bargain after
a one-day steep decline. Instead, investors let the
punishment continue a day or two or more before they decide
the stock has hit bottom.
   Said one senior trader at Shearson Lehman Brothers: "In my
first years in this job, when a stock opened down four
dollars we said we should buy it for a turnaround. Now, there
are two or three waves of selling. There's just no holding
back."
   This is the ugly side of the earnings-driven market of
1990. Casting aside concern about U.S. economic growth,
spurred by a mania that sometimes pays little heed to what
industry group a stock may be in, investors are pursuing
growth stocks with earnings that are up at least 15% on
annualized basis from the previous year.
   Five-year earnings growth in Tandem Computers is 21% --
impressive by anyone's measure. Prior to yesterday, when
Tandem reported profit of 30 cents per share for its fiscal
third quarter compared with 31 cents the previous year, the
stock traded at about 19 times the latest 12 months'
earnings. But after its earnings slipped, Tandem suddenly
didn't fit someone's definition of a growth stock. Tandem
fell 1 7/8 yesterday to 19 5/8 on nearly five million shares.
   Witness the classic lamentation of a growth-oriented
analyst: "I am sorely disappointed that they {Tandem} cannot
translate their very powerful product position into revenue
and earnings growth," said Terry Mogil, vice president at
Chancellor Capital Management.
   These days, no company is given a break. Projections of a
quarter or two of slower growth, or earnings that are a penny
or two a share below expectations, are a death sentence.
   Growth stock investors aren't tolerating even small
setbacks. Browning-Ferris Industries is up 13% this year.
Five-year annual earnings growth is a hefty 22%. Yesterday,
however, the company's third-quarter earnings of 54 cents a
share were "about three cents light," according to one
analyst. For that, Browning-Ferris was slammed with a loss of
1 7/8 to close at 43 5/8 in New York Stock Exchange trading
of 1.3 million shares.
   "Institutions tend to walk away if earnings aren't in
line," said the analyst.
   And that's what worries some traders. Big investors have
been stocking up on growth stocks. Punishing sell-offs are
partly a result of dozens of investors trying to get out the
door at the same time when a company trips on earnings
growth. Investors "are so information-oriented that as soon
as something happens that they don't expect, there's a
liquidation crisis," says Mr. Eppel.
   Complains Henry Van der Eb, manager of the Mathers Fund,
which has a cash level of 88%: "Earnings momentum has
overtaken fundamental valuation."
   If anything, several earnings reports have reminded
investors that growth-stock investing is a game of hope. Part
of the romance of investing in growth stocks that trade at
high multiples of earnings is the belief that some companies
are immune to economic cycles and can expand earnings faster
than the average company no matter what. But a broad slowdown
in business affects all companies, including most growth
companies.
   Even though she owns highflying growth stocks such as
Waste Management, Ellen Harris, chief domestic investment
officer for PaineWebber Mutual Funds, says she is keeping
cash at 20% right now in a mutual fund she manages.
   "What made me cautious were increasing signs of an
economic slowdown that I thought would lead to a
disappointment in earnings," she says, adding: "In certain of
these high P-E growth stocks, people have taken their eye off
the ball. There is a degree of complacency."
   In fact, Mr. Van der Eb says, "There are about 50 stocks
that are in the pure hope stage -- Albertson's, Microsoft,
Limited, Home Depot, and Wal-Mart is the kingpin of them
all." Wal-Mart, with a P-E of about 33 currently, and other
growth stocks, may still deliver, however. On Tuesday,
Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings of 61 cents a
share, up from 49 cents the previous year. Since then, Coke's
shares have climbed an additional 5% as growth investors
moved into the stock; the P-E stands at about 27.
   Coca-Cola's gains have helped move the Dow Jones
Industrial Average up to just seven points away from 3000 as
of yesterday's close. Most strategists think the average can
skip over that level easily in the next few days.
   But the hammering of stocks that have had disappointing
earnings has caused a lot of second guessing in the market.
This week, and for the first time all year, some growth stock
managers have started to doubt that their stocks could fly to
P-Es of 50 or higher as they did in the early 1970s. In a
sign of caution that may grow, profit takers nicked 1/4 off
Wal-Mart yesterday; the stock closed at 33 1/2 on 3.3 million
shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

   Tax Deductions
   May Face Curbs

   WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators of both parties are
considering proposals that would curb itemized tax
deductions, including those taken for mortgage-interest
expenses, charitable giving and state and local tax payments.
   No decisions have been reached. But broad and narrow
limitations on deductions taken by individuals have been
discussed in private meetings. Documents that include such
limitations have been drafted by congressional Democrats and
Bush administration aides.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The idea of restricting itemized deductions has emerged
because of the Democrats' demand that any tax package hit the
wealthy harder than others. The search for ways to meet this
objective has intensified as it begins to appear more likely
that the tax plan will be anchored by a big new broad-based
tax on energy, which would hit low-income individuals harder
than those who are better off.
   Curbing itemized deductions is an effective way to raise
the tax burden on upperincome Americans. At last count in
1986, 43% of all itemized deductions were taken by the 9% of
taxpayers who had adjusted gross income of more than $50,000
a year, according to the Internal Revenue Service. At the
same time, however, some of the deductions that might be
trimmed are among the most politically popular in the tax
code and have withstood assaults in years past.
   Proposals discussed by the budget negotiators range from
reducing all deductions by, for example, 10% to placing
ceilings on such deductions for the highest-income
individuals. The Bush administration has floated the idea of
limiting the amount of deductions taken for state income tax
payments to $15,000 a year.
   Other options that have been discussed include restricting
allowable deductions to a percentage of adjusted gross
income, reducing the value of the deductions by applying them
against only the lower, 15% tax bracket and disallowing
deductions of more than a given dollar figure, say $10,000,
for any individual. Another option is to allow deductions
only if they exceed a certain percentage of income.
   "Both sides are looking at (limiting) itemized
deductions," a Democratic staffer said. "There are scores of
ways to do it."
   Budget summit negotiators met for about two hours
yesterday, their first formal meeting in a week, for what
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
diplomatically described as "a frank discussion . . . about
the difficulty in trying to arrive at an agreement while
political weapons are being used day to day."
   The summit tentatively agreed to reconvene early next
week. President Bush has invited top congressional leaders to
meet with him on the budget talks Monday.
   The Democrats are determined to structure a progressive
tax package that hits higher-income taxpayers at least as
hard as lower-income people. The Bush administration is
trying to find ways to accomplish this without increasing the
top individual tax rate to 33% from the current 28% as the
Democrats want.
   For their part, Democrats don't think raising the top rate
is enough, particularly if the tax plan includes both excise
taxes and a cut in capital gains taxes, which is sought by
President Bush and almost exclusively benefits the very
richest Americans. The excise tax increases most discussed
are a broad-based energy tax, tobacco taxes and taxes on
alcoholic beverages.
   Tax writers note that there is plenty of precedent for
placing limits on deductions. Tax law already allows the
deduction for medical expenses only if they exceed 7.5% of an
individual's adjusted gross income. Only 80% of dining and
entertainment costs are deductible as a business expense. And
a variety of miscellaneous deductions can be taken only if
they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income a year.
   Congressional aides note that a wholesale scaling back of
deductions mightn't be needed to achieve a balance in the tax
burden between rich and poor. Specific deductions could be
targeted for cutback, as the Bush administration has
privately suggested. Or, they said, poor people could be
aided by increases in the refundable earned-income tax credit
and an increase in the standard deduction taken by taxpayers
who don't itemize. Increases in those tax benefits are being
considered on their own merits.
   Considerable revenue can be raised by curtailing
deductions. By way of illustration, the respected
Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that
limiting the deduction for mortgage-interest payments to
$12,000 a year for an individual and $20,000 a year for a
joint filer would raise $600 million in the first year.
Restricting the deduction of state and local taxes to 9% of
adjusted gross income would raise $700 million in the first
year.
   Talk about any such restrictions has compelled lobbyists
for a number of interests to step up their efforts on Capitol
Hill, particularly those who represent state and local
governments. Real estate interests also are considering how
to defend their tax breaks.
   Judging from the past, their chances of success could be
high. Speaking of previous battles over deductions, Rep. Bill
Frenzel (R., Minn.) said, "If they didn't go through then,
they may have some difficulty going through now."

   Top Two Waste-Handling Companies
   Report Higher June-Quarter Earnings

   The nation's two largest waste-handling concerns reported
higher earnings for the June quarter, with results reflecting
not only the industry's rapid growth, but the problems that
can accompany such expansion.
   Waste Management Inc.'s solid impetus continued in its
second quarter, with earnings and revenue jumping 26%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.'s profit from continuing
operations in the fiscal third quarter rose 8.8% on a 19%
revenue increase. Net income rose 16% from the year-earlier
period, which included a loss from discontinued operations.
   Browning-Ferris' results came in slightly below what some
analysts had projected, and the company's shares tumbled
$1.875 yesterday in composite New York Stock Exchange
trading, closing at $43.625 on volume of more than 1.1
million shares.
   Waste Management's earnings were largely in line with
investor expectations; its shares slipped 12.5 cents in Big
Board trading, to close at $42.625.
   Both companies have seen the price of their shares climb
more than 35% from the lows of early 1990, and their fully
priced position makes them vulnerable to any investor
skittishness. They have become something of a sacred cow
among institutional investors, particularly the many new
environmental-sector funds.
   Waste Management's net was $178.9 million, or 38 cents a
share, up from the year-earlier $141.9 million, or 31 cents a
share. Per-share figures reflect an increase in average
shares outstanding to 470.7 million from last year's 458
million.
   The Oak Brook, Ill., company's revenue climbed to $1.41
billion from $1.19 billion.
   Waste Management said its domestic and international units
reported improved results. In addition, the company's
77%-owned hazardous-waste and remediation subsidiary,
Chemical Waste Management Inc., which on Wednesday reported
record second-quarter results, made a "strong contribution."
   A spokesman cited several trends behind the company's
improved earnings, including an ongoing corporate
cost-control effort, "expansion of (the company's)
solid-waste services into new markets," and swelling revenue
from international operations, which more than doubled from a
year earlier. At year-end 1989, international operations
represented about 8.5% of Waste Management's revenue.
   At Browning-Ferris, net rose to $82.4 million, or 54 cents
a share, from the year-earlier $71.2 million, or 47 cents a
share -- which included a $4.5 million loss from discontinued
operations. Revenue rose to $767.6 million from $647.4
million.
   The latest earnings were reduced by interest expenses of
$18.4 million, nearly double the year-earlier outlay of $10
million. A spokesman cited the company's 1989 borrowing for
acquisitions under a growth program for the higher interest
payments.
   Those earnings were "a little bit of a disappointment,"
said Richard M. Hanley, an analyst with the firm of McDonald
&amp; Co. in Cleveland.
   Mr. Hanley said the "biggest issue" in the earnings coming
in below expectations was that volumes in the company's
high-margin disposal business -- operating landfills and
charging clients for the right to dump waste -- was down from
a year earlier.
   The downturn was most acute in the company's big Ohio
operation, where they accept loads from Eastern states:
Browning-Ferris "needed to develop a better climate with
regulators and maintain good relations," so they cut back on
the amount of out-of-state waste they accepted at the Ohio
sites, said Mr. Hanley.
   Browning-Ferris conceded that the reduced volume in Ohio
played a role, as did a downturn in the industrial waste
collection and disposal in the economically sluggish
Northeast. But Mr. Hanley said the higher debt load was a
more significant factor, and added that because the company
is currently adding debt much more slowly, future quarters
will see "more of the top-line growth go to the bottom line."
   Also contributing to the Houston company's margin erosion
is its continued expansion in international markets, Mr.
Hanley said. Growth potential is high overseas for such big
players as Browning-Ferris and Waste Management, but profits
are historically thinner and expected to remain so.

   DENVER -- Apache Corp. expects to report second-quarter
net income rose 67% to about $7.5 million, or 17 cents a
share, from $4.5 million, or 14 cents a share, a year
earlier, said Raymond Plank, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Attributing the record second-quarter results to increased
natural gas production and reduced costs, Mr. Plank said
six-month net income increased 92% to about $19 million, or
43 cents a share, from $9.9 million, or 30 cents a share, a
year earlier. Shares outstanding as of June 30 averaged about
44.6 million, reflecting a 35% increase from 33 million a
year ago. The company is expected to report its earnings next
week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Plank said revenue for the second quarter is expected
to match the year-earlier's $59 million. Six-month revenue
rose about 5% to $127 million from $120.6 million.
   Apache's natural gas production during the quarter
increased about 15% to 260 million cubic feet a day from 227
million cubic feet.
   With oil prices off slightly from a year ago, Mr. Plank
said second-quarter oil production was "close to flat"
compared with 1989 when Apache produced about 8,600 barrels a
day.
   Mr. Plank said Apache had recorded about a 25% reduction
in lease operating, administrative and financing costs during
the first six months, much of it because of the conversion of
two debenture issues, which resulted in a savings in interest
costs of about $1 million a month.
   Because of Apache's performance during the first six
months, Mr. Plank said, "we do not have basis to disagree"
with analysts' estimates that per-share earnings for 1990
will be 75 cents to 80 cents.

   NEW YORK -- Citing increased demand for oil-field services
world-wide, Schlumberger Ltd. reported a 14% gain in net
income for the second quarter.
   The oil-field-service company earned $144.8 million, or 61

   The company noted that second-quarter net rose 56%
excluding $35 million of extraordinary and unusual gains from
a year earlier.
   Evan Baird, chairman, said that despite weakening oil
prices, "world-wide oil-field activity continued to increase
as the oil industry remained focused on developing reserves
for the future." He said revenue from oil-field activity rose
21% while the drilling rig count world-wide rose 11%.
   First-half net rose 30% to $273.3 million, or $1.15 a
share, from $209.2 million, or 88 cents a share; revenue rose
to $2.51 billion from $2.38 billion.

   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $170.7 billion measure
funding the Departments of Labor, Education and Health and
Human Services for fiscal 1991, after boosting anti-drug
spending by $300 million to quiet "drug czar" William
Bennett.
   The spending bill, approved 359-58, also includes large
increases for medical research and aid to public schools.

   The Appropriations Committee leadership amended the bill
to add $321.4 million for drug treatment and the drug-free
schools program, raising such spending to the levels

money even though several members are still seething that,

which is about $17 billion, or 10%, above the 1990 level and
about $3.9 billion over President Bush's request. The total
is almost certain to be pared by the budget summit between
the White House and Congress -- if those talks produce an
agreement. "This is very likely the high water mark," Rep.
Conte said.
   The labor and education measure is the eighth and largest
of the annual domestic spending bills to clear the House.
Attention now turns toward cutting defense spending to offset
proposed increases in domestic spending.
   To that end, the House Appropriations Committee approved
an $8.3 billion military-construction bill, which is 10%
below President Bush's request and significantly pares the
administration's plans for spending overseas. While the
administration sought to spend $153.7 million in Germany, for
instance, the panel approved only $33.2 million. The
committee also amended the bill to bar the Air Force from
moving its Ballistic Missile Organization away from Norton
Air Force Base, Calif.
   In a separate vote, the committee approved a $3.9 billion
District of Columbia spending measure.
   The rush of legislation from the House has increased
pressure on the Senate to act. The Senate Appropriations
Committee yesterday approved the first of its fiscal 1991
measures, a $20.8 billion bill funding energy and water
programs. That is $580 million more than the administration
requested and $2.3 billion above the current year's level,
largely because of added spending to clean up nuclear waste
at defense plants.
   To accommodate individual senators on the committee, the
panel endorsed 11 projects that weren't mentioned in the
subcommittee version of the bill -- including projects in the
home states of Sens. James Sasser (D., Tenn.) and Pete
Domenici (R., N.M.), who are key negotiators at the
deficit-reduction talks.
   The bill directs the Army Corps of Engineers to spend
$550,000 to protect the banks of a park on Lake Barkley in
Clarksville, Tenn. The accompanying report earmarks $400,000
for a study of pollution problems in Nashville if local
opposition prevents the corps from spending that sum on
another Tennessee project. It also earmarks $500,000 for the
Velarde ditch project in New Mexico.

   NEW YORK -- The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said steps
were being taken to reduce oil flow in the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline to 1.2 million barrels a day from 1.6 million
barrels a day.
   The action came as the company continued to negotiate a
settlement yesterday with the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency in compliance with air quality issues. The
EPA had set a deadline of 12:01 a.m. Alaska time today to
resolve these issues or face the risk of noncompliance,
Alyeska said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James Hermiller, president of Alyeska, said the reduced
flow would allow for an orderly shutdown of the entire
pipeline, should that become necessary. The EPA said Alyeska
has "no reason . . . to consider shutting down." Regulators
and oil-industry officials consider a shutdown unlikely.
   Mr. Hermiller said, "We fully expect to reach resolution
of this matter. Conceptually, all concerns by the agencies
have been addressed. What remains is formal approval of these
agreements by midnight tonight."
   The critical step, according to Alyeska, is confirmation
from the Alaska department, which will amend Alyeska's air
quality permits. This would put Alyeska in compliance with
the EPA's notice of violation. Alyeska said it has agreed to
more stringent amendments to its existing permits to bring
the company into compliance.

   TORONTO -- The Toronto Stock Exchange said it suspended
development of a comprehensive trading system because of a
drop in trading volume.
   The new system, at an estimated cost of 7 million Canadian
dollars (US$6.1 million), would have replaced four separate
software systems at the exchange. About C$1.5 million has
been spent on the project, which was set to be introduced in
1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Volume at the exchange has dropped this year to an average
of 12,900 trades a day from 1989's daily average of 16,250
trades. The highest turnover in recent years was in 1987,
when the exchange had an average of 22,300 trades a day.
   Olaf Kraulis, vice president of information systems at the
exchange, said work on the new system might resume if the
number of daily trades increases to the 20,000 to 30,000
level.
   Mr. Kraulis said the new system would have the advantages
of higher capacity, reduced maintenance costs and greater
adaptability to new trading rules. The exchange currently
uses separate systems to monitor trades, depending on the
size of the trade and whether it is executed on the trading
floor or on an electronic screen.

   Bonds End Narrowly Mixed in Light Trading
   In a Respite After Wednesday's Hectic Sell-Off

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices ended narrowly mixed in sparse
activity as the market took a breather after Wednesday's
frenetic dealings.
   "We're seeing a consolidation after the steep losses in
bond prices," that occured on Wednesday, said Robert T.
McGee, a senior vice-president at Tokai Bank Ltd.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It was a quiet day, there wasn't much trading," adds
David Green, manager of the government bond trading
department at Chemical Bank.
   Bond prices fell a full point on Wednesday, about $10 for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount, on concerns about inflation
raised by a stronger-than-expected report on June consumer
prices. Adding to those worries was the bond market's
impression from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that the central bank isn't as
staunch about fighting inflation as it might be.
   In trading yesterday, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond fluctuated in a narrow band and ended 1/8 point lower, a
loss of $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its
price, rose to 8.55% from 8.54% on Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, in a repeat of Wednesday's pattern,
shorter-term Treasury securities fared better than
longer-term securities. Prices of Treasury notes maturing in
two to five years ended slightly higher yesterday.
   Some analysts said the weaker performance of longer-term
bonds reflects the bearish outlook that has emerged for
bonds. As a result, investors are getting out of long-term
securities and putting their cash into short-term securities.
   Analysts say rates of short-term securities are likely to
remain relatively stable in the near term following the Fed's
credit easing move last Friday.
   But a variety of factors, including growing jitters about
inflation, perceptions that Congress is being stymied by
partisan politics in its attempt to fashion a federal
budget-reduction accord, and the prospect of a huge amount of
new supply at the August refunding of the federal debt, are
likely to push bond yields considerably higher, they said.
   "It looks like we'll see continued weakness in the long
end of the market and further steepening of the yield curve,"
said David Jones, a senior vice president and economist at
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
   The economist refers to the widening gap, or spread,
between yields of shorter-dated and longer-dated issues. As
yields of securities with longer maturities have risen and
those of shorter maturities have edged lower during the past
week, the yield curve has steepened.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond currently yields 0.45 to 0.46
percentage point more than the outstanding two-year note.
That spread is up from 0.17 percentage point about a week
ago.
   "I'm negative on the long end of the market," said Roger
Early, a vice president and portfolio manager at Federated
Investors Inc. "It's hard to be a buyer of bonds," said Mr.
Early, who believes that the yield of the bellwether 30-year
bond could climb to 8.75% by the Treasury's quarterly
refunding in August.
   Details of Uncle Sam's next quarterly sale of three-year,
10-year and 30-year securities are due out Aug. 1. Early
estimates are for a record-sized $31 billion refunding
package.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Long-term Treasury bonds were hurt mainly by fears of
inflation. But investors were also disappointed by news that
the Treasury will issue far more supply in the market than
originally planned.
   The Treasury said it may borrow a net of $62 billion to
$66 billion during the third quarter. In May, the Treasury
had said it was looking to borrow in the range of $30 billion
to $35 billion for the July-September quarter.
   The Treasury said it revised its third-quarter borrowing
needs to include funds slated for the federal government's
rescue of sick thrifts.
   In trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at
a price of 102 1/32, down slightly from 102 4/32 on
Wednesday. The latest two-year notes were quoted at 100
15/32, up slightly from 100 13/32 on Wednesday. Yields on
two-year notes ended at 8.09%, down from 8.12%.
   Treasury bill rates also were lower. The discount rate on
three-month bills eased slightly to 7.55% yesterday from
7.56% on Wednesday while the rate on six-month bills eased to
7.45% from 7.48%. Bond-equivalent yields were 7.78% on
three-month bills and 7.83% on the six-month bills.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds

   Investor interest in junk bonds picked up slightly late in
the day after a slow start during morning trading. Most junk
bonds, which are speculative-grade bonds that carry low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended unchanged
to modestly higher.
   Investment-grade bonds, those with higher credit ratings,
were little changed.
   After three consecutive days, the junk bond euphoria
created by RJR Nabisco Inc.'s $6.9 billion recapitalization
plan faded away and the market returned to the quiet trading
that has characterized most of the month.
   Among gainers, RJR's 17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind
debentures due in 2009, which formerly had a rate of 14.07%,
rose 1 3/8 point to 117 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Pay-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of additional
securities.
   The junk bonds of retailers posted gains yesterday due to
prospects of improved earnings. Those prospects were
highlighted by a positive earnings report for Kroger Co. The
grocery chain's 12 7/8% senior subordinated debentures picked
up 1/4 point to trade at 105.
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co., which reported that it had worked out a
deal with bank lenders that would give it more financial leg
room during the Christmas season, saw its 14.5% subordinated
debentures trade 1/2 point higher to 62 1/2.
   Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.'s 12.5% senior subordinated
notes ended the day at 83, up 1/2 point.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended unchanged to 1/8 point lower in
uninspired dealings.
   In related municipal activity, New York City officials
announced the sale of $1.1 billion tax anticipation notes to
be sold via competitive bid July 24.
   Ratings on the issue are under review by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were 1/8 point lower at 99 1/4 to
yield 7.24%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were weaker in most major foreign markets
yesterday.
   British government bonds fell as investors focused on
inflation indicators that appeared in the latest employment
report. The report revealed that wages increased at an annual
rate of 9.75% in May. Although that was similar to the rate
of increase in April, it shows that no progress has been made
on the inflation front.
   Among benchmarks, Britain's 11.75% bond fell 1/2 point to
101 27/32 to yield 11.47% while the 12% notes due 1995 fell
6/ 32 to 99 21/32 to yield 12.10%.
   Prices of West German and Japanese government bonds also
ended lower yesterday.
   In the Eurobond market, prices ended about 1/4 point
lower. Among new issues, Ford Motor Co. offered $250 million
of 9.5% 10-year notes priced at 99.285.
   The offering received mixed reviews from the group
syndicating the deal. Lead manager Goldman, Sachs
International Ltd., which placed close to $100 million of the
issue, reported healthy interest from European and British
accounts.
   Officials at two of the other banks involved with the
offering reported demand ranging from steady to good. Some
other members, however, said they had found difficulty
garnering enough interest for the issue as they found
investors still fixated with shorter-term securities.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities prices ended unchanged to
marginally lower.
   Among 9.5% securities for August delivery, Government
National Mortgage Association issues were off 1/32 at 99 5/8,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. were down 3/ 32 at 98 29/32
and Federal National Mortgage Association issues were lower
by 3/32 at 99 13/32.
   In the subdued primary market, Salomon Brothers Inc.
announced details of a Salomon Brothers Mortgage Securities
VII Inc. issue of real estate mortgage investment conduit
securities totaling around $94 million.
   Collateral for the deal is 15-year and 30-year
conventional jumbo whole loans that are being serviced by PHH
U.S. Mortgage Corp.

   Onex Corp. said its Beatrice Foods Inc. unit agreed to
acquire Palm Dairies Ltd., a Calgary, Alberta, dairy, baked
goods and cheese-making concern.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but Toronto-based Onex said the
operations of Palm Dairies will add about 130 million
Canadian dollars (US$112.6 million) annually to Beatrice's
total sales. In 1989, Beatrice reported revenue of C$672.1
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last year, Beatrice paid C$40 million to acquire Eplett
Dairies Ltd. Gerry Schwartz, Onex's chairman and chief
executive officer, said this year that the company was
planning another dairy acquisition of similar size. He said
Onex had about C$110 million available in cash to finance
acquisitions.
   Beatrice plans to acquire Palm Dairies Ltd. from closely
held Pocklington Financial Corp., Onex said.
   The acquisition "strengthens our presence in Western
Canada and represents an important opportunity for Beatrice
to broaden its distribution and processing base," said Don
McCarthy, chairman of Beatrice.
   Palm Dairies has operations in Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Northern Ontario.

   WASHINGTON -- Calculating for loans to the thrift-bailout
agency, the Treasury revised the estimate of its borrowing
needs for the current quarter to a range of $62 billion to
$66 billion.
   At its quarterly refunding May 2, the Treasury had
estimated its borrowing needs in the range of $30 billion to
$35 billion for the July-September quarter. Both figures
assume a cash balance of $30 billion on Sept. 30, but the
earlier figures didn't count any lending by the Treasury's
Federal Financing Bank to the Resolution Trust Corp. The RTC
is the agency that is running the savings and loan bailout.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday, the RTC Oversight Board said a new operating
plan authorizes it to borrow as much as $34 billion in new
working capital in the July-September quarter. The plan also
authorizes the RTC to roll over $26.6 billion in working
capital borrowed in the prior quarter.
   The Treasury's third-quarter net market borrowing will be
a record if it exceeds $63.3 billion, which was tapped in the
fourth quarter of 1985.
   The RTC uses the working capital to carry the assets of
insolvent thrifts until they can be sold.
   Peter Monroe, president of the Oversight Board, told
reporters that Congress will have to approve new financing
for the thrift bailout operation before the end of the
current session if the thrift rescue is to continue to
proceed at an orderly pace.

   DETROIT -- A new television ad campaign by the United Auto
Workers portrays American workers, but uses professional
actors instead of actual workers on film.
   The campaign started yesterday, the same day the union
began bargaining with Ford Motor Co. on a new three-year
labor agreement. The union will spend about $3 million over
the next 10 days to run the three 30-second spots in 27
markets around the country.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the union has periodically run "image"
advertising promoting American workers while bashing
corporate America, this is the first time it has done so in
conjunction with the start of negotiations. "It's position
advertising," a union spokesman said.
   Union officials say they didn't have enough time to search
their ranks for real workers to star in the commercials.
Another problem, the UAW said, was negotiating with the
Screen Actors Guild to get approval for non-members to have
parts. The Actors Guild, like the UAW, likes to reserve work
for its members instead of outsiders.
   The UAW's commercials feature only cars built in the U.S.
by the Big Three -- a Chevrolet Beretta, built by General
Motors Corp., a Ford Taurus, and a Jeep Cherokee, built by
Chrysler Corp.
   In one of the UAW's ads, a gray-haired worker wiping off a
wrench says, "We've worked hard to turn things around because
we want the U.S. auto industry to win. But we want to share
in that success with secure jobs for the future."

   WASHINGTON -- The owner of a large Dallas savings and loan
under investigation by a Senate subcommittee is trying to
sell the thrift, and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum asked regulators
to block any sale until the inquiry has ended.
   A Bluebonnet Savings Bank spokesman said owner James Fail
has been discussing a sale of the institution "for months,"
though no definitive agreement has been reached.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, has held hearings on
the December 1988 sale of 15 insolvent thrifts by the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Mr. Fail put up $1,000 of
his own money and borrowed $70 million to take control of the
thrifts. He subsequently merged them to form Bluebonnet,
which has $3 billion in assets. Sen. Metzenbaum has charged
that the government gave Mr. Fail a sweetheart deal. The
senator is looking for ways to renegotiate or repudiate part
of the agreement the government made to guarantee profits on
much of Bluebonnet's bad assets.
   Mr. Metzenbaum also has raised questions about why Mr.
Fail, an Arizona insurance executive, was allowed to buy the
S&amp;Ls despite the fact that one of his companies pleaded
guilty to fraud in Alabama in 1976.
   In a letter to federal thrift regulators released
yesterday, Mr. Metzenbaum said, "I believe that the
government's position with reference to renegotiating its
contract with Bluebonnet would be made more difficult if a
sale were to be made prior to the conclusion of our
investigation."

   Raben Publishing Co., a special interest magazine
publisher, said it sold Walking magazine to its publisher and
a group of investors.
   Boston-based Raben sold the four-year-old magazine to Jan
Thaw Bruce, the current publisher of Walking, and a group of
three venture capitalists, Ms. Bruce said. The investors
currently have put money into magazines such as In Health and
Health Journal. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Raben Publishing, founded by Norman Raben, started Walking
magazine in 1986 at the start of what appeared to be a new
trend drawing active adults.
   Norman Raben, president of Raben Publishing, said he will
retain about a 15% interest in the magazine.
   Mr. Raben, who also publishes Bicycle Guide magazine,
still faces large payments to creditors. In April, Raben
Publishing asked creditors, including printers, bankers,
paper suppliers, and consultants, to agree to an extended
schedule of debt payments.
   Sources and creditors close to Raben Publishing said Mr.
Raben has sunk at least $20 million into three magazines,
including another, UltraSport, which later folded. Mr. Raben
is estimated to still owe as much as $10 million to
creditors.

   NEW YORK -- The U.S. Attorney in Jacksonville, Fla., is
conducting an inquiry into the practices of "a small number"
of sales representatives at a unit of insurer A.L. Williams,
said Primerica Corp., the insurer's parent.
   The practices relate to a dispute that Primerica, a
financial-services company based here, has been litigating
for some time with Amerishare Investors Inc., a Jacksonville
insurance and mutual-fund company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Primerica said the U.S. Attorney apparently is looking
into whether the sales forces at A.L. Williams and Amerishare
made improper efforts to obtain data about or interfere with
each other's business.
   Arthur L. Williams Jr., the subsidiary's founder and owner
until Primerica acquired it last November, has requested a
leave of absence from his post as a sales consultant to help
resolve the matter, Primerica said.
   Consumers and A.L. Williams policyholders haven't been
affected by the practices the U.S. Attorney is reviewing,
Primerica said, adding that its subsidiary won't likely be
exposed to material financial liability.
   The U.S. Attorney's Office in Jacksonville wouldn't
comment. An attorney for Amerishare said, "I am not aware of
any investigation into conduct by Amerishare."

   Dollar Loses Ground Against the Mark
   But Climbs Against Japanese Currency

   NEW YORK -- A show of strength by the mark against the yen
and the pound led the dollar lower against the West German
currency.
   By the end of New York trading yesterday, the U.S.
currency was slightly higher against the yen and slightly
lower against sterling.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A feature of the trading day was a retreat by the
Australian dollar, a move that traders said the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York sought to exaggerate by selling the
Australian currency.
   Foreign-exchange traders tried to make what profits they
could from yesterday's small and often random price
movements. "This is a troublesome and difficult market to
trade in," said Robert White, manager of corporate
foreign-exchange trading for First Interstate Bank of
California in Los Angeles.
   "The market just doesn't have the power to break out of
its ranges, and for the next couple of days, with no U.S.
indicators due out, I think we're just going to continue this
messy trading," said Dan Brooks, chief New York dealer for
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6410 marks, down from 1.6480 marks late Wednesday. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 148.10 yen, up from
147.75 yen a day earlier.
   In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at 148.15 yen soon
after the opening; it closed at 147.60 yen in Tokyo Thursday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6395
marks, down from Tokyo's Thursday close of 1.6445 marks.
   Sterling climbed to $1.8157 in late New York trading from
$1.8155 late Wednesday but slid to 2.9796 marks from 2.9919
marks.
   The mark closed at 90.25 yen, up from 89.67 yen. Dealers
attributed the mark's rise to profit-taking on long, or
overbought, yen and sterling positions.
   The Australian dollar was last quoted in New York at
$0.7820, down from $0.7905 Wednesday.
   After a low-volume session of Australian dollar trading in
Sydney and Melbourne Thursday, European and North American
traders opened their offices aware that the market was long
on the Australian currency, said Rick Porter, New York
manager of corporate foreign-exchange for Westpac Banking.
   After an early rise, the currency hit resistance at about
$0.7880 to $0.7900, Mr. Porter said. Then, "it turned upon
itself and fell a half cent in 15 to 20 minutes."
   Many market investors and dealers took advantage of the
listless session to ponder the previous day's Senate
testimony by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Before pushing the dollar out of its current range of
about 147.50 yen to 148.10 yen, the market is "going to wait
to digest what Mr. Greenspan said," commented Mr. Brooks of
Dai-Ichi Kangyo.
   While it seems, Mr. White said, that the Fed chairman "is
very stubborn about lowering rates," market confidence
remains low. Mr. Brooks said, "People still think U.S. rates
will go down and that the dollar will go down with them."
   Sterling got a slight boost, Mr. White said, when British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons
she would prefer a strong pound whether it is outside or
inside the price bands of the European Monetary System.
   The prime minister's cheerleading "obviously didn't hurt"
the pound, said Donald Hubbard, a New York treasury officer
for Midland Bank. But, he added, "she's always wanted a
strong pound."
   Britain's high interest rates, along with speculation that
it may soon be a full EMS participant, will discourage much
sterling-selling. "I don't think anyone can go short sterling
and make money," said Mahiko Nagai, an interbank trader at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust in Tokyo.
   The dollar ended European dealings narrowly mixed,
although its modest advance against some currencies was
largely the result of cross-rate action surrounding the mark.
   The dollar ended sterling-centered Japanese dealings
higher. The U.S. unit was last quoted Thursday in Tokyo at
147.60 yen, above 147.25 yen Wednesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $361.40 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$361.42 an ounce.

   Martin Marietta Corp., Bethesda, Md., received a $138
million contract from the U.S. Postal Service to make 614
automated mail-sorting machines, the company's second such
job, as part of the agency's multiphase initiative to
automate sorting fully by 1995 at a cost of $2.5 billion.
   The company said the accord signals its efforts to find
civilian applications for its defense and aerospace
technologies to hedge against defense spending cuts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta's contract is for a new, high-speed
sorting machine that uses barcode technology to process
first-class and third-class mail by ZIP code. The Postal
Service uses bar-code machines to process 51% of its mail;
the remainder is handled manually or with mechanized sorters.
Martin Marietta's Information Systems Group will deliver the
machines by October 1992, with the first delivery expected in
late summer of 1991. It has options to build an unspecified
number of additional machines; they were developed under a
joint licensing pact between Martin Marietta and closely held
National Presort Inc., a Dallas-based technology concern.

   Jetsons Spur Major Merchandising Effort

   "As exciting as a flat Perrier" -- the Los Angeles Times.
   The reviews for "Jetsons: The Movie," are rolling in, and
they are awful. The box office isn't much better. In its
first 10 days, the animated movie about George Jetson, Jane,
his wife, his boy, Elroy, and the rest of the space-age
family grossed just $10.9 million, according to Variety, less
than "Ghost" pulled in for its first weekend. And the trade
newspaper showed that last weekend's box-office take
nosedived 43%, suggesting that word of mouth isn't about to
save the day either.
   But it's too late for the 200 or so licensed Jetson
products hitting the stores now. In one of the summer's most
aggressive merchandising pushes, Hamilton Projects, licensing
agent for Jetsons creator Hanna-Barbera, has licensed the
cartoon characters to more than 60 companies that have
produced every imaginable Jetsons item.
   We're talking more than T-shirts here. You can find
Jetsons toothbrushes, Jetsons collectible figures, and $400
Jetsons jackets. Wendy's is in the midst of a Jetsons tie-in.
Warner-Lambert is test marketing Jetsons Gummies and Jetsons
Cosmic Candies, while Ralston Purina is about to bring out
Jetsons cereal. The merchandise is in stores, ad budgets are
spent, and marketing plans are in full swing. All that's
missing is the audience.
   The Jetsons' predicament points up the risk licensees take
when betting big on a movie. In the wake of the Batman
phenomenon last year, when $500 million of merchandise was
snatched up in a single season, movie merchandising has
exploded. "Dick Tracy" and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" are
just two of the other big summer releases counting on a
merchandising bonanza. All want their piece of the estimated
$65 billion U.S. merchandising pie. Yet licensees with
visions of "Batman" take the risk that instead, their movie
could sink without a trace.
   When a movie bombs, "it doesn't necessarily kill" the
merchandising program, said Ira Mayer, publisher and editor
of Brooklyn-based Entertainment Marketing Letter, "but it
isn't going to do anywhere near as well."
   The question for the Jetsons is, will it do well enough?
Seth M. Siegel, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of Hamilton Projects, said it will; the Jetson
licensees can make a profit even if the movie isn't a
blockbuster. "Our business plan went in with modest
expectations that nevertheless presented us with
profitability," he said. "Our hope is always the movie would
be a $40 million film. But in any event, we think the movie
performance to date has done just fine for us."
   Optimistic, as executives in his business tend to be, he
added, "I think one could look at it as being very, very
successful in terms of a repositioning, a reintroduction.
Also, the summer isn't over yet."
   Other entertainment executives say the Jetsons merchandise
has a chance of at least modest success because since being
introduced in 1962, the cartoon has spent decades in reruns.
"Lack of success {at theaters} doesn't necessarily mean the
merchandise won't move," said Arnold Bolka, publisher of the
Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Licensing Letter, a trade
publication. "The Jetsons have a life of their own. They've
built a following through the decades, and it may well be
that the current licensing will be successful regardless of
the box office."
   No doubt about it, though, big box-office receipts would
go a long way in making Jetsons merchandise a bigger seller.
Hamilton Projects' Mr. Siegel said a blockbuster film's
merchandise sales may be three or even six times those of a
moderately successful movie. If the Jetsons had turned into a
blockbuster, he said, "we have the machinery in place for a
bonanza, and we had the retailers primed."
   Among other things, he said, if the movie had been a
runaway hit, Hamilton Projects would have helped organize
Jetson "boutiques" in stores, which would feature all sorts
of Jetsons memorabilia in one place. Now, merchandise will
more likely be spread throughout the store, with kids'
T-shirts in the children's clothing department and mugs in
housewares. Most of the Jetsons merchandise is in inexpensive
mass marketers like K mart and Wal-Mart.
   Several Jetson licensees, including Wendy's,
Warner-Lambert and Ralston Purina, say they're satisfied
despite the movie's poor showing in its first two weeks. If
it had been a blockbuster hit, Wendy's would have ordered up
more plastic Jetsons cups for the tie-in that began Monday. A
blockbuster might also help prolong the life of Jetsons
cereal, which, like all of Ralston's licensed cereals, is
expected to have a life span of only 12 to 18 months. But
executives at both companies say the Jetsons characters are
strong enough to justify the tie-ins even without a movie.
   "I'd be absolutely thrilled if the movie turned out to be
a blockbuster. But I'm not concerned that the poor reviews
will negatively impact" on the Jetsons candies in test market
in Atlanta, said Joseph McDonough, product manager for new
ventures for Warner-Lambert. "We're tapping into the
tremendous equity that has developed over the past 30 years."

   Accor S.A., a French hospitality company, said in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Motel 6 L.P.
has projected its net income for the 1990 fiscal year ending
Dec. 31 will be $19.6 million on revenue of $477.4 million.
   The projection was made in connection with a tender offer
made last week by Accor S.A. to acquire Motel 6 of Dallas for
$22.50 a unit, or nearly $1.3 billion. Accor said the figure
was used in merger talks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a related filing, Motel 6 said that three class-action
suits have been filed to block the acquisition. Motel 6
executives weren't available for comment.
   Although the merger isn't conditioned on financing, Accor
said it estimates it will need $1.3 billion to cover costs of
the deal, including buying the shares and paying fees and
expenses. Accor said it would borrow the money from Banque
Indosuez and Societe Generale under a special credit
arrangement and from its existing working capital and credit
lines.
   The French company also said it will explore ways to
refinance Motel 6's existing debt after the deal is
completed.
   Accor also said it has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
a fee of $1 million for acting as a dealer-manager in the
offer. Motel 6, in its filing, said it has agreed to pay
Salomon Brothers Inc. $5.5 million for acting as its
financial adviser.

   Gillette said shipments of its Sensor razors have "far

   For the six months ended June 30, net increased 21% to
$169.1 million, or $1.45, from $140.1 million, $1.45 a share.
The latest quarter and six-month results reflect preferred
dividend payments of $14.3 million and $28.5 million,
respectively.

   Judge Bars Maxus Claims Against Kidder

   A federal judge in New York barred Maxus Energy Corp. from
continuing most of its claims against Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
in Texas state court related to Maxus's acquisition of
Natomas Co.
   In a suit filed in Texas, Maxus alleged that it paid more
than it should have in its 1983 acquisition of Natomas
because inside information was passed by former Kidder
investment banker Martin A. Siegel to convicted former stock
speculator Ivan F. Boesky. Maxus, formerly Diamond Shamrock
Corp., sought $1.6 billion in damages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Senior U.S. District Judge Milton J. Pollack rebuked
Maxus's lawyers for litigating the same issues in state court
in Dallas that he said he had already decided in Manhattan.
   "Semantic adroitness will not serve to obscure what was
litigated, argued and then decided in this court," Judge
Pollack wrote in the injunction issued late Wednesday.
   Judge Pollack had ruled in April that Maxus, based in
Dallas, hadn't suffered injury during the 1983 Natomas
purchase and wasn't entitled to make claims against Kidder
based on the alleged stock price run-up.
   Judge Pollack's order reversed a ruling by state District
Judge Adolph Canales of Dallas. In that ruling last month,
Judge Canales denied Kidder's request to dismiss most of the
claims. In seeking a dismissal, Kidder had cited the April
ruling by Judge Pollack, which Maxus has appealed. The appeal
is pending.
   Maxus had argued before Judge Canales that Judge Pollack's
order had no effect on its Texas action and that it was "not
clear." Judge Pollack's April order and this week's
injunction don't affect Maxus's efforts in the Texas suit to
recover more than $4 million in fees and expenses it paid to
Kidder in the transaction.
   Gary Naftalis, the lawyer for Kidder, a unit of General
Electric Co., declined to comment. Charles E. Davidow, the
attorney for Mr. Boesky, who would have been required to
testify in the Texas case, said, "Judge Pollack seems to take
the view that once he enters an order, it will be viewed as
binding and not merely a recommendation."
   A Maxus spokeswoman said, "We have already appealed {Judge
Pollack's} earlier ruling and no decisions about further
steps have been made at this point."

   WORKERS MAY NOT BE BOUND by agreements not to sue for age
bias.
   A federal judge in Tampa issued the ruling in a battle
over whether companies can enforce signed statements in which
older employees agree not to sue for civil rights claims or
back wages. Fired employees often waive their legal claims
against a company in exchange for higher severance pay.
   But Judge William Castagna ruled that the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act makes the waivers
unenforceable unless the severance agreement is supervised by
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or a federal
court.
   Many other courts have enforced unsupervised waivers if
the waiver was found to be "knowing and voluntary." Judge
Castagna rejected that standard, arguing that "unsupervised
waivers of ADEA claims are contrary to the intent of the
Congress that passed the ADEA." He said Congress repeatedly
has suspended EEOC regulations permitting employers to obtain
waivers without supervision.
   The case involves more than 100 workers fired by
Brown-Forman Corp., Louisville, Ky., in November 1986.
William Gormin, the plaintiff who initially filed the suit,
alleges he was fired as part of the company's policy to force
older employees to retire early "despite their
qualifications, ability and willingness to work" and to
replace them with younger workers.
   Brown-Forman asked Judge Castagna to dismiss the case
because the lead plaintiff had signed a release of all claims
when he accepted $56,000 in severance pay. But the judge
refused, saying that when older workers sign waivers as part
of a severance agreement, they face "little more than a
Hobson's choice," with no real alternative.
   Ed Fessenden, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, said
the judge's decision effectively blocks Brown-Forman's
efforts to avoid a trial. Lawyers for Brown-Forman refused to
comment on the case.

   LICENSING COMPANY allowed to pursue controversial patent
suit.
   Refac International Ltd. sued six major software companies
in 1989 after buying a 5% stake in a patent allegedly used in
spreadsheet software. But last May, Judge Michael Mukasey in
federal court in Manhattan ruled that the suit would be
thrown out because of Refac's licensing agreement. The judge
said the licensing arrangement violated New York state law
against champerty, which occurs when someone helps pay the
cost of someone else's suit in exchange for a share of any
proceeds.
   To comply with the judge's ruling, Refac, a subsidiary of
Refac Technology Development Corp., said Forward Reference
Systems Ltd. has joined as a plaintiff in the suit. The
Canadian company owns the remaining 95% of the patent. The
judge had said Refac was illegally acting as the surrogate
for Forward Reference Systems.
   Eugene Lang, president of Refac Technology, said the
company also has moved to drop its claims against all but one
of the defendants, Lotus Development Corp.
   Mr. Lang said he disagreed with Judge Mukasey's ruling
that Refac had bought a stake in the patent for the purpose
of pursuing litigation. "Our purpose is to license, not to
litigate," he said.
   Henry Gutman, an attorney for Lotus, said the allegations
of patent infringement were "entirely without merit." He said
the company is exploring whether Refac's role in the case is
still illegal despite the change in plaintiffs.

   EX-CITIBANK EXECUTIVE sentenced to eight years for
stealing $25 million.
   Mario Rios Pinochet, formerly a vice president in charge
of safeguarding assets at Citibank, was convicted in May of
embezzling five bearer securities valued at $5 million each.
Prosecutors accused Mr. Pinochet, 48, of taking the
securities on Jan. 25 while inspecting a vault in Manhattan
as part of an effort to improve security procedures at
Citibank, a unit of Citicorp.
   At the sentencing before Judge Robert J. Ward in federal
court in Manhattan, Mr. Pinochet strongly denied any
wrongdoing and said he would appeal. He also told the judge
that the securities he allegedly took had no market value.
   Judge Ward rejected Mr. Pinochet's request to be released
on bail pending appeal, citing the possibility that Mr.
Pinochet, who has family in Chile and other countries, might
flee the U.S. One of the five securities taken from the vault
is still missing.
   The judge ordered Mr. Pinochet to make restitution of as
much as $5 million to Citibank if the bank makes payments on
the security during Mr. Pinochet's sentence.

He is scheduled for trial on Sept. 4 before U.S. District

   SEC Starts Review
   Of Law Proceedings
   To Speed Up Cases

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is
starting a review of its administrative law proceedings, with
an eye toward speeding up cases.
   The administrative proceedings task force, headed by
Commissioner Mary Schapiro, will take up the agency's inhouse
process of trials against investment advisers, brokerages,
exchanges and others that typically are handled by an
administrative law judge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The review comes at a time when the SEC is poised to get
more power to impose administrative actions. The Senate this
week approved a bill giving the agency more leeway to impose
fines on wrongdoers in the securities industry and to block
firms from defrauding investors through cease-and-desist
authority. The House is expected to vote on the measure
Monday. "If we're lucky enough to get the remedies bill, we
are likely to see more administrative proceedings," according
to Ms. Schapiro.
   The panel also is the SEC's response to complaints from
the securities bar that the administrative process is too
slow and occasionally misses the mark badly.
   An American Bar Association task force is drafting
proposals that may recommend that the SEC's system of
administrative law judges doesn't work and should be
abolished, according to a lawyer who has seen a draft. It
isn't clear whether the final ABA proposal will include the
recommendation, he said.
   One Washington lawyer, Arthur Mathews at Wilmer, Cutler &amp;
Pickering, said, "I don't think the commission has paid
enough attention to the role of administrative law judges."
For example, he said he is currently trying a case of
pennystock broker Stuart James Co. before a law judge that is
expected to take a year and a half.
   Ms. Schapiro has spoken in the past about the slow pace at
the SEC. While she said she doesn't have particular rule
proposals in mind, she added that "I want to be sure the
delay -- if it is undue delay -- is not the failing of our
rules."
   She said the study will look at the discovery process, in
which defendants and witnesses offer evidence. It also will
examine whether the SEC is delaying the process of handling
appeals from the law judges.

   Western Union
   Has New Debt Plan
   For Bondholders

   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., fighting to avoid
bankruptcy-law proceedings, has come up with a new debt
recapitalization plan that most of its largest bondholders
have accepted.
   The company, which has been in default on a $51 million
interest payment since June 15, said it will file shortly
with the Securities and Exchange Commission an amendment to
its recapitalization plan that should keep it out of
Bankruptcy Court and placate its bondholders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I believe holders of more than half the bonds --
including four of the five largest holders -- have indicated
agreement to it," said Hal Kennedy, senior vice president of
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. and an adviser
to the bondholders. Western Union has said that the success
of its recapitalization depends on acceptance by holders of
95% of the bonds.
   "We favor this new deal because we believe it will permit
the market value of the bonds to approximate their intrinsic
value," said Jay Goldsmith, president of Balfour Investors
Inc., a private investment company specializing in distressed
securities.
   New York financier Bennett S. LeBow, who controls Western
Union through his Brooke Partners L.P., will remain Western
Union's principal owner, but his voting power will be cut to
29.6% from 46.4%.
   After the sale of its Business Services unit, which
provides telex, electronic mail and Mailgram service, Western
Union will be primarily a financial services business. That
business, which includes money transfer, voice-messaging,
telegram and bill-payment services, posted an operating
profit of $95 million on sales of $309 million in 1989.
   Under the new plan, Western Union will offer to increase
the interest rate on one of its new notes to 9.5% from 8%,
accelerate some interest payments, and boost to $160 million
from $145 million the amount of cash it will commit to redeem
its notes. Proceeds for this repurchasing plan is coming from
the sale of the company's Business Services unit to American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. for $180 million.
   Western Union has also revised the formula for issuing new
common shares in the exchange offer that will give
noteholders 99.8 million new common shares or 25.1% of its
equity and voting power.
   Under the latest plan, in exchange for each $1,000 face
value of 19.25% senior reset note and 16% note, Western Union
is proposing to issue a new $450, 13% note, due Sept. 14,
1992, and a new $550 secondpriority note paying 9.5%
interest, due Dec. 31, 1995, along with 200 common shares,
225 Class C common shares and 275 Class D common shares.
   Interest on the 13% notes would accrue from Dec. 16, 1989,
and be payable semiannually in the form of additional new
notes, rather than cash, through June 30, 1991. In the latest
revision, Western Union said it would begin payments in cash
on the 9.5% second-priority notes beginning with the
semiannual interest payment on Dec. 31, 1993, rather than
June 30, 1994, as earlier planned.
   Western Union's current senior reset notes are trading at
45 cents on the dollar or $450 for each $1,000 note. Its
annual interest payments total $116 million on $643 million
in debt.

   Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co., an 80%-owned subsidiary

WMAR-TV in Baltimore from the Gillett Group Inc. for $154.7
million.
   The station, an affiliate of National Broadcasting Co.,
which is a unit of General Electric Co., recently signed a
new three-year contract to continue as the flagship station
for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team.

   The Gillett Group is controlled by George N. Gillett Jr.,

also controls SCI Television Inc., which has had to
restructure $1.3 billion in debt.
   Lawrence A. Leser, president and chief executive officer
of E.W. Scripps, said the company has not made a major
acquisition since 1986, "preferring to wait until an
attractive opportunity presented itself."
   Cincinnati-based Scripps Howard Broadcasting currently

   SAN FRANCISCO -- BankAmerica Corp., continuing its
rebound, posted relatively good earnings and strong
improvements in its asset quality for its second quarter.
   Net income for the quarter was $267 million, or $1.17 a
share, compared with year-ago earnings of $304 million, or
$1.50 a share. However, analysts consider the current results
to be a slight improvement over year-ago figures, which were
lifted by $44 million from cash interest payments made by
Brazilian borrowers. BankAmerica received no such payments
from Brazil this quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the results were in line with expectations, analysts
were pleased with what were described as "significant"
progress in reducing the amount of nonperforming assets.
   "They had across-the-board, significant improvements in
that area," said J. Richard Fredericks, an analyst at
Montgomery Securities Inc.
   The bank holding company said that during the quarter, it
reduced its nonaccrual assets by 21%, to $3.1 billion.
Nonaccrual assets related to restructuring countries fell
even more -- to $2.2 billion, from $3 billion.
   BankAmerica also reported a 21.5% reduction in the amount
of domestic real-estate loans on nonaccrual status. "You have
all these nervous nellies back East talking about the
California real-estate market slumping, and here
(BankAmerica) is reporting improvements," said Michael
Abrahams, an analyst at Bateman Eichler Hill Richards in Los
Angeles.

   Troubled Stotler
   Says It Accepts
   Offer From Group

   CHICAGO -- Stotler Group Inc., scrambling to shore up its
finances, said it accepted a conditional offer from an
investor group to buy a "substantial equity interest" in the
troubled futures brokerage holding company.
   Stotler, whose chairman, Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, also is
chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, didn't identify the
group or the size of the proposed investment. Board of Trade
members said there were widespread rumors that the group
originated in Taiwan and that the conditional offer was for
at least $10 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stotler said the offer required the approval of the
group's board and that it will expire if that approval isn't
given by 10 a.m. CDT Monday. Stotler Group said this week
that without a capital infusion, it might be unable to make
certain debt payments.
   Stotler Group officials, who announced the offer in a
brief news release, didn't return calls seeking additional
comment.
   The company's stock rebounded on news of the proposed
investment, spurting $1 to close at $6.625 a share on the
American Stock Exchange.
   Late last week, the Board of Trade gave Stotler &amp; Co., the
company's futures brokerage unit, until the close of business
Wednesday to boost its capital cushion supporting customer
accounts or risk being forced out of the customer business.
   Stotler met the deadline for capital compliance -- raising
its capital to 4% of segregated customer funds -- mainly by
transferring tens of millions of dollars of customer accounts
to other futures brokers to lower its capital needs.
   Large blocks of accounts were transferred to Rosenthal
Collins Group, LIT America Inc. and Refco Group Ltd., among
other futures brokerage firms.
   The mass transfers, which included many of what were
considered Stotler's best accounts, left many futures
industry officials wondering whether the remaining accounts
will be sufficient to make Stotler an attractive investment.
"When you lose your quality accounts, you're not in better
shape, you're in worse shape," said a futures trader who
clears, or processes, his futures trades through Stotler.
   If Stotler hadn't met the Board of Trade deadline, it
could have been forced to allow customers to trade only to
liquidate holdings and to transfer all its accounts to rival
brokerage firms.
   Neither the firm nor the exchange has said what caused the
old-line grain-trading firm to slip below minimum capital
requirements. Industry officials familiar with the situation
said the problem arose when regulators determined that
certain assets and liabilities on the holding company's
balance sheet be reflected on the balance sheet of the
Stotler &amp; Co. futures brokerage subsidiary. That action, in
turn, led the Board of Trade to find that the company's
remaining capital was shy of the futures industry's minimum
levels, exchange members said.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates the
Stotler Group holding company, which is registered as a
securities dealer, and is believed to have triggered the
reclassification of the assets and liabilities. The futures
brokerage unit is regulated by the exchange and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.

   PPG to Pay New Jersey $82.5 Million
   For Chromium-Waste Cleanups, Fine
   ----

   PITTSBURGH -- PPG Industries Inc., threatened with
multimillion-dollar lawsuits over toxic chromium wastes,
agreed to pay New Jersey's Department of Environmental
Protection $80 million for cleanups, as well as a $2.5
million fine.
   The glass, chemical and coating company, which has been
pursued by state regulators for eight years, also agreed to
pay $900,000 to cover administrative expenses and the cleanup
of a Jersey City school, among other things. In addition, PPG
dropped its lawsuits against New Jersey.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, PPG will clean up chromium waste at
53 sites in Hudson County, N.J., where until 1964 the company
processed chromium ore to make paint pigments. The resulting
slag-iron laced with chromium and other chemicals -- was used
as landfill in the area. Chromium is a hazardous substance
that can cause serious ailments, including cancer.
   The sites include 32 residential properties, where PPG has
agreed to excavate contaminated soil "to a very stringent
standard," said Michael Schuit, a state regulatory lawyer
involved in the settlement. At the remaining industrial and
commercial sites, PPG will propose and the state will approve
various cleanup remedies.
   To cover some of the cleanup costs, PPG is taking a $25
million pretax charge for the second quarter. It reported
record net income of $141 million, or $1.31 a share, on sales
of $1.57 billion. In the year-earlier quarter, net was $127.3
million, or $1.13 a share, on sales of $1.49 billion. The
company said the charge, along with earlier reserves and
"other measures," would cover its cleanup bill. PPG wouldn't
elaborate further.
   However, Mr. Schuit noted that if the cleanup bill for the
53 sites exceeds $80 million, "PPG will have to pay. There's
no spending limit." The company will also be responsible for
any additional sites that the state discovers and links to
PPG.
   Analysts were optimistic that future earnings won't be
hurt. The charge "is the only impact we should see on
earnings," said Charles LoCastro, a securities analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "This essentially puts the
matter behind them."
   The settlement came after state regulators ordered PPG to
pay $31.5 million in cleanup costs and threatened to seek
treble that amount in court if the company resisted. It's the
second chromium-waste settlement secured by New Jersey. In
April, Maxus Energy Corp., a Dallas petroleum producer
formerly called Diamond Shamrock, agreed to provide as much
as $51.5 million for cleanups and to pay a $2.5 million fine.
   The two settlements comprise the "largest privately funded
cleanup -- and will go a long way toward the renaissance of
Jersey City," said Thomas McKee, a state enforcement agent.
The cleanup cost in New York's celebrated Love Canal case,
which was publicly funded, totaled about $120 million.
   State regulators added that they plan action against a
third company, Allied-Signal Inc., which acquired a closed
chromium-processing plant in Jersey City as part of its 1954
purchase of Mutual Chemical Co. of America. Allied sold the
plant site just a few months later, but the state still holds
it responsible for the plant's slag. A spokesman for the
Morristown, N.J., automotive and aerospace company said,
"We've been talking for some time" with New Jersey
regulators.

   HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp. said
second-quarter profit rose 5.1%, which was in line with a
company statement this week.
   Profit was $207.5 million, or $1.64 a share, up from
$197.3 million, or $1.50 a share, in the year-earlier
quarter. The profit also reflected an $18 million after-tax
charge that was disclosed in the company's announcement
Monday. The charge was due to a plant closing at the Carrier
Corp. air-conditioning subsidiary.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue climbed 7.9% to $5.69 billion, from $5.27 billion.
   Earnings benefited from continued strength in the results
of the Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engine division and the Otis
elevator division, the company said, as well as profit
increases for the automotive and Sikorsky helicopter
businesses.
   Besides the special charge, profit at Carrier fell sharply
because of a weak residential air-conditioner market in the
U.S., the company said.
   "We continue to benefit from our strong international
businesses," said Robert F. Daniell, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The company said its order backlog on June 30 stood at
$21.1 billion, up from $17.5 billion a year earlier.
   For the first half of 1990, earnings rose 6.5% to $342
million, or $2.69 a share, from $321 million, or $2.45 a
share. Revenue increased 7.8% to $10.49 billion, from $9.73
billion.

   NEW YORK -- A federal judge overseeing Integrated
Resources Inc.'s bankruptcy-law proceeding temporarily
blocked efforts by CRI Inc. to buy four real estate
investment partnerships managed by Integrated.
   At a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Judge Howard C.
Buschman III granted Integrated's request for a preliminary
injunction delaying two lawsuits CRI filed in Delaware and
California state courts against Integrated -- which manages
more than 600 partnerships -- in connection with CRI's
proposed bid for the partnership interests. CRI is seeking to
gain control of the interests by approaching the investors in
the limited partnerships directly, outside a court-approved
auction process to sell the interests.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The order effectively gives Integrated, which has an
agreement pending to sell its interests in the partnerships
directly to Krupp Cos., until Aug. 1 to "straighten out the
deal with Krupp," Judge Buschman said. The judge indicated a
condition that was added to the agreement with Krupp after
CRI announced its bid would have to be addressed.
   Although Judge Buschman said "it would be a detriment to
other bidders {in the auction} to renegotiate the terms after
the bids are in," he said it would be "appropriate" to
address the limited issue of renegotiating that condition.
   As part of the court-approved auction, Integrated agreed
June 7 to sell its general partner interests in its American
Insured Mortgage Investors series of limited partnerships to
Krupp for $45 million. But after CRI's bid was announced, a
condition was added to Integrated's agreement with Krupp that
CRI's proposal be ended and its lawsuits dropped. Integrated
announced that accord June 15.
   However, on June 12, CRI, a real estate syndicator based
in Rockville, Md., filed a proposal with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to offer to swap interests in two of its
real estate ventures for the AIM partnership interests.
   Allan M. Pepper, an attorney for Integrated, argued that
CRI's actions would undermine Integrated's efforts at
reorganization and the auction process. He said the company
now will move to develop "a strategy toward a closing with
Krupp."
   Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated chairman, said the company
plans to seek a permanent injunction to block CRI's proposed
exchange offer. Mr. Weinroth said Integrated was encouraged
by the judge's statements "that the facts presented raised
the inference that CRI may have intentionally interfered"
with the court-approved auction.
   Larry Gerber, president of Krupp, said it plans to "go
forward" and that Krupp has had discussions with Integrated
about an amendment to the purchase accord.
   Attorneys for CRI wouldn't comment.

   MONTREAL -- Bombardier Inc. said it and members of the
Bombardier family agreed to issue 7.5 million common shares
to the public for a total of about 146.3 million Canadian
dollars (US$126.3 million).
   The company said it will offer five million Class B
subordinated voting shares, and the Bombardier family will
sell 2.5 million Class B shares, all at C$19.50 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bombardier said proceeds of about C$93 million from the
company's sale of the five million newly issued shares will
be used to reduce debt and to increase working capital.
   At last report, Bombardier had total debt of about C$222
million and C$504 million in shareholders' equity. Some
analysts said they had not expected the company to issue more
equity.
   The transportation equipment manufacturer has made several
major acquisitions in recent months, including the $75
million purchase of Learjet Corp. from Integrated Resources
Inc. announced in April.
   The Bombardier family's voting control of the company
doesn't appear likely to be affected by their sale of the
shares. At last report, the family held 78.7% of the Class A
shares, representing a voting stake of 67%.
   A preliminary prospectus is expected to be filed with
regulators Monday. The share issue is subject to board and
regulatory approvals. Toronto-based securities dealer Scotia
McLeod Inc. will be the issue's lead underwriter.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday,
Bombardier's Class B shares closed at C$19.75, down 62.5
Canadian cents. Its Class A shares closed at C$19.875, down
50 Canadian cents.

   WASHINGTON -- While most of Congress still happily rakes
in savings and loan contributions, one of the industry's
biggest beneficiaries has decided on a new policy.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, under scrutiny by the Senate Ethics
Committee for his ties to a failed savings and loan, said
yesterday that he will give $120,000 to the Treasury,
representing S&amp;L campaign donations received since 1983.

   "The magnitude of the problems in the S&amp;L industry --
stemming from multiple causes over a 15-year period -- leave
a shadow across the industry and across any campaign
contributions from that industry," the Michigan Democrat
said.
   He also said that in the future, his campaign won't accept
money from officers or political action committees of
companies that fall under the jurisdiction of the Senate
Banking Committee, of which he is chairman.
   In 1988, Sen. Riegle returned $78,250 in contributions to
a fund-raising event sponsored by Charles Keating, who
controlled Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association, a unit of
American Continental Corp. The Ethics Committee is
investigating Sen. Riegle, along with four other senators,
following their private meeting with regulators in which the
senators requested a speedier examination of Lincoln's
records. Lincoln's failure -- the biggest ever -- cost
taxpayers $2 billion.

employees, who, it said, are starting a competing plastics
business.
   The New Hyde Park, N.Y., plastics merchant has said loss
of the employees would have a "material adverse effect" on
its sales and earnings from the Northeast and West Coast
operations in the third quarter.

   The order enjoins the former employees from soliciting
Bamberger employees, contacting its customers, or using
confidential information obtained from Bamberger.
   Walter Craig, legal counsel for Helm Resources Inc., a
holding company that controls about half of Bamberger, said
the defecting workers are "engaged in basically the same
business they were involved in, the trading and sale of
thermoplastic resins."
   The company also is seeking damages against the former
employees. A request for a preliminary injunction will be
considered Tuesday.

   Program trading is the purchase or sale of a group of at
least 15 and often hundreds of different stocks. Stock-index
arbitrage, which accounted for 45% of all program trading in
the week ended July 6, involves stock purchases and sales
with offsetting trades in futures and options.
   Kidder, Morgan, Salomon and Susquehanna accounted for
about 76% of all stock-index arbitrage for the week.

   Textron Inc., citing continued strength in its financial
services segment and lower costs on fixed-price contracts,
said second-quarter profit rose 22% to $72.1 million, or 80
cents a share.
   In the 1989 second quarter, when the Providence, R.I.,
company was hurt by a $9.5 million extraordinary loss, net
income was $59.3 million, or 67 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue for the period rose 11% to $2 billion from $1.8
billion.
   B.F. Dolan, chairman and chief executive, said that while
some of Textron's markets remain soft, the company's
diversity enabled it to achieve a "good" first half. Mr.
Dolan predicted that 1990 "should be another good year for
Textron."
   For the six months, Textron reported net of $138.3
million, or $1.53 a share, on revenue of $3.9 billion. In the
year-ago period, the company had net of $122.6 million, or
$1.40 a share, on revenue of $3.7 billion.
   Textron is a financial services, aerospace and commercial
products concern.

   Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s second-quarter profit increased
11.3%, bolstered by a more profitable mix of products
world-wide, price hikes and declining raw material costs.
   The New York-based consumer-products company posted net
income of $81.9 million, or $1.17 a share, up from $73.6
million or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. Colgate's preferred
dividend payments totaled $4.9 million during the quarter,
compared with $717,000. The increase is due to the formation
in June 1989 of a class of preferred that pays a high
dividend. Colgate's quarterly sales rose to $1.5 billion from
$1.3 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results reflected the "growing strength of our
world-wide distribution system," said Reuben Mark, Colgate's
chairman and chief executive officer. Colgate said its major
units in most markets generated higher operating profit.
Operations in Europe and Mexico were particularly strong, the
company said. The company's gross profit margin during the
quarter rose to 44.9% from 42.7% a year earlier.
   Colgate's net for the first half of 1990 was $163.2
million, or $2.32 a share, compared with $140.8 million, or
$2.04 a share. Sales increased to $2.8 billion from $2.5
billion.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index Declines, Then Rebounds
   To Close Above 33000 on U.S. Program Buying

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index spurted higher in the last three
minutes of trading, as program buying on the index by U.S.
brokerage houses helped maintain a close above 33000 points.
   Meanwhile, London shares trailed Wall Street and closed at
their intraday lows.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 7.51 points to
33055.62, after dipping as low as 32847 points, or down 201
points.
   "Someone obviously wanted to see the index hold that 33000
level," said one trader at a U.K. firm, noting that futures
weren't at a high enough premium for arbitrage.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei fell 361.16
points to 32694.46.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
600 million shares, off from 621.5 million shares Wednesday.
Decliners outnumbered advancers 560-383, while 176 issues
were unchanged.
   Traders said the market was broadly lower, as reflected by
the average-based index, as selling pressure in the afternoon
reversed morning gains by "inflation hedge" stocks.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section slipped 4.70 points, or 0.19%, to 2393.08.
   The second section index dropped 17.19 points, or 0.39%,
to 4384.89. Volume was estimated at 20 million shares, off
from 23 million shares.
   Some investment trust funds were canceling on index funds
yesterday, traders noted. The investment trusts regularly
adjust the imbalance between cancellations and buying, with
yesterday's adjustment showing more cancellations, the
traders said.
   One trader said that related selling was "rather minor,"
but another noted that whenever the funds come with the
intent to sell, the psychological impact shouldn't be
ignored.
   Profit-taking in the afternoon also contributed to selling
pressure, as traders took their short-term capital gains
after three days of advances by speculation-driven stocks.
   In the morning, investors had been readjusting positions
and purchasing some shares that would safeguard their
positions in case of visible inflationary movement, traders
said.
   But as the profit-taking set in, other investors moved to
the sidelines, holding back on buying and joining the
generally bearish financial market sentiment, traders said.
   One trader said that with currently high interest rates,
institutional investors aren't willing to lower cash
positions and add to their positions.
   "If anything, they'll buy things that aren't already in
their portfolios, but their average costs will go up if they
just increase their {current} positions," he said.
   Interest in light metal and mining shares, viewed as
inflation hedges, lasted only through the morning, after
which profit-taking clipped gains.
   Mitsubishi Metal rose 9 yen to 909 yen (6 cents to $6.16),
Nippon Light Metal gained 10 yen to 1200 yen, and Dowa Mining
rose 21 yen to 970 yen.
   Trade centered on Ajinomoto, which according to reports
developed a drug that may prevent the spread of cancer to
different organs in patients who already have the disease.
The drug was allegedly found to be effective on laboratory
rats. The stock soared 400 yen to 2420 yen in heavy volume.
   Oil and refinery stocks including Arabian Oil, Nippon Oil
and Teikoku Oil were higher, with oil prices managing to
maintain higher levels.
   Speculative buying on Jujo Paper continued; the stock rose
30 yen to 1000 yen.
   London dealers said market sentiment there was still
relatively buoyant, and prices merely drifted lower after
several consecutive days' rally.
   One trader said the fall gave market makers an opportunity
to pick up stock as prices fell.
   The market gained support from the disclosure of U.K.
money supply data for June and earnings and employment
figures for May. The data suggested that government efforts
to slow the economy were finally working.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ended
down 14.7 points at 2387.3, the intraday low. The Financial
Times 30 Share Index dropped 11.9 points to 1888.7.
   Volume was 412 million shares, down from 595.2 million
Wednesday.
   In company news, Great Universal Stores said pretax profit
in the year ended March 31 grew 4.3% to #417.3 million
($757.6 million). Although the result was above market
forecasts of #400 million to #415 million, the market
perceived the results as "dull," according to one dealer. GUS
fell 10 pence to #10.68.
   Unconfirmed rumors that Hong Kong Telecom, which is a unit
of Cable &amp; Wireless, would issue a trading statement, caused
nervousness about C&amp;W shares. The stock dropped 15 pence to
535 pence.
   STC confirmed it is holding talks with Japan's Fujitsu,
which could lead to the latter's taking a majority stake in
STC's computer subsidiary, ICL. STC gained 24 pence to 281
pence.
   An unconfirmed report that Redland would be pulling out of
the plasterboard market, following charges of price-fixing by
competitor BPB and a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, helped boost Redland a penny to 625 pence, after
standing as high as 630 pence.
   Reckitt &amp; Colman sold its fine art and graphics division
to AB Wilh. Becker of Sweden for #60.7 million. Reckitt &amp;
Colman eased 16 pence to #13.09.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Brussels but lower in
Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, Milan, Stockholm and Amsterdam.
South African gold stocks closed mixed.
   Also, stocks ended higher in Taipei, mixed in Hong Kong,

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Health Groups' Leaders Assail Genentech
   Over Orphan-Drug Lobbying Techniques
   ----

DRUG MANUFACTURERS (DRG)
</IN>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Top officials of two health organizations
have accused Genentech Inc. of using heavy-handed techniques
in lobbying against changes in the Orphan Drug Act.
   In one instance, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society
complained to Genentech President Robert Swanson that the
South San Francisco, Calif., biotechnology company had
falsely claimed to have the group's support in fighting a
move to change the law. The complaint was made in a May 10
letter by Martha Keys, the organization's vice president,
public affairs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Orphan Drug Act confers seven-year monopolies on
drugs, including Genentech's human growth hormone, developed
for certain rare diseases. The law was intended to encourage
drug companies to develop otherwise unprofitable drugs. But a
few companies, including Genentech, have reaped handsome
profits as a result of the law and have spent vast sums
lobbying against efforts to modify it.
   Regarding the complaint by Ms. Keys, a Genentech spokesman
said the company had been told by certain individuals
affiliated with the Multiple Sclerosis Society "but not
actually working for it" that the group did support
Genentech's position. He said Genentech quickly discovered it
was in error, and its officials stopped citing the group as a
supporter.
   A second charge is that in attempting to enlist the
support of health groups, Genentech indicated it would cease
plans for developing a drug to treat cystic fibrosis if the
orphan-drug law were changed. The company vehemently denied
the charge and denied that company officials made statements
the health advocates attribute to them.
   Nevertheless, Dr. Jess Thoene, president of the National
Organization for Rare Disorders, insisted that Genentech's
Mr. Swanson informed him this year that if the law's
guarantee of seven-year exclusivity were "deleted or
modified," Genentech would scrap its plans to develop the
cystic fibrosis treatment.
   Mr. Swanson yesterday pointed out that the cystic fibrosis
drug, DNase, recently began clinical trials. He added that
the orphan-drug law's seven-year exclusivity was "a key part"
of Genentech's decision to develop the drug.
   In a separate incident, Robert Beall, executive vice
president, medical affairs, of the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation, said a Genentech lobbyist told him that any major
changes in the act "would discourage drug companies from
developing drugs like DNase in the future."
   Neither Dr. Thoene nor Mr. Beall characterized Genentech's
position as an explicit threat aimed at their organizations.
But after Mr. Beall spoke to the Genentech official, Mr.
Beall phoned Abbey Meyers, executive director of the National
Organization for Rare Disorders, to say that if her
organization didn't join his and Genentech's opposition to
the bill, several members in her organization would resign.
   Ms. Meyers characterizes this as a threat "to destroy
NORD." Mr. Beall concedes that he "felt very strongly" that
Ms. Meyers had a responsibility to inform her members about
the "likely consequence" of changing the bill. But he says
his statement that she would lose members was a prediction,
not a threat.
   Ultimately, Mr. Beall's group opposed changes in the
orphan-drug law, while Ms. Meyers's group supported them.
   According to one White House aide, "The drug companies
lobbied this thing like you've never seen." Eventually,
Genentech's human growth hormone was exempted from the
orphan-drug revisions approved by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee. The matter awaits action on the House
floor and in the Senate.

   Tandem Computers Inc.'s stock skidded on disappointing
results for its third quarter, ended June 30. The computer
maker's stock fell $1.875 to close at $19.625 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Tandem, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported $472 million
in revenue, an increase of 12% from the year-earlier period
but below analysts' expectations. Net income also was below
expectations, totaling $32.4 million, or 30 cents a share, up
5.5% from $30.8 million, or 31 cents a share, the year
before. There were more shares outstanding in this year's
quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   John B. Jones, an analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc.,
said Tandem's sales were hurt by soft business in the United
Kingdom and relatively weak demand for its highly reliable
mainframe and minicomputers among the securities industry and
government, two traditional big sectors for the company.

   Earnings of four paper and pulp manufacturers were down
sharply in the second quarter, as price discounting continued
to hurt Champion International Corp., Union Camp Corp. and
Bowater Inc. while heavy acquisition costs wiped out stronger
operating results at Georgia-Pacific Corp.
   The industry generally had been expected to report
substantially lower earnings in the face of price pressures
and production cutbacks. Many newsprint and paper producers
managed to push through 5% increases in listed prices in
June, hoping to offset substantial industry discounting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific, which began including results of Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp. in the first quarter, posted a 38%
drop in earnings as interest expense on the $3.74 billion
acquisition nearly tripled. Net income for the latest quarter
fell to $107 million, or $1.25 a share, from $172 million, or
$1.90 a share. But operating results were stronger. Revenue
increased 33% to $3.52 billion from $2.64 billion.
   The Atlanta-based forest products concern said stronger
operating profit from the building products and pulp and
paper businesses, along with higher prices for softwood
lumber and structural panels, drove total operating profit
10% higher, to $425 million.
   Still, a near-tripling of interest expense in the quarter,
to $185 million, more than offset the operating results.
Georgia-Pacific completed its acquisition of Nekoosa, based
in Norwalk, Conn., in March.
   For the half, Georgia-Pacific's net fell 36% to $208
million, or $2.43 a share, from $326 million, or $3.55 a
share. Sales were up 21% to $6.18 billion. Interest expense,
largely resulting from the Nekoosa acquisition, rose to $282
million from $132 million a year earlier.
   Champion's earnings for the quarter were down 50%, to
$56.5 million, or 61 cents a share, from $113.9 million, or
$1.20 a share. Sales declined 2.2% to $1.26 billion. The
results include a $42.9 million restructuring charge for
modernization at several mills and preferred stock dividend
payments of $6.9 million. But those were largely offset by
$46.7 million in gains from sale or disposal of timber and
fixed assets and resolution of issues related to its merger
with St. Regis Corp. in 1984.
   The Stamford, Conn., company noted continued weak prices
and production volume in newsprint, linerboard and pulp. It
also said earnings were hurt by economic reforms in Brazil,
where Champion has a subsidiary. Those measures include
higher taxes, Chairman Andrew Sigler said. He also said
several rebuilding and expansion projects required lengthy
shutdowns and production delays, but that those problems "are
largely behind us."
   For the six months, net was down 48% to $119.4 million, or
$1.29 a share, from $227.4 million, or $2.39 a share. Sales
were off 1.3% to $2.54 billion. Six-month results also
included the $42.9 million charge and $13.9 million in
preferred dividends, which were largely offset by the gains
on asset disposals and the St. Regis resolution.
   Union Camp earnings were down 28% to $58.4 million from
$81.4 million. Sales were essentially flat at $715 million. A
spokesman said the primary factor was price discounting for
products such as linerboard and uncoated papers, noting that
prices are off significantly from year-earlier levels.
Linerboard is used for corrugated materials and packaging,
and uncoated papers include photocopy paper and business
forms.
   For the six months, earnings were down 22% to $125.8
million, or $1.83 a share. Sales were off slightly at $1.42
billion.
   Gene Cartledge, chairman of Union Camp, based in Wayne,
N.J., said in a statement, "Even though earnings de clined
from last year's record second quarter, demand for our paper
and packaging products was healthy, and our mill operating
rates were good." He said total paper product shipments were
up 4.5% to 716,000 tons.
   The Union Camp spokesman said last year's second quarter
was a peak for uncoated white paper prices, which exaggerated
the recent quarter's decline.
   Bowater said net was down 63% to $14.2 million, or 36
cents a share, from $38 million, or $1.01 a share, including
an extraordinary charge. Sales decreased 5.8% to $342.3
million.
   The Darien, Conn., company, primarily a newsprint
producer, said the $9 million charge, reducing per-share net
by 25 cents, is for costs of retiring about $125 million in
debentures. It said the quarter results also included a gain
of $2.4 million, or seven cents a share, involving employee
benefit costs.
   For the half, net was down 53% to $36.4 million from $76.9
million. For the quarter and half, all of its operating
segments were either flat or down 1.7% to 18.6%. The company
said, however, that it expected improvement in newsprint
prices after a $35-a-ton increase in June and improved
operations after start-up expenses at new pulp mills.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Georgia-Pacific closed at $47.75, down 12.5 cents; Champion
closed at $29.25, up 12.5 cents; Union Camp closed at $38.50,
up 25 cents; and Bowater closed at $23.875, up 12.5 cents.

income rose 11% to $89 million, or 30 cents a share.
   In the year earlier, Los Angeles-based Occidental had net

<TEXT>
   Occidental's income before extraordinary items fell 18% to
$69 million. The extraordinary items included a $20 million
gain from tax-loss carry-forwards. Profit was bolstered
further by a $27 million benefit from the reversal of certain
tax reserves. The reversals resulted from an Internal Revenue
Service audit of Occidental and certain subsidiaries that
determined the reserves are no longer necessary.

   Ford Motor Co. said it has received offers for its Ford
Aerospace operations from Loral Corp., a group led by
Westinghouse Electric Corp. and a joint venture formed by
General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. unit and Alcatel
N.V. of Belgium.
   Ford declined to disclose details of the bids, but a
spokesman said the Dearborn, Mich.-based auto maker expects
to narrow the field to one bidder within one or two weeks.

   Some analysts have speculated that Ford Aerospace could
fetch as much as $1.5 billion. But others have said Ford
Aerospace's satellite-building and defense operations could
sell for less than $1 billion in a time of declining military
spending.
   Hughes and Alcatel, a telecommunications venture of ITT
Corp. and Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, have entered a
joint bid, a Ford spokesman said. Hughes, already the largest
maker of commercial satellites in the U.S., is almost
certainly looking to extend its lead in that market by
picking up Ford Aerospace's extensive military and
communications satellite operations. Los Angeles-based Hughes
Aircraft said that, as a matter of policy, it couldn't
confirm or deny any prospective acquisition.
   Ford and General Electric Co.'s RCA unit traditionally
battle for the No. 2 position in the industry, experts say,
raising antitrust questions about a Ford Aerospace-Hughes
combination.
   Alcatel is already a subcontractor to Ford Aerospace on a
project for the International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization, a 118-member group based in Washington that is
responsible for most of the satellite hookups in the Western
world.
   Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, meanwhile, has said it sees
the potential for Ford Aerospace enhancing its radar and
electronics lines.
   Westinghouse has said it would like to expand into
commercial electronics and has been searching for possible
acquisitions. That business would build on the company's
strong position in military radar and sensors and enable
Westinghouse to supply air traffic control equipment to
airports around the world. With the defense budget shrinking,
Westinghouse is especially eager to move into commercial
aerospace.
   Ford said Westinghouse is bidding as part of a consortium
that includes Carlyle Group, a Washington-based merchant
bank, and Aerospatiale, a French aerospace concern.
   A spokesman for New York-based Loral confirmed that the
defense electronics firm is a bidder and said Ford
Aerospace's defense and space electronics operations offer "a
natural fit and development for us."
   Just a few weeks ago, an investment banker close to the
Ford Aerospace deal said a number of companies were still
hoping just to purchase pieces of the Newport Beach, Calif.,
subsidiary. Ford, however, has been eager to shed the entire
unit in one piece.
   The Los Angeles Times recently reported that Martin
Marietta Corp. had submitted a final bid for Ford Aerospace,
which also manufactures, among other things, the Sidewinder
and Chapparal missiles. What may have happened to that offer
wasn't clear. Officials of the Bethesda, Md., company weren't
immediately available for comment.

   Who's News:
   Grumman's O'Brien Leaves Top Posts;
   Caporali Named Temporary Successor

   John O'Brien resigned unexpectedly as chairman, chief
executive officer and president of Grumman Corp.
   The Bethpage, N.Y., aerospace concern said Mr. O'Brien, 60
years old, resigned for personal reasons. The company named
Renso Caporali to succeed him while it "considers candidates
for these positions from both inside and outside the
company."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Caporali had been vice chairman, technology, in charge
of the office of corporate technology; he was responsible for
research, development, engineering and advanced systems
functions.
   Grumman's announcement included no comment on Mr.
O'Brien's record as the company's top executive, leaving the
impression that the departure was on less than cordial terms.
The announcement followed Grumman's monthly board meeting
yesterday.
   Mr. O'Brien, who joined the company in the mid-1950s, was
named chairman two years ago. He was selected as president
and chief operating officer in 1986 and as chief executive in
early 1988.
   His resignation comes as the company is struggling to cope
with the impact of Pentagon spending cuts. Last month,
Grumman announced it would offer early retirement incentives
to 6,000 employees, or 21% of its work force, to cut costs.
Acceptance of the offer by half the eligible employees would
save $100 million, the company said.
   Jerry Cantwell, a securities analyst at Wertheim &amp; Co.,
New York, speculated that Mr. O'Brien's sudden departure may
be a bad omen. "The implication is clearly that there is some
damaging news coming," he said. "I'm really sad to see this
happen. I think he was doing a really terrific job with the
company." Mr. Cantwell's recommendation on Grumman stock
remains neutral, he said.
   Senior Defense Department officials also didn't have any
advance warning of the resignation, which prompted a flurry
of speculation inside the Pentagon.
   Grumman had surfaced in two federal criminal
investigations into possible Pentagon procurement fraud and
illegal document-swapping, but none of the company's top
officials have been identified as targets of those inquiries.
   In March, the company pleaded guilty to illegally using
Pentagon budget documents and paid $2.5 million in fines and
penalties. Also this year, a former Grumman aide pleaded
guilty to fraud-related charges stemming from his dealings
with a Long Island, N.Y., political action committee under
investigation for allegedly funneling illegal campaign
contributions to lawmakers. A federal grand jury in New York
continues to investigate Grumman's involvement with that
committee.
   Grumman's sales have been sluggish in recent years,
totaling between $3.38 billion and $3.65 billion annually in
the past four years, including $3.56 billion in 1989. Net
income in 1989 was $67.3 million, or $1.91 a share, down from
$86.5 million, or $2.50 a share, a year earlier. At year-end
its backlog totaled $6.89 billion, down from $7.25 billion a
year earlier.
   In May, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its ratings
on $525 million of Grumman debt and preferred, citing
unfavorable conditions in the defense industry and high
debt-service costs. Interest expense totaled $105 million
last year, up from $84.9 million a year earlier and $59
million in 1987.
   Mr. Caporali, 56, joined Grumman in 1959 as a structural
flight test engineer, and from 1968 through 1973 he held
various positions in the F-14 aircraft program; he was
elected a vice president in 1980 and was named vice chairman
of corporate technology in mid-1988. He holds two masters
degrees and a doctorate in aeronautical engineering from
Princeton University.
   Grumman's announcement said that Mr. Caporali, speaking
for the board, intends to continue restructuring the company
into a "more efficient and cost-competitive form" while
continuing to "develop the technologies that make sense for
our rapidly changing markets."
   Grumman said Mr. O'Brien resigned from the board "but will
be available to help achieve an orderly transition."
   Besides the abruptness of Mr. O'Brien's departure,
Wertheim's Mr. Cantwell said Grumman's handling of the matter
leaves him with the impression that there was some trouble.
Grumman's investor relations staff, he said, which is
"normally pretty cooperative," was anything but that
concerning the resignation. "All they'll do now is read the
press release," he said.
   Other analysts also praised Mr. O'Brien's performance as
chairman.
   Weyman B. Jones, Grumman's vice president of public
affairs, said "there's no limitation on" Mr. Caporali's
tenure as chairman, even though the board will be considering
other candidates for the top job. He added that Mr. Caporali
"is obviously an inside candidate" to fill the positions.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Cominco Ltd. and the United
Steelworkers of America reached a tentative two-year contract
late Wednesday, which is expected to bring an end to a strike
that began July 9 at the company's big lead-zinc smelter
complex.
   The proposed pact, which was predicted by union officials
earlier this week, covers about 2,900 workers at Cominco's
Trail, British Columbia, lead-zinc smelter operations, and
700 workers at the company's currently inactive Sullivan
lead-zinc mine, in Kimberley, B.C.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The accord calls for an average hourly wage increase of
about 18.5% over two years at Trail, a union official said,
as well as increases in pension and other payments. Union
members are expected to vote on the proposed pact today, and
workers are expected to be called back to their jobs
immediately, a company spokeswoman said.
   The pact also provides for a resumption of operations
later this year at the Sullivan mine, which Cominco closed
earlier this year, citing operating losses and low zinc
prices. Prices for the metal have since risen, and Cominco
plans to invest about 11 million Canadian dollars (US$9.5
million) at Sullivan to make it more viable, the company's
spokeswoman said.
   Cominco's previous contract with the union expired June
30. In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Cominco's
shares closed at C$26.50 each, unchanged.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, said it will
invest $20 million in a company that will purchase a nuclear
power plant in South Haven, Mich.
   While Westinghouse is a major supplier of nuclear-plant
technology, the move marks the company's first ownership
interest in a commercial nuclear plant. The diversified
company has broadcasting, financial services and
manufacturing lines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse will have a 22% equity interest in Palisades
Generating Co., which was formed two years ago to buy the
768-megawatt nuclear generating plant. A megawatt equals
1,000 kilowatts; a kilowatt-hour is the amount of electrical
energy consumed when 1,000 watts are used for one hour. The
purchase is expected to completed next year.
   The other principal investors in Palisades Generating are
Bechtel Group Inc., a San Francisco-based engineering and
construction firm, with a 33% stake, and the Consumers Power
Co. unit of CMS Energy Corp., with a 44% equity interest.
Consumers Power, Jackson, Mich., owns and operates the plant,
which began commercial operations in 1971.

   Iraq's Boldness Raises New Questions
   On OPEC Midyear Session, Leadership

<LP>
   Iraq's increasingly aggressive stance is raising new
questions about next week's meeting of OPEC oil ministers and
the organization's future leadership.
   Until this week, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries midyear conference, to begin Thursday in Geneva,
had been expected to be short and tension-free. The 13 oil
ministers had been expected to rubber-stamp a July 10
proposal by five Persian Gulf producers, including Iraq, that
the two main quota cheaters in their ranks cut output, given
the promise of higher allotments later.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The overproducers are Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
and, according to monitors of OPEC production, both are
already trimming their output. Still, President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq, who has been bitterly accusing the two
countries of overproduction for several months, threatened
this week to use force against them unless they mended their
ways.
   By yesterday, President Hussein's escalating campaign
against his chief target, Kuwait, had triggered a flurry of
charges and countercharges between Baghdad and Kuwait City,
centering on their long-running border dispute.
   Kuwait officially sought the support of its Arab
neighbors, while Iraq's parliament took steps to name Saddam
Hussein president for life. And OPEC watchers conceded that
the outlook for next week's meeting now is less than clear.
   But what is clear, oil specialists said, is that through
his latest hardball tactics, President Hussein is reshaping
alliances and expanding his influence in OPEC, a longstanding
goal, and that this signals higher world oil prices ahead.
   "This is the most important development for the oil
industry since the 1979 Iranian revolution," Bryan Jacoboski,
senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said. "Iraq has taken
OPEC's political leadership away from Kuwait, which had taken
it from Saudi Arabia, and the impact will be felt well beyond
next week's meeting."
   Kuwait essentially had stood alone in OPEC in recent
months -- if not recent years -- in stubbornly holding to its
position that low oil prices were the only way that the
Persian Gulf producers holding the bulk of the world's oil
reserves could assure markets of their petroleum in the
decades ahead. Saudi Arabia's oil authorities still may hold
similar views, but their public posture in recent months has
been to support higher oil prices. It was Saudi Arabia that
hosted the early-July meeting of the five Persian Gulf oil
ministers and then announced the plan to push up the OPEC
benchmark price from this year's low of $14 a barrel to at
least $18.
   Iraq has oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia's. But
the eight-year war with Iran delayed Iraq's plans to build up
its oil-producing capacity beyond the prewar peak of 3.5
million barrels a day. Expansion goals still are sidetracked,
because of the lack of capital and the pressing need to
rebuild the war-damaged economy. So Iraq, which has long
wanted higher oil prices, has been blaming Kuwait and the UAE
for engaging in "economic warfare," by causing the world oil
glut, depressing oil prices and costing Iraq about $14
billion in lost revenue this year.
   Ironically, in his search for higher oil prices, President
Hussein has drawn a staunch new ally, his old war foe Iran.
Some months ago, the oil ministers of Iraq and Iran
discovered that they shared a common pricing goal. Now,
though they may differ on other matters, the three
powerhouses of the Persian Gulf -- Iraq, Iran and Saudi
Arabia -- are linked in a push for higher oil prices.
   But President Hussein is forging a bigger coalition than
that in OPEC. Except for the handful of remaining Persian
Gulf producers, almost every member of OPEC wants higher oil
prices. Many of these countries, such as Indonesia, already
are producing at capacity. The only way they can increase
revenue is through higher petroleum prices.
   Iraq and Iran recently agreed to support jointly an
eventual increase in the OPEC pricing target to $25 a barrel
from $18. Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, returned
home after visiting the UAE, Algeria and Libya in his push
for higher prices. He told reporters in Tehran he expects the
Geneva talks to focus on ways to lift the OPEC benchmark to
$20.
   By any measure, the Iraq-Iran-Saudi trio already has
succeeded in getting oil prices higher. The OPEC benchmark,
which is based on a basket of seven crudes, is up at least $2
a barrel from the year's low to $16. In the U.S., where oil
prices traditionally are higher than the OPEC average, crude
oil futures rose again yesterday, with the August crude up 44
cents to $18.99 a barrel.
   Oil specialists generally suggest there is still room for
West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, the U.S. benchmark crude, to
rise some more, despite the burdensome level of oil
inventories. "We expect the price of WTI to slowly advance
toward a maximum of $20 to $22 a barrel in the upcoming
winter season," reports Stanford Field, an oil consultant
with SRI International of Menlo Park, Calif. Paul Mlotok, an
oil economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., also believes that
oil prices may have bottomed, and that WTI should be back
over $20 a barrel before year end.
   It was Mr. Mlotok who coined the phrase "Saddam Factor" to
explain the new realities in OPEC. And Petroleum Politics, an
industry publication, reports that President Hussein's oil
strategy began to take shape as long ago as February, "when
it became obvious that only a concerted drive to force up oil
prices would save Iraq from an extended economic crisis."
PaineWebber's Mr. Jacoboski likens the strategy to that of
the state oil agencies that enforced restraints on U.S. oil
production to prop up the price for decades. "Saddam
Hussein," he says, "is the new Texas Railroad Commission of
OPEC."

   WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 513 money market

   Assets of 251 general-purpose funds rose $313.3 million to
$134.7 billion and assets of 102 broker-dealer funds rose
$361.6 million to $160.04 billion. Assets of 160

   "A sharp jump in institutional assets accounted for most
of the increase in total assets of money market funds," said
Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the
institute. He added that as rates on direct money market
instruments fell, institutional money managers shifted large
amounts of money into money market funds.
   Mutual fund assets were revised for the previous week to
$386.24 billion. The reported increase has been revised to
$3.5 billion and includes one new fund with assets of $531.7
million.

   Lawmakers Hold S&amp;L Crisis at Arm's Length
   Even as They Keep a Hand Out for PAC Funds

   WASHINGTON -- Last year, with the savings-and-loan
industry seemingly fatally tainted, the once-mighty U.S.
League of Savings Institutions considered dismantling its
political-action committee.
   It's a good thing the industry's lobbying arm didn't take
that step. At least, it's a good thing for a lot of
congressmen and senators. For despite the industry's
financial straits, the Keating Five scandal and public
criticism of the league itself as a symbol of excessive
influence peddling, incumbents are still eagerly lining up
for campaign contributions from its PAC this campaign season.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Already, it has contributed $233,174 to 1990 congressional
candidates, a sum it expects to grow to $500,000 by Election
Day. "We're still being solicited," says Frederick Webber,
the league's president. "People aren't bashful about asking
us for money." At least two or three fund-raising
solicitations from members of Congress arrive each day at the
league's headquarters near the White House.
   Even as lawmakers stampede to distance themselves from the
savings-and-loan crisis, many are still raking in PAC
contributions not just from the league but from the entire
industry. Some of those who are filling their campaign
coffers with S&amp;L-related contributions are incumbents whose
own 1990 re-election drives are being threatened by the
partisan mudslinging over the S&amp;L issue.
   "Basic political sense would tell congressmen to turn off
the S&amp;L faucet for the duration of scandal," says Larry
Sabato, a professor at the University of Virginia who has
written a book about PACs.
   So far in the 1989-90 election cycle, political-action
committees associated with thrift interests have contributed
more than $650,000 to congressional candidates, according to
Federal Election Commission records and data compiled by
Common Cause. The vast majority has gone to incumbents, both
Democrats and Republicans. By Election Day, the contributions
are likely to reach $1 million, according to several industry
sources.
   That's down from previous elections. In the 1987-88
election cycle, thrift PACs kicked in a record $1.8 million
to congressional campaigns. (The league accounted for nearly
one-third of this amount.) In 1985-86, they gave $1.6
million.
   But the decline this time isn't nearly as substantial as
some expected, given the number of S&amp;L failures, the 25%
reduction in the league's membership over the past 20 months
and, most of all, the political taint that now accompanies
such contributions.
   One embattled incumbent still accepting thrift money is
Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.). Late last year, Rep. Neal, a
senior member of the House Banking Committee, returned $3,350
of campaign contributions that he had received from Charles
Keating Jr., the controversial former owner of Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan, and his associates.
   Ken Bell, Mr. Neal's GOP opponent, has also hammered the
congressman for taking in $47,100 in thrift PAC contributions
during the 1980s and for voting with the industry on key
legislation. "It's going to be the major issue in the
campaign," says Mr. Bell. Mr. Neal's district was also
blanketed by Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby,
with stinging advertisements over the July 4 holiday week
that linked the S&amp;L scandal directly to campaign
contributions and highlighted his PAC receipts from special
interests.
   But all that hasn't stopped the congressman from accepting
$3,500 from the league's PAC for his 1990 campaign. Rep. Neal
calls the Common Cause ads "scurrilous," saying the
thrift-related contributions he has received over the years
represent "a tiny percent" of his overall fund raising. He
adds that several healthy S&amp;Ls in North Carolina belong to
the league and that to turn down the group's donation for
this campaign "would be saying something was wrong with our
local S&amp;Ls." He says: "They are decent people. I hate to see
them smeared and tarred with the same brush as some crook out
there."
   Besides Mr. Neal, two other banking-panel members who are
perceived as being vulnerable on the S&amp;L issue have also
accepted contributions from the savings league and other
thrift PACs for their 1990 campaigns. Rep. Frank Annunzio
(D., Ill.) has received $4,500, and Rep. Doug Barnard (D.,
Ga.) has taken in $2,600. In addition, Rep. Charles Pashayan
(R., Calif.), whose past contributions from Mr. Keating are a
hot issue in his race, has received $1,600 from thrift PACs.
   None of the Keating Five, the group of senators in trouble
for their contributions from and intervention on behalf of
Mr. Keating, are up for re-election this year. Three of them,
however, have accepted small contributions from thrift PACs
for their next campaigns. Sens. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.)
and Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) have each received $2,000
from S&amp;L PACs, while Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) has taken
$500.
   Murray Flander, Sen. Cranston's press spokesman, says the
senator is deliberately not doing much fund raising from S&amp;L
PACs for his 1992 election, despite having taken heavy
thrift-related contributions in the past. "It's not an
opportune time," says Mr. Flander, who frets that the senator
might suffer political embarrassment if a thrift contributed
to his campaign and subsequently failed.
   Like Sen. Cranston, Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.)
appears to have undergone a sudden conversion. The Banking
Committee member is eschewing thrift PAC contributions for
his 1990 campaign, and earlier this week led a protest march
to the league's office in Chicago. "The league was targeted
because it represents an industry rife with problems," says
Mr. Kennedy's press spokeswoman, Sue Wood. In 1988, however,
Rep. Kennedy took a $1,100 campaign contribution from the
league's PAC. "If we'd known in 1988 what we know now, we
wouldn't have taken money from the league," says Ms. Wood.
   While the U.S. League of Savings Institutions is still
making money available to those who will take it, at least
one of its components isn't following suit. Earlier this
year, the Iowa League of Thrift Institutions, the league's
Iowa affiliate, decided not to make any PAC contributions to
congressional candidates.
   "With the thrift crisis and all the allegations about
campaign contributions, we've abandoned our federal PAC and
joined the efforts of Common Cause to achieve PAC reform,"
says Kent Klopfenstein, a member of the Iowa group.

   Sauna Culture:
   Michigan Has Finns,
   Not Just Tailfins
   ---
   In State's Upper Peninsula,
   They Struggle to Retain
   Their Identity and `Sisu'

   MUNISING, Mich. -- Eden Evangelical Lutheran Church here
has two things most churches don't.
   One is an inspiring view of Lake Superior. The other is a
sauna in the basement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There's nothing incongruous about the latter, not around
here. Michigan's wild and remote Upper Peninsula is the heart
of the "Sauna Belt," the center of Finnish-American culture.
   In nearby Hancock, street signs are in Finnish and
English. Hancock is home to Suomi College, a two-year school
founded by immigrant Finns and currently dedicated to
preserving their culture in the U.S. And down the road in
Negaunee, WLUC-TV broadcasts "Finland Calling" every Sunday
morning. It claims to be the only Finnish-language television
program in the U.S.
   Next week, Suomi College (the name means motherland) will
play host to the eighth annual Finnfest, a celebration with
films and lectures and cooking demonstrations. Visitors will
see bumper stickers and T-shirts with this one word
emblazoned on  them: "Sisu." It means the willingness to
struggle for a cause or to complete a task, despite
apparently hopeless odds. Keep on truckin', in other words.
   "Finns believe there is such a thing as sisu, and that
they have it," says Michael Loukinen, a second-generation
Finnish-American and rural sociologist at Northern Michigan
University in Marquette.
   The Upper Peninsula's endless forests gave it a familiar
feel to Finnish immigrants. Today, despite a depressed
economy that has been that way for decades (since the mining
boom came and went), the area still has a hold on people. The
locals are self-effacing about their love of rural life. In
tiny Tapiola, a cartoon on the wall of the diner calls a
Finnish motorcycle a "Cowasocky," and shows a cow in socks
with a seat strapped to her back. Pictures are also displayed
of every graduating class from the town's high school. Almost
all the names are Finnish. Alas, the school closed in 1968,
and now students are bused to Houghton, not far away.
   Finnish America is struggling to survive. Finnish
immigrants raised their children to be Americans, and
succeeded. The immigrants' grandchildren, now mostly in their
30s and 40s, typically don't speak the language of their
grandparents, and thus don't attend the Finnish-language
services offered at nearly a dozen Lutheran churches in the
state.
   The average age of people at Finnfest has been 60-plus.
This year's festival will try to draw a younger crowd, using
as a lure a live concert by Miljoonasade, Finland's most
popular rock band. Two Upper Peninsula school districts, in
L'Anse and Baraga, are resisting the assimilationist tide by
offering an optional, once-a-week class in Finnish language,
culture and history for children from kindergarten through
the sixth grade.
   But it is far from clear how successful these efforts will
be. "Finnish culture in America is slowly dying," says Timo
Koskinen, an English instructor at Suomi College who was born
in Finland but raised mostly in this area.
   Actually, it is remarkable that Finns have been able to
remain ethnically distinct at all in the U.S., given the
extent of immigration. While Germans, Italians and Poles
flocked to America by the millions around the turn of the
century, historians say only 380,000 Finns made the trip and
that about 75,000 went back to Finland. Census results aren't
available yet for 1990, but a decade ago some 616,000
Americans claimed Finnish ancestry. Michigan led the states,
with about 112,000.
   Despite their small numbers, Finns in these parts don't
like to be minimized or ignored. People get all riled up, for
example, by a sign promoting an "authentic Swedish sauna,"
there being no such thing.
   The sauna is distinctly Finnish; it was often the first
structure built on an immigrant's farm. And it is always
pronounced "SOW-nuh," the first syllable rhyming with cow.
"If anyone asks about a `sawna,'" says Frederick B. Waisanen,
a retired Michigan State University sociologist, "you know
that he isn't a Finn and he isn't from around here."
   Not all Michigan Finns are serious sauna devotees, but Mr.
Waisanen is. His summer home on Lake Superior has a
traditional wood-fired sauna right next to the beach. After
sweating in the hot room, he and his guests can race down to
the icy water and plunge in. This sweat-and-swim cycle is
repeated two or three times, with breaks for drinking beer
and eating sausages warmed over the hot rocks of the sauna.
At Christmas time, a shop in Hancock sells a sausage, sauna
makkara, expressly intended for the purpose.
   Those who don't have saunas at home can go to Jukuri's
Sauna in Laurium, Mich. -- one of three public saunas in the
Upper Peninsula. It has 12 individual units that an
individual, family or group of friends can occupy for up to
45 minutes at a time, at $3 per adult, or two for $5. It can
be a family ritual, particularly when children are young.
   Saunas have flourished longer than another immigrant
legacy: social radicalism. Finnish immigration started in the
late 1860s, when mining companies in Michigan and Minnesota
sent recruiters to scout for cheap labor. The mines' bitter
conditions made socialists of many Finnish immigrants and, in
the wake of the Russian Revolution, some turned to communism.
Religious and conservative individuals resisted the trend,
and the result was an immigrant community sharply divided
between "Church Finns" and "Red Finns."
   The tiny town of Eben Junction, had two immigrant-founded
co-op stores. (When the Communists failed in their attempt to
take over the church-related coop in 1932, they marched
across the street and started their own.) Old-timers in Eben
Junction still recall the day when Red Finns raised the
Russian flag above their store, and the church-goers called
the sheriff. He tore down the hammer-and-sickle and threw the
Reds in jail.
   The radical tradition hasn't disappeared altogether. It
lives on in Gus Hall, the longtime chairman of the American
Communist Party and a Finnish-American whose name originally
was Gus Arvo Hallberg. And one of the nation's few extant
Finnish-language newspapers, Tyomies-Eteenpain (Working
Man-Progressive) of Superior, Wis., retains a distinctly
left-wing tone.
   All this Finnish-Americanism doesn't enchant everybody who
lives in the midst of it. Some are a bit tired of it all. And
residents without Finnish ancestors can be downright hostile.
   Take Vicky Koskinen, the wife of Timo, the Suomi English
teacher. Mrs. Koskinen has no Finnish ancestors and she says
she has been snubbed, particularly by elderly people at the
Finnish cultural events she goes to with her husband.
"Sometimes I'm a little jealous," Mrs. Koskinen confesses.
"But mostly I just get disgusted with the professional
Finns."
   There will be fewer of those as time goes by. Consider the
changes at Suomi College, which was founded in 1896 to help
Finns assimilate but now is trying to preserve Finnish
culture. "We used to teach our English-language classes in
Finnish," says Ralph J. Jalkanen, who is retiring as Suomi's
president Aug. 1, after 30 years. "Now we teach our
Finnish-language classes in English."

   Browning-Ferris Wants New York Towns
   To Vie For, Not Fight, Proposed Landfill

   Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. wants communities in New
York state to compete for a giant new landfill the company
wants to build.
   Several industrialists and environmentalists think the
company's innovative plan, while flawed, might work. If it
does, it could be a boon for builders and would-be owners of
planned power plants, oil refineries, trash incinerators and
other facilities that often face local opposition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While one expert doubts the strategy will work for
landfills, he thinks it might work for a nuclear power plant.
   In Albany, N.Y., Browning-Ferris Chairman William D.
Ruckelshaus announced that the Houston-based waste-services
firm plans to build a combination landfill and recycling
center in New York, a state which faces a critical shortage
of disposal capacity.
   Rather than have the company choose a site, however, Mr.
Ruckelshaus said Browning-Ferris wants any of 1,400 or so
potential host communities to step forward and express an
interest.
   "It's Your Choice" is the subtitle of a booklet the
company will mail to local elected officials soliciting their
interest. The booklet's title, "An Invitation to Benefit Your
Community," is meant to highlight the revenue, job and other
advantages. The company also pledges to "protect" property
values and groundwater supplies, and to provide financial
"assistance" for any needed new roads, sewers, and other
facilities.
   Several experts expressed reservations. "Even if (the
company) gets some bites, opponents will come out of the
woodwork later on," said J. Winston Porter, a former
Environmental Protection Agency assistant administrator for
solid waste.
   Still, most thought the company's approach should defuse
local opposition enough to give the company a better chance
of siting its landfill than if it were simply to pick a site
and then try to sell the community on it. What's more, with a
couple of additional tactics, these experts said the
Browning-Ferris strategy would have an even better chance of
success.
   "No matter how greased (the plan) is, it can always meet
with opposition," although the company's approach "does give
you a leg up," said Bob McCabe, president of Narragansett
Electric Co., a unit of New England Electric System. Mr.
McCabe gives Browning-Ferris a 60% better chance of
succeeding and adds that the company's chances would be even
better were it also to promise financial benefits to
communities through which all those garbage trucks will have
to pass, kicking up both dust and safety concerns.
   While the company's literature doesn't address surrounding
communities, a company spokesman says Browning-Ferris will
assist them, too.
   Hoff Stauffer, an energy and environmental expert with
Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., the consulting firm, gives the
Browning-Ferris strategy a 25% to 50% better chance of
success. He adds that the company would, in his opinion, have
up to a 75% better chance if, after an initial expression of
interest by a local politician, senior company executives
then personally visited the people who would be living
nearest to the landfill. "This is an emotional issue. You
have to have a very human effort. Using senior executives
would show you really care," says Mr. Stauffer.
   The Browning-Ferris spokesman says the company isn't
ruling out house-to-house visits by senior executives.
   Whatever the company does, however, "It's still going to
take a pretty heroic local official" to express initial
interest in a landfill, believes John Willson, a director of
the environmental, health and safety practice at Arthur D.
Little Inc., the consulting firm. (Mr. Willson gives
Browning-Ferris at most only a 20% better chance of success.)
   Not so, counters David Critchfield, manager of regulatory
affairs at International Paper Co. "At the right price,
somebody will raise his hand," he says. Mr. Critchfield
further believes that the Browning-Ferris strategy could
channel public opposition into constructive pressure on the
company to live up to its environmental pledges.
   Then there's David Sokol, president of Ogden Projects
Inc., a trash-incineration and recycling concern, who doubts
the strategy will work for a landfill, but thinks it could
work for a nuclear power plant. Mr. Sokol argues that,
whereas opposition by the surrounding communities likely will
kill any community's interest in hosting a landfill, it
wouldn't necessarily kill an atomic power plant because
surrounding communities would feel that they, too, were
benefiting from the plant's power production.

   Homosexuality on the Curriculum

   In your June 12 page-one article "Uncharted Course" on the
controversy over teaching about homosexuality and AIDS in
high schools, curriculum director Elaine Lohr was quoted as
saying, "We are teaching about homosexuality, not teaching
students to become homosexuals."
   What irony. As a matter of plain, ordinary common sense, I
ask what is going to be the final result for a nation that
insists on teaching about homosexuality to its young people,
while at the same time forbids teaching in its schools, for
fear of proselytizing, very much of anything about 2,000
years of Christianity.

   Your article leaves me certain that once again the facts
about how AIDS is transmitted will be whitewashed to suit the
demands of various pressure groups.
   The classic example of this so far has been the alliance
of convenience between Christian fundamentalists (hoping to
scare everyone away from nonmarital sex) and gay activists
(trying to prevent public understanding of how gay male
behavior has spread AIDS) that has buffaloed the mass media
into blaming AIDS on vague euphemisms such as "unsafe sex." A
more courageous press would have clearly pointed out what the
two main (and interrelated) causes of AIDS among non-drug
users are: 1. Heavy promiscuity among gay males. 2. A high
proportion of their promiscuous couplings consists of anal
sex.
   While the gay press has long told its readers the plain
truth about the danger of anal sex, the mass media's timidity
has undoubtedly led to women dying of AIDS because they never
had a chance to learn this fact. (Feminist groups deserve
censure as well for not making into a women's issue the
threat posed by anal sex, probably out of ideological
solidarity with gay groups.)
   Sure, the media have trumpeted condoms as an all-purpose
talisman against AIDS, but we all know condoms' limitations.
AIDS is too deadly for AIDS education to emphasize only
condoms just to avoid offending organized lobbies.
   Steve Sailer
   Chicago
   ---
   I am constantly amazed at how those involved with the AIDS
issue regularly find someone or something else to blame for
the crisis. In your article, University of Minnesota
pediatrics professor Gary Remafedi says, "AIDS is a disease
that is all about racism, homophobia and discrimination."
   Racism, homophobia and discrimination do exist, but they
did not cause, nor do they perpetuate, AIDS. AIDS is
primarily about unsafe sex being practiced by homosexuals and
bisexuals, and the sharing of unclean needles among drug
users.
   Taking personal responsibility for one's own actions is
not popular in any segment of American society today, and
especially not in the homosexual community and among AIDS
activists. All of us must be caring and compassionate toward
those with AIDS, but with all the suffering that is
occurring, we ought not add truth to the list of casualties.
   Richard A. Webster
   Falls Church, Va.
   ---
   Why is there a crisis today in American public education?
One need look no further than your article describing San
Francisco's ninth-grade classtime devoted to talking about
what homosexuals do in bed. With such a display of moral and
intellectual bankruptcy being further endorsed by the
National Education Association, one may safely conclude that
public education now suffers from a terminal disease.
   Lucielle W. Robbins

   Project 10, mentioned in your article, is the nation's
first mainstream program that addresses the needs of
adolescent homosexuals. Its message is that unchallenged
discrimination will no longer be tolerated. That Project 10
has survived the attacks of professional homophobes and is
being replicated throughout the country speaks for the
desperate need for similar efforts.

   Workplace:
   Many Businesses Responding Too Slowly
   To Rapid Work Force Shifts, Study Says
   ----

   Many work force dilemmas predicted for the year 2000 are
already here -- and most businesses are coping poorly, a new
study says.
   The study reports pressing shortages of technical,
professional and secretarial workers at many companies,
"skills gaps" that are causing high turnover, and
fast-growing diversity in the labor pool.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But managers aren't responding to the changes quickly
enough, the study suggests. It cites a lack of "leading-edge"
recruitment and training strategies, as well as a scarcity of
progressive "support structures" for women and minority
workers such as day-care centers and mentor programs.
   Conducted by the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis
research group, and Towers Perrin, a New York benefits
consulting firm, the study is billed as the first major
follow-up to the influential Workforce 2000 report issued in
1987 by Hudson and the U.S. Department of Labor. That report
drew much attention for its projection of radical demographic
changes. It predicted, among other things, that white males
would constitute only 15% of net additions to the work force
by the year 2000, down sharply from 45% in 1985.
   The new study, released yesterday, moves beyond its
forerunner by documenting work force changes that are taking
place now, and the ways that corporate America is reacting.
   Qualified workers are in short supply at more than half of
the surveyed companies. Scientists and technical workers are
the most elusive; some 70% of the surveyed companies are
having difficulty recruiting them. Professionals in general
are also hard to get. And 55% of the companies surveyed say
they are having trouble finding secretaries and clerks.
   All industries are suffering and expect problems to grow
more severe, but the shortages are currently affecting
industrial, consumer products and health care companies worst
of all, the study says. The most extreme problems: Some 89%
of consumer products companies reported difficulty finding
workers with technical training, while nearly as many health
care concerns can't find enough scientists.
   The study doesn't cite specific companies, but many
corroborate the findings. At Schering-Plough Corp., a
Madison, N.J., maker of medical products, worries about a
shortage of scientists and engineers have helped prompt an
upper-level management review of recruitment strategies and
other issues related to Workforce 2000. Among other steps,
the company will soon expand the number of colleges from
which it seeks promising candidates. "We're trying to become
more aggressive," says Linda A. Cardillo, director of
corporate human resources.
   But job fairs and other traditional recruitment techniques
are still more popular than the more unusual means that have
gained considerable publicity in recent years, the study
found. Although 39% of surveyed companies are boosting
starting salaries, fewer than one-quarter are rehiring
retirees or recruiting the elderly, disabled and other
"nontraditional" workers.
   Companies also have been slow to make a strong commitment
to training the workers they do hire. Two-thirds of the
surveyed firms spend less than $2,000 for classroom and other
on-the-job education for first-year workers. That helps
account for high annual turnover rates, the study says. Half
of the surveyed firms reported about 28% turnover for new
hires.
   Other factors may alienate workers, too. One-fourth of all
surveyed companies said their corporate cultures weren't
"open to diversity," while 29% said discrimination was a
problem and 15% reported "overt harassment" of minorities as
a concern.
   Such results suggest that "organizations' readiness to
manage the changing work force is mixed at best," the study
says.
   The study indicates that diversity is already a reality at
many companies. Minorities constitute at least one-fifth of
the work force at some 39% of surveyed firms, while women
make up more than half the employees at 47% of the companies.
   Still, just one-fourth of companies are training
supervisors in the complexities of managing "a disparate
group" of employees, the study says. Even fewer are adopting
innovative ways to ease conflicts between work and family and
lower the "glass ceilings" that many minority and women
workers face.
   While 42% of companies engage in "explicit" minority
recruiting, for instance, just 12% train minorities for
supervisory positions. Only 11% have created minority support
groups and 10%, mentor programs.
   Meanwhile, 81% of surveyed companies have formal policies
banning sexual harassment. But management training for women
exists at only 32% of firms, while 8% of companies have
created support and mentor groups for women. Under one-third
of companies offer extended maternity leave and just 15% have
on-site or nearsite day care.
   "You've got to be conscious that the work force is
changing," says Cliff Ehrlich, senior vice president for
human resources at Marriott Corp., Washington. Marriott will
bring together senior managers later this month for its first
companywide meeting on "cultural diversity," which Mr.
Ehrlich says will allow the sharing among divisions of ideas
used "only locally until now."
   Many companies, Mr. Ehrlich adds, have been so preoccupied
with slashing jobs that they haven't taken the time to worry
about remaining workers. But at the same time, he says, many
companies haven't tackled the prospect of a changing work
force simply because the issues it presents are so new.
   "Our attitudes have all been forged in an era when labor
has been plentiful," he says. "That's history, and no one's
really sure what the other side looks like. It's tough to do
something about things you don't know about."

Chrysler expects to release its second-quarter results by the

   Mr. Lutz also said the third quarter won't be "a terrible

because plants building the vehicles will close temporarily
to retool for the redesigned 1991 models.

   Sandoz Ltd. Unit
   Receives Pressures
   Over New Drug

   U.S. officials and patient advocates stepped up pressure
on Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. over the price and delivery
system for its new schizophrenia drug, Clozaril.
   The Department of Veterans Affairs said it broke off
negotiations to purchase the drug because the company refuses
to allow the VA to provide its own system to monitor patients
who take it. In Chicago, the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill said it asked two other federal agencies to
intercede in a stalemate over the price and delivery of the
drug.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The actions reflect growing frustration over Clozaril,
known in its generic form as clozapine. The first new
compound for schizophrenia in 20 years, it has proved
successful in treating some patients for whom conventional
medicines have failed. In some cases, patients who have been
confined in state mental hospitals for years have improved
enough on the medicine to be released from wards and hold
jobs. As many as 200,000 patients nationwide, most of them
indigent, are considered to be candidates for Clozaril.
   But the drug, and a monitoring system patients must
purchase along with the medicine, cost $8,944 a year. Many
state mental health and Medicaid programs, as well as the VA,
say they can't afford it. Sandoz, a unit of the Swiss drug
firm Sandoz Ltd., says the proprietary system is necessary to
monitor a patient's blood for a side effect that can be fatal
unless detected early.
   The VA has designed its own monitoring program and says it
won't pay for a service the agency already offers.
   The controversy is getting attention in Congress. Sen.
David Pryor (D., Ark.) is said to be considering legislation
specifically aimed at penalizing companies that require
patients to buy a drug bundled with associated tests or other
services.
   David L. Winter, Sandoz's vice president, scientific and
external affairs, said the company is prepared to consider a
VA monitoring system if it is as effective as the Sandoz
system, and if the VA is willing to accept liability for any
consequences. He said among 4,200 new patients taking the
drug since February, 15 developed a severe version of the
side effect and another 28 had a milder case. All were
reversed when they stopped taking the drug. Without strict
monitoring, such patients could die, he said, and the drug
would likely be pulled from the market.
   "If groups are wiling to discuss indemnification, I think
we might have a different set of discussions in the future,"
Dr. Winter said. "We can't risk this company on this drug."

   PONTIAC, Mich. -- A federal district court denied First
Federal Bancorp's request for a preliminary injunction that
would prevent federal regulators from appointing a
conservator or receiver for a First Federal subsidiary.
   However, the court continued the temporary restraining
order in effect against the federal Office of Thrift
Supervision until July 27, to give the First Federal
officials time to appeal.

   The bank said it intends to file such an appeal.

   HOUSTON -- American General Corp., which earlier this year
defeated a hostile takeover bid by Torchmark Corp., reported
higher second-quarter earnings; these earnings, the company
says, indicate that it was correct in arguing that
Torchmark's $50-a-share bid was too low.
   For the second quarter, the insurance company reported net
income rose to $198 million, or $1.65 a share, compared with
profit from continuing operations of $103.4 million, or 82
cents a share. Net income in the year-ago quarter was $190
million, or $1.47 a share. After-tax operating earnings,
excluding realized investment gains, rose about 19%, to
$117.5 million, or 98 cents a share, from $98.4 million, or
78 cents a share. Revenue rose to $1.2 billion, from $1.05
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Clearly our earnings substantiate what we have been
saying about the underlying earning power of the company,
which we feel exceeds the value" of Torchmark's offer, said
James D'Agostino Jr., American General vice president and
treasurer.
   For the six months, the company reported net income of
$305.1 million, or $2.55 a share, compared with income from
continuing operations of $200.6 million, or $1.59 a share.
For the 1989 six months, the company reported net income of
$287.2 million, or $2.24 a share. Revenue increased to $2.24
billion, from $2.06 billion.
   The company, which also said it has been approached by a
number of domestic and international companies interested in
buying American General, has started providing due diligence
information to at least one interested party. Although
American General beat back an effort by Torchmark to place
its own nominees on American's board of directors in May, the
company announced at its annual meeting that it was placing
itself on the block anyway.

   Companies listed below reported quarterly profit
substantially different from the average of analysts'
estimates. The companies are followed by at least three
analysts. Results in parentheses are losses.
   The percent difference compares actual profit with the
30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues
forecasts in the past 30 days. Otherwise, actual profit is
compared with the 120-day estimate.
