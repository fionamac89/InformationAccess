   FORD MOTOR Co. (Dearborn, Mich.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it has placed about $5.2 billion in
securities issued by this auto maker's finance arm under
review for a possible ratings downgrade. The move follows
Tuesday's announcement that Moody's is reviewing the ratings
of $40 billion in Ford debt for possible downgrade in the
wake of weak U.S. car sales. A Ford spokesman said yesterday
that the company believes both actions are unwarranted.

   A securities analyst said Merck &amp; Co.'s highly touted drug
for shrinking prostates is producing only "marginal" results
in experimental trials, but company officials sharply
disputed the analyst's report.
   Despite the company's quick response, Merck's shares were
battered in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
falling $3.125 to $76.875 on heavy volume.

<TEXT>
   Patricia Padgett Lea, who follows the pharmaceutical
industry for Vector Securities in Deerfield, Ill., said
Merck's experimental drug, Proscar, "had no meaningful
impact" in reducing symptoms of patients using the drug in
test studies. Ms. Lea said she conducted phone interviews
with about 10 doctors helping Merck study the drug.
   "None of the doctors were particularly enthusiastic about
{the drug}," she said in an interview. Ms. Lea said symptoms
of an enlarged prostate, such as blocked urine flow, weren't
satisfactorily relieved by the drug, according to her
interviews.
   Ms. Lea said she expects the drug to produce annual sales
of "only" about $200 million. Many analysts said Merck's
ability to increase profits by 18% to 20% into the 1990s
relies on Proscar's being a huge-seller, and some predict
Proscar's sales could top $1 billion a year. Merck hasn't
made a public forecast of potential sales, but its chairman
and chief executive officer, P. Roy Vagelos, has stated that
he expects Proscar to be very successful.
   Elizabeth Stoner, Merck's senior director for clinical
research, said there was no evidence to support Ms. Lea's
findings. Dr. Stoner said Merck's study of 1,800 men was
completed several months ago and the data are being analyzed.
She said that as the data haven't been released to the 90
doctors participating in the study, the doctors wouldn't know
which patients were given the drug and which took a placebo.
   Dr. Stoner said Merck plans to use data from the study to
seek government approval early next year to market the drug.
Merck claims that Proscar can shrink enlarged prostates, a
condition that affects many men over age 50, and avoid the
need for surgery.
   The drug's effectiveness has become a source of much
speculation on Wall Street and within the medical community
because the only scientific evidence of the drug's
effectiveness is the just-finished study. Results from the
study will be released next year, the company said.

   Spirit of Palestinian Uprising Remains Alive
   In Town That Defied Israel With a Tax Boycott

   BEIT SAHUR, Israeli-Occupied West Bank -- Issa Massad
picks his way across the broken plaster and splintered wood
that has littered his empty office for a year, hunting for
any trace that he was once the leading dental hygienist in
this Christian Arab town.
   "Here was the sterilization unit," says the 34-year-old,
pointing to a cupboard whose door hangs ajar. "This wall is
where I had my drill." Picking up a clipped piece of
electrical cable, he shrugs: "When the Israeli soldiers came
in, they took everything -- except time to unplug the
equipment. They just cut the wires. All they left was this."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A year ago today, this well-to-do town near Bethlehem was
the center of attention in the Mideast. Beit Sahur was
besieged by Israeli troops because of the unusual manner of
its participation in the "intifada," the Palestinian uprising
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that now has been
going on for almost three years. Many of Beit Sahur's 12,000
people defied the Israeli occupation -- not by throwing
stones, but by refusing to pay their taxes. Their resistance
provoked an army curfew, and ultimately a siege, during which
the army cut all road and telephone links. Only people who
paid their taxes could enter or leave.
   For 42 days, the townspeople didn't budge. On the 43rd
day, Israeli tax collectors assisted by soldiers moved in to
seize property -- from Mr. Massad's dental equipment to cars,
televisions, even socks. About $1.5 million in property was
seized and auctioned off; 40 people were arrested and many
were jailed.
   To the outside world, Beit Sahur illustrated that mass
opposition to the Israeli role in the West Bank spans all
economic classes of Palestinians, including professionals who
have succeeded economically under Israeli rule. And perhaps
because of its sharp contrast with the bus attacks, rock
throwing and other violence of the intifada, Beit Sahur's
nonviolent resistance showed that not everyone who opposed
the occupation was a terrorist.
   A year later, life here is harder. City counsellor Atallah
Rishmawi says the city's economy is half what it was. Nearly
a quarter of the small textile workshops that dotted the town
have closed. Outside the al Sha'ab pharmacy near the small
city hall, groups of unemployed young men gossip and loiter
for hours.
   Nonetheless, people here say resistance to Israeli rule is
hardening. Though Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has pushed the
uprising to the back pages, people in Beit Sahur say they are
determined to continue their tax boycott.
   "They destroyed my business. They took my television. They
put me in prison. But still I continue to fight," says Mr.
Massad. "This is war. People are just as determined to resist
as ever, and to assist in the intifada. Nothing has been
resolved."
   Beit Sahur has been energized by Saddam Hussein's takeover
of Kuwait. People say they support Mr. Hussein because he is
the only Arab strong enough to defy their principal foreign
enemy, the U.S. At a building-supplies shop, which stocks
only half as much as it once did, a plumber named Tewfik puts
it simply: "Saddam is good, the Americans no. You are either
with us Arabs, or you are against us."
   Beit Sahur is a potent reminder that the situation that
led to the intifada hasn't been resolved. Though Israeli
officials quietly press the point that they accurately warned
the world long ago about Saddam Hussein's territorial
ambitions, the Israelis have a lingering problem in their own
backyard, on territory taken in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
And while observers say the intifada is in a quiet phase,
violence on either side could make it erupt again.
   "The intifada is definitely not over," says Keith Kyle, a
Mideast specialist at London's Royal Institute of
International Affairs. "It may have quieted somewhat due to
less arrogant Israeli policing and more internal Palestinian
bickering and fatigue. But I don't think {the Palestinians'}
sheer determination has been weakened."
   Beit Sahur, whose sun-parched buildings of pale flintstone
rise from ancient Judean hills, seems an unlikely place for a
revolt. Biblical scholars say this is the tranquil spot where
shepherds were awakened by an angel to Jesus's birth in
Bethlehem. The once-prosperous merchants wear Baume &amp; Mercier
watches and drive Fords, like city counsellor Rishmawi, a
leader of the tax revolt.
   But while their feet are firmly on the ground, their
hearts and minds are elsewhere. "We want to be free. Why
should we pay for our own occupation?" asks Mr. Rishmawi.
Before the siege, he says, "We were called the Japan of
Palestine. We calculate we lost a total of $5 million in the
siege, both in lost material and lost business." He leafs
through Arabic ledgers documenting the seized property. "We
have less to lose now," he says.
   People credit the international outcry over Beit Sahur as
one of the factors in lightening the Israelis' hand in the
territories. While the current Israeli government is
considered among the most hawkish in more than 40 years,
Defense Minister Moshe Arens's policy of "avoiding
unnecessary friction" has led to an easing of tension and a
sharp drop in the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis.
   Indeed, while nearly 1,000 people have been killed in the
33 months since the uprising began, the balance has shifted:
The number of Palestinians killed by other Palestinians is
rising quickly, and the number killed by Israeli troops is
declining. Last month, intra-Palestinian fatalities in the
occupied territories totaled 41, more than four times the
number killed by Israeli troops. "Obviously, the intifada
isn't over, but we think our policy is working," says an
Israeli official.
   Still, the Palestinians are far from united. "We are very
troubled by the high rate of killing" in internal Palestinian
clashes, says a Palestinian spokesman in Jerusalem. Despite
claims that most murdered Palestinians are Israeli
collaborators, it isn't clear how strong intifada leaders'
control is. And some activists want to switch from stones to
bullets.
   But in Beit Sahur, regardless of the bickering among
Palestinians, the bad feelings generated by the tax siege
appear to guarantee continued resistance.
   Naila Hayek Rishmawi, a secretary, recalls that when the
patrol came to arrest her husband after the siege, her
two-year-old daughter Nadine burst into tears, crying "PLO
yes, Israel no."

   Chrysler Calls Pact
   Of GM-UAW Costly
   But May Accept It

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- A top Chrysler Corp. official said
the proposed contract between the United Auto Workers union
and General Motors Corp. looks "expensive," but it isn't
clear how long the No. 3 auto maker will fight a pact modeled
on the GM settlement.
   "We've made our position clear from the beginning. GM may
have deep pockets, but we don't," said Bennet E. Bidwell,
chairman of Chrysler's automotive operations. "We can't
afford to match an outrageous pattern settlement."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But privately, the company is telling Wall Street analysts
that it could afford a pact on terms similar to GM's. When
asked about the contradiction, Chrysler hastily distanced
itself from statements made to analysts, saying they came
from a source that "cannot and does not speak for the
company."
   UAW bargainers won $4 billion of income guarantees and
increases in pension plans from GM during contract
negotiations completed Monday. Accepting the terms of the GM
package could cost Chrysler as much a $1 billion over three
years, analysts said.
   Chrysler is struggling to reverse a steep slide in its
share of the U.S. car market, and trying to cut $2.5 billion
from annual operating costs by June 30. But the company has
the resources to finance such a deal to avoid a strike,
analysts said.
   Moreover, Chrysler has some advantages over GM in terms of
the pact. It is closer to being at full capacity and
therefore would be less likely to have to pay full wages to
workers laid off for extended periods. "We don't have any
more plants to close," as GM does, Mr. Bidwell said.
   In any case, Chrysler will probably have to wait before
confronting the UAW. GM workers must approve the pact, and
then the UAW will bargain with Ford Motor Co.
   Ford officials have said they could accept the GM pact but
will seek some alterations. One problem for Ford is that the
GM contract increases to as much as $5 an hour from $1.25 the
penalty the company must pay for overtime. The payment goes
to a joint training fund and is in addition to overtime
premiums paid directly to workers. Ford runs many plants on
overtime, and company officials say that strategy gives its
UAW workers job security. When sales slowed earlier this
year, Ford cut back on overtime rather than laying people
off.
   Separately, Chrysler officials said they expect to
increase the company's share of U.S. car sales to 10.5% in
the fourth quarter from 8.7% so far this year. Chrysler's
strategy: cut prices on some slow selling models and sell
more aggressively to rental car companies. Chrysler also
wants to raise its share of the truck market.

   Has the Long-Awaited Recession Arrived?

   In the wake of the October 1987 market crash, many
economists were convinced the next recession was no more than
a year away. Somehow, though, the economy has continued to
expand. Saddam Hussein, however, may be producing the
long-expected recession.
   If the 52 economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, half now
say an official recession will be under way by the end of
this year; a similar percentage probably applies to
economists generally. The economy was slowing even before
Iraq invaded Kuwait, and rising energy costs and bigger
budget deficits may push the economy over the brink.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's likely but by no means certain.
   Even those who vote for a 1990 recession have some doubts.
Lawrence Meyer, an econometrician based at Washington
University of St.Louis, expects a recession to begin in the
fourth quarter. But he worries about the political
uncertainties. "Our models," he says, "can't fully handle the
problems. There's more need for judgmental analysis." In
other words, there's more need for a few careful guesses.
   Close to half of all analysts see no recession in 1990,
and they offer some interesting reasons for their relative
optimism.
   Those who think the economy will muddle through obviously
assume the oil shock will be handled, with increased supplies
from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere offsetting most of the lost
output from Iraq and Kuwait. They also don't expect
full-scale war, shutting off a great deal of oil. Oil prices
will settle at about $25 a barrel, about $5 above the
pre-invasion level, and the market will stabilize.
   There is general agreement that the oil price shock will
keep upward pressure under general prices, at least through
the end of this year. Some analysts see this as a sign of
unsuspected economic strength. Robert Brusca, chief economist
of Nikko Securities Co. International, for instance, notes
that the consumer price index is rising at a year-over-year
rate of 4.8%. "If the economy is so weak," he asks, "how can
such price pressures persist?"
   Michael Keran, chief economist of Prudential Insurance
Co., thinks that high oil prices, and a fear of more of the
same, can have a positive effect on the economy in the short
run. "Increased energy costs are a factor of production which
raises the cost of producing a whole host of other goods," he
says. "Businessmen, aware that this creates a potential for
future price increases, will add to their inventory
holdings."
   Some analysts were encouraged by the revision of the
inflation-adjusted gross national product for the second
quarter, although the gain remained at an overall 1.2% rate.
Consumer spending and net exports were revised upward
substantially, says Morris Cohen, a Hackensack, N.J.,
consultant. "Thus the economy turned out to be in better
shape than the original estimates had shown." Mr. Cohen does
expect the fourth quarter to be negative, but he looks for an
upturn at the end of the year. (For the consensus views, see
the accompanying table.)
   The optimistic analysts expect the Federal Reserve
eventually to provide more help in fending off a 1990
recession. Lacy Hunt, chief economist of CM&amp;M Group, says,
"Currently, the Federal Reserve is likely to pursue a
relatively accommodative policy in an attempt to keep the
economy growing, even at the expense of higher inflation."
   Mr. Hunt notes three other props that could keep the
economy out of a recession this year. Before the oil shocks
of 1974 and 1979, business inventories had been very high,
and the subsequent liquidations were heavily responsible for
the recessions that followed. At the moment, business
inventories are relatively low.
   Second, the composition of the economy has changed. The
now-dominant service sector is less affected by higher energy
costs than manufacturing was in the 1970s. Finally, the weak
dollar is helping to push up exports and limit imports.
   Even the relative optimists don't foresee a business boom.
"While the economy should avoid recession," Mr. Hunt says,
"the growth rate should be a very sluggish 0.5% through late
1991."
   Mickey Levy, chief economist of CRT Government Securities
in New York, says the difference between a positive growth
rate of 0.5% and a negative rate of 0.5% is so small the
average businessman would be unlikely to feel it.
   Mr. Levy likes to stress the difference between economic
risks and economic uncertainty. "Risks," he says, "we can
deal with by the way we plan and make investments.
Uncertainties are just uncertainties -- all we can do is
speculate." Seldom have forecasters felt so trapped in
speculation.

   While other companies spend millions to establish
corporate identities, Xerox Corp. yesterday launched an
effort to shed one.
   Famous for inventing the copier and personal computer,
then ceding the markets, Xerox is poised for a critical
comeback bid. Success promises big returns from a
computerized approach to paperwork that may change business
as much as did its original copier. Says Chairman David
Kearns: "This is a really, really big deal for us."
</LP>

   But another failure -- and there have been several over
the past 20 years -- could see Xerox outflanked again with
its own inventions. And that would cripple the company's
hopes of ever participating in an information age it
predicted 15 years ago, says Charles Pesko, chief executive
of BIS Marketing Information, a market-research firm.
   "They have to succeed," says Mr. Pesko. "At this stage,
they have no other choice." Echoes David Nadler, a consultant
who has advised Xerox: "There's only so long you can defend a
maturing technology like the copier."
   In Act I of a two-part rollout, Xerox yesterday unveiled a
wide-ranging package of computers and software intended to
help people in offices work better together. While not
unique, the technology plays off Xerox's strengths:
Easy-to-use, consistent displays; good communications; and an
approach that emphasizes work groups. As in almost every
computer announcement these days, Xerox claimed its products
would work with those of other major manufacturers.
   But yesterday's introductions were just setting the scene.
Act II comes Oct. 2, when Xerox will augment this vision by
introducing a new kind of technology: a $200,000 machine that
combines high-speed copying, printing, scanning, facsimile
and computing capabilities in a single unit.
   The output is aimed at matching the quality usually
associated with offset printing.
   This new machine, known inside the company as Xenith, is
more than 15 years in the making. Though no one will put a
price tag on its development, insiders say it is the
company's largest-ever project -- in a company that spends
$800 million a year on R&amp;D. For the first time since 1959,
when the Xerox 914 copier rolled out, the firm is pushing an
entirely new approach to paper work.
   Xenith will hook up with the rest of Xerox's computing
products and with other computers to provide what the firm
will tout as a seamless solution for companies swamped with
paper work. Acting as an exchange point between the world of
paper and the world of computers, the big multifunction
device is Xerox's first digital copier and is designed to
become part of a family of machines that would be the
company's bread-and-butter revenue producer through the
1990s, according to industry executives.
   Essentially, Xenith will be able to take in everything an
office now receives -- paper documents, computer information,
pictures, graphics, even mail -- and then massage it, change
it and redistribute it.
   It will put a publishing-grade printing device in the
hands of casual computer users. Using Xenith, a telephone
representative at an insurance company will be able to send a
bound copy of a particular policy with the push of a button;
a desk jockey at a government agency could send out 100 bid
requests on demand, complete with instruction manuals,
without visiting a stockroom piled with forms.
   But the machine works both ways: Since it also converts
paperbound images to electronic data, it will allow computer
users to manipulate and combine documents on-screen. With a
"jukebox" of optical disks, it could even serve as the
backbone of a filing system that everyone in the company
could access.
   Taken together, Xerox's two announcements embody a very
particular view of how computing will develop over the next
few decades: Increasingly dependent on decentralized networks
of computers, the argument goes, firms will be forced to look
to better software and intelligent, highly efficient
peripheral devices for productivity gains. Documents will
have to exist primarily in computers, while paper becomes
just another means of display.
   The announcements also aim to alter Xerox's popular image
as the leading has-been in office equipment. Despite costly
efforts to become a player in computers and finance, Xerox
has repeatedly failed to shed its identity as the firm that
pioneered the stand-alone copier, then saw its 100% market
share devoured almost entirely by more cost-efficient
Japanese producers.
   Xerox's image in high-tech circles is equally
unflattering. It came up with many of the computer industry's
most important innovations, only to let other firms copy its
ideas while it invested in outdated technology and dubious
sidelines.
   "This is a company that has been painfully slow to
recognize and commercialize its own best technology," says
Alex Henderson, an analyst who follows Xerox for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Xenith is likely Xerox's last chance to take advantage of
a flowering of genius that took place at its Palo Alto
Research Center (PARC) in Palo Alto, Calif., during the
1970s. That produced breakthroughs like the personal
computer, the laser printer and the "mouse," which have so
far benefited almost every electronics firm except Xerox.
   Xenith is perhaps the only part of that legacy that hasn't
been plundered so far. Originally code-named Harvest, the
project started as a labor of love for a tiny team of Xerox
engineers, marketers and futurists who had been directed to
come up with technologies that would supplant traditional
copiers before competitors beat them to the punch.
   "It was like a brave new world," recalls John Shoemaker,
who oversaw the team for several years and now works at Sun
Microsystems Inc. "We were looking at everything, with no
preconceptions. It was hard to ask anyone their opinion of
our work, because nothing like it had ever existed before."
   Mr. Shoemaker remembers nights and weekends in the late
1970s when engineers' spouses would come in to sort machine
parts so that prototypes could be assembled on time. From
this primal tinkering evolved a massive machine that requires
more lines of computer code to control it than many mainframe
computers.
   "This will be very different than anything else that is
out there," says William Lowe, the Xerox executive vice
president imported from International Business Machines Corp.
to push Xenith out the door.
   Mr. Lowe is coy about details of the Xenith machine --
indeed, he carefully avoids acknowledging its existence --
even after yesterday's announcement. But he calls
computerized documents "the big news of the 1990s," in much
the same way personal computers were the big news of the
1980s.
   He knows a bit about that subject: He is sometimes
referred to as the godfather of IBM's original personal
computer.
   In an interview, Chairman Kearns leaves no doubt that
Xenith and its successors are the key to returning his firm
to double-digit revenue growth it last saw in the mid-1980s,
"rather than clunking along at 6% or 7%." He also predicts
that the new products would enable Xerox's $12.4 billion
office-products division to deliver annual returns of 17% to
19% in the mid-1990s.
   Adds Paul Allaire, Xerox's new chief executive, in a
separate interview: "This will show people that all the money
we've been investing in research and development wasn't
wasted."
   But while Xenith is clearly impressive, its success is far
from assured. For one thing, Xerox is still busy extricating
itself from a morass of problems caused by its last attempt
to make a name outside of copiers, an ill-fated foray led by
Mr. Kearns into financial services during the early 1980s.
   That move had some benefits: The financial services
division did well for a few years, giving Xerox breathing
room to implement a quality program that helped its
once-dominant copiers regain market share against Japanese
competition. But the diversion has recently become as heavy a
burden as the ancient millstone Mr. Allaire keeps propped in
his office in Stamford, Conn.
   At the company's annual meeting in May, Mr. Kearns
conceded that a dismal performance by Xerox's $5.4 billion
financial services arm will cause profits to drop in 1990,
even before a $375 million write-off taken in the first
quarter to cover bad real-estate investments. In 1989, the
company earned $704 million, or $6.41 a share, on revenue of
$17.6 billion. Mr. Kearns didn't suggest how much profits
will fall this year.
   Mr. Allaire has stopped internal subsidies to financial
services, and has announced his intention to sell or close
any business that can't return at least 15% on equity.
   Then there's the competition. By setting itself up as a
seller of office systems rather than stand-alone copiers and
printers, Xerox is poaching on some pretty serious turf. Many
large computer companies have articulated plans to tie
computers, output devices and software together, and Xerox's
vision is yet another option in a world that's confused
already.
   "They may have a hard time showing that this is something
different enough to merit attention," says analyst Peter
Enderlin of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Moreover, companies like IBM and Unisys Corp. got a jump
on Xerox earlier this year by announcing systems designed to
woo exactly the market Xenith is aimed at: Large-scale
pushers of paper like banks, insurance companies and
government contractors.
   Xerox will attempt to play down such conflicts by making
Xenith take advantage of everyone else's computers and
software. But the company was beaten to market last week by
Eastman Kodak Co., whose well-received new LionHeart
high-speed printing system also connects to a wide range of
desktop computers.
   Though LionHeart apparently isn't as versatile as Xenith,
Kodak promises to offer enhancements. Kodak says it sells for
"less than $250,000, fully configured."
   Meanwhile, Japanese companies like Ricoh Corp., Canon Inc.
and Sharp Corp. are hoping to ambush Xerox's multifunction
ambitions by introducing low-end machines that copy, print,
scan and fax. National Semiconductor Corp. recently unveiled
a microchip that will enable such machines, which are
sometimes generically called Hydras, to be made cheaply.
   With cheap Hydras being shared by work groups -- or even
with one on every desk -- the appeal of a powerful machine
like Xenith, which is more reminiscent of a mainframe than a
personal computer, may be limited to a small number of
paper-intensive companies.
   "We believe that the multifunction market will take off
only when the price drops low enough," says Les Wilson,
corporate manager of imaging systems at National
Semiconductor. "I hate to say it, but right now it looks like
the Japanese have the technology to dominate this market."
   Finally, there's the Xenith machine itself. While most who
have seen it are impressed with Xenith's technology, which
can do just about anything short of making toast, they worry
about whether it offers enough advances to justify its high
price.
   Says one prominent Xerox alumnus: "It's a neat machine,
and a worthwhile concept, but for hundreds of thousands of
dollars they'll have a lot of convincing to do."
   "If Xerox says it is trying to create a new market, we
respect that," says Canon's Haruo Murase. "We like their
idea." But, he adds with a laugh, "a $200,000 machine is a
very, very expensive way to test that market."
   Mr. Allaire agrees that the major challenge with Xenith
will be marketing, but argues that the business environment
is moving in his favor. Printing of all sorts -- copying,
laser printing, offset printing -- accounts for $80 billion a
year, he says, and Xerox soon will be positioned to compete
for three-quarters of that market.
   And while Xenith is clearly aimed at the high end of the
market, where Xerox has traditionally been most successful,
company officials indicate that a workgroup-size Xenith is
likely in the next few years; a desktop version is further
away, if Xerox decides to build one at all.
   But success won't initially come from a choice of
machines, analysts say. It will rest on whether people
believe Xerox's view of how paper work should be done in a
computerized environment.
   Mr. Allaire says most top executives aren't aware that
their companies spend 10% or more of their revenue producing
and manipulating documents, and that the area is ripe for a
major advance in productivity. He uses the super-efficient
American Express charge-card billing system, to which Xerox
contributed, as an example.
   "We have to show people that kind of thing," he says. "We
have to ennoble the document somehow."
   To that end, Xerox tapped the well-connected Mr. Lowe to
line up an impressive list of industry heavyweights as
collaborators, from Sun to Netframe Systems Inc., a maker of
powerful "file server" computers, to Adobe Systems Inc.,
which controls the software that allows computers print and
display type.
   Those alliances, coupled with Xerox's commitment to
connect its products with just about every computer in
existence, have convinced at least some people that Xerox can
finally change its image and emerge as a player in the
computer industry.
   "The probability is on Xerox's side this time," says Ajit
Kapur of Meta Group, a market-research firm in Stamford. "A
company can miss only so many opportunities before it gets
things right."

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Pitney Bowes Inc. said it is scrapping
its remanufactured copier business, which will result in a
one-time pretax charge of $86 million in the third quarter.
   The hefty charge -- 68 cents a share after taxes -- could
mean the company will report earnings of about 10 cents a
share based on analysts' estimates it would have earned 78
cents a share without the charge. As a result, Pitney also
said it expects lower net income for the year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1989, Pitney earned $252.8 million, or $3.08 a share,
on revenue of $2.88 billion. In the year-ago third quarter,
it earned $62 million, or 78 cents a share, on revenue of
$711.9 million. The quarter included income from discontinued
operations of $2.6 million, or three cents a share.
   The announcement yesterday battered Pitney Bowes shares,
which slid $4.125 to close at $30.125 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Investors said they were surprised by the size of the
write-off, but Chairman George B. Harvey said investors "may
not yet fully appreciate the benefits of the action."
   Some analysts said the stock price decline might have been
an "overreaction" to news they believed was positive in the
long term for the company. "They're eliminating one of the
problems that have hurt earnings," said Alex Henderson, of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Indeed, the remanufacturing segment has been a drag on its
copier business, which generates about 10%, or $300 million,
of annual revenue for the company. The business takes rental
copiers that have been returned and remanufactures them, and
they are rented again at a discount. But that created
inventory problems and profit margins were lower than if the
company were to rent higher-margin copiers to businesses.
   "Margins on remanufactured copiers are low and, by
focusing our sales and service efforts on new and higher
value products, we believe we can improve our gross margins
and enhance our after-market supplies and service revenue,"
said Mr. Harvey.

   WASHINGTON -- Voters in two distinct political cultures
delivered a distinct message: They're tired of politics and
politicians.
   Massachusetts voters, in an expression of voter
alienation, selected the outspoken John Silber as the
Democratic nominee for governor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Oklahoma voters, by a large margin, approved a limit on
state lawmakers' tenure. The amendment, which takes effect
Jan. 1, will restrict legislators to 12 years in office.
Those now in office will be allowed to serve 12 more years.
   The upset triumph of Mr. Silber, who is on leave as
president of Boston University, over former state Attorney
General Francis Bellotti came as Massachusetts voters turned
away politicians with ties to Gov. Michael Dukakis, the 1988
Democratic presidential nominee. One of the losers in
Tuesday's primary balloting was Democratic Attorney General
James Shannon.
   Mr. Silber, a tough-talking Texan who came to symbolize
Bay State resentment of the political establishment, will
face former federal prosecutor William Weld, another
political outsider who pulled off an upset in the Republican
gubernatorial primary. He defeated House Minority Leader
Steven Pierce.
   The Massachusetts results were a rebuke to what candidates
in both parties called "politics-as-usual" and brought to an
end an era dominated by Mr. Dukakis, who served three terms
as governor. In the face of mounting criticism and burgeoning
budget deficits, he declined to seek another term.
   "The choice is between leadership proven by experience or
more of the same," Mr. Silber said at his victory party.
"Have you had enough? I think you have. Then join me in
taking back our government."

such things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds

   PLAINVIEW, N.Y. -- Astrex Inc. began reassessing its
accounting procedures after reporting that Ronald S. Kass,
its president and chief executive officer, charged at least
$150,000 in personal expenses to the company.
   Mr. Kass, who resigned as chief financial officer of the
electronics parts distribution company, "has acknowledged
causing such payments to be made for his personal benefit,"
the company said, and has agreed to make restitution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said the payments had been made over 2 1/2
years, in payments Mr. Kass caused to be made to third
parties; many of the payments were classified for accounting
purposes as capital assets. The total amount of the payments
hasn't been determined. Mr. Kass is continuing to serve as
chief executive and president at his base salary, although
his employment contract has been terminated, now making him
an "employee at will."
   Astrex directors said they believe "it is in the best
interests of the company for Mr. Kass to remain employed."
   Astrex said the $150,000 represents less than 3% of the
company's assets, but noted that "there is currently no
assurance" that Mr. Kass's acts "will not adversely affect
the company."
   An audit committee of the board and an independent
accounting firm have been investigating the matter since
August. Mark Schindler, a director, said no criminal
investigation is under way. "It's not likely that this will
go that far," he said. The committee will report next week on
the total amount involved and whether any further action will
be taken against Mr. Kass, who has been with the company for
more than 20 years.
   Mr. Kass and his attorneys at Jacobson &amp; Mermelstein in
New York declined to comment.
   Mr. Schindler said that the board decided to retain Mr.
Kass as an employee because he "is a key man in the
electronic connector business" and is "familiar with all
the matters of the company."
   Separately, Astrex reported that on Sept. 1, it failed to
pay interest of approximately $425,000 due on $8.8 million of
9.5% debentures due Sept. 2000.
   Astrex distributes over 25,000 electronic parts and
components to about 4,000 customers, chiefly in the Northeast
region. Astrex had a net loss of $355,000 or 33 cents a share
on revenue of $4.3 million for the fiscal first quarter ended
June 30.

   FRANKFURT -- Producer prices in East Germany were down 50%
in July from the average for all of 1989, the East German
state news agency ADN reported.
   Citing data from the East German Statistics Office, ADN
said this is the first time East Germany has published
producer price data. Because of the lack of reliable monthly
data for 1989, the year-earlier figures used for comparison
are averages for the entire year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As the two Germanys speed toward a merger on Oct. 3, the
East Germans have been scrambling to produce accurate data
that conform as closely as possible to Western economic
reporting standards.
   ADN said the Statistics Office surveyed 1,900 companies
for its price report.

   COSTS SOAR in Seoul. Services outpace Manhattan's, while
rents rival Tokyo's.
   Goods and services in the capital cost 40% to 80% more
than in New York, depending on how well an expatriate lives,
says Organizational Resources Counselors Inc. Tokyo's price
spiral actually slowed in the past two years, but not so in
Seoul. Residential rents now are nearly identical in the two
Asian cities -- and Korean landlords demand payment in
advance for the lease period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Expatriates lament that the real cost of living is even
higher than surveys show. Monthly rent for a typical
five-bedroom house nearly tripled in the last year, to
$9,000, while consumer-goods prices jumped 20%, says the
American Chamber of Commerce in Seoul. As for office help, an
entry-level bilingual employee can command about $30,000 at a
foreign bank. Office space costs about $36 a square foot --
about half Tokyo rates -- but decent space is scarce.
   One bargain: public transport. Seoul taxis charge a $1
initial meter rate, and the subway costs only 27 cents.

   KOREA DISSIPATES good will on trade, U.S. and European
officials say.
   It is backtracking again on promises to open markets after
escaping designation as an unfair trading partner by the U.S.
last spring. Trade "is headed for a slugfest," says one U.S.
official. The government here delays broad tariff cuts,
citing "weak" economic growth of 10% this year. And with
local farmers fighting import liberalization, Korea feels it
has little room for concessions on food. Disputes over
telecommunications, cigarettes, and intellectual property
also fester.
   Europeans fare no better. Angered by an anti-import
campaign, they want, among other things, an easing of
discriminatory taxes of more than 100% on their wines and
liquors. Meanwhile, British Ambassador David Wright does his
best for England with a garden party to promote Jaguars.
Imported cars carry a hefty new $4,000 tax, in addition to
other taxes that multiply their cost.
                                                                                                       

   RISK CAPITAL: Korea suffers the highest rate of industrial
accidents.
   Two out of every 100 mine and factory workers were injured
last year; 26 out of every 100,000 were killed. In the first
half of 1990, the death rate jumped 43%, while the accident
rate rose about 3%. And government figures show that 20% of
the nation's workers have suffered an accident. Part of the
reason: a rush to produce more goods. Cho Sung Oh, director
of the government's plant safety programs, admits: "Our
safety technique isn't as advanced as our increasing
productivity rate."
   Unions, outlawed until 1987 and previously concentrating
on wages, now begin focusing on safety. Hyundai Motor's
union, the nation's richest, recently initiated the first
company-sponsored safety survey. But government efforts to
educate laborers fall flat. Many refuse welding masks or hard
hats as unmanly.
   Meanwhile, each of the government's 211 safety inspectors
must check about 560 factories.
                                                                                                       

   THE NAME'S THE SAME: 36% of Korean families are either Kim
or Lee. Top law firms include Shin & Kim; Kim, Shin & Yu; Kim
& Chang; Kim, Chang & Lee; Bae, Kim & Lee; and Lee &amp; Ko.
                                                                                                       

   SHEEPSKINS, BUT NO JOBS. The unemployment rate for college
graduates in Korea is double the general 2.6% rate. The
country needs scientists and technicians, but colleges crank
out liberal-arts majors. More than 30% of 1988 graduates are
jobless.
                                                                                                       

   TAP WATER is polluted with bacteria and heavy metals, the
government says. Yet it outlaws sales of bottled water to
natives; only foreign residents can buy it. Nine Korean
bottlers sue on constitutional grounds. The U.S. Embassy says
pollution-control devices, for air, water and waste, are a
ripe market for American businesses.
                                                                                                       

   REUNIFICATION PROSPECTS vary, depending on who's
prognosticating.
   President Roh Tae Woo sees union with the Communist North
in five years; his economists are skeptical. "Up to now,
people are taking the issue emotionally, not practically,"
says Ko Il Dong, a researcher at the government-sponsored
Korea Development Institute. The South's per capita GNP of
about $5,000, at least five times higher than North Korea's,
would fall 25% upon reunification. In six years, when per
capita GNP is expected to be $10,000, it would be easier, the
government says.
   After watching the German example, technocrats in Seoul
are convinced the costs of merging with backward North Korea
would be onerous. "Economically speaking, it is a nightmare,"
says a top adviser to the president. Scholars here also point
out that West Germany knew what to expect, having met with
East German officials many times over the years. But the
belligerent Koreas have talked only a few times. "We need
five to 10 years, then we can prepare for reunification,"
says Yeon Ha Cheong of the Korea Development Institute.
   North Korea carries a hard-currency debt load of $5.2
billion, much of it going bad, which Mr. Yeon says the South
can't quickly absorb.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Electronics giant Samsung aims to advertise on

   SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. said it plans
to phase out more than 1,100 jobs by 1992 in an effort to
reduce costs by as much as $64 million in its nuclear and
fossil-fuel power divisions.
   The majority of cuts will occur in the nuclear division,
which would bear $55 million of the spending cuts. The
planned reductions include 450 company positions and 650
positions now filled by contractors. The investor-owned
electric and gas utility has more than 11,000 employees,
excluding contract workers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said that while it expects to achieve most of
the job reductions through attrition and streamlining of
current job responsibilities, 17 nuclear management employees
will be displaced this year.
   The company is also seeking cost reductions of $9 million
in fossil-fuel generation and plans to eliminate 17 positions
in that division.
   The cost-reduction measures are part of a continuing
program to improve operating efficiency, Niagara Mohawk said.
Similar efforts are under way in regional operations and
corporate departments, with implementation expected early
next year.
   Niagara Mohawk experienced financial difficulties in
recent years, although reported earnings for fiscal 1990 are
more favorable. In fiscal 1989 ended June 30, the company's
earnings sank 36% to $105.6 million, or 78 cents a share,
from $159.7 million, or $1.21 a share, in 1988. Due to a
recent regulatory agreement that allowed it to recoup costs
on one of its reactors, earnings for 1990 rose back to $129.1
million, or 95 cents a share.
   Niagara Mohawk serves two million electric and gas
customers throughout most of upstate New York.

   The chemicals industry, feeling the first reverberations
of the Persian Gulf oil shock, is trying to pass the bad
vibes along. But so far the soft economy is acting as a
buffer to protect consumers.
   About 6% of all oil consumed in the U.S. is transformed
into such materials as the fibers in clothing and carpet and
the plastics in packaging and housewares. But unlike the
laser-like speed with which higher oil prices show up at the
gasoline pump, the cost pass-throughs in chemicals tend to be
delayed and hidden. The price pressures may worm their way
from oil to, say, naphtha and benzene, then to styrene and
polystyrene, and then into the clamshell that holds a Big
Mac.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Only this month are the initial producers in the
petrochemical chain, the so-called upstream producers,
beginning to pass along their higher raw material costs. But
with oil continuing to trade at around $30 a barrel, even
producers farther "downstream" are leaning on managers to
boost prices at the first hint that oil-related costs are
taking off.
   "When we went through the last oil runups, Du Pont didn't
raise prices aggressively and we lost {profit} margin," Edgar
Woolard Jr., Du Pont Co.'s chairman, remarked last week. "The
strategy this year is we're trying absolutely not to allow
that to happen again."
   Du Pont estimates that a $10-a-barrel rise in oil prices
cuts the annual profit of its chemicals operations by $300
million to $400 million if the company doesn't pass through
any of its higher oil-related costs.
   The chemicals industry offers one view of the varied
workings of higher oil prices on the economy. While releasing
the first hard data since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the
government last week reported that the producer price index
soared 1.3% in August. That index, which was fueled mostly by
energy prices, measures the prices commanded by goods as they
come out of the factory and off the farm.
   If oil prices stay high, the soft economy may act as a
breakwater, damming up some inflationary pressures in the
manufacturing sector. But already there is a pinch in
consumer markets, too. On Tuesday, the government reported
that the consumer price index, propelled by gasoline and fuel
oil prices, rose 0.8% in August.
   The typical U.S. household uses $3,500 of chemicals a
year, whether in such obvious forms as soap or in less
obvious ones like the acetyl chemicals used to make cigarette
filters and drugs. About 225 pounds of plastics end up in the
typical automobile, plus the chemicals in tires, hoses and
finishes.
   A few consumer prices could move quickly. For instance,
55% of the cost of producing ethylene glycol, the chief
component of antifreeze, is tied to oil prices. Glycol prices
have shot up about 40% since the start of the Mideast crisis.
The effect of higher oil prices has been compounded by
anxiety over potential supply disruptions from Saudi Arabia,
a big glycol producer. First Brands Corp., maker of Prestone
antifreeze, estimates that the retail price of antifreeze may
climb by $1 to $2 a gallon by this winter. Antifreeze
currently sells at retail for about $7 a gallon.
   Across the whole chemicals industry, however, a more
manageable fraction of aggregate selling prices is tied to
oil, roughly 8%. And the effects on some consumer items will
be tiny, if they show up at all. The price of a business suit
made of a wool-polyester blend has little to do with the
derivation from oil of xylene, a starting point in the
production of polyester.
   McDonald's Corp. says it isn't yet paying more for
polystyrene cups and plates. General Motors Corp. says it
"isn't entertaining" overtures from chemical-industry
suppliers about the need for higher prices. The Karastan
Bigelow division of Fieldcrest Cannon Inc. says it doesn't
expect to be shelling out more for nylon and acrylic carpet
fibers anytime soon.
   "You can't raise prices for a product that is dying," says
William Bond, an executive at Karastan Bigelow. He explains
that the weak housing market is keeping a lid on carpet
prices and, in turn, fiber prices.
   Gerald Adolph, a chemicals consultant at Booz Allen &amp;
Hamilton Inc., doubts that the industry will shed much of its
new oil-related costs. Rather, he says, the costs will lodge
somewhere along the production chain within the industry.
"Someone in the middle is going to get nailed," he says. "The
question is who."
   Ethylene, a basic chemical building block, illustrates the
point. By some estimates, a $10-a-barrel increase in oil
prices would boost ethylene production costs in the U.S. by
$4 billion a year.
   Producers in the U.S. won't be hurt as much as those in
Europe: The chief feedstock for ethylene production in Europe
is naphtha, an early derivative of oil whose price has
catapulted side-by-side with that of crude. The chief
feedstocks in the U.S. are natural-gas liquids, for which
price increases have been relatively modest.
   Even so, for everyone the primary concern is the suddenly
higher oil-cost burden. Says Gerard Kamm, the ethylene buyer
for Union Carbide Corp., "The name of the game is, who's
going to pay that bill?"
   Through August ethylene makers paid it, largely because
their customers were protected by monthly contracts. This
month, they have begun to pass on some of those costs,
sometimes through direct sales of ethylene, more often
through sales of the derivatives they make from it. Most of
the posted increases are pennies a pound and range from 7% to
12%.
   Ultimately this inflationary pressure could sluice toward
consumers. Polyethylene, an ethylene derivative, is the
highest-volume plastic, used in milk jugs, toys and packaging
films. But as producers at the base of the production chain
try to lay off more of their costs, they could also meet more
resistance. Already one chemical company manager says of his
customers, "In some cases they just gulped and accepted" a
price increase. "But in others they said no. If they don't
like it, a lot of the business stops."
   It stops or it goes elsewhere. Whenever producers raise
prices, they look over their shoulders for the competitor who
might hold back and grab market share. Higher oil prices make
this game more dicey.
   "In all these war rooms, people are trying to anticipate
the response of their competitors and to understand the
psychology of whether they can pass these costs through,"
says James Doubek, a planning manager at Dow Chemical Co.
   Sometimes adding to the uncertainty is more production
capacity that will come on stream just as producers are
trying to make price increases stick. By year's end, Chevron
Corp.'s chemical subsidiary is scheduled to expand its
styrene capacity, and Arco Chemical Co., 83%-owned by
Atlantic Richfield Co., may restart a styrene plant idled by
an explosion in July. Together, the Chevron and Arco Chemical
plants would lift styrene capacity in the U.S. by about 25%
over current levels.
   The chemical units of big oil companies, as well as
independent chemical concerns, feel the pressure to pass
through costs. The subsidiaries generally buy oil-based
feedstocks at market prices even when feedstocks come from
the parent.
   Du Pont, though still chiefly a chemicals company, has a
huge hedge in its Conoco oil unit, which is benefiting from
surging oil prices that should more than offset damage on the
chemical side. Still, Mr. Woolard, the Du Pont chairman, says
chemicals managers are being told to act as if the company
had no hedge when they try to raise a price.
   "If in fact it doesn't stick, it doesn't stick," he says.
But then, "you wait three months and try again."

offering some creditors a possible 49% stake in its
television stations.
   Gillett has been trying to restructure its debt since Aug.
1, when it missed an interest payment due on $251 million of
high-yield junk bonds. Gillett incurred a $34 million
first-quarter loss and hasn't issued public financial
statements since then. The Denver company, which operates TV
stations, ski resorts and meat-packing plants, has $983
million in debt outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A confidential memo to bondholders shows that Gillett is
offering a package of cash and new junk bonds of lower value
in exchange for its existing junk bonds. Gillett's bonds
currently are quoted as low as 14 cents on the dollar.
   But so far, Gillett hasn't won much support for its debt
plan. Gillett told bondholders this week that none of the
holders of its Series A, B and C zero-coupon bond issues
tendered their bonds in the company's exchange offer. Gillett
had been seeking to gain as much as 90% acceptance from those
classes of bondholders.
   Some $213 million of Series A, B and C bonds are
outstanding. Bondholders and advisers to the company say
those bonds are largely held by First Executive Corp. and
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association. Executives at First
Executive and Columbia declined comment.
   Gillett's debt-restructuring plan isn't getting much
support from other bondholders either, according to a memo
from the company's law firm, Winston &amp; Strawn. Some 34% of
holders of the company's 13 7/8% subordinated debentures
tendered their bonds by a deadline of midnight Monday. That
was well below the 64% acceptance sought by the company.
   In an earlier version of its debt restructuring plan,
Gillett didn't offer bondholders any equity in its
businesses. But this time, holders of some bonds are being
offered warrants convertible into 49% ownership of Gillett's
TV stations in Tampa, Fla.; Santa Barbara, Calif., and
Salinas, Calif. The warrants would be exercisable if the
company doesn't redeem various bonds by 1992, bondholders
said.
   Gillett, which is owned by Denver businessman George
Gillett, "may be forced to give up some more equity to get
the deal done," says Jeff Evans, a ratings officer at
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. Bondholders in particular are
focusing on the company's most-prized assets, its Vail,
Colo., ski resorts.
   For the time being, bondholders say, Gillett has extended
its existing bond-exchange offer until later this month. The
company and Mr. Gillett didn't return phone calls seeking
comment.

   African Economic Decadence

   Before accepting a two-year assignment (1986-88) as
administrator of a World Bank economic rehabilitation project
in Equatorial Guinea, Harvard economist Robert Klitgaard was
warned by an American aid official that "on a scale of one to
10, even an African scale, it's zero." Mr. Klitgaard wasn't
able to change that rating, but on his return he did produce
"Tropical Gangsters: One Man's Experience With Development
and Decadence in Deepest Africa" (Basic, 281 pages, $22.95),
which is at once an engaging travelogue into that vaporously
hot Central African backwater, and a valuable source for
explaining why Third World countries ostensibly committed to
the creation of a market economy frequently fail to make any
progress toward that end.
   During its Spanish colonial days, Equatorial Guinea was
more prosperous than any of its neighbors, boasting a
respectable literacy rate of 60%, a reasonably efficient
public health system, and a relatively thriving economy based
on the export of hardwood timber, coffee, fish, assorted
foodstuffs and the world's richest cocoa.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By the 1970s, all this was memory thanks to the homicidal
reign of Francisco Macias Nguema, who reduced the population
by at least a third, ruined the cash economy and destroyed
the infrastructure to the point where there were only two
doctors left in the land, one of them the president's
overworked personal psychiatrist. Macias's last act of state
was to burn the country's entire stock of hard currency, some
$105 million, which he had buried in sacks around his
compound.
   By those standards, the economic program promulgated in
1985 by Macias's thuggish nephew and successor, Obiang Nguema
Mbasogo, seemed promising at first. The government removed
price controls, adopted the convertible CFA franc, sold off
most state enterprises, and rid itself of the Cuban
internationalists who formed the nucleus of Macias's palace
guard. Yet it is evident from Mr. Klitgaard's account that
the country is light-years from recovering the level of
prosperity and civility that obtained during the colonial
era.
   Two coup attempts occurred during Mr. Klitgaard's stay,
the suppression of which involved the torture of innocent
men, including one of Mr. Klitgaard's most talented
assistants in the restructuring project. The infrastructure
is only partially restored, despite the infusion of
substantial amounts of foreign aid, which now comprises
almost half of the GNP. Exports remain at a fraction of
pre-independence levels, and the country now imports even
fish (Macias burned the trawlers to prevent people from
escaping).
   Mr. Klitgaard provides a more than adequate explanation
for the country's failure. This tiny nation has 17 cabinet
ministries, each with a full complement of ill-paid
bureaucrats, most of whom sincerely believe that property is
theft. Requisitioning of services and capital stocks on the
flimsiest of pretexts is common. So is corruption, and, not
surprisingly, doing any kind of business in Equatorial Guinea
remains a losing proposition, even if access to water and
electricity was constant, which it is not, never mind the
foreign assistance programs described by Mr. Klitgaard. This
is partly due to the government's indifference to maintenance
requirements, and partly due to the fact that no means exist
for monitoring consumption. Government officials typically
receive water and electricity without payment, stiffing
private users with outrageous charges for outrageously
unreliable service.
   The same lack of accountability has been even more
disastrous for the two state-owned banks, which exist
primarily to funnel IMF and World Bank funds to the president
and his camarilla in the form of unsecured loans. The World
Bank's cocoa rehabilitation project, for example, merely
prompted Obiang and his gang to grab the largest cocoa
plantations for themselves in order to secure access to loan
money, which was squandered on luxury cars and videocassette
recorders.
   Mr. Klitgaard and his World Bank team, with the aid of the
Equatoguinean finance minister and a few other allies in the
government, did succeed in persuading the president to adopt
an economic restructuring program predicated on a market
economy and establishing a rotating fund to finance
small-scale private enterprises. But while this plan looks
good on paper, Mr. Klitgaard gives us ample reason to doubt
that it will be adhered to in good faith.
   The fundamental reason why the notions of private
property, civil autonomy, limited government and political
pluralism have fared so poorly in post-colonial Africa is
that the continent lacks that very sense of social cohesion
and shared values that the partisans of African socialism
claim as the first attribute of the African character. As one
of his more perceptive Equatoguinean colleagues complains to
Mr. Klitgaard, "In Africa . . . people do not have a common
interest." Instead, "First comes the family, then the clan,
then the region, and finally the country. But the country
always comes last."
   Mr. Klitgaard's account is not without a few bright spots.
Many of the Equatoguineans he met compare favorably with some
of the ignorant and indolent international aid officials with
whom he had to do business. He also discovered a great deal
of human potential and natural beauty as he traveled along
the country's deeply pitted roads with his surfboard in an
ultimately successful search for 10-foot waves.

   Tokyo Stocks Finish Lower in Light Trading;
   U.K. Shares Edge Up on Late Bargain Hunting

   Tokyo stocks finished lower in continuously light trading
Wednesday, with little investor participation because of
uncertainty about the direction of domestic interest rates.
   London shares ended slightly higher, up modestly from
intraday lows as a late round of bargain hunting helped boost
prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo stocks fluctuated mostly in tandem with futures
prices. Last-hour arbitrage selling pressured down both the
Nikkei Index and the broader-based Topix index to the lowest
closing levels this year, traders said.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 158.65 points, or
0.66%, to 23726.17, below the previous lowest close of
23737.63 posted Aug. 23.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index retreated another
231.06 points to close the morning session at 23495.11.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
about 360 million shares, down from 401 million shares
Tuesday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 565 to 358, while
170 others were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 16.61 points, or 0.91%, to 1799.72.
   The second section index dropped 25.25 points, or 0.73%,
to 3449.74. The section's volume was estimated at 7 million
shares, up from 6.5 million shares Tuesday.
   Ahead of the fiscal midyear book closing at the end of
September, participation of both brokerage houses and
institutions remained sluggish, with activities centering
mainly on profit-taking, traders said.
   Because of thin overall volume, stock prices were swayed
by the pressure of arbitrage trading, observers said.
   The Nikkei Index rose 247 points to its intraday high in
early trading and moved narrowly above 24000 points during
the first hour of the morning session.
   The index then fell below Tuesday's close under pressure
of arbitrage selling that continued through the early
afternoon.
   The index once again bounced up above 24000 points in the
last hour before dropping quickly on rounds of arbitrage
selling, which appeared to be linked to Wednesday's
expiration of the Nikkei September futures contract on the
Singapore International Monetary Exchange, traders said.
   Concern about the impact of the volatile bond market as
well as that of rising oil prices on the Japanese economy
also prevented investors from hunting for bargains, traders
said.
   Rumors that the Ministry of Finance spoke to the Big Four
brokerage houses Tuesday afternoon to show its concern about
the stock market's decline weren't effective in rekindling
investors' interest in buying stocks, traders said.
   An official at Wako Securities said, "Investors aren't
interested in such lip service. The authorities won't do
anything after all." He continued: "Investors' distrust on
the stock market is really intense. It'll take a long time
for the market to regain credibility."
   Some pharmaceutical shares ended firmer, with Sankyo up 40
yen to 2100 yen (29 cents to $15.23) and Shionogi gaining 30
yen to 1090 yen.
   While most steel makers ended lower, Kobe Steel gained 19
yen to 535 yen, as the strong earnings outlooks for its
aluminum products attracted investors, traders said.
   As the London market wandered in a narrow range either
side of the day-earlier close, two securities houses,
Kleinwort Benson and Shearson Lehman, said U.K. shares are
now oversold and due for a short-term bounce as market makers
find themselves short of stock.
   However, neither the late bargain hunting nor the
brokerages' assessments are likely to have much of an effect
on the immediate direction of the market, traders said.
   "There is no strong feeling in the market, people are just
trading on a whim and market makers are playing about with
numbers," one trader said.
   In the U.S., a statement from Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan that higher inflation is probable sent Wall
Street lower during the late London session, and damped the
U.K. market, traders said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index closed
up 1.8 points at 2065.8. The day's high of 2075.9 came at the
opening of trade; the day's low was 2061.6.
   The Financial Times 30-Share Index closed down 0.7 point
at 1576.1. Volume was 386.8 million shares, under Tuesday's
379.2 million shares.
   Among company interim results disclosed Wednesday, Tesco,
a U.K. supermarket chain, said half-year pretax profit was
36% higher at #188 million ($359.7 million), ahead of market
forecasts. The shares ended 2 pence lower at 229 pence on the
back of profit-taking, traders said.
   Willis Faber gained 9 pence to 210 pence after U.S.
insurance broker Corroon &amp; Black rejected Aon Corp.'s
takeover bid, saying it will proceed with plans to merge with
Willis Faber.
   British Telecom fell 6 pence to 270 pence after recent
downgradings from two London securities houses.
   After a downgrading from securities house Hoare Govett
Ltd. cutting a forecast for Cable &amp; Wireless' year-end pretax
profit to #630 million from #665 million, the shares of the
telecommunications company closed down 5 pence at 434 pence.
   In the building sector, RMC was unchanged at 479 pence
prior to Thursday's disclosure of interim results. Traders
said the market was not optimistic following poor results
elsewhere in the sector over the past few weeks. Blue Circle,
another building-supplies company, ended a penny higher at
190 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Madrid, and lower in
Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels and Milan, flat to higher
in Stockholm, and unchanged in Amsterdam. South African gold
stocks fell.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Sydney, Singapore, Taipei and
Hong Kong, were mixed in Wellington, and higher in Manila and
Seoul.

   Mystery Book Roundup: Scudder and Gunther Return

   Matthew Scudder, the unlicensed P.I. whose moody exploits
have been chronicled in seven earlier novels by Lawrence
Block, continues to be one of the most interesting private
investigators on the fiction scene.
   An ex-NYPD detective who quit the force after accidentally
causing the death of an innocent bystander, Scudder is a
recovering alcoholic who takes time out from prowling the
mean streets of Manhattan to attend AA meetings. In the
Scudder books, there's always an added element of suspense:
Will Matt start drinking again?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He's certainly given plenty of prompting in Mr. Block's
taut and chilling "A Ticket to the Boneyard" (Morrow, 302
pages, $18.95). It seems an episode from Scudder's checkered
police past is back to hound him in the form of James Leo
Motley, a psychopath Scudder once bent the law to have
imprisoned. Now Motley is out and intent on grisly revenge.
   In messages sent first to Elaine, a call girl who
initially involved Scudder with Motley, and then to Scudder
himself, Motley lets it be known that he plans to kill Matt
"and all of his women" -- from former lovers to chance
acquaintances, apparently in sadistically violent fashion.
   The first victims are someone whose testimony helped
Scudder put Motley away, plus the woman's husband and
children. Next Motley kills a female whom Scudder barely
knows. The body count increases, but Matt is unable to
persuade police of the link between these seemingly random
crimes. Using the techniques of his trade, Scudder attempts
to find and stop Motley on his own, even as he tries to
protect himself and Elaine.
   Mr. Block's previous Scudder novels have worked
imaginative variations on the hard-boiled detective story.
Despite the legwork here, there's not much detection in
"Boneyard." Scudder's deadly cat-and-mouse game with the
depraved, Nietzsche-quoting Motley makes for a pretty
straightforward thriller. But Mr. Block proves as adept at
this sort of tale as he is with private-eye cases. As usual,
he fleshes out the bare bones of his account with several
effective side plots and a great deal of convincingly gritty
detail.
   One nagging question: Wouldn't someone as acutely aware of
his city's and society's ills as Scudder voice even passing
concern about resuming physical relations with a high-risk
professional?
   Another highly distinctive P.I. is Philip Kerr's Bernhard
Gunther, who appears for the second time in "The Pale
Criminal" (Viking, 274 pages, $16.95). Gunther, too, is a
former cop -- an ex-Kriminalinspektor of KRIPO, Berlin's
criminal police -- who plies his trade in the treacherous
milieu of Nazi Germany in 1938.
   By turns vulgar and starkly lyrical, Bernie is a tarnished
knight whose sexual fantasies run neck and neck with what's
left of his morality. Like many of his cronies, he's repelled
by Hitler and company but feels powerless to do much except
wisecrack in the Berliner fashion, which "sounds cruel if you
don't understand it, and even crueller if you do."
   Gunther quit KRIPO out of disgust at Goering's police
purges, but now the force wants him back temporarily to take
charge of the hunt for a brutal killer who's preying upon
teenaged Aryan females. The job offer is nonrefusable, and
Kommissar Gunther finds himself returned to the ranks of
those he detests, threading a tricky course between rival
political factions as he uncovers the loathsome conspiracy
behind the schoolgirls' murders.
   From S.S.-occupied palaces to pornographers' dens, from
burghers' mansions to lurid bordellos, Gunther travels some
truly awful boulevards, surveying scenes of decadence and
ugliness that might have been sketched by George Grosz. Mr.
Kerr renders this dire place and time in an effective and
aptly stilted prose that often reads as if translated from
the German. There are surprising Teutonic twists to the
grammar, and the characters utter quirky slang and turns of
phrase so authentic-sounding they could either be completely
accurate or totally invented. (A pistol is a "lighter." A
madman is a "spinner." "Are you stretching me out?" means
"Are you putting me on?")
   Part private-eye tale and part police procedural,
"Criminal" pulls the strands of its politically informed
story together in a finale that satisfies both
detective-story convention and historical truth. The larger
achievement of this book and of the earlier Gunther novel
("Pale Violets") is in the convincing presentation of a
society that seems to be arranging "the very end of
everything." While Bernhard Gunther labors to protect this
grotesque status quo, crimes beyond the ken of any working
detective are waiting in the wings.

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The 1990 oil shock is pushing the U.S.
economy closer to recession while limiting the Federal
Reserve's ability to resist a recession by cutting interest
rates, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said.
   Mr. Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress that "inflationary pressures have increased
concurrently with the weakening of the economy," frustrating
the Fed's goal of averting a recession while gradually
bringing down the inflation rate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The always cautious Fed chairman went to unusual lengths
to avoid foreshadowing Fed policy moves in his testimony. He
gave no hint that a long-anticipated Fed move to lower
interest rates is in fact imminent, though he didn't rule it
out.
   At one point, he exasperated some committee members by
stating: "Whether an efficacious policy response to current
developments would seek higher, lower or unchanged interest
rates will depend on the specifics of the situation, which
are shifting day by day."
   For that statement, Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D., Md.) offered
"the obfuscation award of the month."
   The weakness of the U.S. economy -- which was growing more
slowly than the Fed anticipated even before the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait touched off a surge in oil prices --
argues for lower interest rates. But Mr. Greenspan said that
"as of last week" the U.S. economy was "sluggish" but wasn't
showing signs of "a cumulative unwinding of economic
activity."
   He conceded that economists who forecast a recession
aren't being unreasonable. But he warned that nothing the Fed
can do will "prevent the transfer of wealth, and {the} cut in
our standard of living, that stems from higher prices for
imported oil."
   If oil prices average $30 a barrel over the next year, he
said, economic models suggest that the economy's growth rate
will be cut by about one percentage point and that consumer
prices will be 1.5 to two percentage points higher than they
otherwise would have been.
   Mr. Greenspan explicitly identified two events that might
lead the Fed to ease credit: an intensification of the credit
crunch that he cited when the Fed last made a move to reduce
interest rates in July and a "credible, long-term,
enforceable" agreement to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   One constraint on the Fed's ability to rescue the economy
is the recent rise in long-term interest rates in the bond
market -- a reflection of fears of inflation, among other
things, Mr. Greenspan said. He said that any Fed move to push
down the short-term interest rates that it controls directly
would be "counterproductive" unless the markets responded by
bidding down long-term rates.
   Long-term rates are important because they influence
business investment decisions as well as consumers' ability
to buy homes, he said.

   Twice-Failed Thrifts Add to Taxpayers'
   Tab, as a Result of Regulators' Blunders

   Congressional critics are howling because of the
generosity of regulators in some of the 1988 thrift bailouts.
But it has now become obvious that in many deals regulators
weren't generous enough -- and taxpayers will fork over
billions of additional dollars because of it.
   Federal regulators closed, merged or otherwise "resolved"
223 dead thrifts in 1988, many in last-gasp deals thrown
together in the final days of the year. However, largely
because of regulators' own miscalculations and blunders, they
didn't give sufficient money in many cases. So far, three of
the 1988 deals have collapsed because of the failure of the
acquiring thrifts -- Southwest Savings &amp; Loan of Dallas,
Merabank Federal Savings Bank, Phoenix, and Statesman Bank
for Savings, Des Moines, Iowa. Several others are tottering.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These twice-failed thrifts make for one of the more
egregious aspects of the thrift debacle. While it appears
that wily financiers may have fleeced the government in a
handful of deals, much more costly to taxpayers is the fact
that many of the regulators' "resolutions" actually resolved
nothing and will have to be bailed out anew, adding needless
billions to the ultimate taxpayer tab.
   Consider Pelican Homestead &amp; Savings Association, of
Metairie, La. When it acquired four dead thrifts in late
1987, it was touted by Danny Wall, then chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, as the model for the 1988 deals
that would follow, in which "strong" institutions would take
over basket cases. The Bank Board projected that Pelican
would become profitable in a few years.
   Pelican was indeed a model -- for disaster. It was
insolvent by at least $86 million before the deal, had losses
of $39.4 million in 1988 and $64.3 million in 1989, and
continues to hemorrhage.
   Robert Shofstahl, Pelican's president, says it didn't get
some of the federal guarantees later acquirers received, such
as an assured profit margin on bad assets of acquired
thrifts. Mr. Shofstahl says the institutions that Pelican
acquired were in far worse shape than he or regulators
expected. Pelican is seeking a new rescue package under a
program offering aid to well-run institutions in economically
depressed regions. A new Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
audit now pegs Pelican's cost to taxpayers at a minimum of
$589 million over the next decade.
   The Bank Board ignored warnings from its own regulators
that some of the deals were fatally flawed. For example,
according to past and present regulators, James Cirona,
president of the Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco, and
his staff repeatedly urged Mr. Wall not to proceed with a
plan to permit gravely ill Merabank Federal Savings Bank to
acquire several insolvent Texas thrifts. Mr. Wall may have
been influenced by an agreement with Merabank's parent,
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., under which the parent was
supposed to "make good" Merabank's losses.
   The deal was completed, and Merabank soon collapsed from
massive losses in Arizona real estate. Pinnacle West, in
effect, reneged on the make-good agreement but later agreed
to a settlement that only pared the government's huge loss,
now estimated at $1.5 billion by the FDIC.
   Similarly, the Bank Board folded four broke thrifts into
Southwest Savings &amp; Loan, which was owned by a trust for
Caroline Rose Hunt, of Dallas's once-rich Hunt family. The
board provided $2 billion of notes and other assistance but
required no new real capital, even though Southwest Savings
itself was going broke. Instead, in a move that baffled even
some regulators at the time, the board allowed Ms. Hunt to
convert $25 million of Southwest Savings' debt into stock and
count that as equity. But the debt was worthless to begin
with because of Southwest Savings' own losses.
   Mr. Wall now says he wanted the thrift to convert the debt
to equity because the debt was requiring payments that he
says were depleting Southwest Savings' capital. Though
Texas's real estate problems were obvious by then to many in
the land and lending businesses, Mr. Wall maintains that
regulators didn't know how imperiled Southwest Savings really
was at the time. "In hindsight, we shouldn't have done that
conversion," he concedes.
   Despite $541.6 million of government assistance through
1989, Southwest Savings' net losses have roared on, to the
tune of $238.5 million in 1988 and 1989. It has died twice:
Regulators closed it in June and are looking for a buyer.
Future projected costs of Southwest Savings: $5.6 billion.
   Perhaps the most mysterious of the 1988 deals is Sunbelt
Savings Association of Dallas, which had failed spectacularly
amid allegations of fraud that led to the recent indictment,
in Dallas federal court, of its former chairman, Ed McBirney.
His trial is pending. In late 1988, regulators took the
remains of Sunbelt, lumped them with the detritus of four
other blownout Texas thrifts and pronounced the resulting
entity, rechristened Sunbelt Savings FSB, "stabilized." In
reality, that meant unsaleable, so regulators installed a new
management team to cleanse Sunbelt of the high-cost deposits
that were scaring off prospective suitors. Regulators refused
to disclose how much this process would cost, although the
amount was rumored to be $700 million.
   To date, Sunbelt remains a spinster. And the FDIC audit
shows that its losses are vastly larger than originally
anticipated. The government spent $891.7 million on Sunbelt
through 1989 and estimates that it will spend $9.4 billion
more through 1998. Since that estimate, moreover, two other
collapsed Texas thrifts have been lobbed onto the Sunbelt
pile. Their losses suggest Sunbelt ultimately will cost some
$12 billion, a tad less than Peru's foreign debt.

   U.S. Judge's Ruling Deals Setback
   To Small Investors in Arbitration

   NEW YORK -- Small investors seeking punitive damages in
arbitration disputes with their brokers were dealt a setback
in a precedent-upsetting ruling by a federal judge.
   In a case that was closely watched on Wall Street, a
federal judge ruled that arbitrators don't always have the
power to award punitive damages in disputes with brokerage
firms.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decision, by the influential southern district court
here, goes against several precedents and could significantly
affect arbitration cases nationwide. Punitive damages in
arbitration cases, although not commonplace, have more than
doubled in the past year.
   Arbitration specialists blasted the ruling. "This decision
is a license to steal," asserted David Robbins, a former
arbitration director at the American Stock Exchange who
currently works for the New York law firm of Kaufmann Gilden
&amp; Carlin and is an active arbitrator. "If a customer is
forced to go {to} arbitration, then arbitrators must have the
opportunity to consider punitive damages," he contended.
   Investors typically sign an agreement when they open a
brokerage account that binds them to arbitration in case of a
dispute, rather than filing a lawsuit. Arbitration
specialists say investors are entitled to the same remedies
in arbitration that are available in litigation.
   Punitive damages, which are generally awarded to punish
and deter a defendant found to have acted recklessly or
maliciously, are applied in addition to actual, or
compensatory, damages, which cover the loss.
   A series of federal-court rulings in recent years have
found that arbitrators have the right to award punitive
damages under the Federal Arbitration Act.
   But federal Judge Peter K. Leisure in his decision said
state law controls whether such damages are allowed. And New
York is one of the few states with a law barring punitive
awards in arbitration.
   Judge Leisure's order stemmed from a case involving
Fahnestock &amp; Co., a New York securities firm. Following a
complicated series of cross-claims, a New York Stock Exchange
panel in January awarded a former Fahnestock employee, Joseph
J. Waltman, $270,000 in damages and fees from the firm,
including $100,000 in punitive damages.
   Fahnestock, a unit of Fahnestock-Viner Holdings Inc.,
moved to vacate the punitive damage award in a New York
federal court. It alleged that the arbitrators "exceeded
their powers" by granting punitive damages, citing a 1976 New
York state-court ruling.
   Judge Leisure agreed, and threw out the punitive award. In
a 16-page opinion, the judge said that "the state substantive
law . . . regarding the inability of arbitrators to award
punitive damages is not in direct conflict with any express
provision of the Federal Arbitration Act."
   Robert Scandone, Mr. Waltman's attorney in Philadelphia,
was stunned by the ruling. He called it "totally distinctive
from everything else we have ever seen." His client is
considering an appeal, Mr. Scandone said.
   The ruling will immediately have an impact on arbitrators
and several appeals pending involving the applicability of
punitive damages, specialists say. Even in arbitration cases
filed outside New York, brokerage firms are likely to argue
that New York state law should govern if the disputed
transactions took place there, lawyers said.
   "Arbitrators are going to be very much uncertain that they
have the power to award punitive damages -- and that
uncertainty is likely to lead them to forgo awarding them,"
says Richard Ryder, a former arbitration director at the
National Association of Securities Dealers and current editor
of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J.,
newsletter.
   Look for brokerage firms to be less enthusiastic about
settling punitive claims, too. Heretofore, firms typically
have settled such cases because federal arbitration law
provides only a narrow window for reversing decisions.
   Says Mr. Ryder of the decision: "It puts a tilt on the
balance in settlement negotiations."

   TRACKING JAPAN'S LAND PRICES

   Japan's astronomical land prices continued to rise in the
12 months to July 1, but growth rates in some of the hottest
markets slowed sharply after April.
   According to a survey by the National Land Agency,
residential land prices increased 13.2% on average -- the
fastest rate since the early 1970s. Commercial land prices
rose 13.4%.
   The figures released yesterday, which represent appraised
values of some 25,328 parcels of land throughout Japan as of
July 1, don't show any actual declines. But they do indicate
a sudden cooling since April in such torrid markets as Osaka
and Kyoto. For example, in metropolitan Osaka, residential
land prices jumped by 48.2% in the 12-month period to July 1.
But after April 1, prices rose just 2.8% for the three-month
period.
   By some calculations, the value of all land in Japan at
current market prices is around four times the total value of
U.S. real estate.
                                                                                                       

   ARRESTING EAST GERMANY'S SPIES
                                                                                                       

   Having dropped a plan to issue a general amnesty, West
German officials expect to start arresting East German spies
after the country unifies with East Germany in less than two
weeks. Some experts estimate the sweep could involve as many
as 8,000 people. The plan isn't universally applauded in West
Germany, where some politicians had wanted to avoid linking
the otherwise upbeat prospect of unification with a focus on
problems leftover from the nation's past.

   INDONESIA'S NUCLEAR PLANS
                                                                                                       

   British Secretary of State for Energy John Wakeham said
his country wants to participate in an Indonesian
nuclear-energy project. Mr. Wakeham, speaking in Jakarta,
said he met with Mines and Energy Minister Ginanjar
Kartasasmita and President Suharto and discussed the
possibility of expanding energy cooperation between the two
countries. Mr. Ginanjar said Indonesia has established
cooperative links with West Germany, France and the U.S. to
develop nuclear-power plants. Indonesia's first nuclear-power
plant, to be built in Central Java, is expected to be
operational in the year 2000.
                                                                                                       

   ALL NIPPON'S EXPANSION
                                                                                                       

   Japan's All Nippon Airways announced a five-year plan
calling for expansion of overseas networks. By the end of the
plan, the airline hopes international services will account
for 36% of its overall business, up from about 19% now. It
plans to add routes to Berlin and Barcelona from Tokyo and to
London and Paris from Osaka.
                                                                                                       

   LONDON NEWSPAPER SQUABBLE
                                                                                                       

   London's Financial Times, printed on pink paper, was
rebuffed when it sought a preliminary injunction against the
Evening Standard for using pink paper for a new eight-page
business section. The FT argued that the Standard was trying
"to pass off" the section as being published "by or with the
collaboration" of the FT. The Standard argued that a color
can't be copyrighted. The court ruled that it is unlikely the
two papers could be confused.
                                                                                                       

   A RECORD BEER SEASON
                                                                                                       

   Japan consumed a record 572 million gallons of beer
between June and August, up from 494 million gallons in the
same period last year, the National Tax Administration Agency
said. On average, Japan's 90 million legal drinkers each
purchased six gallons of beer and each paid $36 in taxes to
the government. The agency said Japan's hot summer helped
boost consumption along with active marketing by
manufacturers pushing new brands.
                                                                                                       

   NEW DELHI PROSTITUTES' DEMAND
                                                                                                       

   Prostitutes in New Delhi have petitioned the government to
set aside jobs and educational places for their children.
   Lalchand Vidyarthi, a male social worker who helped found
a prostitutes' group in the Indian capital in 1982, said the
group had submitted the demand to Prime Minister Viswanath
Pratap Singh. "A delegation of our group met Singh and he was
sympathetic to us," Mr. Vidyarthi said, noting that "The
prostitute is the most exploited class of Indian society and
her children are most vulnerable."
   Mr. Vidyarthi said that in its years of existence, the
prostitutes' group "has not got very far, because of the
hypocrisy in our society." He explained: "Many people of
influence come to prostitutes regularly but few admit they
and their children need protection."
   In India, it is difficult to enroll children in school
unless it can be proved they were born within marriage. A
prostitute usually has to declare a pimp to be her husband to
get her children admitted, Mr. Vidyarthi said.

   East Germany shut down its parliament building in East
Berlin yesterday after finding dangerous levels of asbestos,
forcing lawmakers to look for a new place to meet. The Palace
of the Republic, built by the Communists, has been mentioned
as the possible new house of a united parliament if the seat
of the new German government is moved to Berlin. . . .
Pilgrims to Lourdes were rationed to one glass of holy water
each Wednesday because of France's drought. "The source has
not dried out, but it no longer meets demand," said officials
at the Roman Catholic shrine, whose waters are reputed to
heal the sick.

   To characterize President Carter's actions in 1979 with
respect to the price and supply of oil as "dithering" (as
Peter Truell does in the Aug. 20 Outlook column) is to ignore
the facts.
   The revolution in Iran began pushing up world oil prices
early in that year. U.S. oil prices were still controlled,
however, under the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act.
As of June 1, 1979, the law gave the president discretionary
power to revise or eliminate oil-price controls. In fact,
President Carter did initiate gradual removal of controls
from specific categories of oil, with domestic crude prices
scheduled to reach the world price by September 1981, when
controls would expire. By the end of 1979, Congress had
passed a windfall-profits tax to collect about half of the
oil companies' gains from price decontrol.

   Reliance on the market to moderate the effects of price
and quantity changes may not be immediately satisfying as a
military response. Before singing paeans to President Bush's
"decisive action," however, it is prudent to await the fat
lady's aria.

   Rig Site Reflects Pressures
   On Mexican Oil Industry

   BAY OF CAMPECHE, Mexico -- A belching oil rig 50 miles out
to sea may hold the key for the future of Mexico's state oil
monopoly.
   Mexico is pouring $800 million into a complex engineering
project to reduce "backpressure" that is slowing the flow of
oil out of its most productive offshore wells. In the short
term, the success or failure of the Cantarell Project, named
for the bay's largest field, could determine whether Mexico
can remain a major exporter to countries such as the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the rig, hard-hatted rig boss Ricardo Murillo says, "We
know every inch of that platform," as he points to a
roughneck tussling with a manhole-sized pipe fitting. "We
aren't talking about making something new, but making what we
have better."
   Adds Hector Leyva Torres, a Petroleos Mexicanos general
superintendent here in the southern Gulf of Mexico: "It isn't
only the most important project in the company, but the most
important project in Mexico."
   If Cantarell doesn't work, analysts say the oil monopoly,
usually known as Pemex, may face pressure to ease the
country's nationalistic restrictions on foreign investment in
the oil industry.
   Caught in a squeeze between slowing capital investment and
galloping domestic demand, Pemex has been hard-pressed to
maintain its daily 1.2-million-barrel export level -- let
alone help to make up the 4.5 million barrels a day taken off
the international market when Iraq seized Kuwait. Mexico has
pledged to temporarily increase exports by 100,000 barrels a
day, but part of the extra exports will come from existing
inventories.
   How much Pemex can afford to export over the next few
years could well depend on Cantarell. Work began in April on
the project, which Pemex managers view as a showcase for
their efforts to make the infamously inefficient company more
businesslike.
   Pemex managers point to unprecedented public disclosure in
Cantarell subcontracting, thanks to the ouster last year of
the notorious oil workers' union boss, La Quina. Cantarell is
also the first big capital project to be funded from three
recent Pemex issues on foreign bond markets, its first since
the debt crisis began in 1982.
   But for all of the advancement in tactics, some analysts
think Cantarell is a step backward. "Cantarell really speaks
to the collapse of exploration and production of new
resources. It looks to the past more than to the future,"
says George Baker, a Berkeley, Calif., oil consultant. "It is
also fundamentally defensive-trying to maintain the current
export platform, rather than increase it."
   Mr. Baker sees irony in Mexico making a major push to
scrape oil out of the bottom of the well when the country is
widely believed to possess vast untouched oil reserves.
"Mexico's potential probably exceeds that of Saudi Arabia,"
says Bernardo Grossling, a petroleum geologist at the U.S.
Geological Survey.
   But Pemex managers must deal in realities. Mexico's
fast-growing population is pushing demand for oil products;
gasoline consumption grows by 12% a year. Yet, because of
economic woes, investment in Pemex has declined by 75% since
1982, though it is up this year. And oil's nationalistic
symbolism makes it politically risky for the government to
allow foreign oil companies into Mexico.
   Given those constraints, Pemex officials say squeezing
more production out of existing offshore wells is cheaper and
less risky than trying to start new production."Building just
one new production complex would cost $700 million, not to
mention millions of dollars for wells, which may or may not
come in," says Mr. Leyva.
   Pemex concluded that the least expensive remedy was to
squeeze more production out of Cantarell. Without it, an
internal Pemex study estimated, the company's total average
daily production of 2.5 million barrels would fall nearly
400,000 barrels by 1994.
   Not everyone is confident Pemex will succeed. Pemex failed
to get financing for Cantarell from the Japanese
Export-Import Bank. "There are legitimate questions about
Pemex's ability to carry out an engineering project of
Cantarell's complexity," says Japan's ambassador to Mexico,
Ryukichi Imai.
   That kind of talk sits poorly with Pemex officials, who
claim they have turned the company around since La Quina was
ousted from his union post and thrown in jail last year. Last
July, the union signed a contract eliminating many costly
perquisites, such as the union's right to assign 40% of
Pemex's outside contracts. Francisco Rojas, director general
of Pemex, says the savings will total about $1 billion over
the first 17 months.
   Out on the rigs, Pemex managers say the new relationship
with the union sometimes makes it seem like they're working
at an entirely different company. Formerly, subcontractors
tied to the union catered food, painted the rigs and leased
the boats to ferry in roughnecks, among other jobs. "It was
always very expensive and often poor-quality work," says Mr.
Leyva. "Now we open the contracts to bidding, and the savings
are substantial, both in money and efficiency."
   Pemex insists it won't modify longstanding strictures on
foreign equity participation. "Oil is and will continue to be
a resource of the state," Mr. Rojas has said repeatedly.
   How staunchly the government sticks to that pledge may
depend on the Cantarell Project. Analysts see Cantarell as a
stopgap that may allow Pemex to maintain its export levels
through the next few years until, it is hoped, the country's
economic reforms bring the prosperity that will allow
increased investment in Pemex.
   But if the petroleum engineers on the rigs can't maintain
Pemex's place in the export market, Pemex's financial
engineers will get the task of figuring out how to attract
private investment from overseas to the oil giant -- without
stirring the wrath of Mexican nationalists.

   House Approves Nearly $283 Billion
   For Defense Authorization Measure

   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a nearly $283 billion
defense authorization bill after adopting a $978 million
amendment to expand the military's sealift capacity and boost
spending for equipment and training to protect U.S. troops
from chemical weapons.
   Spurred by the current Iraqi crisis, the action came as a
House Appropriations subcommittee separately approved an
estimated $2 billion supplemental defense bill to cover
more-immediate costs incurred by the deployment of U.S.
forces to the Middle East.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Appropriations leadership hopes to rush the
supplemental measure through Congress before the fiscal year
ends Sept. 30, but the administration faces serious obstacles
in its related bid to help Egypt by forgiving $6.7 billion in
back debts on military sales. At a hearing yesterday, senior
lawmakers argued that the White House had understated the
true cost of the transaction, and despite personal lobbying
by President Bush, there appears to be little appetite in the
committee leadership to move quickly on the Egypt issue.
   Instead, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie
Whitten (D., Miss.) is proposing to incorporate the military
supplemental bill with a short-term spending resolution to
keep the government funded through the first weeks of the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The measure would buy time to
complete action on annual appropriations bills backed up in
Congress, and Mr. Whitten appears to support a provision that
would delay the effective date of the Gramm-Rudman law's
across-the-board cuts as budget negotiations continue.
   Delay could make the administration's task that much more
difficult, but lawmakers are reluctant to commit themselves
until they have a better understanding of the costs and what
concessions will be given to other nations, such as Israel
and Poland, on finances or aid. The postponement is
embarrassing at a time when the White House is most eager to
forge a strong alliance with Egypt, yet the administration
may have hurt itself by appearing to engage in budgetary
legerdemain to play down the costs of the U.S. commitment in
the Persian Gulf.
   For example, William Diefenderfer, deputy director of the
White House Office of Management and Budget, testified in
Congress yesterday that canceling Egypt's debt posed no cost
to the Treasury as the U.S. had given up any hope of being
repaid. But in answer to a separate question, Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said the
administration had considered having Kuwait or Saudi Arabia
pay the debt for Cairo, but this would have reduced what
these Gulf kingdoms could do to aid front-line nations in the
region and help pay for the burgeoning U.S. military
commitment.
   "It would be inappropriate to put this in the supplemental
{bill} at this point," said Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.),
chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee. "There are
too many questions to be answered."
   Approved on a 256-155 roll call, the massive defense
authorization bill would cut the Pentagon's fiscal 1991
budget 8% and reflects a wholesale shift of funds from
strategic weapons to more conventional systems. As seen in
yesterday's amendment, the current crisis has contributed to
this emphasis, but the bill also reflects a calculated
strategy to protect lawmakers' parochial interests at a time
of retrenchment for the defense industry.
   The bulk of the new sealift-money yesterday, for example,
comes at the expense of cuts from the Strategic Defense
Initiative. And while the measure terminates production of
additional B-2 Stealth bombers, it authorizes $165 million
for start-up procurement of the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft
backed by the Texas and Pennsylvania delegations over the
objections of the Pentagon.
   Similarly, the bill adds $437 million to the Navy's budget
for the F/A-18 Hornet jet built by Missouri and Massachusetts
manufacturers, and in an effort to embarrass Democrats,
Republicans offered an unsuccessful motion to reapply these
funds to reduce the need for troop cuts elsewhere in the
measure.
   The bill also contains the first provision to clear the
House or Senate for helping workers who lose their jobs in
defense cutbacks. The House voted 288-128 for an amendment by
Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D., Mass.) authorizing $200 million
to extend unemployment compensation for affected workers,
provide retraining and education funds and beef up job
placement. The amendment would also offer funds to help
communities plan for converting defense projects to civilian
work.
   Under the threat of a White House veto, the bill goes to a
conference with an estimated $289 billion Senate measure, and
all sides expect major adjustments in both the weapon and
personnel accounts. In light of the current crisis, some
influential lawmakers expect Congress this year to approve
troop cuts of closer to 80,000, or well below what the two
chambers have approved.
   The $2 billion defense supplemental bill approved
yesterday fully meets the administration's requests for
Operation Desert Shield, but the panel refused to give the
Pentagon the free hand it wanted in accepting and spending
billions in contributions pledged by foreign nations to help
pay for the U.S. forces. Instead, all expenditures would be
subject to the appropriations process, requiring approval
from the committee leadership or full Congress.
   The House action came as the Senate Appropriations
Committee approved a nearly $51.2 billion fiscal 1991 farm
and rural development bill, which rejects prior
House-approved cuts calling for the termination of the
federal crop-insurance program.

   Three cheers for the court system.
   Cheer Number One: To the Appellate Division of the New
York State Supreme Court, which last week overruled a lower
court's ban on the publication of a book by a former member
of the Israeli intelligence service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Israel had claimed that the safety of its intelligence
agents would be endangered by the publication of "By Way of
Deception: A Devastating Insider's Portrait of the Mossad."
Michael Dontzin, a New York judge, agreed, and he temporarily
blocked publication of the book in the United States.
   That was just an awful ruling.
   The glory of democracy is that anyone can say anything.
Sometimes, those things that are said are lies. Sometimes
they're evil. Sometimes they hurt people. Sometimes they're
obscene. Sometimes they're inane.
   But never, never in this land can anyone stop us in
advance from saying what we want.
   That was established in 1931 when the court ruled that Jay
Near, a bigot and extortionist who ran a sleazy newspaper in
Minnesota, couldn't be barred from writing what he thought.
That doctrine prohibiting so-called prior restraints of the
press was reaffirmed decades later in the Pentagon Papers
cases.
   And last week it was reaffirmed again. I have no idea
whether Victor Ostrovsky, the former Israeli spy, is a good
guy or a bad guy. But that makes no difference. For, as
Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in 1950, "It is a fair
summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have
frequently been forged in controversies involving not very
nice people."
   Cheer Number Two: To the Judicial Conference, which is the
policy-making body of the federal court system.
   Last week, the Judicial Conference voted to allow cameras
into federal courtrooms. It's just a three-year experiment.
It's just in six district courts and two appellate courts.
And it's just for civil trials. But, still, it's good news.
   The hallmark of democracy is openness. But for 50 years,
the federal court system has barred cameras and broadcasting
equipment from its courtrooms. In the past 10 years, more
than 40 states have opened their own courts to cameras, and
that has been informative and instructive. Sure, TV stations
go in and pick out the dramatic confrontation, the telling
sound bite. But they also show longer segments, they
familiarize Americans with the system, and they show
democracy at work.
   Our judicial system is, after all, the real people's
court. But few people have the time or inclination actually
to visit a court just to watch a trial. Now we can do that on
TV, we can see how our people's court outshines "The People's
Court."
   Cheer Number Three: To Glenn E. Pille, a state district
judge in Des Moines. He ruled that my friend Gil Cranberg is
a journalist and that the county attorney should quit messing
around with him.
   Gil Cranberg is the retired editor of the editorial pages
of the Des Moines Register, and he kept his sense of outrage
-- a must for any good editorial writer -- after he retired.
One thing he was outraged about was a race track built near
Des Moines with money that was backed by the county without
any votes of the people, so he continued to write about it
for the Register. The county people and the race-track people
think Mr. Cranberg is a nag and they're especially defensive
about the deal because the race track has been finishing out
of the money ever since it opened. Mr. Cranberg points this
out with a certain regularity, maybe even a little glee.
   On Aug. 14, the county subpoenaed Mr. Cranberg and told
him to bring all documents he had regarding absolutely any
matter relative to the Prairie Meadows track. The subpoena
was tangential to a class-action lawsuit about the track, a
lawsuit that Mr. Cranberg is not involved in except as a
resident of the county.
   The subpoena was clearly just harassment, and it worked:
it messed up Mr. Cranberg's life and work, causing him to
devote precious time to fighting the subpoena and pre-empting
him from gathering any more information on the track because
of the fear he would have to disclose sources and hand over
documents and notes.
   But last Thursday, Judge Pille saw through the whole
thing.
   He quashed the subpoena and re-iterated the role of a free
press. It was quick justice.
   The country is a little better off today because of the
appellate decision in New York, the vote of the Judicial
Conference, and the ruling by Judge Pille.
   The press can be jerks, but that's not the point. The
point was made 20 years ago by federal Judge Murray Gurfein
when the government tried to stop newspapers from printing
the Pentagon Papers.
   "The security of the Nation is not at the ramparts alone,"
he wrote. "Security also lies in the value of our free
institutions. A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a
ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority in
order to preserve the even greater values of freedom of
expression and the right of the people to know. . . . These
are troubled times. There is no greater safety valve for
discontent and cynicism about the affairs of Government than
freedom of expression in any form."

   At Best, They've Proved There's
   More Than One Kind of Yo-Yo

   With crime bordering on an obsession in New York City, the
district attorney's office is having its ups and downs.
   Take the case of William Thigpen, a 37-year-old homeless
man who was arrested last December. The charge? Selling
yo-yos on a midtown Manhattan sidewalk without a license.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Manhattan district attorney's office geared up to
prosecute the case, but its efforts were thwarted initially
by criminal-court Judge John E.H. Stackhouse. Noting that the
arrest occurred close to Christmas and Hanukkah, Judge
Stackhouse charitably dismissed the case.
   But that wasn't the end of it for the prosecutor's office,
which promptly appealed, arguing that "the spirit of the
holidays" was hardly a sufficient ground to let Mr. Thigpen
off the hook. The court's appellate division agreed and
ordered Judge Stackhouse to rehear the case.
   Earlier this week, the judge ruled once more in the
long-running saga. Again he dismissed the case, and this time
he was really wound up. In his opinion, Judge Stackhouse said
the police could perhaps find "a more socially useful
purpose" than busting yo-yo dealers.
   The judge said he doubted whether a conviction would deter
other unlicensed yo-yo vendors if they somehow learned about
the case. And he said it was unlikely that dismissing the
case of one unlicensed yo-yo vendor would affect the welfare
of the general public.
   In fact, the judge suggested, with violent crime rampant,
"the public's confidence is more likely to be diminished by
the amount of time and expense already expended on Mr.
Thigpen's prosecution."
   A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office says the
office still disagrees with Judge Stackhouse's decision --
although it plans no further appeal. "This is a
quality-of-life crime," she says.
   Granted, New York's quality of life has taken some knocks
in recent weeks. Time magazine trumpeted the decline of New
York on a recent cover. And the magazine commissioned a poll
that showed the majority of New Yorkers would prefer to live
somewhere else.
   So where does New York Mayor David Dinkins stand on the
issue of yo-yo offenders? He's backing the prosecutors.
   A spokesman for the mayor says the case goes beyond
yo-yos. After all, he says, if people are left free to sell
whatever they want on street corners, why would retailers
want to rent space in the city?

   Iraqi Documents Show U.S. Lawmakers,
   In Baghdad Visit, Didn't Signal Conerns

   WASHINGTON -- Less than a month after Saddam Hussein had a
British-based journalist hanged as a spy, Sen. Alan Simpson
was assuring the Iraqi dictator that his problems weren't
with the U.S. government but with "the Western media."
   In the meeting in Baghdad last April, the Wyoming
Republican and other U.S. lawmakers didn't raise the subject
of the journalist's hanging. Sen. Simpson said in an
interview yesterday that he recalls some references by Saddam
Hussein to an Iranian spy being hanged.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Mr. Simpson in April suggested that the Iraqi leader
should get to know the press better to clear up his image
problems, and the senator also offered his own view of
reporters: "It is a haughty and pampered press," he said.
"They all consider themselves political geniuses. . . . They
are very cynical."
   Sen. Simpson's comments are similar to others made shortly
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait that, at least in
retrospect, appear to have given Saddam Hussein the
impression that his aggressive behavior wasn't creating
serious problems with the U.S. For instance, only weeks
before the Aug. 2 invasion, Ambassador April Glaspie,
reflecting U.S. policy, told Saddam Hussein that the U.S.
strongly opposed an expansion of sanctions against Iraq and
also wouldn't get involved in Arab disputes. The same points
were made in congressional testimony by John Kelly, assistant
secretary of state for Mideast affairs.
   A transcript of Sen. Simpson's meeting with Saddam Hussein
was provided by the Iraqi embassy here. It also appeared
earlier in Spy magazine, a New York-based satirical
publication. In the interview yesterday, Sen. Simpson
confirmed its accuracy. He said Saddam Hussein was
complaining about news reports that he had biological
weapons, which the Iraqi leader denied, and Mr. Simpson
suggested that Iraq invite Western reporters in to see for
themselves.
   Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who also
was on the trip, suggested letting Western reporters visit
sites alleged to house biological-weapons facilities. "At
that point," Sen. Dole said, "they cannot do anything but
tell the truth."
   Sen. Simpson said yesterday that he didn't believe the
comments by lawmakers were misconstrued by the Iraqi leader.
"There wasn't anything to be misconstrued. He was tough,
smooth, rugged, unblinking. He lied to us. What's new?"
   But apparently Saddam Hussein impressed at least one
member of the U.S. delegation. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.,
Ohio) told the Iraqi leader toward the end of the session, "I
am now aware that you are a strong and intelligent man, and
that you want peace." Sen. Metzenbaum also provides one of
the lighter moments in the transcript. Offering his own media
advice, Sen. Metzenbaum suggested that Saddam Hussein would
improve his image by focusing more on peace. But Sen.
Metzenbaum, saying that he is Jewish, adds later, "I am not
the right person to be your public-relations man."
   Sen. Simpson said yesterday that the mission to Baghdad to
discuss peace with Saddam Hussein had been a major success.
"If we had not been over there working for peace, we might
not enjoy the world support the way we do now," he said. "We
might not have the Arabs on our side. Maybe our visit did
that."

   Just three months after Maybelline Inc. was acquired by
Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co., the cosmetics maker's president
and chief executive officer, Gary Mulloy, has abruptly
resigned.
   Company insiders said Mr. Mulloy, who had worked at
Maybelline for 15 years and served as chief executive since
January, quit because of mounting interference from his
superiors at Wasserstein.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Robert B. McKeon, chairman of Wasserstein, Perella
Management Partners, an arm of the parent, called charges of
management interference inaccurate, saying he has visited
Maybelline's Memphis headquarters only four times since the
company was acquired.
   "When we acquired the company back in June, our plan was
to keep Gary through our transition," Mr. McKeon said. "He's
just moving on to other things." Mr. McKeon said he
personally will fill Maybelline's top job until Mr. Mulloy's
successor is chosen. Company insiders said a candidate wasn't
apparent.
   Reached at home yesterday, Mr. Mulloy also said he had
planned to remain at Maybelline "only through the transition
period." He added that he was interested in leaving the
cosmetics industry and would prefer the management challenge
of a turnaround situation. "It's time for me to do something
else," he said.
   Yet at the time of the acquisition, Mr. Mulloy told
reporters he planned to stay at the company indefinitely. And
company insiders said Mr. Mulloy was upset recently over what
he believed was interference in the company's advertising
strategy. There had been rumors on Madison Avenue that the
company was considering changing advertising agencies.
   Earlier this month, Maybelline consolidated its
advertising business at DDB Needham Worldwide in Chicago,
moving a small account for its Shine Free cosmetics line from
the Bloom Agency in Dallas. A spokeswoman for DDB Needham
said she didn't believe the Maybelline account was up for
review. "We just got a new piece of business from them," said
the spokeswoman. "We've hired several new creative people to
work on the account."
   Mr. Mulloy's departure marks the latest twist in
Maybelline's labyrinthine corporate history. Schering-Plough
put the cosmetics unit on the block in December. In April,
MBP Acquisition Corp., an investment group that included
Playtex Family Products Corp., had agreed to acquire
Maybelline for $300 million. When that deal collapsed
suddenly a few months later, Wasserstein was apparently
poised to step in. The sale price was unchanged at $300
million.
   With 1989 sales of about $300 million, Maybelline is the
No. 2 brand of cosmetics sold through mass merchandise
outlets. Although its share of the mass market for cosmetics
has held at about 18%, it continues to trail rival Cover Girl
Cosmetics, which was acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. last
year.

   Owes Up to $13 Million;

   RENO, Nev. -- The Mustang Ranch, perhaps the nation's
best-known legal brothel, may be on its last legs.
   On Tuesday, the brothel, which has been trying since 1983
to reorganize itself under federal bankruptcy laws, was
ordered liquidated by a federal bankruptcy judge here. The
judge acted upon a petition by Mustang Ranch's largest
creditor, the Internal Revenue Service, which claims to be
owed up to $13 million in back taxes from the 105-room
brothel, located a few miles east of here. The tax dispute
has been simmering for years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The order came after the brothel's latest attempt to sell
itself and raise capital collapsed. At least twice in recent
years, the owners of Mustang Ranch have attempted,
unsuccessfully, to raise money in public offerings. The
latest IRS move followed an unsuccessful attempt to sell the
brothel outright to a closely held company, although the
brothel's owners claim it was the IRS's own objections that
caused that deal to fall apart.
   The liquidation order has disrupted normal operations at
Mustang Ranch, according to Peter Perry, a Reno attorney for
the brothel. The court appointed a bankruptcy trustee to
oversee operations, but the trustee is having a hard time of
it. "Nobody wants to work for the trustee, so they all left,"
Mr. Perry says. "She went out there, and tried to take over.
But who wants to work for her? People have got to really
worry about her expertise" in running a brothel.
   Mr. Perry said the brothel plans to fight the liquidation
order; the trustee and the IRS couldn't immediately be
reached.

   Revival of Fusion Energy Program Sought
   ---
   U.S. to Be Urged to Build
   Machine, Join Global Effort

ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG)

<LP>
   A federal advisory panel will urge the U.S. to revive its
lagging fusion energy program.
   Specifically, the panel wants the U.S. both to build a new
experimental fusion power machine of its own and to join an
international effort to build an even bigger fusion machine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The panel is expected to call on Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins to reverse a decision last year that severely cut
back the long-running effort to harness for electric power
production the hydrogen fusion process that fuels the sun.
Last year's cutback mainly shelved construction of the
so-called compact ignition tokamak and delayed committing the
U.S. to participate in the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor, or ITER.
   The compact ignition tokamak, if built, would be the first
experimental machine ever to ignite a fusion fire. The
international experimental fusion reactor would be aimed at
testing the engineering aspects of a fusion power plant.
   The report urging these and other fusion projects is
expected to be submitted to the energy secretary later this
week by the fusion policy advisory committee; its chairman is
H. Guyford Stever, former head of the National Science
Foundation.
   In its report, a final draft of which was obtained by The
Wall Street Journal, the advisory committee argues that
fusion energy is gaining new importance, in light of the
Mideast crisis and growing concern about the environmental
consequences of burning oil and coal. "Fusion is one of the
very few energy options that offer an essentially
inexhaustible and widely available fuel supply," it notes.
Moreover, it declares, fusion is safer than atomic power,
producing only one-millionth of the nuclear waste and a
ten-millionth of the radioactivity that a present-day atomic
power plant produces.
   Energy Secretary Watkins set up the committee last March,
after Robert O. Hunter, the Energy Department's departing
director of energy research, urged a new policy that would
have forced a choice between two roads to useful hydrogen
fusion energy. One road, known as inertial confinement, which
Mr. Hunter favored, uses superpowerful laser beams to
compress a tiny pellet of hydrogen suddenly and ignite a
fusion fire. This laser road to fusion is interwoven with the
Defense Department's development of powerful laser weapons
research, and thus much of the research is secret.
   The other, much older, method road, called magnetic
confinement, ignites a fusion fire in a superhot gas of
hydrogen confined inside invisible "bottles" created by
powerful magnets. The magnetic road to fusion, lacking
military value, has been a unique example of open
international cooperation since President Eisenhower's Atoms
for Peace Conference in 1958. Most magnetic fusion machines,
including the two projects Mr. Hunter, the departing Energy
Department official, shelved last year, are based on a Soviet
doughnut-shaped design called a tokamak.
   The committee argues that "the two approaches to civilian
fusion energy are not yet ready for a choice of one over the
other."
   It notes that magnetic confinement is more advanced than
the laser-based method, but that some concepts, if proven
experimentally, might give the inertial method an advantage
in developing a useful fusion power plant.
   The report emphasizes reviving the U.S. magnetic
confinement program. It recommends that the federal budget
for magnetic confinement research be increased to $420
million in fiscal 1992 from $318 million in fiscal 1990 and
steadily increased to $620 million by fiscal 1996. Each
fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
   Acceding, however, to Energy Secretary Watkins's warning
last July that an "ideal" fusion program is unlikely this
year, the panel is offering a "constrained budget," in which
magnetic confinement research funding would rise to $385
million in the next fiscal year, instead of $420 million, and
to $470 million in 1996, in current dollars, instead of $620
million.
   Even with the "constrained budget," the committee urges
Mr. Watkins to revive the two magnetic confinement projects
with tokamaks that were delayed last year under Mr. Hunter,
the departing Energy Department official. The major U.S.
tokamak is in New Jersey at Princeton University's Plasma
Physics Laboratory. Two larger tokamaks are operating
overseas, one in England funded by the European Community and
one in Japan. The Soviets also have an advanced tokamak
machine in operation.
   Within the next few weeks, the U.S. and European machines
are expected to reach the so-called break-even reaction, in
which the fusion of hydrogen atoms will release as much
energy as it took to force them to fuse.
   The Soviets, the Europeans and the Japanese have agreed
that the next step in fusion research should be an
international joint effort to build a much larger tokamak to
test the engineering problems of a fusion power plant. So
far, the U.S. has participated in design studies for the
ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor,
but has avoided committing itself to helping build the
reactor.
   The other delayed project, the compact ignition tokamak,
is an exclusive U.S. effort to build a magnetic machine that
would ignite the world's first controlled fusion fire, that
is, a hydrogen fusion reaction that would sustain itself, as
well as produce more energy than it consumed.
   The U.S. should move along rapidly on both projects, the
committee says. If built, the compact ignition tokamak would
ignite a fusion fire as long as 15 years before the ITER
could do so. Thus, the compact ignition tokamak would answer
many questions that would affect the design of the bigger
international machine and restore the U.S. lead in fusion
research, the report declares. At the same time,
participation in the ITER would maintain U.S. influence on
the ultimate development of fusion power.
   Even under a constrained budget, outlays for the ITER
should be raised to $40 million in the next fiscal year from
$16 million in fiscal 1990, the committee says. Building of
the ignition tokamak in the U.S. should be started with a
budget boost to $40 million next year from last year's $17
million.
   For the laser-based inertial fusion effort, the committee
says current research isn't an energy program but a defense
program, "which is generating information valuable to the
nuclear weapons program."

   Olivetti to Cut Several Thousand Jobs,
   Cites Computer Slowdown, Weak Dollar

   IVREA, Italy -- Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. is planning to cut
several thousand jobs, in addition to reductions announced
earlier this year, as the company grapples with the effects
of the slowdown in demand in the computer industry and the
weak dollar, Managing Director Vittorio Cassoni said.
   Despite winning a larger slice of the European personal
computer market in this year's second quarter, the company
has been pressured to streamline by a squeeze on profit
margins caused by fierce competition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue increased about 6% in the first half from 3.94
trillion lire ($3.39 billion) in the year-earlier period. But
despite this performance and success in holding down overall
costs, further slimming will be needed, Mr. Cassoni said.
   "We are definitely growing faster than the industry,
certainly faster than the European industry . . . in terms of
revenue," he said. Excluding the effects of exchange-rate
fluctuations, revenue grew 8.7%.
   Olivetti said revenues at the top 20 U.S. computer
companies increased 7.4% in the first half, a figure closer
to 4% once exchange-rate factors were excluded. The figure
also compares with declining, or only slightly growing,
revenues at Olivetti's major European competitors.
   Mr. Cassoni wouldn't discuss the company's profit
performance, because the board is set to meet next week to
review and announce results for the half. Analysts, however,
are pessimistic about Olivetti's profit outlook, and group
Chairman Carlo De Benedetti warned shareholders in June that
1990 would be a tough year. The group has seen net profit
slide to 202.8 billion lire last year from 356.2 billion lire
in 1988, 402 billion lire in 1987, and 565.5 billion lire in
1986.
   "Olivetti is doing well relative to our competition in an
environment that is worsening," Mr. Cassoni said. "That said,
we are not done with the streamlining of our operations." He
said that the process of cutting back, which the company had
expected to complete this year, will have to be continued in
1991.
   The company is planning to shed "a few more thousand" jobs
next year, in addition to the 3,500 jobs being cut this year
from the work force of 57,000 on Jan. 1. Those cuts will come
on top of more than 2,000 jobs cut in 1989; so far all
reductions have been through voluntary methods.
   One reason Olivetti has been particularly hit in the U.S.
is its emphasis on bank automation systems. Last year,
Olivetti bought ISC Systems Corp. of Spokane, Wash., merging
it with the company's Bunker Ramo Corp. unit.
   The move made bank automation Olivetti's biggest single
U.S. business, ahead of sales of office equipment and
personal computers. But the U.S. economic slowdown, coupled
with the crisis in the savings-and-loan industry, has hurt
business.
   Nevertheless, Olivetti has no plans to radically revise
its business approach in the U.S. "Banking is the single most
important vertical market for Olivetti . . . we're not going
to review that strategy," Mr. Cassoni said.

   Shatalin Can Work if Privatization Comes First

<LP>
   The Communist Party of the Soviet Union wasted the 20th
century trying to do the impossible -- organize production
without markets and private property. This ideological effort
has failed at great cost, and now pragmatic leaders are
attempting to create the conditions for economic success. One
such effort that has shown up lately in the news is the
"Shatalin Plan," a 500-day economic program to move the
Soviet Union toward capitalism.
   Mikhail Gorbachev originally wavered over the plan. But
the government of the Russian republic -- led by Boris
Yeltsin -- officially adopted the Shatalin Plan Sept. 11. Mr.
Gorbachev then submitted his own version of the Shatalin Plan
to the Supreme Soviet two days later. The revolution has
begun, and Mr. Gorbachev will have to run hard if he intends
to catch up. On Monday, he decided a national referendum
would be necessary on a crucial element of the program: land
ownership. The reformers interpret that move as an effort by
Mr. Gorbachev to stall implementation of the Shatalin Plan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The main news, though, is that reformers have run out of
patience. Economists such as Stanislav Shatalin and Nikolai
Petrakov -- two of the famed plan's contributors -- believe
that the economy is fading fast and that the result of
further procrastination will be death. New democratic
politicians, such as Boris Yeltsin, Moscow Mayor Gavriil
Popov and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, believe that Mr.
Gorbachev's vacillations are allowing Soviet ministries and
the Communist Party to conduct a de facto privatization in
their own behalf. Determined to prevent powerful vested
interests from plundering the economy, the reformers have
rallied around the Shatalin Plan.
   The lengthy program calls for privatization and market
prices and sets timetables. It is a remarkable document, but
suffers from a lack of details. Most important, the Shatalin
Plan does not say how privatization is to be achieved. It
makes it unclear what comes first, privatization or market
pricing -- decisions that also affect ruble convertibility.
   In part the lack of critical detail reflects a compelling
need to act. In part it reflects a genuine bewilderment about
how to proceed with privatization. Reformers realize that
without market prices and capital markets there is no basis
for valuation of state property. At what prices, then, are
assets to be sold? This problem leads many to conclude that
prices must first be freed in order to find out what things
are worth. De facto privatization does not face this problem,
because those who currently control state property are simply
claiming it and acting as owners.
   The reformers will have to borrow a leaf from their
opponents' book and assign property rights, because without
private property the market cannot value assets. Before
capital markets can form and price assets, property rights
will have to be given to the people. The reformers do not
understand this, and many are determined that property not be
given away. This mindset deprives the Shatalin Plan of a
means of implementation.
   The truth, of course, is that there cannot be markets
without private property. If prices are freed first, some
will rise and others fall. Unemployment or large deficits
would result from falling prices, and higher prices would
produce complaints of profiteering and upward adjustments in
the level of prices that would be mistaken for inflation.
Both would demand remedies and deflect attention from
privatization. Moreover, these "prices" would not be accurate
indications of asset values. In the absence of private
property, assets would not be free. The result would be
undervaluation of resources locked into low-value uses and
overvaluation of resources where prices are high.
   The only obvious way around this problem is to convert
Soviet firms into joint stock companies and issue shares. A
percentage of the shares must then be given away. Once
property is in private hands, prices can be freed, and
markets will establish values for the shares that have been
assigned -- thus creating a priced market for sale of
remaining shares.
   This approach also allows the reformers to fortify the
people with property prior to the new uncertainties of the
market. If I were one of the new politicians, I would rather
be able to tell the people that "the Communist Party is
stealing the property that I intend to give to you," and not
"the Communist Party is stealing the property that I intend
to sell to black market millionaires and foreigners."
   Reformers have not thought about giving property away,
because they are obsessed with the "ruble overhang." They
want to sell property in order to soak up the excess supply
of rubles, but this is a red herring -- no pun intended]
Subsidized prices must rise once they are freed, regardless
of the money supply. Moreover, all the property doesn't need
to be given away -- just some of it.
   There are two promising methods of giving property away,
and reformers should employ both. A portion of the shares of
individual firms should be assigned individually to managers
and workers, and a portion should be assigned to a mutual or
social fund that, in turn, issues shares assigned
individually and equally to the population. Of the remaining
shares, a percentage could be sold to Soviet and foreign
investors, and a percentage could be assigned to government
(in the form of nonvoting shares or bond equivalents) to
provide revenues in lieu of income taxation.
   Without a scheme along these lines, the Shatalin Plan
lacks a political program and a means of implementation.
Distribution of shares would accomplish many goals. For
example, a relatively large percentage could be assigned to
the social fund, and a portion of that could be made a
mandatory holding so that each individual would have his or
her own social insurance, safety net, and retirement system.
This would remove the terror much of the population has of
market pricing. Changes in the level and relation of prices
would be reflected in share values and earnings. The social
fund would provide a cushion to protect the population from
inflation and unemployment. Losses and gains would be widely
distributed and equally shared through the social fund.
   Sales to foreigners attract talent and foreign exchange.
Sales to Soviet citizens accommodate those who have
accumulated wealth and financial balances from the exercise
of de facto property rights.
   This approach automatically solves the problem of ruble
convertibility. The ruble will become convertible once it can
purchase capital. Until individuals can use the ruble to buy
property, it has no basis for conversion into other
currencies. Linking the ruble to a commodity such as gold
before privatization would result in flight from rubles to
gold. It is the capability of a currency to purchase
productive assets that gives it value.
   The Shatalin Plan gives the republic governments sway over
the privatization of property, and this has been its main
sticking point with Mr. Gorbachev. He recognizes that, in
effect, the plan puts the Soviet government out of business.
If Mr. Gorbachev had moved quickly, he could have privatized
on an all-union basis and strengthened the Soviet Union
against the disintegration that is now taking place. By
hesitating, Mr. Gorbachev lost the initiative and may no
longer have the power to govern the republics. His referendum
is an attempt to hold onto that power.
   In the Soviet Union privatization is no longer the
question. What remains to be determined is whether the de
facto privatizations that are occurring will be replaced with
a plan based in law. If democratically elected politicians
permit powerful interests to plunder the country, they will
be discredited. Rising anger could plunge the country into
bloodshed.

   TOKYO -- Japan's Mitsubishi Group and West Germany's
Daimler-Benz AG said they are moving toward cooperation on
about a dozen products, from cross-country vehicles to
semiconductors, but disclosed basic agreement on only one new
venture-boosting sales of Mercedes-Benz cars in Japan.
   "The effort expended in terms of getting to know each
other has been greater than I had expected," Daimler-Benz
Chairman Edzard Reuter said in a statement after the first
set of top-level meetings since the two giant industrial
groups began exploring a global alliance in March.

   Shinroku Morohashi, president of the Mitsubishi Corp.
trading house at the center of the Japanese group, said at a
news conference after the three-hour meeting that the talks
"will take considerable time to reach fruition." But he added
that "given another six months we will be able to report
further progress."
   Some of the projects have been reported before, but
yesterday's news conference provided the most detailed
progress report since the first talks, in Singapore, six
months ago. The most progress has apparently come in the
automotive business, where each group concentrates on
opposite ends of the spectrum. Gerhard Liener, Daimler-Benz
chief financial officer, said Mercedes-Benz AG and Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. were near completion of an agreement to design,
develop and jointly produce cross-country vehicles.
   The companies also said they expect to form shortly a
joint venture along with Yanase &amp; Co., a Japanese distributor
of imported cars, to expand Mercedes-Benz's sales network in
Japan, including arranging for some Mitsubishi dealers to
sell the German cars. Mercedes says it is the leader in
Japan's tiny import market, and with the new agreement hopes
to boost sales to 60,000 a year by 1995 from the current
37,000.
   Regarding previously disclosed discussions on sharing
technology for an auto factory in what is now East Germany,
Mr. Liener said Daimler-Benz must first complete its own
plans for the site before negotiating Mitsubishi's
involvement. He said economic conditions have delayed
cooperation on an auto factory in the Soviet Union.
   In the potentially significant area of aerospace, Koichi
Danno, director of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., said
they were talking about working together on aerospace
systems, ultrasonic measuring devices and medium-sized
commercial aircraft. Mr. Liener said the companies were
discussing three-way cooperation with United Technologies
Corp., which already works with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
   Executives said Mitsubishi and Daimler-Benz are exploring
making versions of each other's chips, and that talks were
focusing on semiconductors for the consumer electronics
products of Daimler unit AEG AG.
   On Oct. 1, Mitsubishi Corp. will set up an office in
Stuttgart near Daimler-Benz headquarters.

   Massachusetts's Strange Protest Vote
   ----

<LP>
   That anguished cry emanating from the northeast Tuesday
was the sound made by the liberal beast as John Silber's
stunning victory in the Massachusetts Democratic
gubernatorial primary thrust a knife into its belly. In the
eight months since the combative president of Boston
University launched what then seemed a longshot bid for the
nomination to succeed Michael Dukakis, Mr. Silber has managed
to infuriate virtually every sector of the state's liberal
establishment.
   Barely two weeks into his campaign, Mr. Silber wondered
aloud why Massachusetts had become a "welfare magnet" for
waves of Southeast Asian immigrants who, he said, have turned
Lowell, Mass., into "the Cambodian capital of America."
Attacking the costly special education classes mandated by
state law, Mr. Silber said the high enrollment in such
programs "would lead one to believe there has been a collapse
of the gene pool in Massachusetts because 17 1/2% of our kids
are weird." Such pungent comments led one of Mr. Silber's
opponents to distribute buttons reading, "In your guts, you
know he's nuts."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And yet Mr. Silber -- despite the conservative credentials
he compiled for his strong support of the Nicaraguan Contras
when President Reagan appointed him to the Kissinger
Commission on Central America, and for cracking down on
overnight co-ed socializing in BU dorms -- is no
right-winger's dream. Mr. Silber takes it for granted that
government ought to be unabashedly interventionist.
   "If we are going to act as social engineers, we ought to
learn from the practice of real engineers," Mr. Silber wrote
in his book "Straight Shooting: What's Wrong with America and
How to Fix It" (Harper &amp; Row, 1989), the Rosetta Stone of his
campaign. "Confronting our social problems, we need the same
willingness to acknowledge failure, to discover what went
wrong, and to produce new designs."
   At no little political risk, he vehemently opposes an
initiative placed on the November ballot by a libertarian
anti-tax group that would wipe out all recent tax hikes. (His
Republican opponent, William Weld, state chairman for Phil
Crane in 1980, was an early and avid supporter of the
petition.) This petition promises to be the whitecap atop the
wave of voter anger that swept out a number of Democratic
incumbents in the primary. But Mr. Silber argues that the
"discipline" imposed on state government by a Silber
administration would be sufficient to control costs.
   He has called too for a "pump-priming" 12-cent-a-gallon
gas tax hike to stimulate public construction projects and
tourism. Mr. Silber's social proposals include high-priced
items such as expanded early-childhood education and
year-round schooling. It's not big-spending, interventionist
government that draws Mr. Silber's scorn -- it's the
Democratic Party's contemporary captivation by "special
interests and single-issue politics," such as those
enticingly generous welfare policies and poorly-managed
special education programs.
   "Some true dependents, such as the mentally ill or
handicapped, do need a free ride," says Mr. Silber. "Other
than that, the notion of a free ride is preposterous." To Mr.
Silber, socially responsible citizens are those who pay their
taxes, obey the law, and do not make excessive demands on the
state's largesse. All others -- be they unwed teenage
mothers, juvenile offenders, or incompetent public school
administrators -- must submit to the paternalistic stick if
they expect to taste the welfare carrot.
   In a state where the bureaucracy has taken to calling
welfare recipients "clients," Mr. Silber's prescription for
trimming welfare rolls represents a 180-degree change of
attitude. Too often, he maintains, the promise of enhanced
welfare benefits entices poor, unwed mothers to have a second
child whom they are ill-equipped to raise properly. Mr.
Silber would deny benefits to that second child. "While we
should neglect neither the child nor the mother when such
pregnancies occur, financial support should be contingent on
the mother's placing her child in a preschool nursery program
and enrolling in a school to qualify her for employment," he
wrote in "Straight Shooting."
   Mr. Silber advocates placing all children in full-time
schooling from age three, with their parent or parents also
receiving parenting coaching and taking premedical education
courses. All this state attention would be voluntary --
unless the state determines the child is not being properly
cared for. Then, Mr. Silber promised in his book, "truancy
laws would guarantee" proper child care. "No parent should
have the right to engage in child neglect."
   He evinces a "humane concern" for the hard-core
unemployables who populate the prisons and have proven, in
Massachusetts, and elsewhere, proof against even full
employment conditions. But along with that empathy comes a
conviction that the state -- through remedial education in
boot-camp prisons and through the preventive balm of his pet
early-education programs -- should back up that humane
concern with tough, compulsory remedies.
   Mr. Silber advocates abandonment of racial integration
quotas in the early grades in order to facilitate
neighborhood schooling. He would put faltering public schools
on notice by giving expensive but ineffectual systems like
Boston's five years to shape up. If they have not improved by
then, he would allow students to enroll in the district of
their choice, with state funding following them. He reserves
special scorn for parents who, as he said in a recent
television interview, "allow their children to watch endless
amounts of television" and then send the kids off to school
"without a proper breakfast, so they become inattentive as
the day wears on."
   "True liberalism," Mr. Silber argues, "never departed from
the New Deal model." But skeptics detect quite another model
in Mr. Silber's rhetoric: The model that sociologist Charles
Murray described in a 1988 Commentary article as "the brave
new world of custodial democracy, in which a substantial
portion of our population . . . will in effect be treated as
wards of the state."
   Mr. Silber's candidacy offers much of the benevolent
paternalism of Franklin Roosevelt, but its moralistic
underpinning -- stemming from a conviction that the proper
reform not only helps out the unfortunates, but also forcibly
improves their character -- is more reminiscent of the
beliefs of another college president who ran for governor of
a reform-minded state: Woodrow Wilson, who won his race in
1910, by espousing the same sort of moralistic reform that
Mr. Silber now touts. Mr. Silber's impressive primary victory
over a field of garden variety Democrats suggests that, given
Massachusetts's unhappy experiences with modern-day
liberalism, the electorate might be ready for Mr. Silber's
new, old-fashioned brand of change.

   Postal Service Moves
   To Boost Use of Mail
   Carrying Bar Codes

   WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service is moving to speed up the
use of mail with address bar codes, which enable post offices
to use efficient automated equipment.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced several actions
aimed at encouraging business customers to put bar codes on
letter envelopes, large flat mail pieces and even packages.
The agency also said it will send brochures encouraging
mailers to use complete addresses, with ZIP codes on the line
next to the city and state, to the more than 116 million U.S.
addresses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, the agency awarded two contracts totaling
$27.2 million for modified equipment that will read address
bar codes almost anywhere on the face of envelopes. Automated
bar code sorters currently in use can only read bar codes
printed in the lower right-hand corner.
   The awards include a $14.2 million contract to
Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, and a $13 million
contract to Bell &amp; Howell Co., Skokie, Ill. Each contract is
for modification of 614 bar code sorters that currently are
being built and for changing an additional 694 sorters
already being used by the Postal Service.
   By 1995, the service hopes to have all letters bar coded
with 11 digits, which narrow delivery to the recipient's
address. It hopes to have 40% of all letters coded by
customers, 40% by post offices and 20% by contractors who do
the coding from remote locations, or using other
technologies.
   Mr. Frank said the agency proposes to begin offering rate
incentives for barcoded letters next June, and to extend them
to all of the nation by three months after that. The service
originally had proposed starting the discounts in 1992, then
moved the plan up to September 1991. While the agency has
proposed that first-class mail be charged 30 cents, up from
the current 25 cents, mailers who bar code letters could pay
as little as 24.3 cents under the rate proposal pending
before the Postal Rate Commission.
   The agency will file for a bar-coding rate discount for
flats, possibly more than one cent per piece, next spring,
Mr. Frank said. It has contracted with several vendors to
develop a flats bar code reader. Finally, the Postal Board of
Governors has approved $52 million for a package bar coding
system to process packages, Mr. Frank said.

   High-Risk Drivers
   In California to Pay
   More for Insurance

   State Agency Clears 85% Rise
   In Premiums; Consumers
   Vow a Court Challenge

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The price of auto insurance in
California, which was supposed to decline in the wake of the
revisionist Proposition 103, is about to go up in a big way
for as many as 1.2 million of the state's drivers.
   Yesterday, the state insurance department backed an 85%
increase in premiums charged for the high-risk drivers who
are insured through the so-called California assigned risk
plan. Unless it ends up being blocked in court, the order
allows insurance companies that make up the plan to impose
the higher rates beginning Sept. 28. According to one
estimate, the increase would raise about $800 million in
revenue for the industry, boosting the average annual premium
to nearly $1,300 from $695.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About 1.2 million of the estimated 14 million insured
drivers in California are covered by the plan, which the
Legislature created in the 1940s as an insurer of last resort
for people who otherwise can't afford or obtain insurance.
   State insurance officials defended the big increase, and
said it is aimed at rooting out massive fraud and other
problems with the program. Though the exact numbers are in
dispute, the program is considered to include thousands of
good drivers who don't qualify for the special rates but who
have signed up in increasing numbers in recent years as rates
in the so-called voluntary market have soared.
   "These policies are being purchased by people who belong
in the voluntary market and who are being subsidized for no
good reason," Karl Rubinstein, an attorney for the state
insurance department, said. "Our sympathy is with the people
in the voluntary market who are suffering an extra load they
should not have to suffer."
   Nonetheless, consumer groups said the increase would weigh
the heaviest on poor people and vowed to try to stop it in
court. Robert Gnaizda, a San Francisco public-interest
lawyer, said the department's action represents "the largest
unscrutinized rate increase in California history."
   Industry officials said the increase isn't enough. "This
is a welcome relief, but it is only a step in the right
direction," said Steve Feely, chairman of the assigned risk
plan's governing committee. The plan, which hasn't had an
increase in premiums since 1987, is continuing to seek a 160%
increase to offset a deficit that hit $630 million last year.
   The planned increase points up the tangled nature of the
state's recent insurance revision efforts. Proposition 103,
enacted by voters in November 1988, called for major
rollbacks and other strict new regulation to minimize rate
increases, though the initiative has been held inapplicable
to the assigned-risk program.

   American General, Unable to Get Buyer,
   May Sell Core Unit; Stock Falls $6.375

   American General Corp., claiming that it's having trouble
finding a buyer for the whole company, said it may settle for
selling only its core, home service life insurance business.
   The Houston-based financial services concern, which placed
itself on the auction block in May after turning down a $6
billion, or $50-a-share, takeover bid from Torchmark Corp.,
blamed "current international and economic uncertainty" for
the apparent lack of buyer interest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That bleak description sent shock waves through the entire
market for takeover stocks. American General plunged $6.375
to $33.625 a share in composite trading yesterday on the New
York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, UAL Corp., the parent of
United Airlines, skidded $5 to $100.
   The news was compounded by an announcement by Aon Corp.
that it doesn't intend to pursue a proposed bid for Corroon &amp;
Black, a New York insurance broker, after Corroon rejected
Aon's bid late yesterday. Corroon stock tumbled $3.50 to $32.
   But skeptics also questioned whether American General has
been shopping itself as vigorously as it might. Under the
alternative restructuring plan sketched out yesterday,
current management would stay at the helm of a restructured
American General. The principal businesses of the
restructured company, including a tax-qualified annuities
unit, real estate operations and a consumer finance
subsidiary, would have assets of $24.9 billion and equity of
$3.5 billion. In 1989 those businesses earned $235 million,
the company said.
   "With this kind of action, management looks like it's
protecting its own positions," said one analyst, who asked
not to be quoted by name.
   In an interview, Harold S. Hook, American General's
chairman, denied that the company has dragged its heels or
that he's trying to hold onto power. He said the company's
preference is still to sell itself whole, and attributed the
slow progress to the complexity and size of American General.
"The mechanics of things like this take a little time," he
said.
   Still, such speculation has been fueled by the fact that
American General has been slow to circulate its books to
potential buyers. According to one consultant, the company
didn't complete actuarial appraisals of its insurance
businesses until about three weeks ago.
   And it apparently hasn't yet come up with a plan to allow
Torchmark, which at one time was its most eager suitor, to
peek at its books. Jon Rotenstreich, Torchmark's president,
said the Birmingham, Ala., insurer hasn't seen them because
it refuses to sign a confidentiality agreement required by
American General. That agreement, Mr. Rotenstreich said,
"would have precluded us from making any appeal to their
shareholders" at American General's annual meeting in 1991.
   Torchmark sparked American General's self-auction in March
by offering more than $6 billion in cash and securities for
the whole company. American General turned down the proposal
at the time, but later decided to stage an auction in order
to seek a higher price.
   Mr. Rotenstreich called American General's latest
announcement "encouraging," but stopped short of saying
whether his company would make a separate bid for American
General's core home service life insurance unit, a cash cow
that focuses on selling life insurance door-to-door to people
of moderate income.
   Mr. Rotenstreich said Torchmark still believes it could
finance the purchase of American General, despite market
uncertainties and a drop in Torchmark's own stock price. In
Big Board composite trading yesterday, Torchmark shares
closed at $44.75, down 25 cents.
   American General's latest plan would be complicated by the
fact that it would want to make any home service sale be
"tax-effective." Although it isn't clear what the company
means by that, several analysts said it would likely require
that the assets be acquired for stock rather than cash. Such
a transaction would require approval from the Internal
Revenue Service.
   Analysts said American General's announcement will likely
generate new bidder interest. The home service operations,
with assets of $8.9 billion, equity of $3.0 billion, and 1989
earnings of $305 million, would make a good strategic fit
with a number of foreign or domestic companies, they said.
   Thomas Richter, an analyst with Robinson Humphrey Co.,
Atlanta, estimated that the home-service unit itself would
likely fetch $25 to $30 a share, or about $3 billion to $3.6
billion. But he said American General might try to unload its
corporate-level debt, which he valued at $15 a share, along
with the unit. The remaining operations have a book value of
$29 a share, he added.

   Karen Elliott House's excellent article, "How Jordan's
King Was Played for a Fool" (editorial page, Aug. 14), states
that the British installed his grandfather Abdullah in a
kingdom they had created for him "after they removed him from
the Hejaz, now a part of Saudi Arabia."
   The British did not remove the Hashemite family from their
hereditary domain in the holy cities of Arabia. They were
removed by the desert tribal sheikdom of Ibn Saud, who
conquered most of the Arabian Peninsula during the first two
decades of this century and exiled the Hashemites when the
conquest was completed in 1921. This gives the Hashemite
family at least as much legitimate claim to Saudi Arabia as
anybody has to any area of land in the Middle East. Some
lingering coolness between the two royal families may be
explained by their old enmity and the precarious legitimacy
of both over the lands they rule.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After their conquest of Arabia, the Saud family named
their new domain after themselves -- "Saudi Arabia." This
would be about the equivalent of the King ranch family of
Texas conquering the entire state and calling it "King
Texas."
   The other consolation prize given by the British to the
exiled Hashemite family was Iraq, where they installed
Abdullah's brother Feisal as king. He was murdered by an
earlier version of Saddam Hussein.

   Pan Am to Slash Payroll, Trim Service

   Pan Am Corp. Chairman Thomas Plaskett said he's slashing
2,500 jobs from the company's payroll, axing some
trans-Atlantic service and shifting to smaller aircraft in an
effort to cope with higher fuel costs and sluggish passenger
demand.
   The action by the parent of Pan American Airways, one of
the country's major carriers, is the largest work force
reduction announced so far this year by any airline holding
company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Industry analysts said the company's plan is a harbinger
of further troubles to come in an industry whose outlook has
been darkening in the days since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The company said it plans to eliminate the 2,500 jobs, or
8.6% of its work force, during the fourth quarter through
voluntary leaves of absence, attrition and furloughs. Mr.
Plaskett said the furloughs will affect management officials
as well as rank-and-file employees.
   Mr. Plaskett, speaking at a Wall Street airlines analyst
meeting, said that he plans to cut Pan Am's capacity by 7.5%
to 42.96 billion available seat miles in 1991 from 46.43
billion available seat miles in 1990.
   The largest chunk of the service cuts will come from Pan
Am's trans-Atlantic service, where Mr. Plaskett said he plans
to reduce capacity by 15.4% next year compared with this
year.
   For one thing, Mr. Plaskett said he will be dropping
Boeing Co.'s 412-seat 747 jet on several trans-Atlantic
routes and replacing it with Airbus Industrie's smaller
192-seat A310-300 aircraft.
   Although Pan Am's already-low stock remained unchanged at
$1.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading, the
announcement came as good news to many Wall Street analysts,
long-familiar with Pan Am's difficulty turning a profit.
   "They didn't get up there and dish out a bunch of
baloney," said Roseanne Tortora, an airlines analyst at
County NatWest Securities. "When push comes to shove, I don't
know if it will be enough, but they have a plan that appears
to be well thought out."
   Already, other carriers have tried to take bites out of
their budgets. USAir Group Inc.'s Chairman Edwin Colodny last
month said he is laying off 6.7% of his carrier's work force
of 54,000 employees.
   Other carriers are said to be discussing similar furlough
plans. Robert Crandall, chairman at AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines, is slashing operational costs in a campaign that
includes an edict to workers to turn off lights after
quitting time.
   As part of Pan Am's trans-Atlantic switch in planes, Mr.
Plaskett said he plans to return five leased Boeing 747-400s
to General Electric Credit Corp., a General Electric Co.
unit, by April 1991.
   Another large part of the service reduction is coming from
Pan Am's domestic service, where Mr. Plaskett said he plans
to cut capacity by 10.1% next year versus this year.
   Among other things, Pan Am plans include closing its
offices in Austin, Texas, Cincinnati and San Antonio, Texas.
It is also cutting a number of domestic flights from its hub
of operations at New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport.
   All the while, Mr. Plaskett said that he plans to boost
the carrier's Latin American service out of Miami, which the
carrier has been building as a hub of operations. The
company's plans include increasing Pan Am service out of
Miami to 82 flights next year from 63 departures in 1989 and
the first half of 1990.
   By 1995, Pan Am says it plans to increase the number of
flights to 231 daily departures, including its commuter
flights.
   Pan Am's layoff program may raise tensions with the
Teamsters, which represents about 6,500 employees. It isn't
clear how many of its members will lose their jobs.
   Yesterday, Teamster officials met in Washington, D.C., to
discuss whether to call a strike at Pan Am. Already, the
union, which is in the midst of contract negotiations, has
been conducting a work-slowdown campaign at Pan Am.
   "The company is in trouble," said George Miranda, a top
official at the union's airline division.
   Just days ago, in fact, Pan Am reached an agreement with
government regulators to defer $53 million in pension-plan
payments until November. That comes on top of $106.4 million
in bills that Pan Am deferred paying earlier this year to
three big creditors.
   Pan Am is turning to a longstanding practice of trying to
remedy its cash problem by selling assets. Yesterday, Mr.
Plaskett said "several" parties are interested in buying the
airline holding company's Pan Am Shuttle unit, which he said
should be sold by year end. He cautioned, however, that a
purchase most likely wouldn't be completed until early 1991.
   Although Mr. Plaskett wouldn't identify the parties
involved in the shuttle talks, industry sources have pointed
to America West Airlines as a possible buyer.
   The company already has one sale under its belt this year.
It recently announced the sale of its inter-German service to
Lufthansa German Airlines for $150 million. It should get
cash from that sale during the fourth quarter.

   Art Auction Firms Try Cooling Sales Fever

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- While the world's two big auction houses won't
go so far as to concede the much-ballyhooed art boom is over,
they are retooling their sales strategies in hopes of taming
a difficult market.
   This week and early next week, the sales catalogs for the
1990 fall art auction season -- essentially the international
shopping list for art collectors world-wide -- go to press.
Last year, in the roughly three-month-long season, Sotheby's
Holdings Inc. and Christie's International PLC sold more than
$2 billion of art. But this year, they say they expect to
sell less.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Every time we've had a dip in the economy, or times of
unrest, people tend to hold onto art objects until the price
is right for them," said John Marion, chairman of Sotheby's
Inc., the firm's New York auction unit. Reflecting the
concern of dealers and collectors, he said: "Everybody is
walking around asking: `What do you think is going to
happen?'"
   The best guess: The flagship Impressionist and modern
paintings auctions, which generally set the tone for the
overall art market, will be appreciably smaller, according to
auction house officials. At these sales, scheduled for the
second week of November, not only will there be fewer
artworks for sale but, in some cases, the "reserves" the
auction house have set on paintings -- the minimum price the
seller will accept -- will be lower than they would have been
a year ago, said Christopher Davidge, the managing director
of Christie's International.
   What Sotheby's and Christie's can't afford, auction house
officials concede, is a repeat of last spring's miserable
London art auctions. The majority of $300 million in
paintings and sculpture put on the auction block in June
failed to sell. Mr. Marion said the price estimates on the
artworks were so high they actually discouraged potential
bidders.
   This time, the auction houses say, they won't make the
same mistake. Consider a hypothetical Pierre Auguste Renoir
purchased at auction in 1986 for $1 million that the owner is
seeking to put on the auction block with an estimated catalog
price of $2.5 million to $3 million. "That used to be an
acceptable risk" for Christie's, said Michael Findlay, head
of the firm's Impressionist and modern paintings department
in the U.S. "Now it is not." These days, he said, Christie's
would publish a price estimate of $1.5 million to $2 million
for such a painting. And the painting might not be accepted
for sale at all, given how recently it had been on the
market.
   The auction houses are preparing the art market and their
shareholders for the possibility of a sharp drop in the fall
auction sales totals. Sotheby's, for example, is estimating
that its major fall Impressionist paintings auction will take
in about $80 million. Last May, Sotheby's major spring
Impressionist sale, boosted by the $78.1 million paid for
Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette," took in $286 million.
   By reducing public expectations for the fall sales,
Sotheby's and Christie's, which together control almost 80%
of the art auction market, hope to prevent the slew of
"buy-ins," or unsold art works, that shook up the art world
this spring and sparked talk that the art boom was over. And
some experts believe that the auction houses may be
successful in preventing an art market panic with their
strategy of orchestrating smaller, but successful fall sales.
   The sales will be missing the blockbuster masterpieces
that sold for $50 million or more in recent years, the
auction houses say. The highest estimates for any paintings
to be sold at the fall auction season are $28 million for a
painting by British artist John Constable at Sotheby's, and
$16 million for a Vincent van Gogh due on the block at
Christie's.
   The wealthy art collectors who routinely consign works to
auction are noticeably skittish this year, anxious that their
artworks not become a test of the market.
   Noticeably absent from this season's auction market is
John Whitney Payson, an art dealer with galleries in Maine,
New York and Florida who is one of the wealthiest art
collectors in the country. In recent years, Mr. Payson, or
members of his family, have been responsible for consigning
three of the 10 most expensive works ever sold at auction.
And in past years, the excitement and interest generated by
the Payson family masterpieces often spilled over into the
rest of the auction.
   This year, Mr. Payson isn't selling a major painting from
his private collection. Reached at his Brunswick, Maine,
gallery, he said that when he sold van Gogh's "Irises" for
$54 million in November 1987, "the need was there and the
market was right. Now there's not the market, not the need,
and not the inclination."
   Meanwhile, the big auction houses are tramping the globe
looking for new business. Sotheby's Holdings Inc. President
Michael A. Ainslie is temporarily relocating to the firm's
London office. He will be shoring up the operation in London,
where several major sales have flopped in the past few
months, and looking for new business through planned
Sotheby's expansions in France, Eastern Europe and Asia.
   Similarly, Christie's has doubled its staff and auction
space in Paris, expecting increased business when trade
restrictions are eased in 1992, and is considering opening
offices in Frankfurt and Berlin, said Mr. Davidge. He added
that the firm's world-wide business -- as measured by the
value of artworks consigned for sale -- is running just below
the level of a year ago and above 1988's level.
   While prices for Impressionist paintings "don't grow to
the sky," he said, other markets such as French furniture and
porcelain are continuing strong. However, they aren't as
profitable to the company as Impressionist pictures.
   Overall, dealers, collectors and other art market players
are more cautious than bearish. Last year, for example, Ralph
Lerner, an estate attorney, consigned much of the late Lydia
Winston Malbin's collection of Italian futurist paintings and
sculpture to Sotheby's, where it sold well above estimate at
about $87 million. This year, both his dealer and estate
clients "are much more cautious," he said. "Nobody is sure
what the market is going to do, what the market is going to
tell us."
   Said New York antiques dealer David Killen: "The status
antiques, the ones signed by the right artist, or with the
right marks or from the right collection, are still bringing
tremendous money. Everything else has plateaued, nothing has
crashed, and there's still so much money out there" to buy.

   NEW YORK -- Jitters about the economy wiped out a meek
rally in over-the-counter stocks and bruised the shares of
yet another newly public company.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index ended down 0.53 at 371.68, a
0.1% loss, after staging a brief rally in the first hour of
trading. Volume rose to 120.9 million shares from 115.1
million Tuesday. Declining shares outpaced decliners, 936 to
870, as 143 stocks fell to new lows and 20 reached new highs.

   O'Charley's, a Nashville, Tenn., restaurant operator,
tumbled 1/2 to 5 on more than six times average volume after
analysts trimmed their earnings estimates for the company.
The operator of Southeastern restaurants went public in
mid-July at $9 a share. But now it is feeling the pinch of
higher food prices and slower business, according to Alex.
Brown &amp; Sons analyst Steve Rockwell, who as recently as
midAugust said the company's growth was on target.
   Alex. Brown was the lead underwriter for the IPO. J.C.
Bradford &amp; Co. and Morgan, Keegan &amp; Co. were co-managers.
Analysts at all three firms trimmed estimates for O'Charley's
yesterday, but maintain "buy" opinions on the stock.
   O'Charley's chief financial officer, Gregory Burns, told
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that general economic
concerns have hurt the stock. If the economy strengthens in
the fourth quarter, then the company could earn 50 to 55
cents a share for the year, Mr. Burns said. Otherwise, higher
operating costs will make it hard to achieve that goal, he
said. However, both Mr. Burns and Mr. Rockwell said they're
convinced the company is positioned well for future growth.
   The nation's budget deficit is fast replacing Middle East
tensions as the chief concern of stock investors now, said
Jeremiah Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter
Reynolds, New York. Small investors have disappeared from the
market and institutions continue to be very picky, he said.
The remainder of the week should be slow, he added.
   Grant-Norpac, a Houston oil-service company, made its
debut with an initial offering of four million shares priced
at 10 1/4. The stock rose 1/2 to close at 10 3/4 on 1.1
million shares.
   Apple Computer fell 7/8 to 32 1/2 after the Cupertino,
Calif., computer maker said that shipments of its System 7.0
software will be delayed until the first half of 1991. More
than 1.6 million shares changed hands, making Apple the day's
third-most active OTC stock.
   Investors favored some other technology issues. Oracle
Systems, the day's most-active stock, edged up 1/8 to 7 1/4;
Intel rose 3/8 to 33 7/8; 3Com added 5/8 to 7 3/4; and Conner
Peripherals climbed 3/4 to 21 5/8.
   MIPS Computer Systems, which posted an all-time low
Tuesday, jumped 1 1/8 after Alex. Brown &amp; Sons analyst Mark
D. Stahlman upgraded his investment opinion on the stock to a
"buy" from a "hold."
   Centocor jumped 2 to 41 3/4. PaineWebber analyst Linda
Miller told investors she learned the military has asked for
supplies of Centoxin, the biotechnology company's product for
the treatment of septic shock, for possible use in the Middle
East. Although federal regulators haven't approved the
product for commercial marketing, Ms. Miller said she doesn't
believe this prohibits the military from using it. Centocor
confirmed it has had talked with the military, but wouldn't
elaborate.
   Grossman's advanced 5/8 to 3 5/8 on more than three times
average volume. After the market closed, the Braintree,
Mass., building-materials company said its board authorized
the buy-back of up to $2 million of its 26 million shares.
Grossman's, which also hired McKinsey &amp; Co. to help boost
stockholder value, is fighting a move by two real estate
investors to replace its board.
   Advance Ross, which holds 13.7% of NaTec Resources' shares
outstanding, jumped 1 1/2 to 11 1/4 after NaTec said it
agreed to acquire the metal-fabrication concern in a
stock-swap. Houston-based NaTec, a pollution-control company,
eased 1/8 to 4 1/4. Advance Ross said Tuesday that it hired
an investment firm to explore ways to enhance shareholder
value.
   The American Depositary Receipts of Reuters Holdings
tumbled 2 1/8 to 43 1/2 on more than one million issues.
Reuters Ltd., the trading subsidiary of the London news and
information services concern, said it bought UpLink Ltd., a
specialized satellite service operator.
   ViCorp Restaurants and SciMed Life Systems fell after
"sell" recommendations on both stocks were issued throughout
the week by Stan Weinstein, editor and publisher of The
Professional Tape Reader, Hollywood, Fla. Mr. Weinstein said
in an interview that he isn't aware of any fundamental
problems with either company.
   But he recommended investors sell the stocks based on a
technical analysis indicating that both shares have become
pricey relative to the market and are vulnerable to
profit-taking. ViCorp, he noted, is in the lagging restaurant
sector. ViCorp fell 2 to 17 1/4 and SciMed Life Systems
tumbled 2 1/4 to 28 1/4.
   Oil-Dri Corp. of America's Class A shares slipped 1 3/8 to
20 7/8. Shortly before the market closed, the maker of cat
litter reported that net income for the fourth quarter ended
July 31 rose to 25 cents a share from 18 cents. Profit thus
was slightly below one analyst's estimate of 28 cents
reported by First Call, a unit of Thomson Financial Networks.
Oil-Dri's full-year earnings of $1 a share were only one cent
shy of an analyst's estimate.
   Shares of several companies that reported bad news earlier
this week continued to slide. Stokely USA, which expects a
drop in fiscal second-quarter earnings, tumbled 2 1/8 to 10
7/8 after Tuesday's 3 1/8-point drop. The stock's 52-week
high was 24.
   G-III Apparel slid 1 1/4 to a new 52-week low 5 3/4, well
below its 52-week high of 21 1/4. Monday, the New York
retailer said that two class-action suits were filed against
it alleging certain securities laws violations.
   Shares of two northeastern financial institutions extended
their losses. Hamptons Bancshares dropped 3/4 to 6 1/4.
Monday, the Southampton, N.Y., financial institution said it
temporarily suspended its quarterly dividend. Newmil Bancorp
of New Milford, Conn., fell 1/2 to 2 1/2. Tuesday, Newmil
said that an extraordinary provision for loan losses will
eliminate its earnings for the first quarter ending Sept. 30.
Newmil also suspended its quarterly dividend of 15 cents a
share.
   Occupational-Urgent Care Health skidded 1 1/4 to 18 3/4
after Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Dirk Godsey cut his earnings
estimates for the Sacramento, Calif., company. Mr. Godsey
maintains a "buy" opinion on the provider of medical cost
containment and managed care programs, but lowered his third-
and fourth-quarter earnings estimates.

   So Says Their Growing Band

   OFF LONG BRANCH, N.J. -- If sharks wrote novels, Richard
Bruno might be cast as the villain of one called "Hooks."
   Here he is aboard his fishing vessel Gannet in the
Atlantic Ocean, in sight of the Manhattan skyline, winching
in a seven-mile length of monofilament line tied with 800
baited hooks, each one intended to turn a guileless shark
into somebody's dinner.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite sharks' vile public image, Mr. Bruno has his
detractors -- people who are "trying to give sharks a
personality and make us look like the sharks," Mr. Bruno
says. "But no amount of propaganda will make sharks any less
aggressive, fierce predators."
   Shark propaganda? Its time has come. The pro-shark folks
are on the rise.
   Most pro-sharkers concede that sharks aren't cuddly
creatures (although Stuart Cove, owner of Nassau Undersea
Adventures in the Bahamas, takes divers out three times a
week to ride, pet and hug sharks. "We refer to them as puppy
dogs," he says.) Shark fans do say that "negative
interactions" between man and shark -- shark attacks, to the
unenlightened -- are vastly exaggerated in number and
seriousness. Sharks, these people say, are just as worthy of
protection as their cutesy, warm-blooded neighbors, like
dolphins and whales.
   Sharks, they say, need compassion and understanding.
   The movement has risen in part as a response to a
government program begun several years ago encouraging
professional fishermen like Mr. Bruno to harvest the
underutilized meat and fins of shark.
   Demand for shark fins, used as an ingredient in shark-fin
soup, an Oriental delicacy, has soared. Shark meat, once
disguised under names such as flake and steak fish, has
become an acceptable alternative to higher-priced tuna and
swordfish. Fishermen say they get $2 to $2.50 a pound at the
dock for prized mako shark steak and about 50 cents a pound
for the less desirable species. A shark fin brings $5 to $10
a pound. The Fulton Fish Market Retail Store at the South
Street Seaport in New York sells mako shark to consumers at
$5.95 a pound, swordfish at $8.95 a pound and tuna at $9.95 a
pound.
   Conservationists, fearing for the shark's survival, are
trying to burnish the predator's image with position papers,
newsletters, exhibits and documentaries. "Sharks are really
very timid animals," says Quenton Dokken, executive director
of the Texas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi. "They aren't
the bloodthirsty mankillers they are made out to be."
   Sportfishermen are concerned about sharks, too. At
Hoffman's Anchorage in Brielle, N.J., the shark angling has
grown so poor, presumably from overfishing, that the marina's
annual shark tournaments have been canceled. "Fishermen are
bummed out," says Todd Colabella, the dockmaster. Mark
Quartiano, a Miami charter boat captain, says that fewer
customers are keeping sharks to be mounted as trophies. "They
feel sorry for them," he says. Mr. Quartiano has lately been
dispatching cameramen into the water to videotape customers'
catches and their release.
   Even Peter Benchley, author of "Jaws," has some sympathy
for sharks. "I don't feel any more guilty about `Jaws' than
Mario Puzo should feel about `The Godfather,'" he says, but
he adds that he has narrated shark documentaries with a
conservationist slant and now writes novels that "portray
animals as victims and man as the predator."
   Sharks' low reproductive rate and slow growth to maturity
make them particularly vulnerable to overfishing. "Tuna, cod
and striped bass can lay millions of eggs and rebound very
quickly," says Jack Musick, head of the fisheries section at
the College of William and Mary's Virginia Institute of
Marine Science. "But once sharks are overfished, you can kiss
them goodbye."
   The National Marine Fisheries Service is preparing a plan
to protect sharks by imposing on Gulf and East Coast shark
fishermen permit requirements, catch limits and a ban on the
killing of sharks for their fins alone. Some states,
including North Carolina, are adopting their own shark
protection plans.
   Conservationists are trying to rally public support. That
may be hard. Says David Doubilet, an underwater photographer
for National Geographic magazine: "Sharks, to be quite
honest, are cold fish." Mr. Doubilet says the shark's
efficiency makes it a fitting symbol of our age. "When you
look into a shark's eye, it's really like looking into the
depths of a machine rather than looking into the depths of a
creature," he says.
   Still, "sharks simply try do the best in their
environment, which is what we all do," says Mimi Armstrong,
member of a husband-wife film company in Los Angeles called
SafeSharks Inc.
   Others are going further on behalf of the shark. Eugenie
Clark, a zoology professor at the University of Maryland,
says she frequently swims right alongside sharks. And once,
she reached out from her protective cage and petted a great
white shark -- the "Jaws" species -- as it passed. "It is
safer to swim with sharks than drive your car on the
highway," she says.
   Environmental groups, including the National Audubon
Society and Greenpeace, are launching their own campaigns to
save the shark. Sid Clark, the managing editor of Chondros, a
newsletter about sharks and their relatives, is firing off
letters to set straight the makers of games, movies, toys,
books and foods that perpetuate a negative view of sharks.
   One of his targets is General Mills Inc., which asks
children to eat its Shark Bites candies, "before they eat
you]" Barry Wegener, a public-relations manager at General
Mills, says that "to portray the shark as other than what it
is is an injustice to sharks and to the profession of public
relations."
   Samuel Gruber, a professor of marine biology at the
University of Miami, praises sharks' importance as
scavengers, ridding the oceans of weak and dying creatures;
their resistance to cancer; their keen sense of smell, and
their ability to detect weak electric fields. But there is no
denying, adds Mr. Gruber, that one of sharks' most awesome
features is the power of their teeth and jaws. "Their bite
looks like the impression left by an ice cream scoop," he
says. "Bones and all go neatly away. It's a terrible,
terrible sight."
   That sort of negative interaction, says George Burgess,
senior biologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History at
Gainesville, Fla., and keeper of the International Shark
Attack File, mostly occurs in murky, turbulent water where
sharks can easily mistake humans for their normal prey. He
says that sharks wound just 50 to 75 people around the world
in an average year, only 20% of them mortally.
   None of this sits too well with sharkhaters. "I hear about
shark numbers dwindling, and it just makes me a little more
comfortable in the water," says Dean Schoonover, a New Jersey
surfer.
   Mr. Bruno, 49 years old, who built boats for a living
before turning to shark fishing, makes his distaste clear,
too. As he pulls in a six-foot sandbar shark, its jaws
clutching a smaller shark that had taken hook and bait, he
says: "Nice guys. They eat their own kind." Today the Gannet
catches only seven sharks, but on better days the catch
exceeds 40. "There is a staggering amount of sharks out
here," he says. "I'm having a field day."
   Mr. Bruno's crewmen grab the sandbar shark with big steel
hooks to avoid its snapping jaws and ease it on deck next to
butchered shark corpses. "Look at the mouth on that critter,"
Mr. Bruno says. "He'll take off your arm in one bite]"
   Right on, says Bernard Leroy, owner of Bernard's Cafe News
in New York, which sells a lot of shark dinners. "You always
try to eat what you want to be," Mr. Leroy says. "The shark
is the ultimate capitalist animal. It eats other animals to
become bigger and bigger."

   Your Aug. 10 editorial "The Forgotten Ally" was a welcome
recognition of Turkey's unflinching defense of Western
interests. Turkey has been a staunch ally since the formation
of the Turkish republic following World War I. Shutting off
the Iraqi pipeline without even a blink and immediately
beginning the embargo against Iraq is yet another example of
Turkey's devotion to Western ideals.
   That the path taken by Turkey is an extremely costly one
both for the short term and for the long haul is
unquestioned. A casual look at the map reveals that Turkey
has enjoyed a trusting relationship with Iraq. Why would Iraq
build a pipeline that goes north for miles to enter Turkey
before heading west to reach the Mediterranean when a much
shorter route was available directly west through Syria? The
Iraqis trusted their lifeline to the dependable Turks in
preference to their fellow Arabs, the Syrians. Aside from the
immediate loss of $2 billion to $3 billion a year in business
with Iraq and $3 billion in back payments, Turkey faces an
uncertain future with its erstwhile trusting neighbor.

   Following your laudatory editorial, you became the target
(not unexpectedly) of anti-Turkish voices emanating from
individuals with Greek surnames (Letters, Aug. 30). Turkey's
alliance with the West is anathema to these folks who are
still fighting World War I against the Ottoman Empire. Every
time somebody says something nice about Turkey, they come out
slinging mud, with misstated facts, exaggerated half-truths
and absolute lies.
   For the record, Turkey did not invade Cyprus. Turkey
fulfilled its lawful obligation, as Greece and Britain could
also have done, to protect the integrity of Cyprus, which had
fallen into the hands of the military junta then ruling
Greece. Ironically, the Turkish action benefited Greece
immensely by giving the junta a bloody nose and opening the
way for democracy to return to its birthplace in Athens.
   For the record, torture is not condoned in Turkey. It is
against the law. What we call police brutality, illegally
practiced by certain overzealous officers in the U.S.,
becomes government-sanctioned torture in Turkey as related by
those who are still fighting World War I.
   For the record, there were no pogroms in Turkey to
diminish the minority populations. Any non-Turkish citizen of
Turkey who left Turkey left for the same reason we Turks left
-- to seek better economic opportunities abroad.

   Your editorial stated, "The Senate passes resolutions
wallowing in the Armenian tragedies of the old Ottoman
Empire. . . ." I resent the use of the term, "wallowing" and
wonder whether my Jewish friends have been wallowing also in
the tragedies of the Holocaust.
   Any infection, left untreated, continues to be destructive
to the body. Any conflict, left unresolved, continues to
erupt in strife. Any tragedy, left unrecognized, continues to
haunt future generations. Oedipus or the Old Testament
stories of David and Absalom (to name a few literary sources)
are but a reminder of such truths.

   Venture With NKK

   PITTSBURGH -- National Steel Corp., NKK Corp. of Japan and
Dofasco Inc. of Canada agreed to build a $200 million steel
galvanizing line, in what is believed to be the first
steel-related venture involving three countries.
   The multination project could launch a new round of joint
agreements in the U.S., where such relationships have
consisted mainly of Japanese-American partnerships. "This is
a model for global cooperation and in that sense is an
extremely important milestone," said John Jacobson, an
analyst with AUS Consultants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He noted that such ventures should help steelmakers'
viability by reducing the potential for excess capacity,
which has been the industry's nemesis. "There are too many
players for each company to do its own thing," he said.
   The plant, scheduled for completion by early 1993, will
produce about 400,000 tons of hot-dip coated steel annually
for the automotive market. Although a site hasn't been
selected for this venture, the plant will likely be built
along the U.S.-Canadian border, close to auto makers in
Detroit. The site must also be close to National Steel and
Dofasco plants, each of which will supply 50% of the raw
steel.
   High-quality, corrosion resistant coated steel has been
the industry's darling in recent years, with steelmakers
rushing to add lines. The electrogalvanizing coating process
has been considered superior to hot-dip because the first
process covers steel more uniformly, which is essential for
exposed car panels. However, the hot-dip process has improved
in terms of consistency and is making a comeback because it's
cheaper and more flexible.
   The flurry to build coating lines could create a glut in
the next few years. John Lichtenstein, a director at Beddows
Co., an international consulting firm, believes demand for
coated steel will grow for both automotive and construction
markets. Whether supply exceeds demand, he said, depends
largely on the ability of Japanese auto transplants to expand
the U.S. car market, as opposed to supplanting U.S. auto
makers.
   NKK will supply equipment and provide technical and
operational assistance, patterning the plant after one of its
Japanese facilities. Dofasco and National Steel will each
market and distribute one-half of the total output to their
existing automotive customers.
   Dofasco will own 50% of the venture, NKK 40%, and National
Steel, which is 70%-owned by NKK, will own the remaining 10%.
Ben J. Ciprietti, vice president, planning of Dofasco, will
be president, while a NKK director and two National Steel
executives will be directors.

   In his book review of "A Literary Guide to Science"
(Leisure &amp; Arts, Aug. 17), Jim Holt writes: "A particularly
unattractive physicist named Otto Warburg accepts the status
of `honorary Aryan' from the Nazis so that he can remain in
his Berlin laboratory even though he is half Jewish."
   The Otto Warburg to whom Mr. Holt refers was of course not
a physicist but a biochemist, indeed the most notable
biochemist of his time, perhaps of any time. The body of work
for which he received a Nobel Prize includes his famous
determination of the action spectrum of the "respiratory
enzyme." This was not only a technical tour de force but also
on the purely aesthetic level one of the most beautiful
experiments of the 20th century.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Warburg is the subject of a brief, highly readable
biography "Otto Warburg: Cell Physiologist, Biochemist and
Eccentric" (Oxford University Press, 1981) by Sir Hans Krebs.
Sir Hans, himself a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist, was a
Jewish scientist forced to flee to England from the Nazi
butchers. He knew Warburg as well as anyone could claim to
know him, having worked for some years in Warburg's
institute. His criticism of certain aspects of Warburg's
personality and career is unsparing but he is also generous
in his admiration of Warburg's genius and his devotion to
science.

   Court Allows Officials
   To Pursue Nevada Site
   For Nuclear Dumping

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled Wednesday that federal energy officials may pursue
Nevada as a potential nuclear waste dump site, despite the
state Legislature's adamant opposition.
   The uananimous court decision allows government officials
to proceed with a massive environmental study of Nevada's
Yucca Mountain, about one hundreds miles northeast of Las
Vegas, as a burial site for radioactive wastes. The state has
mounted several legal challenges to the federal plan since
1987, and the state Legislature has passed hostile
resolutions and refused to supply the government with
necessary environmental permits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The three-judge panel rejected state arguments that the
federal government was violating constitutional protections
of state rights, as well as provisions of the U.S. Nuclear
Waste Policy Act. The state attorney general had argued in
August before the court that Congress failed to override
Nevada's disapproval notice within the 90 days required under
the 1982 act.
   In his decision, federal Judge Arthur Alarcon asserted
that the U.S. energy secretary was correct in arguing that
the U.S. Constitutions's 10th amendment "does not protect a
state from being outvoted in Congress."
   Originally the federal government was considering five
sites in Mississippi, Utah, Texas, Washington and Nevada.
Since 1987, the government has narrowed the list to three --
in Hannaford, Wash., Deafsmith, Texas, and Yucca Mountain --
and more recently dropped all but the Nevada location.
   Nevada can appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court
or ask the appellate court for reconsideration. State Deputy
Attorney General Harry Swainston wouldn't say whether the
state will appeal until he reads the decision. But in August,
state Attorney General Brian McKay vowed "to use every tool
possible" to keep the dump site out of the state.
   The federal energy officials have said that its "site
verification study" would take about six to ten years to
complete. So far, government researchers have bored several
exploratory holes in the mountainside, but their work largely
halted in the face of state resistance.

<LP>
   In your Aug. 17 page-one article "Comeback Story: Reborn
Ohio Industry Is Clean, High-Tech and Shock-Absorbent," the
idea that "Manufacturing has come roaring back" seems overly
optimistic, when one checks the official figures. According
to the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Commerce
Department, in 1969 Ohio ranked 15th among the states in
per-capita personal income. By 1988 -- the latest year for
which comparable figures are available -- Ohio's rank was
down to 24th. The bureau projected a further drop to 25 by
the year 2000.
   Over a period of decades Ohio has been gaining in low-wage
and part-time jobs, while losing many thousands of high-wage,
full-time jobs. In 1969, for example, employment in
manufacturing industries in Ohio averaged 1,471,000. By 1989
that level had dropped to 1,123,000 -- a loss of 348,000
jobs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Production workers in Ohio manufacturing industries
averaged $523 a week in 1989. Had the 1969 level of factory
employment been achieved in 1989, personal income of Ohioans
would have been greater by at least $10 billion.

   Payout for Airline Shuttle
   Is Due in Three Weeks;
   Bailout Pact Seems Safe

   Less than a month after concluding a $65 million bank
bailout, Donald J. Trump returned to his bankers to seek a
delay in loan payments due on the Trump Shuttle airline.
   Mr. Trump and two aides met yesterday with officials from
Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, which issued the shuttle loan,
to ask the bank to restructure $245 million in debt payments
still due, saying soaring fuel costs and a soft Northeast
economy have made the airline unprofitable. The next payment,
about $1.1 million, is due in three weeks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Citibank executive said the bank was scheduled to
communicate last night with about 20 banks that purchased
pieces of the shuttle loan and urge them to allow Mr. Trump
to defer interest and principal payments.
   "This isn't about being mad at Donald," said a Citibank
official. "We have to look at this and analyze it in an
unemotional manner."
   Should the participants not agree to go along with a
deferral of interest, Mr. Trump could lose control of the
shuttle, which he bought in 1989 while taking on $380 million
in debt. However, under Mr. Trump's multibank bailout
agreement, a default on the shuttle wouldn't necessarily
trigger a default of the entire agreement, which allows Mr.
Trump to defer interest on almost $1 billion of his $2
billion in bank debt. The accord doesn't cover $1.2 billion
of casino bonds that will most likely be restructured in the
coming months.
   Under the bank deal, Mr. Trump agreed to continue payments
on $245 million in debt issued by Citibank. An additional
$135 million unsecured loan from Citibank and participants
has already been deferred under the deal.
   While Mr. Trump probably will be able to meet the
forthcoming $1.1 million payment, he is not expected to be
able to keep up with the payments due in the next 12 months,
said Stephen Bollenbach, chief financial officer of the Trump
Organization. Those payments are expected to total about $30
million.
   "We don't owe a huge amount right now but we need to
maintain our ability to run the company," Mr. Bollenbach
said. In addition to Messrs. Bollenbach and Trump, Trump
Shuttle President Richard Cozzi attended the meeting with
Citibank officials.
   A Citibank official said last month's shuttle ridership
was off 16% from August 1989. In recent weeks, fuel costs
have risen to 95 cents a gallon from about 50 cents a gallon.
Trump executives are said to believe that matters will not
improve within the next few months.
   Convincing the participants in the bank loan to give Mr.
Trump more time may be difficult. Many of the banks were
reluctant to join August's bank bailout and did so only after
Trump officials assured them that their payments would
continue.
   "The ink isn't even dry yet on the last agreement," said
one individual from a Japanese bank that purchased a piece of
the shuttle loan. As of yesterday, that bank had not been
contacted either by Trump officials or by Citibank officials.
   Mr. Bollenbach said he was sympathetic with the banks'
unhappiness over recent developments. "The situation has
degenerated so quickly that what someone told them a month
ago looks silly by now," he said.

   ABC Rides Radio Waves to Tout
   Three of Its Fall TV Programs

   In an effort to add a new twist to the old tactic of radio
promotion, the ABC network plans an aggressive campaign in
five big U.S. markets designed to woo coveted 18-to-34
year-old viewers to three of its fall TV programs.
   The radio campaign, which is just now getting under way,
involves elaborate deals with popular radio personalities who
have agreed to host offbeat, sometimes gimmicky, special
events and award prizes such as a "Twin Peaks" T-shirt, a
"Cop Rock" cap or a "China Beach" cassette tape.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All of the networks air radio ads and run promotions to
pitch their shows. But ABC says its promotion is different
from other networks' "watch and win" ads, which award prizes
to TV viewers who can answer trivia questions about their
shows. ABC says its promotions, instead, have been designed
to create long-term interest by playing on the shows'
creative appeal.
   "It's an extension of the entertainment," says Mark
Zakarin, vice president of marketing at ABC Entertainment.
"This isn't `We're going to give you something just so you'll
watch it.'"
   The promotions are different in each market. In Chicago,
for example, radio station WKQX will host an event to promote
"Twin Peaks" called "Hide the Body." Chicagoans driving to
work will be challenged to locate a local radio personality
who is wrapped in plastic and hiding somewhere in the city.
The other markets are New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and
San Francisco.
   Executives at rival network CBS scoffed at the plan,
saying the Capital Cities/ABC network is just scrambling to
play catch-up because it doesn't have a link with a major
retailer or fast-food chain to boost its fall-season
fortunes. CBS is in the midst of a giant promotion with K
mart; General Electric's NBC has linked with McDonald's.
   "We all do very aggressive local marketing," says George
Schweitzer, senior vice president at CBS. "Radio was very
effective in helping `Uncle Buck' beat `The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air' {on NBC} this week."
   John D. Miller, executive vice president of marketing at
NBC, said his network, too, has explored the options of
expanded radio promotions. "At this point, the networks are
looking at every possible vehicle to reach a consumer that's
going to watch TV. We're all screaming loud in as many places
as we can."
   Mr. Zakarin insists the ABC promotions are different
because they are so highly targeted and are designed to build
enthusiasm among specific viewer prospects. ABC developed the
program with its ad agency, Grey Advertising, and Local
Marketing Corp. of Cincinnati.
   Further, he says the real value of the program is in the
"stamp of editorial endorsement" that the shows will get from
the radio personalities, who will talk about the shows on the
air. "People spend time every morning on their way to work
listening to these personalities and they have an important
connection with them. It's kind of akin to when Johnny Carson
on `The Tonight Show' says something positive about a movie
he recently saw."
   ABC has been an outspoken critic of the giant
cross-promotions the other networks have coordinated. "Our
research indicated that there was only a negligible increase
in sampling as a result of those cross promotions" last year,
Mr. Zakarin says. "With those promotions, you end up spending
an awful lot of air time not promoting your shows, but
promoting contests."
   New CBS shows attracted lots of viewers early in the fall
of 1989 following the network's first promotion with K mart.
But later, the network had its worst showing ever in the
critical November "sweeps" rating period, suggesting viewers
watched some shows once or twice, but then left in droves.
   For now, Mr. Zakarin is betting the targeted radio
promotions will help to stir up grassroots support for the
shows. TV ads are still the network's best weapon for
promoting shows, he says, "but you have to speak to the
audience very directly at the local level, too."

   Saatchi Stays Put
                                                                                                       

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. broke off talks with Canadian
developer Olympia &amp; York about moving its flagship London
agency to Canary Wharf, a huge office development on the
Thames.
   Some analysts believed the cash-strapped communications
giant might reap savings of up to #10 million ($19.1 million)
by relocating the Charlotte Street agency. Olympia &amp; York,
owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, has had trouble
attracting tenants to Canary Wharf.
   Saatchi decided on Friday that any potential savings
wouldn't be enough to offset initial costs and opposition
from staff and clients to an inconvenient move, analysts
reported. A Saatchi spokesman said the company had decided
against a Canary Wharf move until further notice.
   Analysts predicted Saatchi instead might raise nearly $500
million by selling Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide, one of
its two international ad groups. Chief Executive Robert
Louis-Dreyfus insists the network isn't for sale -- despite
unsolicited approaches recently from two large French
agencies, Eurocom S.A. and Roux, Seguela, Cayzac &amp; Goudard.
Ad industry executives say that, privately, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus
is shopping for a buyer and the Eurocom discussions may turn
serious.
   The Saatchi spokesman also declined to comment on British
press reports that the company is mulling a debt-for-equity
swap to cancel a European convertible preference issue. The
issue could cost Saatchi as much as #211 million when it
comes due in 1993.

   WATCH ACCOUNT: Tag-Heuer SA, a Swiss watch manufacturer,
awarded its $5 million U.S. ad account to Wells, Rich,
Greene, New York. The account had been handled by Ammirati &amp;
Puris, also of New York. The move consolidates Tag-Heuer's
world-wide advertising: French agency BDDP, which owns a 40%
stake in Wells Rich, continues as the world-wide agency of
record for the watch manufacturer.
                                                                                                       

   JOINT VENTURE: Ketchum International, a unit of Ketchum
Communications, Pittsburgh, formed a joint venture with
Adplus, a Korean advertising agency. Terms weren't disclosed.
The new company, called Adplus Ketchum, will be headed by
Frank Lee, executive vice president of Adplus.
                                                                                                       

   BELATED SAATCHI EXIT: Two top Saatchi &amp; Saatchi executives
dismissed last spring finally completed a settlement with the
company on Friday. The deal, originally expected in late
July, gives Roy Warman and Terry Bannister freedom to operate
their own agency while they remain long-term Saatchi
consultants. But the settlement omits any big cash payments,
knowledgeable observers say.

   Latvia says it sighted two Iraqi missile ships training
with their Soviet teachers in the waters just off Bolderaja,
a suburb of Riga. Latvia's independence-minded government
immediately passed a resolution condemning the event and
demanded that all Iraqi soldiers "leave the territory of the
republic of Latvia." Moscow itself has said it would continue
to honor some old "contracts" with Iraq. We suppose that in
the larger geopolitical picture, the impact of a Baltic
republic's criticism of landlocked Iraq's navy doesn't loom
large. But as the West sorts out the question of who its new
friends are, it's worth noting that the Latvians had little
trouble deciding whose side they're on.

at the low end of analysts' forecasts and announced top
management changes, including the "retirement" of company
co-founder Michael DeAngelo.
   Mr. DeAngelo, 41 years old, had been chairman and chief
executive officer of the Anaheim, Calif., retailer for most
of the time since he, his father August, his brother Raymond,
and John Ortega founded the company in the mid 1970s.

<TEXT>
   Michael DeAngelo remains a director and will spend a
couple of days a week at Clothestime as a part-time employee.
Raymond DeAngelo, 38, succeeds his brother as chief
executive. He remains vice chairman. Mr. Ortega, 41, formerly
vice chairman, assumes the chairman post.
   John Shanklin, 50, resigned as chief financial officer to
pursue other interests, Clothestime said. He "has something
lined up in a better capacity at another company," said David
Sejpal, corporate controller and acting financial officer.
Mr. Shanklin was on vacation and couldn't be reached.
   Mr. Sejpal said that Michael DeAngelo retired to spend
more time with his family. "He started working in flea
markets when he was 19 -- he hasn't taken many vacations and
he's tired." Mr. DeAngelo wasn't in the office yesterday and
didn't respond to a request for an interview.
   Mr. DeAngelo's retirement wasn't prompted by criticism of
his recent company stock sales, Mr. Sejpal said. "In
hindsight, it appears that Mike was planning his retirement
and was liquidating his founder's stock." Mr. Sejpal said he
wasn't aware of any investigations of the stock sales.
   The executive sold almost 60% of his holdings in the
company for $2 to $3.75 apiece between July 23 and
mid-September. Between October and December last year he sold
763,467 shares at $4.75 to $9.38 apiece. The retailer's
shares have plummeted from a high of $13.875 late last year.
   Yesterday, Clothestime shares rose 12.5 cents to $2.125 in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Clothestime said it expects profit of one cent a share to
five cents a share in its fiscal year ending Jan. 26. In
fiscal 1990, the company posted net income of $461,000, or
three cents a share.
   Mr. Sejpal said the company's new forecast allows for the
possibility of a small second-half loss. For the six months
ended July 28, Clothestime reported net income of $100,000,
or one cent a share.
   "Half way through (the third quarter), so far we are
looking at a slight profit," Mr. Sejpal said.
   Clothestime cited stiffer competition and a recent
slowdown in consumer spending. Clothestime and some other
discount retailers have been squeezed as department stores
cut prices. Clothestime is "downscaling" its merchandise
somewhat to attact customers who want lower prices, Mr.
Sejpal said. With $10 million in cash or cash equivalents,
the company is financially strong, he added.

   NEW YORK -- Pessimism about the outlook for interest
rates, the economy and corporate earnings took its toll on
the stock market, as prices fell in moderate trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 13.86 to 2557.43,
as selling produced sharp setbacks in Merck, General Electric
and Primerica.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among broader indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
dropped 2.00 to 316.60, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index dropped 0.97 to 173.91 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index fell 1.78 to 293.30.
   Declining issues topped advancers by 883 to 599 on the Big
Board, where the pace of trading improved modestly. About
147,530,000 shares changed hands in New York Stock Exchange
trading, compared with 141,130,000 shares Tuesday.
   Trading is expected to swell tomorrow as the result of
activity stemming from the quarterly expiration of
stock-index futures and options -- also known as the "triple
witching hour."
   Stocks held firm as the latest session began, but fell
after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's
testimony before a congressional panel damped speculation
that the central bank would soon ease its monetary policy in
order to revive the economy.
   "People were looking to get some inspiration" from Mr.
Greenspan, said John A. Conlon Jr., a managing director at
Rothschild Inc. But the Fed chairman said any shifts in
central-bank policy would depend on factors "which are
shifting day by day."
   Also, Mr. Greenspan noted that inflation hasn't eased
despite sluggishness in the economy and that weakness in the
dollar could produce further inflationary pressures.
   Merck fell 3 1/8 to 76 7/8 in composite trading of 2.9
million shares after Vector Securities, a Deerfield, Ill.,
investment concern specializing in health-care stocks,
downgraded the issue and lowered its long-term projection for
profit growth at the company to 15% from 18%.
   Analyst Patricia Padgett Lea said that conversations with
doctors involved in the clinical trials of Proscar, Merck's
prostate drug, had led her to conclude it will be only a
"marginal drug," rather than the blockbuster many had
expected.
   Merck, which said it expects the results from the trials
to be released early next year, wouldn't comment on its
financial expectations for the drug. But Ms. Lea said annual
sales could eventually reach $200 million, rather than the $1
billion or more projected.
   MBIA fell 3 3/8 to 28 1/2 on 1.2 million shares,
reflecting concerns about the possible impact of the city of
Philadelphia's financial troubles on the municipal
bond-insurance firm. The company, whose shares skidded 3 1/2
Tuesday, said it has about $9 million of exposure to the city
next year. MBIA also disclosed that it is reinstituting a
program to repurchase up to one million common shares.
   GE, the parent company of municipal bond insurer FGIC
Corp., went down 2 1/2 to 56 1/8 and led the list of most
active issues as three million shares changed hands.
Primerica dropped 1 7/8 to 21 1/4 on 1.4 million shares;
Federal National Mortgage Association, another
financial-services issue, dipped 1 to 26 1/2 on 2.5 million
shares.
   American General plummeted 6 3/8 to 33 5/8 on two million
shares after the company's board cleared management to
consider a restructuring plan -- involving the sale of its
home-service insurance operations -- as an alternative to
selling the company.
   Stocks depressed by lowered earnings expectations included
Claire's Stores, which skidded 3 3/8 to 12 in active trading;
Lowe's, which dropped 1 1/2 to 21 1/2; Armstrong World
Industries, which went down 2 to 27; and Pitney Bowes, which
fell 4 1/8 to 30 1/8.
   Claire's fell after Alex. Brown &amp; Sons lowered the
company's earnings estimate for the current fiscal year to a
range of $1.20 to $1.25 a share, from $1.30 a share, citing a
slowdown over the past few weeks in sales growth at stores
open at least a year. The firm also downgraded the stock to
"buy" from "strong buy."
   Prudential-Bache Securities lowered its fiscal 1991 and
1992 earnings projections on Lowe's, citing a softening
economy and other concerns, and cut its investment rating to
"sell" from "hold."
   Kidder Peabody reduced its 1991 forecast on Armstrong
World by 90 cents a share, to $3, and downgraded the issue to
"underperformer" from "hold." Analyst Barbara K. Allen said
the company faces "a period of turmoil" in the flooring
industry, stemming from new products introduced earlier this
week by a competitor, Mannington Mills.
   Pitney Bowes, in disclosing plans to stop remanufacturing
used copier equipment, said it expects this year's net income
to fall short of the year-earlier level. The company said its
decision to scrap its remanufacturing business would result
in a third-quarter pretax charge of about $86 million.
   Occidental Petroleum retreated 1 3/8 to 21 3/8 on 2.6
million shares and traded as low as 20 1/4, a 52-week low,
amid rumors that the company would lower its dividend.
Occidental denied the speculation.
   Waste Management, whose board approved the repurchase of
up to 25 million shares over the next 24 months, advanced 1/2
to 34 5/8 on 1.4 million shares. The total represents about
5% of its shares outstanding.
   Other active issues to advance amid the broad market's
retreat included International Business Machines, which added
1 1/8 to 108 3/8 on 2.2 million shares; Philip Morris, which
went up 7/8 to 46 on three million shares; and Eastman Kodak,
which rose 1/2 to 42 1/8 on 1.6 million shares.
   Quaker Oats jumped 2 3/8 to 45 5/8 amid speculation that
the company would receive a takeover offer from Coca-Cola,
which dropped 1 1/2 to 39 3/4. A Coca-Cola spokesman
dismissed the rumor, calling it "totally ridiculous."
   Corroon &amp; Black skidded 3 1/2 to 32. Aon reiterated that
it won't pursue a hostile offer for the company, which
rejected its $40-a-share offer in favor of proceeding with a
stock-swap merger with Willis Faber, a British insurance
broker.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.72
to 318.97. Volume totaled 10,270,000 shares.

   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. -- FarWest Financial Corp., buffeted
by recent losses and tough new regulatory capital standards,
said Fred Kayne resigned as president, chief executive
officer and a director.
   Mr. Kayne, a former Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. managing director
who has been president and chief executive of FarWest since
February 1988, said the decision wasn't related to FarWest's
problems. Rather, he cited the thrift-bailout law last year,
which greatly limited diversification opportunities for
thrifts and meant that "I could not be involved in expanding
the company."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kayne, who will continue as a part-time consultant,
said he plans to spend more time managing his own
investments.
   The S&amp;L holding company is controlled by the Belzberg
family of Canada, and William Belzberg will continue as
chairman. Mr. Kayne said he didn't know of any plans to name
a new president and chief executive to succeed him.
   FarWest reported a net loss of $3.7 million, or 47 cents a
share, for the second quarter. Last month, federal thrift
regulators subjected its FarWest Savings &amp; Loan Association
subsidiary to a number of operating restrictions after
rejecting a plan by the thrift to bring its capital levels
into compliance with regulatory standards.
   Among other factors, FarWest, a major junk-bond investor,
has been hurt in recent months by the declining junk-bond
market.

   Central Plan or No, Moscow Believes
   It Still Knows Best What Ivan Needs

   MOSCOW -- Central planning may be passe, but it isn't
dead. As the Kremlin prepares to introduce a market economy
soon, even the most capitalist-minded of the proposed reform
ideas will tell Soviet consumers what their minimum needs are
supposed to be.
   Current shortages are bad enough. But under proposed
guidelines, the average working-age man may soon be entitled
to an annual allotment -- at subsidized prices -- of only one
toothbrush, two ties and five rolls of toilet paper.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These meager rations are part of a "minimum consumer
budget" drawn up last year by the State Labor Committee. They
will serve as a basis for a new basket of necessities that
would continue to have government subsidies under the most
radical of the proposed economic reform programs. Everything
not on the list will have to be purchased -- at much greater
expense -- on the open market.
   That reform program is one of three now under debate in
the Soviet parliament. Authored by economist Stanislav
Shatalin, and backed by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
and Russian Republic leader Boris Yeltsin, it starts with
fiscal austerity and moves on to sweeping privatization and
decentralization -- all in just 500 days. The other programs
include a modified version of the Shatalin program, and a
slower-paced government proposal that starts with price
increases on consumer products and calls for less
privatization and partial decentralization.
   The necessities list dissects all daily physical, mental
and emotional needs, giving a picture of Ivan Ivanovich's
life in the course of a year. That includes an egg every 2
1/2 days, and four visits to museums and 12 condoms a year.
   The promise of fixed prices is small consolation for
consumers already unable to buy these items in the nation's
stores. There has been a gasoline shortage for weeks. Vodka,
the Russian cure for all ills, is practically a luxury. Even
eggs are disappearing.
   Shortages come and go as if by magic. There was no soap
last year; now there's a surplus. The list of minimum needs
includes a weekly bath at a little more than two ounces of
bath soap a splash.
   Then tobacco disappeared, giving the nation's heavy
smokers something else to fume about. Rationing was imposed,
limiting everyone to five packs a month. A black market in
ration coupons sprang up and the price of cigarettes tripled.
   Then, suddenly, there was no bread. It was worst of all in
Moscow, but fear of shortages spread instantly and within two
days, lines formed at bread shops in the Soviet Far East. The
official explanation was the lack of labor and machinery, and
greedy grain farmers who refused to provide the cities with
their harvests.
   But within a week, the bread shortage was gone. The
selection isn't quite what it used to be, but most shops have
at least two types of bread; some even have rolls and buns.
Lines are back to normal.
   This haphazardness feeds the feeling that the economy is
falling out of control. As the government argues over how to
change the economy, it must also struggle to control the
current situation. That is made harder by a widespread belief
that the shortages are a conspiracy by hardliners to
undermine economic reform.
   Rationing is the simplest way to restore control. It
usually calms the fury over shortages because it helps
regulate sales. Everything from flour to sausage is rationed
in Moscow and many other parts of the country. The sale of
such items is limited, and shoppers must show their
resident's card. When the cigarette shortage hit, Moscow's
Mayor Gavriil Popov told smokers to use their December sugar
coupons to buy tobacco in September.
   One Muscovite complains that her tobacconist won't sell
cigarettes to women. Another shopper, Irina Ushakova
explains: "It's all a matter of personal relationships,
really. Because there aren't enough available, you have to
beg the guy to sell it to you rather than the next person."
   The government also helps by boosting imports. In the past
few weeks, the government has brought in three billion
cigarettes and plans to import 32 billion more in the next
few months. Last year's soap shortage was followed by a surge
in soap imports. While these moves help ease the pain, they
add to the country's foreign debt. That in turn reduces
spending on real necessities such as medicine, where a major
shortage is just around the corner.
   Another shortage on the agenda is heating oil. Already,
worried shoppers are talking about it as they stand in line
for eggs, fretting about power cuts if this winter turns out
to be colder than usual.
   Meat is always scarce, a fact to which the Labor Committee
seems resigned: its list calls for a little more than two
pounds each of chicken, goose and duck per year, and 23
pounds each of beef, lamb and pork. Fish fills the gap to
bring the protein allowance to about six ounces a day.
   The list of subsidized necessities also includes about one
loaf of bread a day. But the dessert menu might be
disappointing: for a year, only two-thirds of a pound of plum
cookies, 6.6 pounds of dry cookies, and a pound of strawberry
jam.
   "It's an absolute joke," says plump Valya Zakharova, an
engineer who traveled two hours from home to shop in Moscow.
Adds her husband, Yura, a lanky army officer, "How can you
make people march in lock step like that -- so much macaroni,
so many potatoes? I like macaroni all right, but I don't like
potatoes. What am I supposed to do?"

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- The Gallery:
   An Archipelago Struts Its Stuff All Over U.S.

   In assembling "Court Arts of Indonesia" for New York's
Asia Society, Helen Ibbitson Jessup managed to persuade many
important Indonesians to relinquish their most private,
sacred treasures. Many of these objects, ranging from a
14th-century "modesty disc" to shadow puppets to gold ritual
vessels, had never before been shown to their own countrymen,
let alone foreigners. The decisions weren't made lightly. It
took two years for the Sultan of Bima, for example, to yield
his diamond-laden dagger and crown, two of the three objects
believed to legitimize his rule. (He held on to the third
one, an umbrella too large to travel.)
   "Under normal circumstances, people would not be willing
to part with these objects," says Ms. Jessup. "They realized
it was part of an enormous national effort."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That effort is aimed at putting Indonesia -- the world's
fifth most populous nation -- back on the map after 25 years
of obscurity. The "Court Arts" exhibit is just one of more
than 200 events in the $12 million, 18-month-long Festival of
Indonesia that was launched at the Kennedy Center in
Washington Sunday night. This cultural extravaganza promises
to bring an astonishing array of music, dance, theater,
puppetry, poetry, food, film, art and artifacts to cities and
towns across the U.S.
   With a population of 180 million spread across an
archipelago of 13,000 islands, Indonesia probably is the
biggest place Americans know virtually nothing about. It
wasn't always that way. In the 1950s and early '60s,
Indonesia's flamboyant first president, Sukarno, made
headlines here, and Indonesia's growing Communist Party
alarmed U.S. policymakers.
   But after Sukarno's fall and a swift, sweeping purge of
Communists in the mid'-60s, Indonesia slipped from view. "We
had to go through a period of looking inward and putting our
house back in order," says Foreign Minister Ali Alatas. "Now
we can say that we are on the right path. Our economy is
stronger by the day, and our political institutions are more
established."
   The festival is only one reflection of this newfound
confidence. Recent moves to normalize relations with China,
strengthen ties with the Soviet Union, and host peace talks
on the Cambodia issue are other signs of Indonesia's desire
for a higher international profile. Cultural diplomacy,
however, may prove the trickiest kind to manage.
   As the festival brings Indonesia's hidden treasures to
light, more sensitive matters also have emerged from the
shadows, and Indonesia finds itself the target of
unaccustomed -- and sometimes critical -- scrutiny by
outsiders. The Ford Foundation, which provided much of the
funding for the festival's performance-art component, also
gave the Social Science Research Council in New York $100,000
to coordinate a series of conferences.
   "The committee felt that the thrust of the festival was an
Indonesian government attempt to present Indonesia in a very
favorable, uncritical light," says Toby Volkman, staff
associate at the council. "Our role, as scholars, is to be
more critical."
   Cornell University held a well-attended conference in July
on the status of the Indonesian Chinese, and conferences on
deforestation, the role of women, and human rights in east
Timor have been scheduled elsewhere next year.
   Foreign Minister Alatas says Indonesia is ready for open
debate on these issues. "We welcome anyone to discuss with us
our view on human rights, our philosophy of life. I welcome
discussion on East Timor," he says. "Just give me the same
time as my accuser."
   Generally, however, the festival's organizers have shied
away from controversy, as befits a society based on the
virtues of consensus. "We thought the festival was an
occasion to create understanding and friendship, not to
create conflict," says former Foreign Minister Mochtar
Kusuma-Atmadja, chairman of the private Nusantara Jaya
Foundation in Jakarta, which put together the festival.
   When American anthropologists wrote letters of protest
over the planned display of stolen effigies from Sulawesi
island -- arguing that the objects' value would increase and
thus encourage future theft -- festival organizers agreed
that only photographs of the objects be shown.
   And when two Indonesian artists objected, in the
Indonesian press, to the festival's choice of paintings by
other artists "tainted" with former communist ties, nothing
happened. "I said, look, this is about art, not about
politics," recalls Mr. Mochtar. "We should show these
paintings on the merits themselves."
   This purist position carried over to the marketing of the
festival. While the critical and commercial success of the
1986 Festival of India first inspired the Indonesians to come
up with their own version, they are avoiding the commercial
hoopla -- the Bergdorf and Bloomingdales tie-ins -- that
India was happy to permit. "Javanese reticence has probably
shown itself in the way this has been organized," says one
American official involved in the festival. "They are not
going to sell Indonesian T-shirts all over the place."
   Nevertheless, the Indonesians and their American friends
are quietly working to ensure that the festival boosts trade,
investment and tourism in time for "Visit Indonesia Year --
1991." The American-Indonesian Chamber of Commerce will run
business seminars in 10 cities.
   In the end, though, it is Indonesia's rich cultural
heritage that is most likely to bowl Americans over. The
excellent "Court Arts" show in Manhattan serves as the best
overall introduction, since it ranges from the highest forms
of religious art to wild-eyed leather puppets and precious
artifacts. One of the most striking objects is a 19th-century
"measure of a corpse," a series of gold plaques strung
together with wire, made so that the body "can be properly
reconstructed in its next incarnation." Turn-of-the-century
and contemporary photographs add context to the eclectic
display.
   "Affandi in America," now on view in the Atrium at the
International Monetary Fund in Washington, provides a
colorful sampling of the contemporary Indonesian artist's
expressionism. "Many paintings epitomize the compassion,
humanity and liveliness he found in Indonesia's people,
especially the poor," writes the Smithsonian Institution's
Paul Michael Taylor, in the show's catalog.
   And judging from the Kennedy Center gala, the performing
arts program promises to be exciting, even hypnotic. A row of
young men in orange-and-black batik costumes brought the
house down with their Islamic chanting and synchronized
rhythmic body movements. Their group -- Saman of Aceh,
Sumatra -- will appear in New York next March.
   Washington also is the setting for another major festival
event, "The Sculpture of Indonesia," now at the National
Gallery of Art. For museumgoers familiar with Indian
sculpture, the Buddhist and Hindu forms may seem to be
nothing new, but the details of the smaller pieces command
attention.
   One quibble: The introductory panel on the wall of the
first gallery and the brochure identify Indonesia as an
archipelago of "three thousand islands." What happened to the
other 10,000?
   Curator Jan Fontein brushes off the blooper. "There are a
lot of islands, let me put it that way," he says. Mobil Oil,
which underwrote the show as part of its $2 million
contribution to the festival, may not be amused. Not to
mention the millions of Indonesians sent to oblivion.

   THE U.S. MILITARY IS PUSHING to keep troops permanently in
Saudi Arabia.
   According to senior military officers, the Army and Air
Force are quietly drafting the long-term strategy, involving
10,000 troops, as well as plans for securing air bases
throughout the Persian Gulf after the current crisis ends.
But civilian officials at the Pentagon denied that there is
such a policy, presaging a possible internal feud. Meanwhile,
Iraq said it is confiscating assets of nations participating
in economic sanctions against Baghdad. U.S. officials didn't
have any immediate estimate of the value of American assets
involved, but it probably isn't great.

   Tied to Airline's Decision

   Northwest Airlines has received a cash infusion of $500
million from European aircraft maker Airbus Industrie and
U.S. engine maker General Electric Co. as it flies into a
tough earnings period sparked by the fuel crisis.
   Airbus arranged the loan after Northwest -- a unit of NWA
Inc., St. Paul, Minn. -- agreed to order an additional 75
A-320 aircraft manufactured by Airbus and take options on 30
more Airbus planes. A GE joint venture is supplying the
engines for those aircraft.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Northwest is Airbus's largest U.S. customer, the
European company had faced stiff competition for the
Northwest order, valued at $4.6 billion, from Seattle
aircraft maker, Boeing Co. The cash arrangement may have
given Airbus an edge in the competition.
   Officials familiar with the transaction say Northwest
plans to use the loan to reduce the bank debt that resulted
from its acquisition last year by an investor group that
included Alfred A. Checchi and several other former Marriott
Corp. executives. The Checchi group borrowed about $3 billion
to purchase the airline and has $1.7 billion in bank debt
remaining.
   The new aircraft -- narrow-body twin-engine jets that seat
150 passengers -- will be paid for through the airline's
operating funds as they are delivered, persons familiar with
the transaction said.
   The loan reduces the chance that Northwest will face a
cash crunch as it weathers a period of sharply higher fuel
prices and soft domestic passenger traffic. The carrier
estimates its fuel bill this year could increase by $180
million.
   The cash infusion also gives Northwest a cushion as it
faces other potential financial hurdles. The carrier is
facing a Sept. 29 deadline from the Department of
Transportation to find a replacement for $225 million of a
$400 million equity investment from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
Northwest is also under pressure to buy back an $80 million
stake currently held by Elders IXL Ltd., an Australian
concern.
   Elders has been trying to sell the Northwest stake and
other assets to solve its own debt problems. Northwest could
use a portion of the Airbus-arranged loan to complete the
purchase of the Elders stake.
   The KLM situation is less pressing since the
transportation department is likely to grant Northwest an
extension for reducing the KLM investment to $175 million.
That would be the second extension the carrier has received.
The department ordered Northwest to alter the KLM investment
last year, citing rules about foreign control over U.S.
carriers.
   Northwest and GE declined to discuss the Airbus
transaction. However, Alan Boyd, chairman of Airbus Industrie
of North America, confirmed Airbus arranged the loan with
Northwest during negotiations over the aircraft order.
   Mr. Boyd declined to say how much of the loan Airbus
provided and how much came from GE. Mr. Boyd said the new
A-320s and spare parts Northwest ordered will serve as
collateral for the loan, which is repayable after 1995. The
loan is believed to carry an interest rate of less than 10%.
   GE's involvement in the transaction is through CFM
International, a joint venture GE has with the French
aircraft engine concern, SNECMA. The GE engine order is
valued at $1.3 billion.
   The Airbus loan to Northwest could renew the debate among
U.S. aircraft manufacturers over whether their European rival
is using unfair inducements to gain a toehold in the U.S. The
U.S. aircraft market is dominated by Boeing and St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Mr. Boyd of Airbus said Boeing set a precedent for such
transactions when Boeing agreed in 1987 to invest $700
million in Chicago-based UAL Corp. to help United Airlines'
parent thwart a takeover attempt by its pilot union.
   "Airbus is operating in a purely commercial fashion. We've
not done a single thing where there was not already a
precedent," Mr. Boyd said.
   Spokesmen for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas both declined
to comment on the Airbus-Northwest arrangement.
   It could be difficult for the U.S. manufacturers to openly
criticize Airbus's move since the loan is a boon to
Northwest. The loan could help the carrier reduce its
acquisition debt to a point where it could refinance the
borrowing at a much lower interest rate. The Checchi group
currently pays an interest rate of about 10% on the debt.
   Refinancing the debt at a lower rate would give Northwest
a stronger balance sheet at a time when even the strongest
carriers are predicting lower earnings.
   Northwest earned its first profit since the Checchi
acquisition during this year's second quarter, when it had
net income of $59.6 million on revenue of $1.8 billion.
Higher fuel costs are expected to clobber earnings at
Northwest and most other airlines in the third quarter.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   The Voters Roar

   This week's primaries have identified the most explosive
issue in this fall's election: the war on incumbents. As the
saying goes, the voters are mad as hell, and aren't going to
take it anymore.
   We suspect the anti-establishment vote just recorded in
Massachusetts is going to get most of the attention, but for
a more revealing look at what may lie ahead, check out
Oklahoma. Oklahoma has become the first state to vote to
limit the terms of its state legislators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Oklahoma's term-limitation initiative won more than 67% of
the vote, carrying every one of the state's 77 counties and
all demographic groups. It made the difference in the
come-from-behind victory of businessman David Walters in the
Democratic primary for Governor. Mr. Walters defeated Wes
Watkins, a seven-term Congressman, by running pro-term limit
commercials and declaring "it's time to reclaim our
government." Congressman Watkins didn't take a position on
term limits, leading us to wonder what might happen to
someone in Oklahoma who had actually crusaded against term
limitation. In the GOP primary, the candidate most strongly
in favor of term limits scored an upset victory.
   The Oklahoma initiative won wide bipartisan support. A key
backer was former State Rep. Cleta Deatherage Mitchell, who
chaired the Appropriations Committee before she retired from
politics. Ms. Mitchell, a self-described liberal Democrat,
says term limitation will be good for her party. "The
national Democratic Party doesn't understand America outside
the Beltway," she says. "I think term limitation is the only
way Democrats will survive long term. We either force new
blood into the party or we will be increasingly out of
touch."
   The Oklahoma initiative doesn't limit terms for Members of
Congress, but it serves as a rocket booster for term-limit
votes in Colorado and California this November. The Colorado
initiative also covers that state's congressional delegation.
Oklahoma supporters of term limits say they plan another
initiative extending term limits to Congress.
   In Massachusetts, the state's Democratic establishment is
still reeling from John Silber's landslide victory in the
Democratic gubernatorial primary over Francis Bellotti, a
30-year political insider and conventional liberal. Though no
conservative, Mr. Silber, the acerbic president of Boston
University, used his campaign to lambaste liberals and call
for wholesale change in government. So the same Massachusetts
party that nominated Michael Dukakis for Governor three times
has now chosen John Silber, who voted for Ronald Reagan and
George Bush for President.
   "There is no question this is a voter rebellion by
anybody's definition of the term," says former Massachusetts
Democratic Senator Paul Tsongas. Angry Democrats, furious at
their party's role in dragging the state into fiscal ruin,
also defeated Attorney General James Shannon and at least
eight state legislators.
   A new Times Mirror poll confirms what some of us have been
pointing at for some time now: Americans feel increasingly
disconnected from their government. The percentage of adults
who "agree completely" that politicians in Washington lose
touch with their constituents quickly has increased from 22%
in 1987 to more than 30% today. Exhibit A in this respect is
the Glass Cocoon budget summit in Washington, which persists
in believing that voters will support higher taxes to help
Washington get control of the federal budget. Democratic
candidates around the country know better.
   On taxes, Neil Hartigan, the Democratic candidate for
Governor in Illinois, is running to the right of his
Rockefeller Republican opponent, Jim Edgar. He pledges to
weed out marginal programs and not raise taxes. In New
Jersey, congressional candidate Marguerite Chandler is
fleeing from Jim Florio, her party's Governor. She's running
a radio ad in her House race denouncing the Florio tax
increases and saying "it's time to tell the Governor enough
is enough." In a Nebraska House race, State Senator Sandra
Scofield is touting her vote against a state tax increase
backed by her GOP opponent.
   With only seven weeks to go in the campaign, the White
House appears uninterested in helping discontented voters
find their way to candidates who would challenge the status
quo. The fact remains that voters are frustrated with
politicians who have cemented themselves into office with
incumbent-protections, and they are now willing to back term
limits -- a radical measure that is the equivalent of a
national vote of no-confidence. The political momentum of
this movement is now headed straight into November, and once
it's finished with that slate of candidates we suspect it'll
head for 1992.

   Commodities:
   Mideast War Fears Continue to Hold a Floor
   Under Most Oil Prices, but Gasoline Ends Weak

   Middle East war fears continued to hold a floor under most
petroleum prices yesterday, although an apparent leveling in
U.S. demand for gasoline is beginning to have an impact on
world oil markets.
   Prices generally were off sharply as markets opened in the
wake of an industry report of a surprising surge in U.S.
gasoline inventories. Some oil economists and industry
analysts interpreted the report, which was released late
Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute, as an early
signal of a possible new sluggishness in U.S. demand for
gasoline. As a result, gasoline prices plunged, helping to
drag down prices of crudes and other fuels around the world.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most crudes and fuels rebounded in later trading to finish
strong. But gasoline remained weak.
   In the U.S. futures market, unleaded gasoline for October
delivery settled at 89.9 cents a gallon, down 1.71 cents,
after being down more than two cents for much of the day. The
November contract closed at 87.09 cents a gallon, down less
than one cent.
   Heating oil contracts generally were up about two cents a
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, however. October
heating oil rose 2.1 cents a gallon to settle at 88.53 cents.
   The futures price for October crude oil fell 23 cents a
barrel to settle at $33.18. But today is the last day of
trading for the October crude. Crudes traded on the
International Petroleum Exchange in London staged a sharp
recovery in the final minutes to close above day-earlier
levels.
   U.S. gasoline inventories had been expected to decline
rather than rise last week. According to the American
Petroleum Institute's latest report, however, inventories
increased nearly 5.9 million barrels to 216.8 million
barrels.
   That isn't far above the 200 million barrels that the
industry considers to be the minimum working level for
inventories. Also, industry officials caution that one week's
changes in the API figures are hardly enough to suggest a
trend. Still, it's generally assumed that the unexpected
buildup in inventories suggests motorists and others worried
about possible shortages from the Middle East crisis have
completed a rush to "top off" their tanks.
   Demand for gasoline, the chief petroleum product sold in
the U.S., usually begins to decline seasonally at this time
of the year. Labor Day is said to mark the end of the
so-called driving season.
   In addition to the seasonal slackening, some other
factors, including a possible national recession and the
higher pump prices, could contribute to a slowing in gasoline
sales in the U.S., said McDonald J. Beavers, a gasoline
marketing consultant and analyst.
   "There's no doubt higher prices and slower economic
activity are beginning to have an impact on demand," added
Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chief economist at Ashland Oil Inc.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of cattle futures settled
mixed. They are expected to drop at the open of trading today
in the wake of a monthly government survey of feedlots in
seven major ranch states. Feedlots fatten cattle for
slaughter. More young cattle than expected by traders were
placed onto feedlots in August, signaling that the supply of
mature cattle is probably building. That would tend to
depress prices. After the close of trading yesterday at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Agriculture Department
reported that the number of young cattle placed onto feedlots
in August increased 6% from a year earlier. Most traders had
expected only a 3% increase, said Thomas Morgan, an analyst
at Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. The
number of cattle on feedlots on Sept. 1 increased 5% from a
year ago.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices again fell sharply. The
soonest-to-expire September contract was down three cents a
pound at $1.27. The most actively traded December delivery
was off 4.25 cents a pound to $1.1975. The major depressing
factor was a continuation of the selling in London that began
Tuesday and continued yesterday, an analyst said. Traders in
London had recently bought contracts in anticipation that
supplies would tighten when the September contract there
expired yesterday, but they liquidated their holdings when
that condition didn't develop, the analyst said. Trading
during the last 10 minutes of the session in New York was
mostly technical, he said, particularly when the December
contract fell below the $1.20 level for the first time since
mid-August. Another price-depressing development, but less
so, were reports that the Peruvian Labor Ministry may order
workers at the Minero Peru mine to return to work, the
analyst said. The miners walked out Aug. 17. The ministry
declared the work stoppage illegal last week, the analyst
noted, but hasn't ordered workers to return. If the miners
disobey the order, the company can fire them and recruit new
workers, the analyst said. Clashes between strikers and
police already have taken place, he said.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices were strong on concern over
supplies. The soonest-to-expire October contract ended up its
daily limit of two cents a pound at 75.90 cents. The
most-active December contract settled with a gain of 1.65
cents at 73.95 cents. Concern that there may not be
sufficient cotton to deliver against the October contract
drove prices for that month higher, according to Sandra Kaul,
analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers. Monday is when the
first notices to deliver cotton against the October contract
will be issued. Ms. Kaul noted that there are only 1,600
bales of cotton in warehouses of the Cotton Exchange in New
York for delivery against the October contract, and 2,500
bales are awaiting certification. However, she said, the open
interest, or the number of outstanding October contracts that
remain to be nullified by an opposite trade or satisfied by
delivery, announced yesterday was 2,168, or the equivalent of
216,800 bales. "The 1989-90 crop, which ended on July 31, was
a modest one and that combined with record export and
domestic demand have reduced U.S. stocks to the lowest level
relative to demand in over a decade," Ms. Kaul said. The
cotton that is normally harvested early, and which was
expected to provide supplies in time for delivery against the
October contract, has been delayed by rains over the past two
weeks, she said. Rainfall at this stage of the crop's
development can also cause damage, she noted. Although the
1990-91 crop is expected to be much larger than last
season's, continued strong demand is likely to reduce
available supplies even further, she said.

   Allergan Inc. said it will close its contact lens
manufacturing facility in Woodbury, N.Y., over the next year
and lay off 70 employees.
   The Irvine, Calif., maker of eye and skin-care products
said it will transfer the operations to Allergan facilities
in Irvine and in Waco, Texas. The company consolidated its
manufacturing operations in Europe into one plant in Britain
last year.

   First Executive's Reports on Its Health
   Apparently Fall Short of Past Claims

   LOS ANGELES -- Still unreleased reports that troubled
First Executive Corp. has been using for months to establish
the long-term financial strength of its insurance units
appear to fall short of the mark.
   The reports, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, were
done by Seattle-based actuarial consultants Milliman &amp;
Robertson Inc. and are based on computer analyses of detailed
financial information about Executive Life Insurance Co., Los
Angeles, and Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York, First
Executive's principal units.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Two initial studies, dated Feb. 16 and March 6, are based
on conditions through December 1989. Excerpts were circulated
to Executive Life agents, policyholders and shareholders --
and even to a committee of Congress.
   A draft summary of a third report, which plugs in the
company's actual experience with record policy surrenders in
the first half and its financial condition as of June 30,
paints a somewhat harsher view of First Executive's future
earnings in about 10% of 78 scenarios drawn up by the
consultants. But they say the assumptions in the scenarios
"represent extremely unlikely economic conditions and
customer behavior."
   Still, the reports appear to have shortcomings that
several regulators say privately undercut their usefulness,
largely because they may make some of the findings
over-optimistic.
   "Assumptions can be made so tough that they'd imperil any
company," said Alan C. Snyder, president of First Executive.
"But we've tried to establish a range of assumptions that
deal with the real world." Mr. Snyder said the consultants
examined a wide range of interest rate assumptions, junk-bond
default rates higher than experienced by the market, and
policy surrenders at multiples of the company's current
experience. "And the company withstood all these tests," he
said.
   The outcomes in the first two studies portray financially
solid units, able to withstand insurance customers this year
redeeming as much as 50% of all the company's policies that
can be surrendered and a further 20% next year. Even under
such arduous scenarios, the reports say that the hypothetical
book values of the companies actually could increase over a
five-year test period.
   The update seeks to address some of the serious questions
the first two reports don't resolve. The initial reports'
most severe assumption of policy redemptions for 1990 was
nearly surpassed in the first six months of this year, when
redemptions and defaults totaled $2.65 billion. The update
starts with the higher actual surrender rates of the first
half, but assumes a more normal surrender rate by no later
than next June 30.
   Milliman &amp; Robertson's first report assumes that half of
all money from maturing investments is reinvested in junk
bonds. The assumption means higher bond yields that favorably
affect the study's conclusions, but that violates an
agreement between Executive Life and California insurance
regulators. The update assumes all new investments being
totally investment-grade.
   Another reinvestment assumption in the first two reports
analyzes annual junk-bond default rates to a maximum of 2%
and an investment return of five percentage points over
Treasury bill rates. The studies suggest that financial
results of the First Executive units are quite sensitive to
the rate of junk-bond defaults.
   The studies also assume that the death rate of Executive
Life's policyholders remains unchanged throughout the
analysis. However, insurance experts say that any analysis
should consider a phenomenon known as "adverse selection," in
which healthy policyholders may abandon an insurer because
they can easily obtain policies elsewhere, while medically
high-risk holders stick with the policies they have. Mr.
Snyder said that Executive Life policies have adjustable cost
features based on mortality experience.
   First Executive at first promised to publicly release the
updated report and the earlier studies at the end of August.
The company now says it plans the release soon.
   Joseph Belth, publisher of The Insurance Forum, a trade
publication, and a frequent critic of First Executive, had
been trying to obtain copies in court from New York insurance
regulators under freedom of information legislation. First
Executive opposed Mr. Belth's efforts. But Mr. Belth obtained
copies of the first two reports independent of this newspaper
and called them "inconclusive" in his latest newsletter. "It
is my opinion the assumptions do not reflect various negative
developments that may occur," he said.

   Years of overspending on public programs and inflated
union contracts are looming as the formula for fiscal
disaster among more American cities. Philadelphia, the
nation's fifth-largest city, appears to have reached the edge
first.
   Philadelphia has run a deficit for the past three years,
each time borrowing enough to meet its cash-flow needs. This
year, with a deficit of $210 million in a $2.1 billion
budget, the lenders refused to buy the city's notes. On
Monday Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the city's credit to
triple-C, which means the city is in danger of default on its
general obligation bonds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Like many other cities, Philadelphia chose in recent years
to lavish money on a host of programs. By trying to do too
much, it ended up doing nothing very well. The evidence can
be found in the city's escalating crime rate and crumbling
infrastructure.
   Mayor Wilson Goode has called for $150 million in
"emergency" tax increases. He previously asked for a new 0.5%
sales tax along with an increase in the city's 5% wage tax.
City taxes on financial and insurance firms are already
two-thirds higher than in the surrounding suburbs.
   Mayor Goode concedes that new taxes will hurt job growth
in the city, but insists there is no alternative. That "no
alternative" thinking is precisely the problem. Where is it
written in stone, for instance, that a city must retain all
of its past functions in perpetuity? Unburdening the city of
some of its long-held properties would not only raise cash
but reduce the city's budget obligations. The Philadelphia
Water Department is estimated to be worth $100 million. The
city spends $80 million a year maintaining the Philadelphia
Airport. Cities from Albany, N.Y., to Los Angeles are
discussing the sale of their airports.
   But rather than debate fundamental reform of what
constitutes city government, Philadelphia's leaders are
trying to get the federal government to blackmail
Pennsylvania into paying for the city's mass-transit system.
Rep. Bill Gray, chairman of the House Budget Committee, has
inserted a provision into the pending House transportation
bill that would cut off 25% of the state's federal highway
funds unless it establishes dedicated taxes to support
Philadelphia's transit system.
   Mr. Gray's ploy would create a dangerous precedent for the
pre-emption of state tax policy by Congress. Pressure groups
that failed to win tax increases at the local or state level
would seek local tax mandates from Congress using the threat
of withholding federal funds.
   The city's establishment is aware of what Mr. Gray's
squeeze play represents. The Philadelphia Inquirer
editorialized in favor of his tactics: "Blackmail may be a
nasty business, but sometimes somebody has to do it." We hope
this doesn't mean that blackmail is liberalism's ultimate
urban policy.
   The Philadelphia story is hardly unique. What's most
troubling is that at all levels of government, the political
system the past 20 years has seemed driven to keep piling on
spending commitments. They believed that somebody or
something could always be squeezed for the money -- the
federal budget, the state, "the rich," a round of union
givebacks, new business taxes, penny-ante taxes, raiding
pension funds. In fairness to the politicians, most
intellectual and media elites have praised and supported all
these public commitments.
   But the game is about over. The challenge now, in
Philadelphia and other cities, is to start finding people and
policies which aren't tied to a status quo that has proved
itself financially and intellectually bankrupt.

   Workplace:
   Integrity-Test Firms Fear
   Report Card by Congress

   Publishers of so-called integrity tests, which employers
use to help screen millions of job-seekers each year, are in
a furor over the pending release of a government study that
they fear could demolish their products.
   The study, by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment, is expected to cast doubt on whether integrity
tests work as advertised. In other words, can they accurately
predict which employees are likely to steal or goof off on
the job?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A damaging report could leave droves of employers in the
lurch. An earlier report by the congressional office helped
prompt the banning of most lie-detector tests in the
workplace two years ago. Since then, a growing number of
employers have turned to the written integrity tests, which
they now administer to an estimated five million job
applicants each year.
   The report isn't expected until next week, but publishers
of the tests have seen draft versions, and the prospect of a
negative assessment has panicked them and others who believe
the tests are a valid screening tool. Led by a coalition of
disgruntled testing firms, supporters of the exams have been
frantically goading government researchers and congressional
aides for 15 months to postpone and alter the study.
   They've had some success. The report is a year past due
and has been rewritten dozens of times. It won't be as
damaging as some drafts suggested, say those who've seen the
final version. But it clearly won't endorse the tests, as
their publishers had hoped. So now they are intensifying
their fight, launching an angry, pre-emptive campaign to
undermine the congressional offices's credibility.
   "There is nothing more that we can gain from a dialogue,"
says Ryan A. Kuhn, president of Reid Psychological Systems, a
Chicago test publisher.
   Gathered in their lobbyist's Alexandria, Va., office this
week, officials of the three largest testing companies --
Reid, London House of Park Ridge, Ill., and Stanton Corp. of
Charlotte, N.C. -- cited a three-inch pile of chronologies,
charts and critiques they have gathered to use in their
campaign to show a pattern of misconduct by the congressional
office and others. They charged that the research agency has
been biased and sloppy, that it ignored conflicts of interest
among reviewers of the drafts and that its report will prove
to be unscientific and misleading.
   "It embarrasses me as a citizen that the government is
doing such shoddy research," says John W. Jones, vice
president of research and development at London House.
   The technology office allows that it made some mistakes
along the way and that staffing problems have plagued the
project, but denies the publishers' charges and says it has
confidence in the quality of its final report. The
congressman who requested the study, Pat Williams (D.,
Mont.), says he plans no immediate effort to introduce
legislation restricting the tests. He says that challenges to
the report are premature. "I can't presume to know how good
this study has been before it's been released," he says.
   John Andelin, an assistant director at the technology
office who supervised the integrity test study, says the
comments on drafts that the technology office solicited from
test publishers and others have been "helpful" in improving
the reports. But he scoffed at what he calls "a lobbying
effort to kill the report."
   Mr. Andelin adds that some reviewers say the draft reports
haven't been critical enough. "We have people who think we
are too harsh and too charitable on almost every issue," he
says.
   The dispute has proven to be unusually heated. "I've seen
lobbying by people who are complaining about the report at a
level (of intensity) I've never seen before," says Tom
McNamara, chief of staff to Rep. Don Sundquist (R., Tenn.), a
member of the congressional board that oversees the
technology office.
   The office had intended the study to be a modest memo that
wouldn't require the congressional approval mandated for
major studies. But a barrage of complaints from test
publishers persuaded Mr. McNamara and his counterparts to
demand regular updates on the project, including the review
of several separate drafts. Typically, even major studies get
just one formal review.
   "It may seem trivial," Mr. McNamara says. "But we can't
just allow something that's this controversial to be moved
out and produced and given the (technology office's) stamp of
approval if it's not very well done."
   For months, test publishers have been deluging Washington
officials with letter after letter assailing the draft
report. For instance, in a long appeal in July to Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch (R., Utah), a member of the technology office's
board, the coalition of test publishers blasted what it
called the office's "calculated attempts to produce a
document that is rife with heavy-handed political statements,
rather than limited to objective scientific issues." It added
that the technology office "is trying to point the debate in
a particular direction. That direction is clearly
anti-business."
   At the heart of the dispute are questionnaires that are
now widely used in banks, stores and other workplaces where
concern about employee theft and dishonesty runs high. Some
employers develop their own tests, but most buy them from one
of several dozen industrial psychologists and small companies
that make up the $30 million integrity test industry. Reid,
Stanton and London House are private concerns and refuse to
divulge sales, but together they are believed to control
about 70% of the market.
   The tests typically include questions that ask how people
feel about crime and honesty. "Do you always tell the truth?
Were you ever tempted to take company merchandise without
actually taking any? Do you think it is OK to get around the
law if you don't actually break it?" are sample questions
contained in a brochure promoting one of Reid's exams.
   The publishers concede that the tests aren't perfect, but
say data prove that employers can benefit from using the
instruments. Reid, for instance, says studies it has
conducted show its tests can properly categorize potential
thieves and honest people an average of 85% of the time. That
means, of course, that some people may be falsely
characterized and potentially denied jobs even if they're
honest, while some potential thieves may slip through.
   "There is error with every test," insists Reid's Mr. Kuhn.
   Critics agree that no method is perfect, but say not
enough independent research has been done to verify the
validity claims of test publishers. They say certain test
questions are overly intrusive, and that more study is also
needed on whether the tests discriminate disproportionately
against minorities. Moreover, they charge test publishers are
overly zealous in their claims about what the tests can
accomplish, citing sales brochures that promise such results
as increased productivity, lower turnover rates and higher
profits.
   Some also say the tests don't account for the ways in
which someone's propensity to steal might change depending on
circumstances. "Something like honesty is an attribute that
is not hard and fast," says Walter M. Haney, a senior
researcher with Boston College's Center for the Study of
Testing, Evaluation and Educational Policy. "Honest versus
dishonest behavior is affected by environment."
   Even if the technology office's study doesn't spark
efforts in Congress to restrict integrity tests, it could
have other consequences. Massachusetts already bans the
exams, and moves to limit use of the tests on the state level
are said to be under consideration in Connecticut, Oregon and
New York. And while there have been few legal disputes over
the tests, a negative study could fuel a flood of challenges
from people who claim their job chances were unfairly
affected by the tests.
   The report could also prompt a scramble among employers to
find alternative methods to gauge worker honesty. Already,
there has been substantial growth in the use of credit
reports, injury files, criminal records and background checks
in pre-employment screening, though there is little research
to prove the value of such means to predict worker behavior.
   Concern may also mount about "psychological inventories,"
longer quizzes such as the popular Minnesota Multiphasic
test, that many employers use to gain a broad reading of
their workers' motivations, ambitions, skills and potential.
In many companies, even candidates for executive positions
take such tests as a condition of promotion or hire. Some of
these tests have also come under fire, but the technology
office's study isn't expected to address them.
   However the study turns out, it won't be the last word on
integrity tests this fall. The American Psychological
Association has also been studying the topic, and expects to
unveil results and recommendations in November.

   Sherritt Gordon's
   Board, Managers
   Ousted by Group

   TORONTO -- In a surprise ending to a bitter proxy battle,
a dissident shareholder group won the right to oust Sherritt
Gordon Ltd.'s board and top managers.
   The battle was launched by the Toronto financiers Ian
Delaney, Bruce Walter and Eric Sprott, who accused Sherritt's
managers of running the nickel refining and fertilizer
company unimaginatively and without direction. They
maintained that the management group, by holding less than 1%
of Sherritt's shares, couldn't be committed to making the
widely held company a success.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the dissidents hold only 5.4% of Sherritt, they
managed to round enough support from institutional holders to
win the proxy battle by a small margin, with 53% of the votes
cast. The group replaced Sherritt's board with its own
nominees.
   Mr. Delaney said he will assume the posts of president and
chief executive officer. He said that a board meeting will be
held shortly to elect a president, and that the post is
likely to go to Mr. Walter.
   Sherritt's former president and chief executive, Charles
Heinrich, asked shareholders to vote against the dissidents,
on grounds that they don't have any background in Sherritt's
key industries. They "haven't offered even one specific
workable element of a plan that differs in any real way from
the plan being implemented" by the company, he said.
   In their information circular, the dissidents said they
would seek joint-venture partners, acquisitions and marketing
changes, but didn't offer specifics. Mr. Delaney declined to
comment on changes the new directors will make, but he said
there won't be any drastic changes in operations immediately.
He said the "near-term problem is to get the company on a
stable" footing. "Sherritt runs efficently," he said. "The
problem with Sherritt has always been the strategic
direction."
   Sherritt has been hit hard by downturns in its cyclical
businesses. It lost a key supply of nickel feed last year and
has been struggling to keep its refinery operating at full
capacity.
   In this year's first six months, Sherritt's net income
plunged 88% to C$4.1 million (US$3.5 million), or 16 Canadian
cents (14 U.S. cents) a share, from a year earlier.
   In the past 52 weeks, Sherritt's stock price has fallen
from a high of C$13.50 to a low of C$7. On the Toronto Stock
Exchange yesterday, the stock closed at C$8.25, up 25
Canadian cents.
   Mr. Delaney said that Sherritt will proceed with its plan
to move its head office to Edmonton, Alberta, to be closer to
its operations, but that he will run the company from
Toronto.
   Mr. Heinrich said he doesn't know what he will do now,
though Mr. Delaney said a Sherritt executive position will be
available to him.

   WASHINGTON -- Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats
have a political advantage in the current budget standoff,
according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
   The poll, which underscores public concern about an
economic recession, shows that the public is equally divided
over whom to blame if no agreement is reached to reduce the
federal budget deficit. If the talks fail, 34% say the Bush
administration would be mostly to blame, while 31% say that
the Democrats in Congress would be mostly to blame.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Top congressional and administration officials continued
budget talks at the Capitol yesterday, seeking to break the
impasse over taxes and other issues.
   The WSJ/NBC News poll, taken by Peter Hart, a Democrat,
and Robert Teeter, a Republican, was based on telephone
interviews Sept. 15-18 with 1,508 registered voters across
the nation. The poll carries a margin of error of 2.6
percentage points.
   The results show virtually no public preference between
the Democratic plan, which, among other elements, includes an
energy tax and an additional income surtax on the very
wealthy, and the Bush administration plan, which includes a
smaller energy tax, limits on deductions for state and local
income taxes and a cut in the capital-gains tax.
   "There is as much division on the issue among the public
as there is between the president and Congress," Mr. Hart and
Mr. Teeter say.
   The poll shows that 43% of the public prefer the
Democratic plan, with 41% preferring the Bush administration
plan.
   A Journal/NBC News poll in January showed the public split
over cutting the capital-gains tax, which assesses levies on
the profits from the sale of stocks, bonds and real estate.
In that poll, 47% opposed a capital-gains tax cut and 45%
supported it.
   Meanwhile, the poll shows there remains strong public
concern about the prospect of a recession. A majority (51%)
believes there will be a recession. The Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait triggered a major upsurge in public apprehensions
about the prospect of a recession; those apprehensions
haven't disappeared in the past six weeks even though the
initial shock of the invasion has worn off. Thirty-five
percent believe there won't be a recession. Republicans are
slightly less sure of the prospect of a recession than are
Democrats.
   The budget talks that continued behind closed doors
yesterday were again limited, as they had been Tuesday, to
the five highest-ranking congressional leaders of both
parties and three top administration officials, in an effort
to cut down on acrimony and information leaks. At Tuesday's
session, House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) asked to meet
with President Bush, but administration officials said
negotiations had to show more progress before the president
got involved again, congressional aides said.
   Meanwhile, House Democratic leaders began considering the
need for an emergency government-funding bill, including a
possible provision to suspend across-the-board spending cuts
that would be triggered in October by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law absent some budget accord.
   Without an agreement in place after Oct. 1, the start of
fiscal 1991, government programs would be unfunded and at
least $85 billion in automatic cuts would be imposed by the
law. Senate GOP Leader Robert Dole began circulating a letter
to President Bush promising to support his veto of any
measure waiving the cuts. But given the pain such cuts would
impose on federal workers and beneficiaries of numerous
programs, Sen. Dole was having trouble getting signatures.
   The four-month-old budget impasse and threatening fiscal
breakdown has fed frustration among lawmakers. Some House
Democrats now propose to draft their own budget that would
meet the budget negotiators' goal of $50 billion in budget
cuts for fiscal 1991, while protecting Democrats' favorite
social programs. But proponents acknowledged any such budget
would be difficult to pass. And House Democratic Leader
Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said he told the group that the
summit negotiators "have got to keep talking and see what we
can accomplish."
   Despite congressional leaders' recommitment Tuesday to
bargain in "good faith," the troops from both parties
mobilized to put their own partisan spin on the impasse
through news conferences and floor speeches. Democrats
complained that only President Bush's insistence on lower
capital-gains taxes for the rich blocked a budget agreement.
Republicans in turn stressed that many other differences
remained, including the amount and kind of energy taxes and
Medicare cuts.

   "If no agreement is reached on how to reduce the federal

   Inspiration Resources Corp., New York, said Western Gold
Exploration &amp; Mining Co., a limited partnership of
Luxembourg-based Minorco S.A. and Inspiration, plans to close
its offshore gold mining operation in Alaska.
   As a result, Inspiration, a diversified agricultural and
mining concern, said it may take a charge, which hasn't been
determined, by the end of the year. Last year, the company
earned $25.2 million, or 38 cents a share, on revenue of
$1.42 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Western Gold said it "reluctantly decided to end
operations, due to low gold prices and persistent losses from
the operation." Since the mining began off the coast of Nome,
Alaska, in 1986, the offshore vessel has recovered about
130,000 ounces of gold. Last year, the operation recovered
about 70,000 ounces.

   If Swatch Name Sells
   Watches, Why Not Cars?

<TEXT>
   THIS MAY BE the ultimate brand extension: Swatch, creator
of the disposable watch, is coming out with a car.
   No kidding, according to Ernst Thomke, an executive vice
president of SMH, Swatch's parent. The Swatch car, due out on
the road in three years, will be a real passenger vehicle,
albeit a tiny one. Designed for city use rather than long
hauls on the open highway, the cars will be priced comparably
to other compacts. Mr. Thomke adds that one of the two Swatch
car models will be powered by electricity.
   Swatch revolutionized the market for watches in the early
1980s, with its light-hearted, inexpensive timepieces. But
for most consumers, the name Swatch stands for trendy and
cheap -- hardly a desirable image for a car. "A Swatch is a
$35 throwaway," says Al Ries, chairman of Trout &amp; Ries, a
consulting firm. "The last thing you want to communicate in a
car is disposability."
   But SMH is known for a lot more than plastic timepieces.
The Swiss company also makes medical laser systems and
machine tools and plans to manufacture the car's key
electronic systems. It will probably rely on a European auto
maker to manufacture the car's body, though no supplier has
been chosen.
   The Swatch car may get a boost from state regulators, who
are pressuring auto makers to offer "ultra-clean" vehicles.
   General Motors has already said it plans to start
producing an electric passenger car, although it won't say
exactly when. GM unveiled a sporty-looking electric show
model called "Impact" earlier this year, also designed for
city commuting. "We would expect to see a number of companies
considering entering the electric-vehicle market right now,"
says a GM spokesman.
   Mr. Thomke is undaunted by marketing critics. "Swatch is a
well-known brand name worldwide," he says. "We don't want to
produce throwaway cars. We never planned to produce throwaway
watches."
                                                                                                       

   Pam Charges Pan Lite
   Violates Its Trademark
                                                                                                       

   THE MAKER of Pam, a vegetable spray that keeps food from
sticking to pans, is turning up the heat under one tiny
competitor.
   American Home Products filed suit in federal court in
Chicago charging Stuart Hale Co. with violating its
trademark. The sticking point: In 1988, Stuart Hale, based in
Chicago, began marketing a food spray called Pan Lite. It had
sales of nearly $38,500 last year, mainly in Illinois.
   American Home contends that the name Pan Lite too closely
resembles its own Pam brand name. The similarity is likely to
confuse consumers, according to court papers filed by the
company, and could lead them to believe Pan Lite is made by
American Home. The suit seeks to bar sales of Pan Lite.
   But American Home has another agenda, says Jerome
Schulman, 77 years old, who runs Stuart Hale. He has sold
nonstick solutions to bakers under such names as Pan Rite and
Pan Aide for decades. He says American Home sent him a letter
stating, "We have no objection to the continued use of the
prefix Pan on an aerosol product with any number of
acceptable suffixes." The letter even suggests Pan Glide.
   If the problem isn't the word Pan, why the lawsuit? "What
they really want is the word `Lite,'" Mr. Schulman says. He
believes American Home wants to reserve the option of
introducing a light product under the Pam brand, but failed
to apply for the trademark quickly enough.
   An American Home attorney won't comment. Any plans the
company might have for a "lite" product under its Pam brand
would be proprietary, he says.
                                                                                                       

   Toiletries for Kids
   Wash Away Parental Guilt
                                                                                                       

   WISH YOU COULD spend a little more time with your kids?
   A flock of marketers are betting that kind of yuppie guilt
will encourage parents to buy a host of fancy new shampoos,
body lotions and even deodorants designed to pamper children.
   S.C. Johnson &amp; Sons launched a line of kids' products
under the Fisher-Price brand, and Revlon will roll out bubble
bath and shampoo featuring Nintendo characters. William &amp;
Clarissa, based in Laguna Hills, Calif., recently began
selling trendy toiletries under the Kids brand in 20,000
stores nationwide. And BertSherm Products, Cleveland, sells a
natural deodorant for kids called Fun 'n Fresh through 5,000
outlets.
   The upstarts face tough competition. Johnson &amp; Johnson,
which introduced Johnson's baby shampoo in 1954, continues to
rule the category. But the appeal of the kiddie market is
clear: Sales of children's personal-care products reached
about $360 million last year and are growing at an annual
rate of more than 10%.
   Marketers say parents are having fewer kids and are
willing to lavish more money on each. And the fancy soaps are
cheap enough to spur impulse buying.
   Not all the products may warm parents' hearts, however.
Cosrich of Perth Amboy, N.J., plans a line of toiletries
inspired by "The Simpsons" TV show, including Radical Hair
Stuff, a styling gel that lets kids imitate the spiky 'do of
the puckish Bart Simpson.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   HILTON HOTELS will license the name of the Waldorf-Astoria
hotel for a line of home furnishings, including china and
upholstery. . . . Loews Theaters is planning to expand the
number of movie houses showing art films. Loews has two art
houses slated for cities in Kentucky and will consider
dedicating theaters in other medium-sized cities to highbrow
fare. One drawback: Loews doesn't sell as much popcorn at
these flicks.

   LUBBOCK, Texas - Furr's/Bishop's Cafeterias L.P. said it
won't pay the regularly scheduled cash dividend of 32.5 cents
a preferred and subordinated unit for the third quarter.
   The decision was a previously announced but unreported
part of a proposal made to unitholders last week by the
general partner, Cavalcade &amp; Co., to convert the master
limited partnership to corporate ownership.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the proposal, for each partnership unit owned,
Furr's/Bishop's 20,000 public limited partners would receive
75 cents in cash, one-fourth of a common share, and
six-tenths of a share of $9 convertible preferred stock. The
convertible preferred would have a stated cumulative annual
dividend of $1.12 a share, payable quarterly, increasing to
$1.80 a share on the 10th anniversary of the merger.
   The proposed conversion has been deemed fair by an
independent committee of the Furr's/Bishop's board and its
financial adviser, Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., but must be approved
by a majority of the preferred and subordinated units.
   If the proposed corporate conversion doesn't take place,
the partnership said it will reconsider paying the 32.5
cents-a-unit dividend for the third quarter to preferred
units only.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- "What a race this is]" an ebullient
Dianne Feinstein tells Asian-American supporters in
Chinatown.
   Actually, the Democratic candidate for governor
understates its significance. Joe Scott, a California
political commentator, may be closer to the truth. "It's the
Battle of the Marne," he says, "and the stakes are enormous."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The prize to be won goes beyond the opportunity to govern
this sprawling nation-state of 30 million people, which added
six million residents in the 1980s alone. With
reapportionment after this year's census, California will get
more representation in the U.S. House of Representatives and
will account for one of every eight members. If Ms. Feinstein
wins, she and the Democratic-controlled legislature stand to
make California a Democratic juggernaut for the rest of this
decade.
   They would have free rein to draw the lines for state and
federal legislative districts. They might even manage to
carry California for the Democrat in a presidential election,
which is a feat the party has accomplished just once since
1948 (with Lyndon Johnson in 1964).
   And as the first woman to be governor of California, the
57-year-old Ms. Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco,
would automatically become a national figure, perhaps an
international figure.
   She has star quality. She pulled San Francisco together at
a tragic moment following the murders in November 1978 of
Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the city's
first avowedly gay elected official. (She inherited the
mayor's job.) Her prominence as a female Democratic
officeholder caused Walter Mondale to seriously consider her
as his vice presidential running mate in 1984. In June, she
went through the primary election on a roll, defeating John
Van de Kamp, the state's attorney general. She cuts a
handsome figure on the campaign trail -- tall and elegant in
her trademark red.
   Republican hopes to avoid Democratic hegemony in the state
rest on the slight shoulders of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. The
baby-faced ex-Marine and popular former mayor of San Diego,
who was elected to the Senate in 1982, is going up against
Ms. Feinstein in the November election. At the moment, he
seems to enjoy a narrow lead, at least in recent private
polls. Public polls have the race too close to call.
   Mr. Wilson's most effective weapon, one Ms. Feinstein has
been known to deploy herself: the power of negative
campaigning.
   Where there are issues of any substantial sort, there
isn't much difference in the candidates' positions. Ms.
Feinstein and Mr. Wilson both are scrupulously cautious,
middle-of-the-road politicians. Both support abortion rights,
the death penalty, spending money to fight crime.
   So if the race isn't to be decided on issues, it will
hinge on mudslinging and, of course, personality.
   "Personality matters," says Adriane Urband, a hotel clerk
in Monterey. "They don't have to be the most appealing person
in the world, but they mustn't turn me off," she says.
   The outcome of this race looks to be in the hands of the
image-makers, consultants and fund-raisers. Television ads,
more than anything else, should determine the outcome.
   In a campaign like this, the spoils go to whoever can make
the opponent look worse, particularly this time in matters
pertaining to the national savings and loan scandal. Pete
Wilson is proving to be very good at this sort of thing, and
his organization knows how to win votes in California.
   "Pete Wilson wants a down-and-dirty campaign, and he's
getting it," says Democratic pollster Paul Maslin. "If this
race stays punch-counterpunch, both sides slinging negative
ads, it's Pete's game, and he wins." Adds Richard Maullin, a
demographics and marketing expert: "Pete Wilson knows more
about how the process works in California."
   The voters are understandably frustrated. "All we're
hearing is this sleaze stuff," says Elizabeth Kemper, a Los
Angeles lawyer. "My reaction is: Oh, come on."
   Harold Lape, a Macy's shoe salesman in San Francisco, says
he laughs at the ads. "Each of them is trying to do a
negative number on the other. If they're doing those ads for
me, they're missing the target."
   Voters want issues, at least they say they do. But in a
campaign essentially devoid of any such thing, the ads do
have their effect. And the effect so far is mostly against
Ms. Feinstein, who, among her other disadvantages, has less
money with which to buy time.
   She shares a point of vulnerability that has troubled
other successful women in politics -- a wealthy husband with
business interests that invite investigation. Geraldine
Ferraro, chosen ultimately as Mr. Mondale's running mate in
1984 (over Ms. Feinstein) spent weeks trying to explain the
real-estate dealings of her husband, John Zaccaro. In
Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher from time to time
has been criticized for the interests and investments of her
husband, Dennis.
   Ms. Feinstein's husband is investment banker Richard C.
Blum, who reported personal income last year of more than $7
million. His firm, Richard C. Blum &amp; Associates, invests
hundreds of millions of dollars for nearly a dozen corporate
clients, including BankAmerica Corp. and Fireman's Fund
Corp., not to mention some wealthy individuals he won't
identify.
   He and Ms. Feinstein (she has kept the name of her second
husband) have lent her campaign about $3 million.
   Ms. Feinstein's detractors charge that Mr. Blum is trying
to buy the election for his wife, and the state Republican
Party has filed a suit saying his loans to the campaign are
illegal. "They're flouting the law," says Sen. Wilson,
striding up and down his suite at an airport hotel here,
sipping from a bottle of mouthwash. The case probably won't
be heard until after election day.
   Ms. Feinstein and her husband have been reluctant to pump
more of their own cash into the campaign. And as a result,
they are being outspent, with Mr. Wilson picking up millions
more in fund-raising events, including one on Sept. 17 that
featured President Bush.
   In a way, Ms. Feinstein's people brought the problems down
upon themselves, and, accordingly, on her. They knew from the
start that Mr. Wilson would make Mr. Blum an issue, so they
decided on a pre-emptive surgical strike. In a TV ad, they
charged that Sen. Wilson had received $243,000 in campaign
contributions from savings and loan association executives,
more than anyone else in the Senate, plus $9,000 in S&amp;L
honorariums.
   But though the charge was accurate, the attack
boomeranged. As it turned out, Mr. Blum himself has been
heavily involved with S&amp;Ls. Mr. Wilson and his campaign staff
seized the opportunity to put twice the money Ms. Feinstein
had spent into a TV spot of their own. It pointed out that
Mr. Blum had profited hugely from the bailout of Jackson
County Savings &amp; Loan, in Medford, Ore., in 1988. His payment
for putting the deal together came to $325,000.
   "What they did," says George Gorton, Mr. Wilson's campaign
manager, speaking of the Feinstein campaign, "is called
hypocrisy."
   "She got hurt" in the volley of charges, says Sen. Wilson.
"I didn't."
   A counterpart to the TV ads has been a rash of
investigative stories in newspapers around the state
analyzing Mr. Blum's financial dealings. The latest,
appearing Sept. 14 in the Los Angeles Times, noted that Mr.
Blum sold $2.7 million in stock -- 15% of his holding -- in
National Education Corp., of Irvine, Calif., in the two days
preceding the announcement of a management shake-up, which
caused the share price to plummet. Mr. Blum says he didn't
know about the imminent happenings when he sold his shares.
   The normally cool Ms. Feinstein has been forced to defend
her husband's ethics. "He's the most honest person I know,"
she says. "I recognize what's happening here, and what's
happening here is {they are} using him to get at me."
   The result of what has been happening is clear enough.
"They {the voters} liked Dianne at first," says pollster Mr.
Maslin, "but now some of the bloom is off the rose."
   That is certainly true for at least one California voter,
Ted Stemp, a retired aerospace manufacturing engineer in
Murrieta. "She seemed pretty appealing at one time," he says
of Ms. Feinstein, "but now politics is too much in her
blood."
   The race is still eminently winnable by Ms. Feinstein, of
course. The two candidates are too close in current polls to
say that either is leading. The professionals are counseling
her to move on to higher ground. "She needs to paint Pete
Wilson as a politician of the past," says Democratic pollster
Alex Evans. "She needs to remember this is the most exciting,
most media-driven state in the nation, where being different
is a way of life. She needs to talk about the future of
California."
   "The theme is still there for her," says Mr. Maslin. "The
voters know something has gone wrong in California. They talk
about the pride they used to have in the public schools. All
gone now. They talk about highway congestion, pollution,
crime and drugs. They see the {Democratic-controlled}
legislature run through cronyism and controlled by special
interests. Dianne Feinstein ought to take the lead on all
this."
   Bill Carrick, Ms. Feinstein's campaign manager, isn't so
sure about that. Yes, Californians worry about crime,
education, the environment. "But there isn't an army ready to
march for an agenda of change," he says. "They want to do all
these things without raising taxes."
   Moreover, an emotional campaign could just as easily play
into Mr. Wilson's hands. Even though California's population
is becoming less white, largely because of Asian and Latin
immigration, whites still are the overrwhelming majority of
those who vote. The state's white voters are largely
suburban, and growing old. "This predominantly white
population worries about the exploding minority population,"
Mr. Maullin, the demographer, said.
   These are Pete Wilson's voters -- regular Republicans and
tepid Democrats, white people who live in Southern
California, especially in the pulsing suburbs surrounding Los
Angeles that now stretch eastward all the way to Riverside
and San Bernardino.
   Ms. Feinstein is painfully aware of her standing in the
burbs. At a breakfast fund-raiser in the heavily Hispanic
Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, she claimed to have
80% of the black vote and nearly 70% of Hispanics. "White
men," she said, "are a problem."
   If Ms. Feinstein can find a way to take the initiative and
raise the needed cash for TV ads, she does have some
important cards to play. She favors a sweeping environmental
ballot proposal (called Big Green) that would, among other
things, ban carcinogenic pesticides; Mr. Wilson opposes it.
Her running mate, incumbent Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, is the
sponsor of a ballot proposal that would increase the state
sales tax by half a percentage point, so as to fight a war
against crime and drugs, which are big concerns among
California voters.
   That is a specifically targeted spending proposal that
seems to be popular with voters. The cautious Mr. Wilson, who
has made crime-fighting the centerpiece of his campaign
rhetoric, has no plan of his own to pay for it. He
unenthusiastically suggests that he might actually vote for
the initiative himself.
   Meanwhile, he calls his next round of TV attacks a "tale
of two cities" -- his record as mayor of San Diego from 1971
to 1982 against her record as mayor of San Francisco from
1978 to 1988. "I cut taxes when I was mayor," says Mr.
Wilson. "When she was mayor of San Francisco, she raised
taxes."

   NEW YORK -- The scene outside Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.'s Gold Street office here on Monday would have made any
Wall Street executive cringe.
   Eloise Burg, a 61-year-old widow from Florida, marched for
three hours to protest about the $200,000 she says she lost
through limited-partnership investments sold by
Prudential-Bache. Refusing the brokerage firm's requests to
move inside and talk, Mrs. Burg hoisted a cardboard placard
attacking Prudential-Bache and declaring: "Investors beware."

   Prudential-Bache, once Wall Street's biggest purveyor of
limited partnerships with $610 million in sales last year,
has joined Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and other brokerage
firms in pulling back sharply from the troubled partnership
industry in recent months. It has laid off 40 of its
55-member partnership staff. But the brokerage unit of
Prudential Insurance Co. of America is finding that it isn't
so easy to put its partnership problems behind it.
   Lawsuits and arbitration claims by angry investors are
mounting, and most aren't expected to be resolved for at
least two to three years.
   Prudential-Bache could face $800 million or more of claims
just related to the highly publicized collapse of VMS Realty
Partners in Chicago, whose partnerships Prudential-Bache
aggressively sold, lawyers familiar with the cases say.
Prudential-Bache won't confirm that figure. The ultimate loss
on VMS "frankly is up in the air," says Loren Schechter,
Prudential-Bache's top lawyer.
   All told, the brokerage firm faces lawsuits over 30 of the
VMS partnerships its brokers sold to wealthy investors.
Herbert Beigel, a Chicago lawyer who represents some
investors suing Prudential-Bache, estimates that overall as
much as $2 billion of investment capital has been lost
through partnerships sold by the brokerage firm in the 1980s.
"I don't know of any brokerage firm that has more partnership
exposure than Prudential-Bache."
   Despite all its troubles, Prudential-Bache still believes
partnership investments can be good products. Shearson --
under new management from its parent American Express Co. --
has announced it won't originate any more new partnership
deals, though it will sell others' deals. But
Prudential-Bache vows to bring out a variety of partnerships
for investors when feasible. This is even as the firm's
lawyers deal with the legal woes from soured deals of the
past.
   "We're still in business to offer any product we feel is
appropriate and will work in this marketplace," says Richard
Sichenzio, Prudential-Bache's brokerage chief. "What we're
offering going forward is those investments that are
appropriate for today's economic conditions."
   And that means no more real-estate limited partnerships
marketed as tax shelters, of the kind that Prudential-Bache
and other Wall Street firms sold heavily to wealthy
individuals, and that were torpedoed by the 1986 tax overhaul
and slumping real-estate prices. "Tax-incentive limited
partnerships are no longer something that is being received
well by clients or the sales force," says Mr. Sichenzio.
   Instead, commodities partnerships are a hot product these
days, and Prudential-Bache says it will continue to sell many
of those, as well as aircraft-leasing partnerships. But
compared with its total sales of $610 million last year,
Prudential-Bache is likely to sell only $175 million to $275
million in partnerships of all kinds this year, officials
say.
   Prudential-Bache, which as a firm posted a net loss of $51
million last year, apparently hasn't felt the need to make a
large reserve in recent months to cover possible
partnership-related legal costs. That's partly because it has
been difficult for investors to prove in court that their
losses were the brokerage firm's fault, or that the firm
improperly marketed the investments, lawyers say. Mr.
Schechter, the Prudential-Bache lawyer, won't discuss details
of the firm's reserves, saying only: "We think our general
reserves for contingencies are entirely adequate."
   George Ball, Prudential-Bache chairman, was out of the
country traveling on business and couldn't be reached for
comment this week.
   Among other issues, Prudential-Bache soon has to decide
what to do with $1.6 billion of Prudential-Bache Energy
Income partnerships it co-sponsored with Graham Resources
Inc., a Covington, La., oil and gas syndicator, between 1983
and 1989. Analysts say about half the 26 partnerships are now
performing below expectations. Prudential-Bache and Graham
have been discussing a "roll-up" of the partnerships, or
consolidating them into a publicly traded corporation, since
last January.
   While it may successfully take care of its legal and
marketing problems, Prudential-Bache still faces a
public-relations dilemma. Partnership investors typically
complain louder than, say, an investor whose stocks have
plummeted. That's because partnerships are more-complicated
investments, and investors typically rely far more heavily on
a broker's advice. Also, partnerships are far more difficult
than stocks for investors to sell.
   Prudential-Bache has about 2.5 million customers of all
kinds; a "vocal minority" are complaining about partnerships,
says Mr. Schechter. "Where you see people really angered is
when they put an untoward amount of money in {a particular
investment} that didn't work," he says.
   Many customers, including Mrs. Burg, have done just that.
They blame their brokers for committing too much of their
money to partnerships. Mrs. Burg, for her part, last year won
a $45,000 arbitration award against Prudential-Bache from a
National Association of Securities Dealers panel. But she is
unhappy because that is a fraction of what she says her
losses are.
   Prudential-Bache, in a statement, said, "While it's
unfortunate that Mrs. Burg disagrees with an independent
arbitration tribunal, she had submitted her claim before the
NASD, which determined her claim was worth approximately
$45,000 and which entered an award in that amount." The firm
declined further comment.
   Vows Mrs. Burg: "I won't rest until I have full
restitution."
   Meanwhile, the partnership industry continues to contract.
New offerings in the first seven months of this year raised
$2.3 billion from investors, 39% less than a year ago,
according to Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J.,
publishing and consulting firm.
   Shearson, another firm plagued by problems stemming
largely from past real estate offerings, has surged to the
lead in partnership sales, collecting $220 million from
investors through July.
   More than half the money that Shearson and
Prudential-Bache raised this year went into partnerships that
trade commodities. The key feature of most of these
partnerships is a guarantee that investors will at least get
their own money back. Many limited partners in failed real
estate syndications have been stunned to discover they have
lost their principal.

   FCC Alters Phone Rate Rules, but Critics
   Sneer at Promise of Big Customer Savings

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
approved sweeping changes in the way it regulates local phone
companies' rates for interstate services and promised
billions of dollars in savings for customers over the next
four years.
   The FCC's modified price-cap system was designed to keep a
lid on rates for broad categories of services while giving
the phone companies flexibility to quickly raise or lower
prices and incentives to operate more efficiently. If the
phone companies can boost efficiency, their reward is higher
profits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The price-cap plan, which goes into effect Jan. 1, is
mandatory for the seven regional Bell companies and GTE
Corp.'s local telephone operations. It is optional for
smaller phone companies. The commission's nearly unanimous
vote -- Commissioner Ervin Duggan dissented to part of the
plan -- comes a year and a half after the agency adopted
price caps for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   The commission's action applies to fees charged to
long-distance carriers and big companies for access to local
telephone networks. The agency figures it could reduce
long-distance rates by slightly more than $2.8 billion over
the next four years compared with rates under the current
regulatory system, which allows companies to earn a specified
return on specified investments.
   At yesterday's meeting, the commission also voted to lower
the allowed rate of return to 11.25% from 12% for local phone
companies -- including the hundreds that won't be covered
under price caps. The agency said the lower rate strikes a
balance between phone companies' continued access to capital
markets and fair rates for customers. The commission figures
the new rate, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will cut fees
for access to local phone networks by $337 million, of which
$317 million is attributed to the Baby Bells and GTE.
   The FCC believes the price-cap plan gives phone companies
an incentive to lower their costs and operate more
efficiently, translating into lower rates and better service
for customers. Most phone customers, the agency claims, will
see indirect benefits as long-distance companies, which buy
services that allow access to the local phone networks, pass
along savings.
   The plan drew swift criticism from user and consumer
groups. "This isn't price caps. It's profit-inflating, lagged
rate-of-return regulation," complained Gene Kimmelman,
legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America.
The outcome for most consumers, he said, will probably be
higher prices for long-distance service.
   "Instead of spurring investment in the telephone networks,
this could choke it," said Brian Moir, a Washington lawyer
who represents the International Communications Association,
a group of big corporate telecommunications users.
   Commissioner Duggan raised similar concerns in his partial
dissent, saying he feared higher rates would result from a
complicated price-capping formula for subscriber line access
to local phone networks.
   Analysts, however, were enthusiastic about the
commission's decision. "In real terms, the Bells will earn
more money in 1991," said Jack Grubman of PaineWebber. Their
productivity gains, he said, far exceed the gains implied by
the FCC's price-cap mechanism.
   Eventually, the new regulatory plan "will begin to
differentiate the companies, separating the wheat from the
chaff," said Robert B. Morris III of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., who
nevertheless raised some concerns about the long-term
implications. "Clearly in the short term, it is constructive
for the Bells," he said. "But it remains to be seen how the
industry will manage this."
   Under the commission's plan, the caps will be applied to
four large "baskets" of service. The commission set limits on
price fluctuations for service categories within those
baskets. Much of the debate in recent months has focused on
an algebraic equation used to calculate the price cap for
subscriber line access to local networks, and the local
companies were busy yesterday testing how that formula will
work in real life.
   "We're running the numbers right now," said Linda Burr,
director of federal regulatory matters at Pacific Telesis
Group's Pacific Bell unit. "In general, though, we're happy
with the FCC's decision."
   The price-cap formula doesn't abandon traditional rate of
return regulation, which allows phone companies to earn a
specified return on their investment base. The commission
also said it will continue collecting phone company cost data
as well as information on service standards as a way of
monitoring consumer benefits under price caps. The commission
is using July 1, 1990, rates as a starting point for
price-cap indexes, adjusted down to reflect the new 11.25%
rate of return.
   To determine the price cap, the agency is using a formula
that measures inflation, costs beyond a company's control
such as changes in tax laws, and expected productivity gains.
To solve bitter disputes over the productivity measure, the
commission offered a compromise: It adopted a plan that
assumes a 3.3% annual productivity increase, but lets phone
companies opt for 4.3%. Phone companies can switch annually.
   Those that sign up for the more rigorous 4.3% adjustment
can retain a larger share of their earnings. They can earn a
return of 13.25% on their investment before splitting further
profits 50-50 with customers. After reaching 17.25%, all
profits will be returned to customers. With the 3.3% factor,
phone companies start sharing profits with customers when
their return reaches 12.25%, and earnings above 16.25% will
be returned to customers.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   McKernan and Brennan, Their Former Civility
   In Shreds, Fight a Topsy-Turvy Battle in Maine

CONGRESS (CNG)
</GV>
<LP>
   ROCKLAND, Maine -- Up here among the tranquil pine groves
and birches, the most bitter fight in Maine political history
is brewing.
   On one side is the incumbent Republican governor, himself
a former congressman and the husband of a popular
congresswoman. On the other side is the Democratic
congressman from the southern district of the state, himself
a former two-term governor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two, Gov. John McKernan and Rep. Joseph Brennan,
swapped jobs four years ago in a celebration of civility
played out in the drawing rooms of Augusta's Blaine House,
the elegant governor's mansion with its two-toned mahogany
and birch floor. But the political quadrille, fashioned in a
state where voters' ears search for the call of the lonely
loon and the coastal foghorn rather than the charge and
countercharge of political rhetoric, has turned into a
quarrel.
   Now Gov. McKernan, struggling with a regional economic
downturn that may turn five of the six New England governors
out of office, and Rep. Brennan, impatient after four years
of exile in the back benches of Congress, are engaged in an
election fight that has shattered the serenity of a state
where, as turn-of-the-century writer Rosalind Richards wrote,
the fragrance distilled by the needles of the white pine,
black spruce and balsam fir is "surely the very breath of New
England."
   The result is a close, acrid campaign that has left even
independent observers with a vague sense of uneasiness. "We
don't know how to handle a race where someone isn't up 30
points," says Christian Potholm, a Bowdoin College political
scientist. "This is the first time we have had two
heavyweights in the ring at the same time."
   Now that the political idyll of Mr. McKernan and Mr.
Brennan has gone sour, all of the assumptions of the state's
politics have turned upside down and inside out.
   "I don't understand this campaign at all," says Anthony
Buxton, an Augusta attorney and former Democratic state
chairman. "The incumbent is running like a challenger and the
challenger is running like an incumbent. The Republican is
saying he's a progressive and the Democrat is saying he's a
fiscal conservative."
   The fight is being conducted against the backdrop of
economic distress that has prompted three Democratic
governors in New England not to seek re-election this autumn
and has imperiled both Edward DiPrete, the GOP governor of
Rhode Island, and Mr. McKernan. Only GOP Gov. Judd Gregg in
devoutly Republican New Hampshire seems safe.
   Although Maine -- more commodity-oriented and less
high-tech than the five other states of the region -- has
weathered the storm better than its sister states, the
real-estate free fall hasn't hit bottom yet. There is
apprehension among bankers and uncertainty among workers at
Bath Iron Works, the state's biggest employer and, with its
trade in warships, a leading indicator of the economic
consequences of the end of the Cold War. The Maine State
Planning Office reported recently that second-quarter taxable
retail sales in the state had dropped 5% from a year earlier
and -- two other warning signals -- that building-supply and
automobile sales were down 12%. The fiscal year ended June 30
was the first year ever that retail sales in Maine dropped
below the previous year.
   "I could have picked a better time to run for
re-election," Mr. McKernan says. "I'm the guy in office when
there's a lot of legitimate concern about where the economy
is going. The economy was red hot -- and then it dropped
dead. But this condition didn't start at the bridge between
New Hampshire and Maine. It's everywhere up here in New
England."
   The economy gave Mr. Brennan the opening to attempt his
return to the governor's office. He's criticized Gov.
McKernan's handling of a $210 million projected budget
shortfall -- the governor boasts of having closed it without
raising new taxes -- and set off a series of thrusts and
parries that dominated the campaign for months.
   Rep. Brennan is warning that the next governor "will end
up facing the biggest fiscal mess in Maine history," and is
charging that Mr. McKernan's budget, which calls for
double-digit growth in general revenue at a time when the
economy is flat, is so "phony" that it can be balanced only
if "Santa Claus deposits huge checks right after the
election."
   Mr. McKernan's response in a recent televised debate: "We
don't have a `fiscal mess' in Augusta. That's what they have
in Massachusetts. We have tight financial times." In an
interview, the governor adds that his rival "would have
handled this the way Michael Dukakis did, and we'd have had
$100 million in new taxes."
   Even so, the economy has hurt Gov. McKernan's prospects,
especially among flinty Republicans who pride themselves on
their fiscal rectitude and are, as Mr. Brennan crows,
"offended at the way the finances have been handled." Charles
Moreshead, a former Republican chairman supporting Rep.
Brennan, says the ailing economy may not be Mr. McKernan's
fault "but since we are in this mess, I don't think McKernan
can pull us out of it."
   Gov. McKernan says the state's economic condition is
"manageable," and he hopes to use a second term to
restructure the state's education-funding formulas and
increase the school year, currently a low 170 days, to 180 or
even 190 days -- an emotional issue in a state where, just
this month, some authorities closed schools so youngsters
could help pick the record blueberry crop.
   For his part, Rep. Brennan wants to "jump start" the
economy by getting more than $200 million of construction
projects under way, by seeking a bond issue to provide
reduced mortgages and spur home construction, and by
providing matching funds to communities to improve downtown
areas.
   But Gov. McKernan's strategy is to move the debate off the
economy. He believes, moreover, that his winning margin could
come from independent and Democratic women who might be drawn
into his camp by his wife, GOP Rep. Olympia Snowe; by his
appointments of women to top cabinet jobs, and by his
longtime support for abortion rights. Rep. Brennan was a late
convert to the abortion-rights movement.
   The race between the two men underlines a pervasive
distrust of Washington and discomfort with the federal
government. "The fact that both of us left Congress to run
for governor tells you a lot," says Gov. McKernan.
   The governor says he's "not patient enough for Congress."
Rep. Brennan, who lived with his widowed sister in a
Washington suburb and grew weary of his 30-minute commute
through crowded urban streets, seems to have felt diminished
by his journey from the governor's mansion to the rear of the
congressional pack.
   Besides, Maine has its lures. Rep. Brennan, for example,
relinquished his spot in the House seniority queue in 1987
when he held onto the Maine governorship for a few extra days
so as to serve out every moment of his term. Today, he
stations his press secretary, Barbara Reinertsen, in Portland
rather than on Capitol Hill, where most House press
secretaries work. He has returned to Maine the past 70
weekends in a row.
   With two familiar figures contending for the same office,
a lot of voters find the decision wrenching. "This is one
election in the country where the voters won't feel they're
choosing the lesser of two evils," says Douglas Rooks, the
editorial-page editor of the Kennebec Journal newspaper. "A
lot of people are going to be making up their minds in the
car on the way to the polls."

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The results of a large community-based
clinical study confirm anecdotal evidence that the
adminstration of a sprayed drug greatly affects the
prevention of the leading cause of death of AIDS patients
   The drug, aerosolized pentamidine, helps in the prevention
of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). The study, published
in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine,
shows the administration of varying doses of the drug -- from
30 milligrams to 300 milligrams -- over 18 months to 408
patients in 13 treatment centers in the San Francisco area.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The patients who received the highest dosage, 300 mg.
every four weeks, suffered the fewest cases of PCP. "There is
a clear trend here, that more is better," said Dr. Gifford S.
Leoung, assistant clinical professor at University of
California at San Francisco and the study's principal
investigator.
   A separate but related study found that a new oral
treatment for first episodes of PCP is as effective as the
most common treatment and has fewer side effects. The study,
published in the same issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine, found that 92% of the 60 patients responded well
whether treated with the new drug, trimethoprim-dapsone, or
the standard treatment, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. But
only 30% of the patients taking the new drug had to stop
treatment because of severe side effects, compared with 57%
of the patients on the standard drug.
   The two most common side effects reported from the
standard drug were hepatitis and neutropenia, which is a
decrease in infection-fighting white blood cells.

   NEW YORK -- Stocks fell and bonds rose on comments by
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that investors
deciphered to mean the Fed won't be turning on the money
spigot soon.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13.86 points on
expanding volume to 2557.43. Bond investors, reassured that
Mr. Greenspan is a determined inflation fighter, bid prices
higher, and the dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies for the same reason.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stock investors have been hoping the Fed would ease
interest rates to keep the economy from slipping into a
recession. But in testimony before the House, Mr. Greenspan
indicated he remains less concerned about the threat of
recession than he is about surging inflation.
   Though the market still is focused on oil prices, said
Jack Conlon, head of equities at Rothschild Inc., Mr.
Greenspan called the tune yesterday. "The market didn't get
what it expected," he said. "It was looking for more
significant easing. Instead, the Fed seems to be locked in
neutral. That's disappointing."
   Some stocks tumbled. Merck, for example, plunged as much
as 4 on an analyst's negative report about a promising new
drug; the stock ended down 3 1/8 at 76 7/8. And American
General sank 6 3/8 to 33 5/8, affecting other takeover
stocks. The company said it was having trouble selling itself
to fend off an unwanted suitor.
   The result: "Two gaping holes" in the limelight stocks
that "certainly doesn't help the cause," Mr. Conlon said.
   Stocks didn't react to a drop in oil prices; the October
crude-oil futures contract fell 23 cents a barrel to $33.18.
As long as oil isn't making new highs, "stocks won't be
following oil," said Sal Gilbertie, oil-futures trader at
Merrill Lynch. "The stock market is getting used to intraday
volatility."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 147.5 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues led
advancers, 883 to 599.
   Bond prices rose one-half point, or $5 for each $1,000 of
face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond fell to 9.01%.
   The dollar rose against most currencies. In late New York
trading, the dollar was up to 1.5715 marks from 1.5530 marks
Tuesday. But it edged down to 137.52 yen from 137.85 yen a
day earlier.

   Tyco Toys Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to
acquire Nasta International Inc. for a sweetened price of
$1.25 per share, up from $1 a share, and extended the offer
until Oct. 3.
   Tyco Toys of Mount Laurel, N.J., said the companies also
reached an agreement, subject to certain conditions, to
settle three lawsuits brought in response to Tyco's original
tender offer. The settlement reflects the new offer price and
includes an agreement to pay certain attorney fees and
expenses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As of Sept. 17, 607,965 shares were tendered under the
original offer, which would increase Tyco's stake in New
York-based Nasta to 86%, from its current 74% stake. The
offer is not conditioned on any minimum number of shares
being tendered and the new price applies to shares already
tendered at the previous price.

   Heard on the Street:
   MBIA Feels
   Brunt of Fears
   On Municipals

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Wall Street is suddenly worried about
municipal bond insurers and is taking out its fears with a
vengeance on insurer MBIA.
   With the city of Philadelphia in financial distress and
the condition of other state and local governments worsening,
investors now say a default by one or more issuers of
tax-exempt bonds isn't out of the question.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And if such a default were to occur, the companies that
insure municipal bonds would take a hit. The largest such
firm -- and the only publicly traded one -- is MBIA, based in
Armonk, N.Y., and 27%-owned by Aetna Life &amp; Casualty.
   As recently as June, underwriters sold 6.6 million MBIA
shares to the public at 36 1/4 each. The stock reached 44 in
July. But this week, as fears related to Philadelphia
gathered steam, MBIA shares plummeted 3 1/2 Tuesday and a
further 3 3/8 yesterday to close at 28 1/2.
   Yesterday's slump in the stock occurred even though MBIA
announced that it would reinstitute a share-buy-back program
to acquire as many as one million of its common shares.
Meanwhile Fund American Cos.,which owns 23.5% of MBIA, fell 1
3/4 to 44 7/8 yesterday while Cigna, which owns 11.6%, rose
slightly.
   "There is a perception that with cities there isn't any
risk, and that isn't true," says Mark Cohen, head of the
financial guaranty rating group at Fitch Investors Service, a
credit-rating concern. "Cities and counties go through
periods of indigestion. The question is whether it's fatal."
   The immediate cause of the slide in MBIA's stock seems to
be that it insures $122 million of Philadelphia's
general-obligation bonds, entailing total debt service of
$197 million. It also insures a larger amount of Philadelphia
bonds backed by "dedicated" revenue streams, such as those of
the local airport.
   Yesterday, MBIA quickly moved to calm investors' fears by
pointing out that its exposure to Philadelphia is relatively
modest, compared with the company's capital base of $773
million.
   If Philadelphia were to default on its general-obligation
bonds, MBIA would be on the hook first for $9 million in
1991, then for $29 million more in 1992. MBIA, which
guarantees both principal and interest payments, doesn't take
any reserve. Thus, if it were forced to bail out an issuer,
the total would come out of its earnings.
   However, it's unlikely that a full write-off would be
necessary. Moreover, the par value of Philadelphia
general-obligation bonds insured by MBIA -- which don't fully
mature until the year 2016 -- is less than its 1989 pretax
profit of $135 million.
   MBIA says that it has never had a claim, a boast that few
other insurers can make. Standard &amp; Poor's yesterday
reaffirmed that bonds insured by MBIA are rated Triple-A. An
S&amp;P analyst added: "We have no problems with the credit."
   At the very least, the municipal bond market values
MBIA-insured bonds much more highly than non-insured issues.
According to MBIA, Philadelphia bonds that it has insured
yield 1.57 percentage points less than uninsured bonds --
meaning the insured bonds are considered less risky by
investors.
   As with most insurers, MBIA earns money on its investment
portfolio, which totals $1.63 billion. Unlike most others,
MBIA also makes a profit on insurance underwriting.
   Essentially, bulls on MBIA's stock see America's crumbling
inner-city infrastructure as proof that the volume of
municipal-bond issues -- and thus of insurance -- should
rise.
   According to MBIA, the total volume of municipal bond
offerings in the U.S. increased 6% in the first half of 1990.
The percentage of such bond issues carrying insurance edged
up to 27%, from 24% in the first half of 1989.
   Harvey H. Bundy, an analyst with William Blair who
recommends MBIA stock, says: "A lot of places {cities} don't
look so good, but all of these problems are ones that
politicians are going to have to solve."
   He adds that when MBIA insures a bond, it collects the
entire fee up-front but books the fee into its earnings over
the life of the bond. MBIA's deferred fees, which will show
up as profit in later years, have a current net value of
about $110 million.
   "I like the stock because of the predictability of the
income stream," Mr. Bundy says, adding: "The stock market is
worried that every gnat is part of a swarm, and that every
mosquito carries malaria."
   MBIA's stock, however, still trades at a premium to its
roughly $23-a-share book value. And, unlike other insurers,
that book value doesn't reflect reserves for potential
problems.
   MBIA's total exposure as of June 30 was $148 billion,
equal to 191 times its capital. Mr. Cohen says that this
multiple -- a measure of an insurer's level of risk -- is the
highest in the industry. He added, however, that without
knowing the quality of a company's credits, it is difficult
to judge the true level of risk.
   MBIA said it takes reserves on a case-by-case basis. It
said it doesn't know how much it would reserve if
Philadelphia defaulted. Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered its
rating on Philadelphia's general-obligation bonds to
triple-C, the lowest rating for bonds that aren't yet behind
in payments.
   S&amp;P also lowered ratings on bonds of related city
authorities and water, sewer and airport revenue bonds.
Following the recent scuttling of a plan to float short-term
notes, officials have said that Philadelphia is in danger of
running out of cash late this year.
   The concern among bearish investors is that problems may
spread beyond Philadelphia. MBIA, in a conference call with
investors yesterday, disclosed that it is monitoring 130
issues -- representing about 3% of its exposure -- for
possible problems.
   Most of these bonds aren't thought to be in as serious a
shape as Philadelphia's. "The situation is confined to
Philadelphia," David Elliott, MBIA's president, said in the
conference call. "We don't see any similar situations, " he
added.
   But Mr. Elliott also noted that until quite recently,
Philadelphia wasn't on its watch list either. "It happened
very fast," he said.
   Thus, some investors wonder how anyone can be sure that
other cities, towns and agencies -- especially in the
depressed Northeast -- won't suddenly develop problems.
   Cities in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and
Michigan are of particular concern. And with Congress now
thinking of cutting the federal tax deduction for state and
local income taxes, all municipalities could find it tougher
to raise funds.
   "You have very high state and local government deficits,
which are starting to bust out of budget projections," says
one municipal bond specialist, adding: "There will be other
Philadelphias."

   Corroon's Stock
   Plunges as Aon
   Backs Off Its Bid

   Corroon &amp; Black Corp. shares dropped sharply after Aon
Corp. reiterated that it will abandon its $40-a-share bid if
Corroon's board continues to oppose it.
   Shares of the New York insurance broker tumbled $3.50 in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, closing
at $32.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tuesday, Corroon rejected Aon's $840 million bid, and said
it would proceed with its earlier plan to merge with Willis
Faber PLC of London. The announcement of the rejection of
Aon's bid was made after the close of trading Tuesday.
   Investors received conflicting signals yesterday
concerning Aon's intentions: Prior to the company's threat to
walk away, people close to the Chicago concern said Aon
hadn't ruled out a hostile tender offer for Corroon. But an
Aon official said that a release by the company specifically
meant that "we will not go hostile" -- the market apparently
concluded that Aon is serious about not pursuing a bid in the
face of a rejection by Corroon.
   Aon reiterated that it will withdraw its bid if Corroon's
board "denies us a hearing," or if the company, "after a
hearing, persists in its position that the Willis Faber
transaction . . . will serve the best interests of Corroon's
stockholders."
   Aon had said previously it was "not interested in pursuing
any transaction which is opposed" by Corroon's board. But
after Corroon's rejection of the bid Tuesday, Aon immediately
said it wouldn't pull its proposal. The company said it was
"incredible that (Corroon) came to this conclusion without
even talking to us or to our investment bankers about our
proposal."
   The earlier decision not to withdraw the proposal "was
part of our request to meet with the Corroon board -- if it
wasn't on the table, there wouldn't be anything to meet
about," said Patrick G. Ryan, Aon's chairman, chief executive
officer and president in a release.
   Traders said Aon's statement yesterday that it would back
away from its bid significantly increased the chances that
Corroon will be able to proceed with its plan to merge with
Willis Faber. Under that deal, Corroon holders would receive
Willis stock currently worth $30.87 for each of their shares.
   Some traders, though, held out a slim hope that some
Corroon directors might be willing to listen to Aon's
proposal.
   The stern criticism Aon leveled at Corroon "is designed to
give Corroon holders more ammunition for a lawsuit against
the company for rejecting a higher bid," said Allan Nichols,
an insurance analyst with James Capel &amp; Co. in London.
   "I can't believe the board was united in turning a deaf
ear to Pat Ryan. The view of shareholders is that this is
truly outrageous conduct on the part of the Corroon board,"
said Michael Smith, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, a unit
of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   He added that the board is "putting faith on (a) Time
Warner ruling" that allows the board to reject the Aon offer
on the basis of what it considers to be the best long-term
benefits to shareholders. Corroon &amp; Black declined to comment
on Aon's statement.
   A relieved Willis Faber, responding to Corroon's Tuesday
decision, said "We're pleased at the outcome and are looking
forward to getting the merger completed."
   In London trading, Willis Faber shares rose 9 pence, to
210 pence -- a price that values the Willis Faber merger at
$648.2 million.

   Time Warner to Create Unit Combining
   Book Publishing, Magazine Operations

   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. is consolidating its
publishing operations into a new unit, Time Warner
Publishing, which will include its magazine business and its
book publishing operation.
   The new entity will be run by Reginald K. Brack, who was
named chairman of Time Warner Publishing. Mr. Brack will
continue as chairman, president and chief executive of Time
Inc. Magazines Co., but will now oversee Time Inc. Book Co.
as well. Kelso Sutton, president of that unit, will now
report to Mr. Brack.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company has been expected to consolidate some
operations to cut costs at the media giant created last year
by the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
However, Mr. Brack said that while merging the two units is a
streamlining measure, it will not result in any staff
reductions and is not aimed at cutting costs. Mr. Brack will
continue reporting directly to Time Warner president Nicholas
J. Nicholas Jr.
   Separately, Time Warner said that Peter R. Haje, a senior
corporate partner with the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind
Wharton &amp; Garrison, will become executive vice president and
general counsel of Time Warner. Mr. Haje assumes the general
counsel's duties from Martin Payson, who will continue as
vice chairman of the company. Mr. Haje was the longtime
outside counsel to Warner Communications Inc. prior to its
merger with Time Inc.
   Mr. Brack, who ran Time Inc. Books for a few years in the
1980s, is expected to focus in part on Time Warner's plans to
create new products drawn from both magazines and books. In
the past year, some of those products have included Sports
Illustrated for Kids Books, published by Little, Brown and
Warner Books; Warner Books paperbacks written by Time
magazine reporters; and an upcoming cookbook series from
Warner Books based on Cooking Light magazines.
   But some analysts and industry observers were perplexed by
the decision to consolidate books and magazines, especially
since there are no savings. Jessica J. Reif, a First Boston
Corp. analyst, said "the synergy they talk about, they can do
now as separate companies, and if there are not savings, why
put it together?"
   In an interview yesterday, Mr. Brack said the unit's first
moves would be to use an established book distribution system
in Western Europe to push subscriptions of international
editions of Time and Fortune. Mr. Brack said book
distribution could be expanded in Asia and Australia, where
Time Warner has established magazine distribution. The
company will bring together 30 million customers culled from
magazine subscribers and book club members, Mr. Brack said.
   Mr. Brack now oversees two operations whose businesses
have been battered in a slowed-down economy. Almost all of
Time Warner's major magazines are down in advertising pages
through the first half of 1990. Although Time Warner's
Book-of-the-Month Club is the industry leader, the book club
business in the U.S. is suffering. Like other publishers,
profit margins are under pressure at the Little, Brown and
Warner Books divisions.
   Time Inc. Magazines in 1989 had an operating profit of
$318 million on revenue of $1.9 billion. Time Inc. Books had
a loss of $23 million because of the sale of its Scott,
Foresman unit. Revenue was $1.1 billion.
   At one point in the mid-1980s, Messrs. Sutton and Brack
were peers. But in 1986, Mr. Brack, then president of the
book company, swapped jobs with Mr. Sutton, who was then
running the magazine company.
   Mr. Brack's track record at Time Inc. Magazines is mixed.
He dismantled the Magazine Development Group, which had
produced only expensive duds such as TVCable Week and Picture
Week, and put magazine development into the hands of editors
at established Time magazines. Sports Illustrated editors
spawned Sports Illustrated for Kids, and a Time for Kids is
under development by the staff of Time magazine. Fortune,
meanwhile, is developing a student version.
   Mr. Brack has also successfully moved Time Warner into
joint ventures which include joint ownership in new
magazines, or investments in publications started by
entrepreneurs. Time Warner has partial ownership in Whittle
Communications L.P., Hippocrates and In Health magazines, and
Emerge magazine. It recently took over full ownership of
Parenting magazine, where it initially had a half-interest.
   But bigger, more expensive projects -- notably the
eight-month-old Entertainment Weekly -- have had shaky
starts, and some critics question Time Warner's decision to
make such investments in the first place, considering its
merger-related debt. To date, analysts estimate Entertainment
Weekly has cost Time Warner more than $50 million. The
magazine's founding editor resigned early on, and the
publication was redesigned and redirected after early issues
turned off both readers and advertisers.

September 1988, for Seeq's use under the company's restated
1982 stock-option plan. Since then, Seeq hasn't bought back
any of the stock.

   A federal district court threw out Chevron Corp.'s
challenge to the Pennzoil Co. purchase of a stake in the San
Francisco-based oil giant.
   U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti of San Francisco found
that Pennzoil didn't violate antitrust law when it bought
8.8% of Chevron's common stock outstanding for $2.1 billion
in open-market purchases last fall. Chevron had sought to
block the purchase on grounds that Pennzoil misrepresented
its intentions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pennzoil said it was "delighted" with the ruling. The
Houston-based company has spent $2.1 billion of the $2.6
billion it won in its highly publicized legal battle with
Texaco Inc. to buy into Chevron. In July, Pennzoil said it
was considering additional purchases of Chevron stock with
the remaining Texaco settlement proceeds.
   Chevron said it would consider an appeal, but must review
the opinion first. "We're disappointed with the outcome,"
said Kenneth T. Derr, Chevron's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Pennzoil has maintained that it bought the stake for
investment purposes.

   Sterling Skids as Bundesbank Chief Airs
   Concerns About Pegging Pound to Mark

   NEW YORK -- Sterling tumbled after the Bundesbank
president said "big problems" in Britain's economy raise
questions about whether the pound can be pegged tightly to
the mark within the European Monetary System.
   Later, in answer to a question from a Reuters reporter,
Karl Otto Poehl said he didn't pass judgment on whether the
pound is ready to enter the EMS's exchange-rate mechanism.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the market reacted strongly because his earlier
remarks seemed to fit a pattern of sniping between Britain
and Germany over European cooperation, said Marc Cohen, a
corporate foreign-exchange trader in New York for Fuji Bank.
   In late New York trading, sterling was quoted at $1.8845,
down from $1.9140 late Tuesday in New York. Against the mark,
the British currency slid to 2.9615 marks late in the day
from 2.9724 marks late Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, the dollar rose against the mark but slid
against the Japanese currency. Late in the New York trading
day, the U.S. currency was at 1.5715 marks, up from 1.5530
marks late Tuesday. It declined to 137.52 yen from 137.85
yen.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 137.35 yen, down from 138.05 yen at the close there
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5695 marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5526
marks.
   Pound selling on the Poehl comments in the early European
afternoon began in the mark cross sector and spread to the
dollar and yen. Similarly, it was a technical floor in the
sterling-mark price that limited the pound's losses
generally.
   The British currency has appreciated about 14% since early
summer on speculation of imminent entry into the
exchange-rate mechanism -- which would give sterling a stable
price range as well as its current advantage of high domestic
interest rates. Such rates make a currency attractive to
international investors.
   But the German central banker's remarks cast a cloud over
sterling. His opinion is considered crucial because Europe's
exchange-rate mechanism is anchored by the mark. Moreover,
the Bundesbank, along with other European central banks,
would be obliged to spend its own money to support the pound
were the British currency to depreciate after joining the
exchange-rate mechanism.
   In a thinly veiled reference to Britain, Mr. Poehl said a
country with "three times the inflation" of Germany can't
expect to peg its currency to the mark for long without
requiring "enormous" intra-European Community transfer
payments. He didn't elaborate.
   A U.K. Treasury spokesman responded: "We have announced
our intention to enter {the exchange-rate mechanism} when the
time is right, and our position remains unchanged."
   Sterling's decline yesterday was exaggerated by the
dollar's firmness after the first hints of Federal Reserve
concern about the greenback's recent losses.
   Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said "the weaker dollar
adds upward pressure to U.S. import prices and hence raises
further concern about inflation and instability."
   Erik Lehtis, a New York dealer with France's Credit
Agricole, said "Greenspan's suggestion that there's a
downside to the dollar's decline gave the market ideas that
he won't let the dollar fall any further."
   But currency traders plucked Mr. Greenspan's comment about
the dollar out of a wide-ranging testimony that many
considered contradictory. "People were picking parts {of the
testimony} to trade on," said Jeff Mondschein, managing
director of foreign exchange for Continental Bank in Chicago.
   Fed watchers were uncertain what action, if any, Mr.
Greenspan would take to support the dollar. His concern
seemed to put him at odds with the Treasury, which is thought
to be a dominant partner in joint market interventions. On
Monday, Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford called the
dollar's retreat orderly and credited it with helping to
close the U.S. trade deficit.
   Dealers said Mr. Greenspan's remarks appeared to be aimed
at the dollar's mark price, which remains near a record low
of 1.5385 marks, set Aug. 27, and not its yen price, still
about 17 yen above its low of 120.95 yen, set Nov. 24, 1988.
   The dollar ended European dealings moderately stronger,
helped largely by covering of short positions after Mr.
Greenspan's comments. But London dealers said market
participants are still holding substantial short, or
oversold, dollar positions. That should continue to support
the U.S. currency.
   The dollar finished mixed in Tokyo after a session of
active trading, while the yen declined. The dollar was last
quoted Wednesday in Tokyo at 138.05 yen, above 137.68 yen
late Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $386 an ounce, down $1.60. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.1 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$385.55 an ounce.

   Pentagon Plans
   On Permanent
   Presence in Gulf

   Officials Quietly Seek Force
   Of Almost 10,000, Bases,
   After Crisis Is Resolved

   DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia -- Senior U.S. military officers are
pushing to keep a permanent force of nearly 10,000 American
troops in this country and to secure air bases throughout the
Persian Gulf after the current crisis is resolved.
   According to senior military officers here and in
Washington, the Army and Air Force are quietly drafting
long-term plans to stay in the gulf in force. The plans also
call for leaving behind huge stockpiles of U.S. weapons and
equipment for use in any future emergency.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But in Washington, top civilian officials at the Pentagon
and elsewhere in the Bush administration strongly denied that
there is a U.S. policy to establish a permanent presence
here. Their comments could presage an internal battle over
what to do when the crisis with Iraq ends, pitting the
uniformed military against civilian leaders.
   Asked about the military planning, chief Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams said flatly: "We have no intention of
doing that." He added, "We've been too busy dealing with the
crisis at hand. No one has been authorized to do any planning
beyond that."
   Mr. Williams said, "Maybe somebody is spinning out some
eventuality. The Pentagon is a big place, and there are lots
of people in the Pentagon who think they have the big
picture. But as far as I know, there is no such plan." State
Department officials, who have repeatedly denied any interest
in a permanent ground presence here, expressed similar
surprise and dismay at the officers' planning.
   Military officers said the plans haven't been approved by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Chairman Colin Powell of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, or President Bush. But the planning is
being handled at a high level in the Army, including some
officers on the staff of Army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl Vuono.
And Saudi officials said the issue has been discussed
informally with them.
   The Saudis, for their part, appear lukewarm about the
idea. "We have strongly resisted such a step over the years,"
noted one Saudi official familiar with the latest
discussions. "But that's clearly what the {U.S.} Army wants,
and the opposition may be reduced this time."
   Even informal talk about permanent bases -- a goal the
U.S. has sought for years -- could make Arab allies nervous
and strain the coalition against Iraq.
   Nevertheless, the Army's leadership is quietly drafting
plans to maintain at least a heavy mechanized brigade and
support forces here indefinitely, according to the officers.
That would total 7,000 or 8,000 troops, and the Army wants to
leave enough hardware on the ground here to support five or
six times that many troops in case of another crisis.
   The Air Force, meanwhile, hopes to win permanent bases in
Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, according to
military planners. And the Marines are beating the drums to
have more of their tanks and other weapons placed on
permanent floating storage sites in the Middle East.
   The Pentagon's efforts contradict public signals by the
Bush administration. Just last Friday, on a visit to Syria,
Secretary of State Baker declared that "We have no intention
or desire to establish a permanent military ground presence
in this region." After initially hinting that a new "regional
security structure" for the Middle East might involve U.S.
troops, Mr. Baker repeatedly has said any U.S. contribution
would be likely to be limited to the naval forces the U.S.
has maintained in and near the gulf for 40 years.
   Separately, administration officials said they believe
that 15 pro-Iranian terrorists, whose fate has been linked to
that of the U.S. hostages in Lebanon, are in Iran or on their
way there. The terrorists, who were being held by Kuwait for
a series of 1983 bombings, include the brother-in-law of a
kidnapper who holds two U.S. hostages in Lebanon and has
demanded that the group be freed in exchange for the U.S.
hostages.
   With the prisoners in Iranian hands, another release of
U.S. hostages might be possible. But administration officials
aren't expecting anything soon.
   Meanwhile, Iraq announced that it is confiscating assets
of nations that are participating in economic sanctions
against Iraq. The order applies to assets of U.S. companies
doing business in Iraq. The U.S. government didn't have any
immediate estimate of the value of U.S. assets involved. The
total probably isn't great, though.
   "It is not clear from the Iraqi statement in what form or
against whom the action will be taken," said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. "In any case, actions like
this can only make it more difficult for Iraq to return to
the international community of nations and to restore
economic relations which are crucial for Iraq's long-term
development."
   Meanwhile, the State Department said all Americans who
wish to leave Iraq and Kuwait, and who have been permitted to
do so by Iraqi authorities, will be flown out by Saturday.
Some Americans have chosen to stay, and many others -- mainly
men -- are being refused permission to go.

   Six months after rejecting a dissident group's $18.50 a
share, or $140.5 million, offer, Justin Industries Inc.
rejected a second offer from the group, this one for $18 a
share.
   In a letter sent yesterday to the dissidents, led by Perry
H. Sutherland of Kansas City, Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of
New York, Justin chairman John Justin said, "It should be
apparent to you that since the board has rejected your
previous proposal to consider $18.50 a share, there is even
less reason for the board to consider $18 a share."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In their latest offer, made Friday in a letter to the
Justin board, the dissidents contended that Justin's planned
acquisition of Tony Lama Co., El Paso, Texas, which lost $1.8
million in 1989, had lowered the value of Justin.
   But in his response, Mr. Justin asserted that the planned
$9-a-share, or $18 million, acquisition of Tony Lama had
"substantially enhanced" the value of Justin, based in Fort
Worth, Texas. Both Justin and Tony Lama make boots, and
Justin also makes bricks and building materials.
   In the letter outlining their offer, the dissidents said
that if rejected, they would seek other strategies for
acquiring Justin, though they conceded that they had not yet
arranged financing for a takeover.
   Mr. Sutherland said he had no response to the rejection
letter.

   Valhi Inc. and NL Industries Inc., two companies

entered into a definitive agreement on a previously announced
plan to merge. Under the plan, Valhi, a chemical and
industrial concern that currently holds about 66% of NL,
would acquire the remaining equity in the petroleum services
concern in a transaction valued at $411 million.
   The companies said the merger will not be completed if the
average price of Valhi common shares stays below $9.50 a
share for the 20 trading days ending two trading days before
a shareholder vote on the proposal. Valhi can terminate the
merger if its average price for the same period is above $13
a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consummation of the merger is subject to, among other
things, approval by Valhi's shareholders and approval by a
majority of NL shares present and voting, other than those
held by Valhi. Both the NL and Valhi boards have already
approved the merger agreement, the companies said in a joint
statement.
   The companies said they expect to mail a joint proxy
statement to shareholders in late October and that their
respective meetings of shareholders, called to consider the
transaction, would probably be held in December.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Instron's Management May Suffer
   Bad Side Effects From Poison Pill

   Like all companies with "poison pill" provisions, Instron
Corp. hoped that its takeover defense would protect the
company from hostile suitors.
   But now Instron may be getting a taste of its own
medicine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the provisions of Instron's pill, stockholders gain
the right to purchase additional shares at below-market
prices whenever an individual or group gains control of 20%
or more of the company's shares. This makes the company more
expensive for a raider to buy.
   But what happens when the existing management group,
rather than a raider, breaks the 20% barrier with no intent
to change the status quo?
   A lawsuit filed earlier this month in a Massachusetts
state court claims it means that the rest of the shareholders
must be granted the lucrative stock-purchase rights
guaranteed by the pill -- even if that outcome turns the
obvious intent of the anti-takeover provision on its head.
   In this case, the lawsuit alleges, Instron's own founders
triggered the poison pill when they declared in a news
release in July that they and family members owned about 39%
of Instron's stock. Ironically, the purpose of the news
release was to oppose a takeover, not to start one.
   While many companies' poison pills explicitly state that
officers and controlling shareholders are exempt from the
pill's provisions, Instron's pill contains no such exemption.
Stephen Carr, a partner at Goodwin, Procter &amp; Hoar, which
drafted the pill, said such a provision wasn't necessary. He
said no "group" of shareholders owns 20% or more and that the
news release didn't create such a group.
   Takeover experts said the lawsuit apparently marks the
first time that controlling shareholders or managers have
been accused of triggering a poison pill.
   "This certainly is a new wrinkle," said Alan Bromberg, a
professor of securities law at Southern Methodist University
in Dallas. Mr. Bromberg said that if the Instron founders in
fact authorized the news release or were acting as a
"controlling group," as defined by the poison pill, the novel
suit might actually succeed.
   Stephen Rabinovitz, a Boston investor, filed the lawsuit
on behalf of himself and other Instron shareholders in
Superior Court in Boston. Mr. Rabinovitz's group had said in
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July
that they were interested in acquiring control of Instron, a
Canton, Mass.-based maker of materials testing instruments.
   Michael Schell, a partner at the New York firm of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom who is defending Instron, said
that Mr. Rabinovitz is notorious for "facilitating his own
personal objectives" by "making noise" and filing suits. Mr.
Schell said that Instron intends to vigorously defend against
the suit, although he won't say on what grounds.
   Mr. Schell added that Skadden Arps had no role in writing
the news release or the poison-pill provision.

   PLANNED PARENTHOOD loses appeal over limits on federal
funds abroad.
   The U.S. appeals court in Manhattan upheld a federal
policy banning the use of U.S. funds to "perform or actively
promote abortions" in foreign countries. The federal aid
involved is family-planning assistance from the Agency for
International Development. The money is distributed to
foreign organizations through Planned Parenthood and other
nongovernmental groups in the U.S.
   Planned Parenthood claimed that the rule, adopted by the
Reagan administration in 1984, violated its free-speech
rights by requiring it to enforce restrictions on speech in
order to qualify for the program. But the Second U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals said no rights were violated because Planned
Parenthood wasn't prohibited from using its own money for the
activities.
   "A policy of not subsidizing the exercise of a fundamental
right differs in an important respect from a prohibition on
the exercise of a fundamental right," the appeals-court panel
said. The ruling upheld a lower-court decision dismissing the
case.
   A Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said the organization is
considering whether to appeal.
   ---
   BAN ON SOME TIMBER SUITS is rejected as unconstitutional.
   The ban was contained in the so-called Northwest Timber
Compromise. Congress enacted the law in 1989 to allow for
limited timber harvests for a year in certain old-growth
forests in California and Oregon that are populated by the
northern spotted owl. The law was designed as a temporary, if
forced, truce between warring environmental and timber
interests while a presidential commission developed a final
plan for protecting the owl, recently designated a threatened
species.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a
provision of the legislation requiring federal courts to
dismiss suits challenging the timber sales. Reversing a
lower-court ruling, the appeals court said Congress had
violated the constitutional separation of powers by requiring
the courts to rule in a particular way without changing the
underlying laws that would permit such suits.
   The act expires on Sept. 30; Congress has been considering
extending the law for another year because the presidential
panel report itself has been delayed.
   Todd True, an attorney in Seattle for the Sierra Club
Legal Defense Fund, said environmental groups were still
assessing possible suits. He said the ruling would be a
useful precedent in fighting other attempts by Congress to
bar judicial review of environmental laws.
   Mark Rutzick, an attorney in Portland for the Northwest
Forest Resource Council, a timber industry consortium, added,
however: "To tie up a sale, one must prove that it will have
an unlawful impact on the spotted owl." He also said the
timber group is mulling an appeal.

   FRANCHISEES bring civil racketeering suit against American
Vision.
   In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in New York, eight
franchisees in New York and Georgia allege that American
Vision Centers Inc. profited from store-opening services that
it should have provided at cost and misrepresented the
success of company-owned stores that it sold to franchisees.
The suit also alleges that American Vision claimed
franchisees would make money renewing contact-lens insurance,
then started a division to renew the policies itself.
   The franchisees also claim that American Vision Centers
didn't obtain regulatory approval to sell franchises in New
York state and failed to account for advertising fees --
equal to 6.5% of a franchisee's sales -- that it collected
from franchisees. The suit seeks to recover alleged losses of
more than $1 million, plus treble damages.
   Seth Poppel, American Vision Centers president and chief
operating officer, says the suit is a response to legal and
other actions American Vision Centers has taken against
several of the plaintiffs who allegedly owe his company
money. "The suit is totally without merit," Mr. Poppel says.
"The bulk of our franchisees are profitable and happy." Of
American Vision Centers' 82 stores, 36 are franchisees.
   Mr. Poppel says the failure of numerous franchisees to pay
royalties and other fees has contributed to American Vision
Centers' financial problems.
   The company has reported losses of more than $2.5 million
annually since 1987. During the first half of this year, it
reported further losses of $1.8 million on $18.7 million in
revenue.

   NEWSPAPER loses bid to keep unpublished photographs
confidential.
   The Albuquerque Journal's pictures were taken of a 1985
highway accident in which 62-year-old Eleanor Barton was
killed. Her husband, John Barton, is suing Ford Motor Co. for
negligence and product liability, alleging that a defect in
her car caused the accident. Both Mr. Barton and Ford sought
the newspaper's unused photos and negatives, saying they were
needed to help determine the relative position of the
vehicles involved in the accident.
   Attorneys for the Albuquerque Journal argued that
producing the pictures interfered with the news process in
violation of the paper's First Amendment rights. But State
District Judge Art Encinias in Santa Fe, N.M., ruled that the
photos are "relevant, essential and material" to deciding key
issues in the case. And the New Mexico Supreme Court refused
without comment the newspaper's request to block the
lower-court order.
   Kent Walz, assistant editor of the Albuquerque Journal,
said the paper planned to comply with the order, but it was
still considering an appeal aimed at clarifying the First
Amendment question.

   HARVARD LAW SCHOOL reinstates public-interest law
counseling post.
   Harvard Law School Dean Robert C. Clark has appointed
Stacy DeBroff, a lawyer who isn't a member of the faculty, to
the position of public-interest law counselor. Elimination of
the position last year prompted protests from students.
   A Harvard Law School spokesman said "over 100 students"
have already met with Ms. DeBroff. The keen interest in
finding jobs in the public-interest field seems to be an
indication that "there is a new activism among students
here," he said.
   The counseling position was first established in the late
1970s to help students tap the network of increasingly scarce
public-interest jobs.
   Public-interest law includes such areas as legal aid for
the poor, consumer advocacy and congressional staff work, all
paying much less than associate positions at top private law
firms.

   BCE Inc., parent of Bell Canada, expects to form a group
that will bid for control of Telefonos de Mexico S.A., a BCE
official said.
   As previously reported, the Mexican government intends to
sell a 20% control block in TelMex to a consortium that
includes one or more foreign concerns. The 20% control block
represents just over half of the full-voting shares in the
Mexican telephone monopoly. The government owns just over 50%
of TelMex. It would sell its remaining shares, new
limited-voting shares created under a recapitalization this
summer, at a later date.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The BCE official said putting together a group to bid for
control of Telmex is "a priority" for the Montreal-based
holding company. He said a Mexican concern would own about
half of the consortium while BCE and a U.S. telephone company
would each own about 25%. The BCE official said the company
is in talks with a number of U.S. telephone companies, which
he declined to identify, regarding the bid. He said the
government has set a deadline of Nov. 15 for bids.
   BCE entered the Mexican telecommunications market this
spring as a member of two of the eight consortiums that were
awarded licenses to build and operate cellular telephone
systems in the country. Also this spring, BCE joined forces
with MCI Communications Corp. and others to form a group in
New Zealand that will compete with that country's main
telephone company.

   POSITION WANTED: Super-healthy college graduate,
powerfully motivated, highly competitive, totally
inexperienced, seeks executive post. Will require minimum
three months' time off for athletic pursuits.
                                                                                                       

   A WANT AD LIKE THAT SOUNDS like an adolescent pipe dream
but it fits any American hoping to compete in the Olympic
Games. The average age of a U.S. team member is now a mature
25 years and training expenses for a shot at the gold can hit
$40,000 a year. Unlike state-supported foreign competitors,
most U.S. athletes foot their own bills. Now Ernst &amp; Young, a
$2 billion auditing and consulting firm, is putting them in
the starting blocks.
   In 1977, the U.S. Olympic Committee set up its Olympic Job
Opportunity Program and by 1984 had put 276 athletes on
career paths. That year, Ernst &amp; Young, which handled scoring
for the Los Angeles Games, volunteered to help. By 1988, the
firm had placed 162 more athletes. Since September 1989, 164
Olympic strivers have been placed, a year that topped any
previous non-Olympic year. By the time the 1992 Summer
Olympics start in Barcelona, Spain, Ernst &amp; Young hopes to
have 400 Olympians at work.
   James Taylor, Ernst &amp; Young's marketing director, runs the
placement program. The Olympians, he points out, are
incredibly efficient at sports but naive outside the arena.
To help place the 176 athletes now in the program, he is
using 500 volunteers from the firm's 25,000 employees.
"Mentors" in 28 offices go one-on-one with the athletes,
review their resumes, and use the firm's good offices to
match them with employers.
   Ed Brodie, a senior manager in the New York executive
search operation, has three Olympians on his string, a 1988
gold-winning sprinter and two top fencers. One, runner Andrew
Valman, is working at Eastman Kodak as a sales
representative. Mr. Brodie estimates that he puts in 10 to 20
hours a week on his volunteer job, an important consideration
in a profession that starts the meter when the phone rings.
   In Los Angeles, Elizabeth Hammond spends 25% of her time
on her nine charges. Her job, she says, is to "find a label"
for a candidate's skills. "The athletes," she says, "must
analyze themselves, something they are good at."
   The Olympians offer more than glamour and muscles, Mr.
Taylor points out. "Athletes learn from their failures," he
says, a valuable trait in any employee. The grueling
training, he adds, takes dedication, organization and staying
power, qualities most employers long for.
   Olympic rower Kevin Still, a bronze medalist in the 1988
Seoul Games, is on the fast track at New York insurance
broker Johnson &amp; Higgins in New York. "These guys are our
future," says J&amp;H director Norman Barham. Kayaker Mike
Herbert of Arkansas got to the 1988 Olympics because of his
job at J.C. Penney; the company has hired 27 other athletes
through the OJOP program. "I couldn't have done it without
their help," Mr. Herbert says. Anheuser-Busch has taken on 50
Olympians over the years and vice president Jack McDonald
says "everyone's a winner" in the program.
   What does Ernst &amp; Young get out of all this? The tangibles
are publicity, special invitations to U.S. Olympic Committee
events and the right to put a special torch-and-Olympic-ring
symbol on the company's stationery. But the real plus is the
satisfaction of knowing that the firm is finding post-Olympic
careers for the best amateur athletes in the U.S.

   Real Estate:
   Reichmanns Act
   To Sell Chunk
   Of Real Estate
   ----

   The Reichmann family, which owns Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd., is seeking to sell almost a 20%
partnership interest in its massive U.S. real estate
portfolio.
   John Zuccotti, Olympia &amp; York USA president, declined to
estimate the value of the stake, but real-estate
professionals said the interest could sell for between $200
million and $800 million. Mr. Zuccotti denied speculation
that the company, as with many real estate concerns, has a
cash-flow problem. He added that the planned transaction had
been in the works for many months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Zuccotti said the move is intended to put in the hands
of a single institutional investor minority holdings in
properties controlled by a variety of Reichmann family
members. The corporate entity will be unaffected by the sale,
said O&amp;Y officials.
   The properties, which include commercial projects in New
York City, Boston, San Francisco and other major U.S. cities,
are being shopped to a variety of institutional investors,
although the ultimate buyer is expected to be foreign.
   Lazard Freres &amp; Co. has been retained by the Reichmanns to
handle the sale.
   Observers of O&amp;Y's activities are keenly interested in the
sale because they think it may signal that the Reichmanns are
protecting themselves against a more severe downturn in the
real-estate market.
   One individual who has spoken to family leader Paul
Reichmann said that while Mr. Reichmann does not believe in
the "gloom and doom scenario, it's enough of a possibility
that he's hedging his bets."
   In the past, the Reichmanns have made fortunes by
correctly anticipating swings in the real estate and credit
markets. In perhaps its most prescient move, the company
purchased the Uris family's New York City real-estate
portfolio in 1977 for $320 million. Those properties were
said to have increased tenfold in value during the 1980s.
   O&amp;Y also developed the successful World Financial Center
in the 1980s. Its tenants include the world headquarters of
American Express Co., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., and Dow Jones &amp;
Co., publisher of this newspaper.
   Lately, however, the O&amp;Y's fortunes have taken a slight
turn for the worse, in part because of its heavy investment
in the troubled Campeau Corp.
   Olympia &amp; York also has spent more than $1 billion
building the world's largest real-estate development in the
London docklands. That project, called Canary Wharf, is 50%
leased, but its success is far from certain. The company is
in the midst of securing long-term bank financing from
British and Japanese institutions.
   Some of the company's older, Wall Street-area buildings,
such as one once occupied by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., sit
largely empty.
   Nonetheless, during the past two decades, O&amp;Y has
diversified into a number of industries that provide hedges
against major drops in the real-estate market. It owns a
controlling interest in newsprint producer Abitibi-Price Inc.
and Consumers' Gas Co. It also owns a 73% interest in Gulf
Canada Resources Ltd., which has benefited from the recent
rise in oil prices.

   WASHINGTON -- The impact of the Middle East crisis is
starting to be felt in the U.S. economy, raising
manufacturers' costs, thwarting consumer buying and bringing
widespread uncertainty to businesses across the country,
surveys by the 12 district Federal Reserve banks show.
   The surveys were taken in August and September and provide
some of the first broad looks at the impact of Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, which drove up world oil prices and
ignited fears that the already shaky U.S. economy could fall
into a recession.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While some businesses say the turmoil hasn't affected
them, a variety of others say it has influenced their
activities in the past month and a half.
   In the Southeast, retailers are trimming orders for new
merchandise, anticipating "consumer resistance," according to
economists at the Atlanta Fed. "The general sentiment among
Southeastern retailers is that already weak consumer
confidence has been negatively impacted by the Mideast crisis
and oil price advances during the last six weeks," the
economists reported.
   In the Midwest, steel producers expect higher fuel costs
will further pinch their narrow profit margins, according to
the Cleveland Fed. But because of the weakness in the
economy, the producers say, they can't pass the additional
costs along to consumers.
   In the Mid-Atlantic states from Maryland to the Carolinas,
however, many manufacturers are transferring the burden to
their customers. "Higher oil prices raised manufacturers'
costs and pushed up prices for finished goods," economists at
the Richmond, Va., Fed wrote.
   To cope with higher raw-material prices and transportation
costs, half of the manufacturers surveyed in the Mid-Atlantic
district said they had already raised prices or will do so
soon, while 10% said they will cut employment and one-third
said they will try to trim non-personnel costs.
   Fed officials will use the survey to help guide them when
they meet Oct. 2 to set credit policy for the ensuing six
weeks. Central bank policy makers face some hard choices.
They are under pressure to cushion the weakening economy by
reducing interest rates. But the jump in oil prices that
brought a surge in the country's inflation rate last month
makes them wary of easing credit.
   Overall, the Fed survey depicts an economy that is clearly
deteriorating. Banks continue to tighten lending standards in
many regions. At the same time, loan demand is down at many
institutions. Numerous retailers throughout the country saw
their sales slow down in the past month, and a number of them
find sales below year-earlier levels. Manufacturers' reports
generally range from moderate expansion to decline. And
construction is down just about everywhere.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan pointed to
the regional surveys in testimony before the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress yesterday, saying they show "a greater
caution on the part of firms in the acquisition of capital
goods, in some cases because of increased uncertainty"
produced by the oil shock.
   About half of the manufacturers polled by the Boston Fed
say they have pared capital spending plans or made "judicious
delays" in projects.
   One of the areas where the Persian Gulf situation has
taken a clear toll is consumer attitudes. Local surveys
conducted after the Iraqi invasion -- which spurred a
world-wide trade embargo against Iraq and a U.S.-led buildup
of military forces in neighboring Saudi Arabia -- showed
sharp declines in consumer confidence, according to the
Chicago Fed.
   A panel of forecasters at the Cleveland Fed says the surge
in oil prices, which came after Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil was
forced off the market by the embargo, has weakened the
near-term outlook for consumer spending. Retailers in that
district say price promotions will probably be necessary to
sustain sales over the next several months.
   The oil price shock has affected some home buyers, too. In
the Midwest, where housing markets have been healthier than
in most other regions, sales have softened in recent weeks. A
real estate agent there blames rising mortgage rates and
uncertainty "generated by the Middle East crisis."
   And the Persian Gulf has crept into scattered other
business decisions. Chemical producers in the Southwest are
switching from petroleum-based raw materials to other
products to reduce the impact of rising oil prices, according
to the Dallas Fed. Two manufacturers in the region covered by
the St. Louis Fed say they are tightening credit to Middle
East customers. One has held up shipments of capital-goods
orders to the region until previous bills are paid.
   In the Western states, most businesses say that "the Iraqi
invasion has not yet caused changes in their business plans
beyond a new interest in energy conservation," according to
economists at the San Francisco Fed. One company, however,
has suspended its business with the Middle East, and others
say they are making decisions about capital spending with
increased caution.

   THE ECONOMY is moving closer to a recession as a result of
the jump in oil prices, Fed Chairman Greenspan told Congress.
He said the central bank's ability to resist a recession by
lowering interest rates has been frustrated by inflationary
pres sures. However, he didn't rule out a long-anticipated
move to lower rates.

   Home Savings Bank shareholders cleared the acquisition of
the company by H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., the Los Angeles parent of
Home Savings of America.
   The companies definitively agreed on the transaction in
April; completion, which is expected by year end, is subject
to regulatory clearances. Home Savings Bank is based in
Queens, N.Y.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under terms, Home Savings Bank holders are to receive
about $25 of Ahmanson stock for each of their shares, or
about $300 million.
   The offer price is subject to adjustment based on
Ahmanson's stock price in the 10 trading days prior to
closing: If the figure is $24.64 or more, Home Savings Bank
holders get $28 a share; if the figure is $16.92 or less,
Home Savings Bank can decide not to complete the transaction.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ahmanson shares fell 12.5 cents to close at $15.875. In
national over-the-counter trading, Home Savings Bank shares
closed unchanged at $17.875.

   Software Users Are Beginning to Rebel
   Against the Steady Stream of Upgrades

   In the beginning, there was Microsoft Word 1.0, and it was
good. But it wasn't perfect. So Microsoft Corp. developed
upgrades: Word 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0.
   Microsoft isn't alone. The entire software industry has
embraced upgrades with a devotion to the "new and improved"
that would shame a soap maker. "You can count on upgrades
like the earth revolving or young hearts turning to love in
the spring," according to W.E. Peterson, executive vice
president of WordPerfect Corp., which upgrades its software
products every six to 18 months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While such upgrades usually include many worthwhile
features, consumers increasingly are balking at trading up.
"A lot of people don't need to upgrade as often as the
vendors offer upgrades," says Tracy Lickleider, president of
the Boston Computer Society, the nation's biggest computer
user group.
   Customers complain that upgrades are expensive and
difficult to install. Sometimes, using the new software
requires buying a bigger computer. Worse, some of the
upgrades don't work as well as the products they replace.
That's what happened with an upgrade of Ashton-Tate Corp.'s
dBase product, causing a sales collapse at the company.
   "In the past, when you announced an update, everyone would
buy it," says Mr. Peterson of WordPerfect. "Now, people tend
to wait to make sure there's no problem." That skepticism has
confounded some software makers, such as Lotus Development
Corp., which expected a bigger revenue boost than it got from
the widely publicized upgrade of its 1-2-3 software.
   Until now, upgrades have been gravy for the industry. They
have helped software makers solve one of their biggest
marketing problems -- the fact that "software never wears
out," according to Lawrence Wortzel, a marketing professor at
Boston University. "They have to make you trade in, trade up
and throw it away while it's still working," he says.
   In order to continue milking their customer base, the
software companies generally have sold upgrades to existing
users for about one-third of the discounted retail price of a
new product. In theory, it's almost as reliable as an annuity
stream, says Michele Preston, a stock analyst with Cowen &amp;
Co. WordPerfect calculates that upgrades account for 5% to
10% of revenue most months.
   There are many other reasons for upgrades. Tax software,
for example, has to be updated annually to reflect changes in
the tax laws. Sometimes upgrades are needed to fix bugs in
the first version of a program. In other cases, an upgrade
corrects more fundamental faults. Lotus has just started
selling Release 2.0 of Agenda, a personal information manager
with a reputation of being very hard to learn. The new
version, Lotus says, will be doing useful work within half an
hour of starting.
   Software makers also have to improve their products to use
new hardware. As laser printers have become affordable, for
example, word-processor makers have been forced to provide
better graphics.
   "I've never seen a worthless upgrade from a major
company," says Ronald Goldfarb, a PC manager for United
Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney division. "You create a
need with a new feature."
   But existing users of software often take a jaundiced view
of upgrades. Even when the added features are beneficial, "it
seems to me upgrades are nothing but bad news," says Linda
Schultz, director of information technology for the fragrance
and food ingredients division of Hercules Inc., Wilmington,
Del. She complains about the complex process of exchanging
every user's old disks for new ones and the time it takes to
teach users about new features.
   Many other users say upgrades don't address their
particular needs, especially those who buy programs to do
specific jobs, such as churning out business letters or
recalculating the values of a stock portfolio. If the job
doesn't change, the software probably shouldn't either. "When
a customer calls me about a new release, I say, `Do you
absolutely need this right now?'" says David Kahn, president
of D. Lawton Associates, a Natick, Mass., computer
consultant.
   But many users say software makers subtly imply they won't
continue to give advice on older products. Software vendors
usually stop selling older versions after they bring out new
ones. And big companies prefer to have all employees using
the same product because it simplifies training and sharing
information. "We try to keep up with the upgrades," says
Larry Hamilton, who manages the computer network at Budd Co.,
an auto parts maker in Troy, Mich. "It's a fact of life that
they will ratchet you up," he says.
   It isn't easy, though. To get the low-priced upgrade,
users are required to send in either original floppy disks or
else title pages from the manual. Especially for big users,
that's a headache. Neal Checkoway, vice president at
Corporate Software Inc., a Canton, Mass., software
distributor, says his company started a special service to
help with upgrades. "The vendors' requirements generally
included the first page of the manual, diskettes and the
first-born son," he jokes. "Imagine that for thousands of
copies, distributed broadly with a variety of different
budgetary controls."
   Even at cut rates, upgrading 1,000 users at once is a
stiff cost, sometimes as much as $150,000. Worse, because new
software with added features takes more memory than the
software it replaces, many users have to buy more powerful
computers or more memory for existing computers. Forrester
Research, a Cambridge, Mass., market research firm, decided
against buying Microsoft's popular Windows 3.0 upgrade
because executives concluded that the $50 software upgrade
would force it to buy about $800 in extra hardware for each
user, the equivalent of having to buy a new house with a
larger garage in order to buy a new car model.
   Then there's the hassle of simply installing the upgrade.
Technicians at Boston Edison Co. spent an average of half an
hour with each of 900 users upgrading Lotus 1-2-3.
   Upgrades also may disrupt long-established patterns for
experienced users. Russ Walter, a computer book author from
Somerville, Mass., says that when he moved from WordPerfect
5.0 to 5.1, he had to rewrite many of the shortcuts called
macros that he had written to make his work easier. In the
old version, a single keystroke could set items into tables;
the new version provides a menu with a choice between tables
or columns, necessitating a rewrite of the macro. "I took the
41 chapters (in the book) I'd created and redid every damn
one," he says.
   Software makers say they are sympathetic with users'
problems and are working to make things easier. Scott Oki,
senior vice president of Microsoft, says upgrades used to
come out every six months, but now they "tend to be more like
every 18 months." In addition, software companies
increasingly are selling new products at the upgrade price if
corporate users simply send a "letter of destruction"
attesting they won't use the old version anymore.
   At the same time, changes at big customers are making
upgrades easier to digest. As corporations install networks
connecting all their PCs, PC managers only have to update
software on central servers rather than going to each user's
PC.
   But for every improvement, there's a horror story. Take
Lotus, whose 1-2-3 spreadsheet is the most-used software for
millions of computer users. After successfully upgrading
users from Release 1A to 2.01 in 1986, it promised a second
major upgrade in 1988. That was delayed twice.
   Finally, last year, Lotus produced two different main
versions, each priced at $150 for existing customers -- the
smaller 2.2 with fancy printing capabilities and the powerful
3.0 -- as well as a host of versions for other computers.
   The process has irked loyal customers. Hercules had to buy
some users both 2.2 and 3.0 in order to provide both
increased power and the printing capabilities available only
with Release 2.2. "It's not a happy situation," says Ms.
Schultz.
   Now Lotus is offering another upgrade. Since Sept. 10,
buyers can get the new 1-2-3 Release 3.1, which includes the
best of both predecessors, for $35, $75, $99 or $150,
depending on what version they exchange and where they buy
it.

   IMF Says World
   Economic Activity
   Will Pick Up in '91

   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund,
contradicting growing fears of recession, predicted that
world economic activity generally will pick up speed next
year. But it acknowledged that rising oil prices have taken a
toll on business activity.
   In its latest semiannual survey of the world economy, the
IMF forecast that world economic growth this year will slow
to about 2% after inflation from 3% in 1989, and then will
pick up to a 2.4% clip in 1991. For the U.S., the
international agency forecast that output will expand 1.3%
this year and 1.7% in 1991, compared with a 2.5% growth rate
in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In May, before the rise in oil prices, the international
agency was projecting healthier world economic growth rates
of 2.3% this year and 3.1% in 1991. For the U.S., it was
anticipating growth of 1.7% this year and 2.3% in 1991.
   Despite the lowered forecast, the IMF doesn't expect a
recession. "We don't believe there's a negative quarter
anywhere, said Ernesto Hernandez Cata, an IMF economist,
discussing forecasts for the U.S.
   The agency predicted that the pickup in the global economy
next year will be led by strong growth in Japan and Western
Europe. It stressed that the medium-term outlook for the
world economy "remains strongly influenced by the
far-reaching changes currently taking place in Europe,"
particularly the 1992 economic integration of the European
Community, German unification and economic and political
changes in Eastern Europe.
   Growth in the industrialized countries will average 2.5%
in 1990 and 1991, down from almost 4% rate in 1988 and 1989,
according to the IMF's latest forecast.
   Because of economic reforms associated with the transition
toward more market-oriented economies, output is expected to
stagnate in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe this year and
next. The rise in oil prices, and the need to pay for oil in
hard currencies, will hit East European countries
particularly, the IMF said.
   Meanwhile, German unification will involve a rise in
investment relative to saving. That, coupled with high levels
of resource utilization in the industrial world will result
in some upward pressure on German prices, interest rates and
the value of the mark, the IMF said.
   The IMF forecast is based on national policies and
exchange rates as of last month. But some of its assumptions
are relatively optimistic. It assumed that oil prices will
average $22.75 a barrel next year, down from current levels
of about $33 a barrel, and that the recent decline in the
dollar will boost U.S. exports while lower U.S. interest
rates also will spur growth next year.
   The U.S. current account deficit will rise slightly to
$99.7 billion in 1991 from an estimated $97 billion this
year, according to the IMF forecast. The deficit totaled $110
billion in 1989. The current account is a measure of a
nation's trade in goods and services.
   The international agency predicted that U.S. inflation
will accelerate slightly to 4.3% this year from 4.1% in 1989
before moderating to 4.2% in 1991. Altogether, the IMF
forecast that inflation in the industrialized countries will
run at a 4.8% rate this year, up from 4.4% in 1989.
   But the IMF predicted that inflation will slow to 16.1%
next year in developing countries, compared to 104.8% this
year. That rosy forecast is based on the assumption that
developing countries as a group will bounce back to economic
health in 1991, with an average economic growth rate of 4.2%
compared to 2.2% in 1990.

   Upgraded Operating System
   For Macintosh Is Delayed

   Apple Computer Inc., struggling to complete a new
operating system for its flagship Macintosh family, said it
won't complete the job until the first half of next year.
   Apple, whose stock fell 87.5 cents to $32.50 in
over-the-counter trading yesterday, has billed the operating
system, a software program that controls the basic functions
of the Macintosh, as the biggest advance in software for the
computer since its introduction in 1984. Apple had hoped to
ship the operating system to customers this summer, but in
May pushed the date back to October.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This delay shouldn't harm Apple since the operating system
is mainly aimed at Apple's high-end computers, said Bruce
Lupatkin, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist. In mid-October,
the company is expected to introduce two low-end computers,
which can't make much use of the new operating system anyway,
he said.
   Delays in the release of the operating system are
worrisome, however, since Apple is under pressure from
Microsoft Corp., which supplies operating systems to Apple's
competitors in the personal computer business, to make
further improvements to Macintosh software. Apple said it
expects to release test copies of the operating system to
software developers in October.

   WASHINGTON -- The federal government's case against Neil
Bush, the president's son, involving his role as a director
of failed Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association,
isn't likely to wind up until next spring, a spokesman for
S&amp;L regulators said.
   Next week, Mr. Bush, will defend his actions before an
administrative law judge in Denver. The Office of Thrift
Supervision is seeking a cease-and-desist order to prohibit
Mr. Bush from engaging in certain activities if he holds a
similar post at a financial institution in the future. Mr.
Bush served on the board of the Denver thrift from 1985 to
1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bush, who as an outside board member had no day-to-day
role at the thrift, has denied wrongdoing and has fought the
order. Thrift regulators said he failed to disclose to other
Silverado board members his separate business relationship
with two large Silverado borrowers. Several Silverado
executives have been barred from the S&amp;L and banking
industries under government consent agreements.
   The administrative law judge is to make his recommendation
for action by Dec. 6, and following another month for written
rebuttals, OTS Director Timothy Ryan will have 90 days to
either agree or disagree with the recommendation. Mr. Ryan's
ruling may be appealed in court.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Australian Stock Exchange officials
said News Corp. has approached them to allow the company to
issue nonvoting stock, a type of security currently
prohibited by the exchange.
   The move apparently is an attempt by media mogul Rupert
Murdoch to raise equity without diluting the 45% stake in
News Corp. that his family controls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A senior News Corp. official in New York declined to
comment. But for Mr. Murdoch, News Corp.'s chief executive
officer, the ability to issue such restricted-voting
securities would provide an alternative to his failed effort
last year to create a separate media vehicle to further his
international expansion. That company, named Media Partners
International Ltd. and dubbed "Son of News Corp." by Mr.
Murdoch, was to be managed and 20%-owned by News Corp.
   But investors shunned the new venture and it was
abandoned. Meanwhile, News Corp.'s debts have spiraled. Mr.
Murdoch has been selling assets to reduce debt, and he has
taken News Corp. off the acquisition trail.
   Issuing nonvoting stock, however, would give Mr. Murdoch
"the potential to play the same game on {News Corp.'s}
existing balance sheet," says Viktor Shvets, who tracks News
Corp. for Baring Securities (Australia) Ltd.

It is slated to open early next year.
   Edgar T. Savidge, account manager of Cargill's soybean

   Life-Insurance Industry May Be Facing
   Expensive Lesson in Lobbying Tactics

   WASHINGTON -- The life-insurance industry is likely to get
hit with a $2 billion-a-year federal tax increase largely
because of its own overheated lobbying efforts.
   The outlook for reaching a bipartisan budget accord is
uncertain. But any tax-increase legislation this year
probably will raise the taxes of life-insurance companies by
two-thirds from the current $3 billion annually. During
recent budget talks, Democrats and Republicans agreed to
target the industry for a tax increase of $10 billion over
the next five years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decision is notable because the life-insurance
industry is the only one on the chopping block this year.
Most other tax increases being considered are noncorporate,
on consumers and individuals. The tax rise would be the
largest whack at a single industry since the real-estate
industry was similarly highlighted in 1986.
   The reason for the life-insurance industry's plight is a
study in how to mishandle a lobbying campaign. Over the past
two years, the industry sharply divided itself into two
camps: the stock insurance companies and the mutual insurance
companies. Each side has complained bitterly that the other
hasn't been paying its fair share of taxes and, despite
repeated entreaties from lawmakers, they haven't been able to
agree on a solution.
   On top of that, legislators have grown increasingly weary
-- and wary -- of the heavy-handed lobbying by both sides.
Most of the capital's tax lobbyists have hired out to one
side or another.
   The lobbyists say they haven't overreached. But many
lawmakers feel they've being pressured everywhere they turn.
Stocks and mutuals have held separate fund-raisers for them,
have treated their staffs to exotic trips and have repeatedly
pressed their case in meetings both in Washington and in
their districts. A group of mutual lobbyists even showed up
in Barbados during a junket by the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   Most members of Congress take lobbying in stride and even
benefit from it. But many lawmakers are tired of hearing the
blindingly arcane details of the insurance dispute. The
result has been a backlash that is likely to lead to a
massive tax increase for both sides.
   "Did they overlobby? Absolutely," said Rep. Michael
Andrews (D., Texas), a member of the tax-writing Ways and
Means Committee. "Each side took the hardest position they
could and were unable to coalesce behind anything that was a
thoughtful approach."
   By dividing, they were defeated, most analysts agree.
"Around here a lot of people sit down and try to work out
their differences," said Rep. Barbara Kennelly (D., Conn.),
who is also on the Ways and Means panel and an
insurance-industry advocate. "They made themselves vulnerable
by not finding a solution."
   In the meantime, the industry is howling about being
mistreated. "America needs a reduced federal deficit, but not
at the expense of one industry and its consumers," said
Donald J. Schuenke, president and chief executive officer of
Milwaukee-based Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. A 66%
increase in taxes, he added, "will force the entire
life-insurance industry to shoulder a disproportionate share
of the deficit-reduction package."
   Individual companies would be hurt and insurance rates
would rise, executives complain. Prudential Insurance Co. of
America estimates its tax bill would go up 65% to 70%
annually, or $150 million to $170 million, if the industry's
tax bill is increased $2 billion annually. Berkshire Life
Insurance Co. in Pittsfield, Mass., estimates that had the
tax increase been in effect last year, the company would have
posted a loss of $2 million to $2.5 million, compared with
the statutory gain of $1.2 million it reported.
   Ironically, the method of increasing the industry's taxes
was first put on the table in January as one element of a
package meant to help the mutuals. Called deferred
acquisition costs, or DACs, the provision would require
companies to write off the commissions and fees they pay to
insurance agents over several years. Currently, those costs
can be written off immediately.
   But the budget negotiators seized on the one provision and
plan to use it to raise the taxes of both sides. So now
finally the stock and mutual insurance companies have put
aside years of bickering to work together against DACs.
   Typically, the insurance companies are unleashing a
lobbying barrage to battle the tax rise. The agents have
taken out a newspaper advertisement. Employees and agents of
Prudential and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. are writing
letters and telephoning lawmakers and the White House.
Prudential Chairman Robert C. Winters wrote to White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu Aug. 8. Stock and mutual lobbyists
were making rare joint visits to lawmakers' offices last
week.
   Though not too little, it's probably too late. "We were
caught off guard," said Thomas O'Hara, the head of
Prudential's Washington office. "The industry expected a tax
increase, but not to this extent."

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community's top agricultural
official was forced to withdraw a crucial proposal on
farm-subsidy cuts when a majority of fellow EC commissioners
demanded more substantial rollbacks.
   Aides to Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry said a
majority of EC commissioners wanted to signal the U.S. that
the Community was serious about a successful outcome to the
current round of world trade talks taking place under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. GATT negotiators gave
all countries until Oct. 15 to put their final offers on the
table. Because of the bitter dispute on farm subsidies
between the EC and the U.S., many experts are worried that
the talks could fail.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MacSharry had proposed cutting overall farm support by
only 30% over 10 years, using 1986 spending as a basis. U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills, in Brussels yesterday, said
that would effectively be a much smaller reduction, perhaps
as little as a 10% off today's levels, as 1986 was a high
benchmark. The U.S. this week softened its stand, saying it
would accept a 70% cut in subsidies and deeper cuts in export
refunds.

   New Compound Developed

   BOSTON -- Hitachi Ltd. said its researchers developed a
compound that shows signs of superconductivity at a somewhat
higher temperature than previously reported for the
phenomenon.
   The new compound, unlike most "high-temperature"
superconductors developed during the past few years, doesn't
contain copper -- an aspect of the material that intrigues
superconductivity experts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   They hope the new compound will provide clues about how to
make superconductors that work at yet higher and more cheaply
attained temperatures.
   Superconductors, which conduct electricity without
resistance when cooled, promise new electrical technologies,
such as faster computers and cheaper power generation.
   The Japanese concern said its new material contains the
elements thallium, strontium, vanadium and oxygen; the
company also reported fabricating a closely related
superconductor in which part of the strontium is replaced
with the element cerium.
   A sample of Hitachi's compound showed a sharp drop in
electrical resistance -- indicating superconductivity --
between 130 Kelvins and 160 Kelvins, or minus 225 degrees
Fahrenheit to minus 171 degrees Fahrenheit, Hitachi said.
Currently, the highest known temperature for
superconductivity is about 125 Kelvins, or minus 234 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   The finding hasn't yet been confirmed, and some scientists
said they were skeptical about it. During the past few years,
several research teams have reported similar
superconductivity temperature advances that apparently were
spurious.

   WASHINGTON -- The National Cancer Institute found that
people who live near nuclear facilities don't face a greater
risk of death from cancer than those who live elsewhere.
   The NCI compared mortality data in 107 counties
surrounding all 62 U.S. nuclear facilities -- 52 commercial
power plants, nine Department of Energy research and weapons
plants, and one commercial fuel-reprocessing plant -- in
operation before 1982 with data from demographically similar
counties that weren't close to nuclear facilities.
Researchers found "no evidence to suggest that the occurrence
of leukemia or any other form of cancer was generally higher
in the study counties than the control counties."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both proponents and opponents of nuclear power agree that
the NCI survey is the nation's most comprehensive assessment
of the relationship between proximity to nuclear facilities
and cancer mortality.
   But Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), who requested the
study, said the study "isn't a clean bill of health for the
nuclear industry" because it didn't go far enough. In
contrast, the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, a nuclear
trade group, said the study "should put the public at ease
that living near a nuclear plant isn't harmful to their
health."
   No matter how reassuring its findings, the study isn't
likely to improve the prospects for the construction of new
nuclear plants. Because of concerns about cost, nuclear waste
disposal, safety and regulatory delay, there hasn't been an
order for a new nuclear plant in the U.S. since 1978.

Another 33% plan investments but didn't say how much. DRT
surveyed 128 companies world-wide with assets or sales of
more than $1 billion.

   Most companies planning to invest in Eastern Europe intend
to do so through joint ventures with existing Eastern
European enterprises. Export-import opportunities, which are
particularly popular among Japanese companies, came in
second.
   In the survey, 23 European companies said they expect to
invest $1.7 billion; 13 U.S. companies, $332 million; and 12
Japanese companies, $1.1 billion.
   Nearly all of the Western Europe respondents do business
in Eastern Europe or plan to do so in the next five years;
more than half of the North American and 63% of Japanese
companies said they expect to have a stake in Eastern Europe
in the future.

   WASHINGTON -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Stein Roe &amp;
Farnham Inc. and two other firms agreed to pay nearly $3
million to settle federal charges of misusing assets of three
Teamsters Union funds.
   The Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits
Administration said that under consent orders in federal
court in Syracuse, N.Y., Shearson, the brokerage unit of
American Express Co., agreed to pay $2 million to three
Teamsters pension and health funds in Utica, N.Y., as
restitution for alleged improper transactions made on behalf
of those funds. Stein Roe, a Chicago investment manager,
agreed to pay $625,000, and Renaissance Investment Management
Inc., Cincinnati, and First Albany Inc., Albany, N.Y., a
brokerage firm, agreed to pay a combined $180,000, the agency
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency charged Shearson and Stein Roe with violations
including transferring stocks with falling prices to the
Teamsters fund accounts while switching valuable stock to
friends, relatives and customers of Shearson brokers.
Renaissance and other investment firms were charged with
letting the funds' cash balances under their management be
treated as Shearson credit balances and with allowing payment
of excessive commissions to Shearson and First Albany.
   A spokesman for Shearson said the employees handling the
accounts were fired in 1985 after the firm's own internal
investigation. He said the firm cooperated fully with
investigators "and agreed to settle without admitting or
denying the allegations to avoid protracted litigation."
   Stein Roe officials couldn't be reached for comment.

   WASHINGTON -- Housing starts fell for the seventh
consecutive month in August for their longest decline in
eight years.
   Builders started work on new homes at an annual rate of
1,127,000 last month, the Commerce Department said, down 1.7%
from July's 1,147,000. August starts were running 15% below a
year earlier. They haven't fallen for seven months in a row
since the last recession in 1981-82.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These are the first housing-start figures to appear since
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and might reflect shaky
confidence in the wake of the crisis. "Frankly, I think the
housing industry probably would have begun to rebound by
August if not for the Persian Gulf crisis," said Mark
Obrinsky, a senior economist at the Federal National Mortgage
Association.
   Starts on single-family homes fell 3.2% last month to an
annual rate of 840,000 after declining 2.4% in July to
868,000. Starts on apartments and other multifamily dwellings
rose 2.9% in August to an annual rate of 287,000 units after
plunging 7% in July to 279,000.
   Despite these figures, however, David Seider, chief
economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said
the market for multifamily dwellings is in a "bona fide
recession condition," with the falloff in single-family
housing starts less dire.
   All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

   Public Service Co. of Colorado, Denver, said it expects to
borrow, either through a private placement or public
offering, about $200 million to help pay costs associated
with converting its idled nuclear electric generating plant
to natural gas power.
   The utility said it expects to use about $125 million of
the borrowing to pay for removing the remains of radioactive
fuel from the St. Vrain plant north of Denver. PS Colorado
stopped generating electricity at the plant, the nation's
only gas-cooled, high-temperature reactor, in August 1989
after 10 years because of operational problems and excessive
costs. The company said it may have to spend $47 million of
the borrowed funds to build a temporary storage facility for
spent fuel from the plant.
</LP>

   PS Colorado said state regulators cleared a private
placement, though plans are still preliminary. It hasn't
filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on a possible public bond offering. It said it doesn't expect
now to use any of the funds to finance the plant's $85
million dismantling and conversion.

   LOS ANGELES -- Northrop Corp.'s chairman, Thomas V. Jones,
retired yesterday, just as an International Chamber of
Commerce ruling surfaced saying that $6.25 million in South
Korean payments by the company were meant to induce Seoul to
buy Northrop F-20 fighter planes.
   The ruling, a copy of which was obtained by this
newspaper, said the Northrop payments never were intended to
be part of a hotel-development venture in the country, as the
company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Jones, a 70-year-old executive who was often at the
center of controversy during 30 years in Northrop top
managment, was succeeded by Kent Kresa. Mr. Kresa, 52,
retains his posts as Northrop's president and chief executive
officer. Mr. Jones remains a board member.
   Two federal grand juries are examining whether Northrop
executives violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in its
marketing of the F-20s and whether Mr. Jones may have
disobeyed the terms of a consent decree he signed in a
foreign-payments case in the mid-1970s requiring Northrop not
to bribe foreign officials.
   The sharply worded arbitrator's opinion, dated Aug. 29,
dismissed claims by Northrop that a group of unscrupulous
South Korean businessmen bilked the defense contractor out of
the $6,250,000 in the hotel deal. Arbitrator Wolfgang Kuhn
wrote, "This was not a situation where low-level employees
colluded to defraud Northrop, but instead Northrop was acting
through its highest level of management in violation of the
law."
   Strikingly, Mr. Kuhn named names. He said he was convinced
that former Northrop executives James Dorsey, Donald Foulds
and Welko Gasich, and "probably Mr. Jones . . . knew of and
approved" an oral understanding that funds were to be
diverted from the ersatz hotel project to the late Park Chong
Kyu, a powerful businessman with ties to upper levels of the
government in Seoul.
   The 44-page ruling is a major setback for Northrop. The
aerospace and defense concern lost a similar decision in July
before the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board, but the
company attributed that ruling to legal technicalities. At
that time Northrop indicated that the decision by the
international chamber would carry more weight.
   A Northrop spokesman said the company was disappointed
with the arbitrator's ruling, and maintained that the finding
doesn't "support widespread reports and allegations that the
company's investment in this hotel was to be used to make
payments to Korean government officials." He said Northrop
still is pursuing a related civil lawsuit in Seoul.
   Mr. Kresa, in an interview, said there wasn't any link
between the ruling and Mr. Jones's decision to retire. He
said both issues came up at a regular board meeting
yesterday, along with other matters, but were unconnected.
"This was his decision," Mr. Kresa said of Mr. Jones's
retirement, adding that in the 21 months since Mr. Jones
turned over the chief-executive job to Mr. Kresa, there grew
"a sense that it was a proper time to make the transition."
   Rep. Thomas Bliley (R., Va.), a member of the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee that is investigating Northrop,
called the arbitrator's ruling "another blow to Northrop's
implausible story that it was the victim of clever Korean con
men." He said the Pentagon should "consider whether
additional contracts should be awarded to Northrop," given
"the integrity" of its management.
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.), whose investigators obtained the ruling, said he
would soon call for Northrop to discuss the F-20 case at a
hearing. But staff members said setting a date has been
slowed in part by Northrop's desire to avoid having Mr. Kresa
sit at the same witness table with Mr. Jones. Mr. Kresa said
the reasons for testifying separately "are rather
straightforward," and reflect his own desire to concentrate
on "where the company is going," while Mr. Jones discusses
legal issues and other matters that arose during his tenure.
"I didn't want to blur those lines," Mr. Kresa said.
   Mr. Dorsey's attorney, Daniel Bookin, declined to comment.
Mr. Foulds's lawyer, Jan Lawrence Handzlik, said: "The
arbitrator is simply wrong. Mr. Foulds had no knowledge of a
supposed agreement to divert money to Park. Mr. Foulds was
involved in legitimate counter-trade investment activities in
Korea."
   Michael Klein, Mr. Gasich's attorney, said the conclusions
about his client are "outrageous and self-evidently a stretch
. . . and extraordinarily difficult to see on the facts."
Neither Mr. Jones nor a lawyer for him, Leonard Janofsky,
could be reached.
   The arbitrator said he based his conclusions on both
testimony and written documents. For instance, while Mr.
Gasich basically denied knowing that Mr. Park -- a gregarious
former army colonel nicknamed "Pistol Park" because of a
fondness for guns -- was behind the hotel venture or had
requested any money for his services, the arbitrator
determined that the statement was contradicted by two memos
signed by Mr. Gasich.
   Mr. Kuhn also said Northrop's contentions about its hotel
plans were undercut by the inexperience of Northrop and of
the Korean concern it was involved with, Asia Culture Travel
Development Co., in the hotel business. He said Northrop "did
not take elementary preliminary steps" to solicit financial
statements from Asia Culture Travel to guarantee the
investment; that there wasn't ever an Asia Culture Travel
shareholder meeting to consider the issue; and that Northrop
transferred the funds despite irregularities involving the
appraised value of the Asia Culture Travel property.
   "One of the most telling pieces of evidence is that
Northrop paid $6.25 million to an {Asia Culture Travel}
account in Hong Kong over which it had no control," Mr. Kuhn
said. "Moreover, this money transfer was made before there
was any necessity to pay this entire sum, since governmental
approval for the {hotel} project had not yet been granted."
The arbitrator also pointed out that while Northrop justified
a need for a hotel investment as part of a standard industry
practice of offsetting currency fluctuations in foreign
countries, the company didn't involve its offset manager in
Korea in the hotel project.
   The 52-year-old Mr. Kresa served at the company's aircraft
group before becoming president in 1987. The major program at
the group was the B-2 Stealth bomber, developed in secrecy
but now the center of a Pentagon procurement battle.
Northrop's design for the YF-23, one of two candidates for
the huge Air Force Advanced Tactical Fighter program, also
was developed there. The F-20 program was canceled several
years ago without a sale ever being made.
   The B-2 has been one of a number of Northrop production
programs subject to various government investigations in
recent years. In February, Northrop pleaded guilty to 34
counts of falsifying test results in its work on the
air-launched cruise missile and the AV-8B Harrier fighter
jet. Criminal inquiries also have been conducted into its
work on the navigational system for the MX missile.
   Mr. Jones, who pleaded guilty to a felony count for
creating a secret political slush fund to contribute to
President Nixon's 1972 campaign, resigned as chairman of the
company for a time after a special Northrop report in 1975
saddled him with "a heavy share of the responsibility for the
irregularities and improprieties" involving payments made
during the industry's foreign-payoff scandal of the early
1970s. He kept the titles of president and chief executive
through that period, however.

   Even though leisure travel is in the doldrums, and

about service problems in the back of the plane than the
changes in front.
   "As coach gets so crammed, some people will do almost
anything to try to justify to themselves or their company why
they need to fly in first class," says Stephen Taylor,
executive vice president of Lifeco Travel Services, a major
agency in Houston.
   U.S. carriers won't release individual numbers, but the
Air Transport Association says that while first-class travel
surged, overall domestic traffic was up only 4% through July.
Since the trade group tracks only paying customers, the
first-class increase isn't coming from frequent-flier members
using free awards and upgrades. And it's not being spurred by
any discounting in first class; indeed, first-class fares are
up 7% this year, and first class revenues have climbed 22%.
   The upswing is a big surprise for many in the travel
industry, who assumed that with corporate belts tightening
and travel costs soaring, most companies wouldn't pay $3,000
to fly an employee one-way from New York to London. "You hear
so much about companies cutting back," says a spokesman for
Carlson Travel Network, a major travel agency. "This clearly
goes against the trend." And in general, the travel industry
has been mired in a slump for most of the year.
   But experts say that a weak economy doesn't affect the
vacation plans of truly wealthy travelers the way it does
others. "For the people on Park Avenue, this is just the way
they go," says Bill Fischer of Fischer Travel in New York,
which specializes in travel for the rich and famous. "A
recession isn't going to stop them."
   Furthermore, despite promises otherwise, many companies
still let their very senior executives fly up-front. They do
so by establishing two-tier travel policies -- one for the
top executives, one for everyone else. Generally, the
executives who fly first class tend to be discreet about
their travel arrangements to ease resentment.
   "There are definitely more companies trying two-tier
policies," says Jeanie Thompson-Smith, president of Topaz
Enterprises, a travel-management company. "Your top
executives still generally feel they deserve to go first
class."
   Airlines also insist they have been able to nudge people
into first class by heavily promoting it and improving
service. Pan American World Airways offers free limousine and
helicopter service for international first-class passengers.
Delta has put in electronically reclining seats. And American
now bakes chocolate-chip cookies on board.
   Whatever the reason for the increase, it's definitely a
boon for the industry. Paying first-class customers don't
form a huge market. United Airlines estimates that only 20%
of the people sitting in its first-class cabins actually pay
full-fare. (The rest are frequent-flier members using
freebies or upgrades.) Industrywide, only about 7% of all
passengers buy first-class tickets. But the profit margins on
first-class fares are often 10 times greater than they are in
economy class, airline officials say.
   "These are definitely very important customers for us,"
says Hector Adler, vice president of in-flight and dining
services for Pan Am.
   Those profits are likely to stay strong even through the
fall season. Leisure travel drops off then, but business
travel usually stays strong, and most first-class travelers
are business fliers.
   But although it may boost profits, the first-class surge
has caught some carriers off guard. Because they thought
first-class travel was shrinking, some airlines have
gradually reduced their proportion of first-class seats. As a
result, first-class cabins are starting to sell out on some
transcontinental and international flights weeks ahead, and
that forces airlines to turn away some paying first-class
customers.
   "The airlines thought first class was a dead market," says
Mr. Fischer. "Obviously, it's not."

   Regarding your Aug. 22 "Tracking Travel": There are lies,
damned lies and statistics. I propose we add a new category
called "damned statistics." Damned statistics should be
reserved for any statistic by the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, or any other self-serving insurance-industry
propaganda mechanism.
   The fact is, the most reliable measurement of traffic
fatalities is the number of people killed per million miles
driven. The IIHS never quotes that one. It drops every year
and is at the lowest level since transportation statistics
were first collected for motorized vehicles. The number of
fatalities that are reported rise in proportion to the number
of miles driven. Another statistic conveniently left out by
most of that group (IIHS and the like) is that the deaths are
rising equally on highways not affected by the 65-mph speed
limit. In addition, studies have found that states that wish
to keep their hands buried deeply into the pockets of their
citizenry by maintaining the preposterous 55-mph speed limit
(i.e. Massachusetts) have the same average speeds on their
highways as states with the 65-mph speed limit, despite
ridiculous fines for speeding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Whether you wish to travel at 55 mph or 65 mph (conditions
permitting), you should know that the posted limit has had no
effect on anything other than revenues for the beneficiaries
of the 55-mph speed limit. States have lost ticket revenues
and insurance companies have less excuse to raise your
premiums due to tickets received for driving at a speed
dictated by common sense, rather than arbitrary politics.

   EUREKA, Nev. -- The most important workers at the Tonkin
Springs Gold Mine are too small to wear hard hats. About 2.5
billion of them fit into a square centimeter.
   They're bacteria. Billions of them swirl around in huge
tanks of gray liquid at the mine, eating dissolved ore and
releasing gold into the water. The happier they are, the more
ore they eat and the more gold they release. "Our goal in
life is to make bugs very happy," says U.S. Gold Corp.
President William Reid, 42 years old, who heads the company
along with his brother David, 40, the exploration chief.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Reids and their bugs are attempting to unlock gold
from the rust-colored, sulfurous dirt of these central Nevada
hills. If this experiment in so-called bioleaching works,
U.S. Gold will have developed a modern-day alchemy worth
millions to it and its new venture partner, Homestake Mining
Co. If it fails, U.S. Gold will vanish under a mountain of
debt and broken dreams.
   Although U.S. Gold is a midget among the nation's giant
gold miners, its success or failure in this project is
important to the country's gold mining industry. U.S. miners
desperately need new technology to release hard-to-refine
gold reserves economically, but no one has come up with it.
   With the mining world watching closely, the Tonkin Springs
experiment has had a rough baptism, bringing U.S. Gold to the
brink of bankruptcy more than once. To keep lenders at bay
and continue the project, the Reids have had to sell off all
the company's other assets. And recently, desperate for cash
to continue the experiment, they signed an agreement giving
part ownership and control of the operation to Homestake.
   The gold mining industry has always depended on people
like the Reids. Most gold exploration is done by small firms,
which then sell their projects to larger companies. To be a
gold miner, says Thomas D. Kaufman, professor at the Colorado
School of Mines, you have to be a gambler. The Reids are no
exception. "If you're not worried, you're not risking
enough," Bill Reid says. "I believe life should be an
adventure, and we're having a hell of an adventure right
now."
   Early prospectors searched for nuggets and water-borne
flakes that required little refining. But most of that
"placer" and "alluvial" gold was gone by about 1950. By 1960,
the domestic gold industry was dead, as miners moved on to
copper, lead and zinc. But by 1980, prices for those metals
had plunged.
   Meanwhile, companies rediscovered cyanide leaching, a
technique developed by the U.S. Bureau of Mines during the
Depression that could pull microscopic gold from oxidized
ores. Driven by rising gold prices, new gold boomtowns sprang
up in the West. In 1989, 8.6 million ounces of gold were
produced, up from about 970,000 ounces when the decade began.
   Now, however, those oxidized ores are also playing out --
proven reserves have dwindled to a 23-year supply from 69
years in 1982 -- and the domestic gold industry is once again
threatened. Mining companies searching for the next big
strike are straying overseas, where pickings are better.
   Supply isn't the problem; many experts estimate that only
10% of the nation's gold has been found. But much of what's
left is trapped in so-called refractory ores, in which gold
is chemically bound with iron and sulfur. And refining those
ores has been a problem.
   The cost of pressure-cooking refractory ore in autoclaves
is more than twice that of cyanide leaching, limiting its use
to very rich ores. Roasting refractory ores, another
technique, emits worrisome gases. Milling can release the
ore, too, but it works only on the highest-grade ores.
   Bioleaching, the approach being pursued by U.S. Gold, is
considered more environmentally compatible and cheaper.
Dozens of U.S. mining companies have lab-scale bioleaching
experiments under way, and some pilot projects are planned.
But no one in the U.S. had ventured to try the process on a
commercial scale until U.S. Gold took the plunge three years
ago. "Most people are interested in getting their gold out of
the ground and making a profit, not in being a hero," says
John Tumazos, metals analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   For the Reids, however, plunging into the unknown waters
of bioleaching was in character. After leaving Indiana with
geology degrees and the age-old gold fever, the brothers
started the company as Monte Cristo Mining &amp; Milling Co. in
1977 with $7,000 from a second mortgage on Bill's house. They
squeezed silver out of abandoned claims behind Pikes Peak,
David says, by patching up old machinery, designing their own
mills and pinching pennies. "I knew we'd reached some level
of efficiency when our welder was using coat hangers to fix
some of the equipment," he says.
   As Silver State Mining Corp., the brothers went public in
1980 at 10 cents a share -- just as the bottom fell out of
the silver market. Quickly, Bill and David switched their
attention to gold, and in 1982, they bought a mine near
Victor, Colo., that brought them five comfortable years of
profits. The company name became U.S. Gold.
   But dreams, not comfort, drive the brothers. They wanted
to be more than one of hundreds of little gold mining
companies, and they knew they needed a niche to break out of
that class. Tonkin Springs was their chance. They bought the
mine, knowing that the majority of the ore there was
refractory. By being in the lead in refractory technology,
Bill Reid reasoned, he could link his company up with bigger
companies' projects and grow.
   Bioleaching mimics weathering, nature's own way of
oxidizing ores. Across the Nevada foothills, countless
billions of natural bacteria munch away at sulfur and iron
molecules, turning sulfide ore to oxidized ore and releasing
a rotten-egg odor. But nature takes millenniums to digest a
handful of gold ore. U.S. Gold's bioleaching plant speeds
things up by placing the bacteria in an acidic, wet
environment with plenty of oxygen. In three 600-gallon tanks,
Tonkin Springs' bugs belly up to about 3,500 tons of ore and
clean their plates in about 60 hours, U.S. Gold says.
   As with any brand-new process, there have been plenty of
surprises. During one period, the bugs suddenly multiplied
like crazy but quit eating the iron and sulfur. After a week
of head-scratching and dozens of test-tube experiments, the
Reids discovered that a drop in the acid level had given the
bugs an appetite for different substances.
   Operating on a tight budget, the company was once forced
to shut down the entire plant for a couple of days when a
gasket broke and a pump spewed its oil. Because it couldn't
afford an oil reserve, employee Bruce Winkelkotter had to get
up at 2 a.m. the next day and drive 12 hours to Reno and back
to get oil. "Unfortunately, we don't have the kind of
resources we need to take care of the little problems," says
David Reid. "We're having to scrounge around."
   Such glitches, together with unworkable plant designs, bad
weather and equipment failures, increased the cost of the
experiment from the original estimate of $18 million to more
than $31 million. The cost overruns also generated some
resource-sapping litigation with the project's engineering
and construction contractors. The Reids blame the engineering
company for underestimating costs and for poor designs, and
they blame the construction managers for not catching the
problems soon enough. The two concerns say the Reids still
owe them money. The glitches also slowed production. Since
March, the bioleach process has produced 2,000 ounces of
gold, falling far short of paying the bills.
   The deal with Homestake gives the Reids some breathing
room, but success still isn't guaranteed. If the project
fails, says David, he'll just sell his house, load up his van
and go back to prospecting. Bill's wife, Beth, has been
studying to get her nursing credentials updated, just in
case.
   Like any seasoned gambler, Bill Reid takes the possible
loss in stride. In nearby Elko one evening, he drops dollar
tokens into the slot machines at the Red Lion Casino,
starting with $20 and building it up past $60 before he hits
a prolonged losing streak. Holding the final dollar in his
hand, he raises his eyebrows in mock fear. "Uh-oh. We've got
a liquidity crisis. It's just like U.S. Gold, isn't it?" He
drops the final coin and shrugs off the loss. "It was a lot
of fun, wasn't it?"

   TORONTO -- The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it
plans to sell its British mortgage financing unit, CIBC
Mortgages.
   The Toronto-based bank said it has retained investment
firm S.G. Warburg to advise it on the sale. It also said it
has received expressions of interest from several financial
institutions in its unit's $3.83 billion mortgage loan
portfolio.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the bank declined to identify those
interested parties or to say what price the bank hopes to get
for the mortgage lending concern.
   But he said CIBC will sell the profitable unit, one of the
six largest mortgage lenders in Britain, only for "the right
price."
   The bank decided to sell the unit "for strategic reasons,"
the spokesman said. CIBC has begun to move out of retail
banking operations abroad, focusing instead on wholesale
operations such as its corporate finance and project
financing services.
   "We've built this up over the last four to five years,
made it profitable and decided this would be a good time to
sell," the spokesman said.
   Analysts said CIBC is following in the footsteps of other
Canadian banks in backing away from its overseas ventures.
   "There's been a retrenchment in recent months as the banks
realized things weren't working out in those markets the way
they'd expected them to," said Kersi Doodha, an analyst with
Maison Placements Canada Inc.
   Mr. Doodha said CIBC is wise to sell the mortgage lending
unit while it is still profitable, pointing to rising
interest and inflation rates in Britain.
   He said the sale of the unit would also help the bank meet
its target of reducing expenses by $130 million over the next
three years.

   GAO Asserts Banks Should Provide
   More Capital to Protect Insurance Fund

   WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office said it is
concerned that bank regulators are making some of the same
mistakes that led to the savings-and-loan crisis, and called
for banks to put up more capital to protect the deposit
insurance fund.
   "We don't think we are in a crisis situation with the
banking industry, but we think now is the time to take steps
to make sure it doesn't happen," Richard Fogel, GAO assistant
comptroller general, testified before the House Banking
Committee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The GAO, outlining a plan to strengthen the banking
industry to avoid a taxpayer bailout of the government
insurance fund, also recommended that required capital levels
for banks be increased beyond the floors in a risk-based
capital system that will be phased in at the end of this
year. The GAO didn't recommend any specific capital levels,
but said the new levels could be phased in over five years or
more to make it easier for banks to raise the money.
   Significantly, the GAO shied away from recommendations to
fundamentally change the deposit-insurance system itself --
such as lowering the $100,000 insurance limit per account or
limiting depositors to a few accounts -- for fear of
"destabilizing the system."
   The GAO's emphasis on capital and supervision, and its
worries about the possible disruption from major changes to
the deposit insurance system, echoed the views expressed by
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan several weeks
ago.
   On the other side of the growing debate are some
congressmen, who would like to explicitly limit the
government's liability by cutting back coverage, and parts of
the banking industry, which fears Congress won't grant banks
new securities and insurance powers unless coverage is
reduced. The GAO plan "doesn't seem to address
deposit-insurance reform," said a spokeswoman for the
American Bankers Association.
   The GAO said, "We question, on grounds of stability,
whether reducing deposit insurance coverage . . . should be
the centerpiece of reform." Instead, the GAO exhorted
Congress to make sure regulators are closing troubled banks
quickly enough, before they pile up losses that the deposit
insurance fund must later handle when the bank fails.
   The GAO is so concerned about the regulators that it
called for a presidentially appointed panel to conduct a "top
to bottom" study of the regulators' procedures and skills.
The GAO also said the regulators shouldn't be given as much
discretion as they have now to allow troubled banks to grow
or pay dividends, among other actions.
   While the GAO didn't present a blanket criticism of the
bank regulators, the agency did warn that they may, in some
cases, be following the dangerous path of their thrift
counterparts in allowing troubled institutions to remain open
too long. Most experts agree that much of the $150 billion
cost of the S&amp;L industry bailout could have been avoided had
hundreds of troubled thrifts in the 1980s not been allowed to
operate for years.
   The agency, an investigative arm of Congress, singled out
the regulators' recent handling of the failure of the
National Bank of Washington as a sign of its concern. The
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency used new powers
granted to it last year to close the bank while it still had
some equity capital remaining. (Previously, regulators
usually waited until complete insolvency.)
   But the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has said it
expects to lose about $500 million, or about 30% of the
bank's assets, bailing out the institution, which "indicates
that OCC did not act soon enough," the GAO said. A spokesman
for the Comptroller didn't have any immediate comment.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Businessland Inc., continuing to cut
costs, said it plans to lay off 10% of its work force and
merge its ComputerCraft unit into main computer-dealer
operations.
   The moves will cost about 370 people their jobs and result
in Businessland, the nation's largest computer dealer, taking
a $1 million charge against earnings in its first quarter
ending Sept. 30.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This year, Businessland has repeatedly cut costs and
reorganized in order to stem operating losses tied to price
competition, rapid overseas expansion and poor performance of
its ComputerCraft unit. In January, the company trimmed its
work force by about 5% and since has posted losses for three
consecutive quarters.
   The decision to fold ComputerCraft into its main
operations follows months of informal efforts by Businessland
to sell the unit, which it purchased two years ago for about
$25 million in stock. Businessland mainly sells computers
directly to large corporations through its own sales force,
while ComputerCraft -- soon to be renamed Businessland -- has
16 stores, mainly in the West, and relies heavily on walk-in
customers.
   David Norman, Businessland's chief executive officer, said
the new arrangement will save the company money, but some
analysts said it was tantamount to discontinuing
ComputerCraft.
   "It's a death knell," said Seymour Merrin, a
computer-dealer analyst in Palo Alto, Calif. Direct sales and
retail "are so different, there is no way to run them under
the same roof."
   Mr. Norman said Businessland also plans to cut expenses by
eliminating its regional sales managers and reducing
inventory by roughly 20% in the current quarter.

   Film: Scorsese's Very Good `Fellas'
   ----
   By Julie Salamon

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12

<LP>
   There's very little that's really new in "GoodFellas,"
Martin Scorsese's latest film, which is what makes this
gangster picture so astonishing. Like some half-mad visionary
who finds new magic every time he paces the same street, Mr.
Scorsese has made familiar territory seem thrilling and
dangerous all over again.
   He was inspired this time by "Wiseguy," Nicholas Pileggi's
sociological study of mobsters at work; the two men wrote the
screenplay together. And though the movie has a dramatic
structure and heart, it is in fact an ingenious bit of
sociology about the "good fellas" who are the organization
men of the Mafia infrastructure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The movie follows a group of them over a 30-year period,
starting in the mid-1950s. They have roughly the same
ambition and desire as other upwardly mobile Americans of
that generation. They speak with the vocabulary of the
streetwise businessman and are no more or less tacky in their
display of wealth than their nouveau-riche contemporaries.
   But while they indulge in the trappings of success --
flashy suits and expensive homes -- of the ordinary striver,
these men operate by a moral compass that makes perfect sense
within their universe and none at all anywhere else. They
live by a complex set of rules. Failing to show respect to a
group leader is unacceptable, murdering an old friend can be
acceptable, even mandatory.
   Mr. Scorsese gets at the romance of the life, and the
rottenness, and the absurdity, without mimicking either the
operatic style of "The Godfather" or the cartoonish
quirkiness of "Married to the Mob." Picturesque though they
may be, his wiseguys feel very real. These men are familiar;
little guys who make themselves feel big through their
acquisition of money and things and by the constant
celebration of what they've accomplished.
   The picture unrolls as a flashback, narrated by Henry Hill
(Ray Liotta). The first third of the picture does romanticize
the mobsters, as the young Henry recalls his infatuation with
these men who seemed so great because they could get things
done. So, for example, when Henry's parents objected to his
missing school to run errands for the local Mafia boss,
Henry's new friends urge the mailman not to deliver the
truancy slips. Henry was aware that they convinced the
mailman by beating him pulpy, but he was young and too
infatuated to think or care about the violence.
   Or maybe Henry and the bad men he gravitated toward were
born without whatever it is that allows most of us to learn
to feel bad when people are brutalized. "I always wanted to
be a gangster," says Henry, right at the beginning, in the
wistful tone of the professional baseball player recalling
how he got started.
   Mr. Scorsese stages Henry's recollection of the early
years with playful poignancy -- interrupted by the flashes of
violence that were an ordinary part of Henry's life. He
sustains the mood with a backdrop of period rock 'n roll
music and with freeze frames that lock in Henry's memory of
this period the way snapshots form the basis of a family's
remembered history.
   When the young Henry (Christopher Serrone) sets a building
on fire and runs away from the explosive flare, Mr. Scorsese
stops the camera on this image of exhilaration, the boy's
arms stretched out in pure joy at his own anarchy, and power.
   Yet the film doesn't glorify the gangsters or make their
outbursts of violence seem anything less than shocking and
horrible. As Henry grows up and becomes an entrenched part of
the gang, the picture changes tone. Henry's still able to
persuade himself that it's all a kick, but he's now aware
that there can be personal danger in the trigger temper of
Tommy (Joe Pesci), and that his "family" will be no more
loyal to him than its men are to their wives (Saturday night
is for wives; Friday night for girlfriends). Even his smooth
friend Jimmy (Robert De Niro), could one day be the one to
whack him.
   Henry starts to share the narration with Karen (Lorraine
Bracco), the suburban Jewish girl who was drawn to Henry for
the same reasons he was drawn to the mob: He was exciting and
dangerous and would make life an ongoing drama. He could get
a table at the Copacabana without reservations, and Bobby
Vinton knew him personally. Without making a big deal of it
Mr. Scorsese slyly stocks the atmosphere with such period
pieces as Henny Youngman, Jerry Vale and Bobby Vinton Jr.
(standing in for his father).
   The picture changes pace again in the third act, as Henry
spins off from his pals and starts taking the drugs he's
dealing. Though Mr. Scorsese hasn't set things up for a big
message, or catharsis, he creates the sense of frenzied
hopelessness that will eventually destroy the life Henry's
bought into, and perhaps worse for him, the mythology he's
created. In the end, the glamour that drew him in seems
pitiable, and it is gone.
   Mr. Scorsese tells his tale swiftly and fluidly, with
characterizations that are beautifully played and never
predictable. Who else would think of showing the mob boss
Paulie (Paul Sorvino) concentrating on slicing garlic thinly
as he waits out his time in prison, organizing perfect meals?
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: The fierce humor and originality of
"GoodFellas" is especially impressive if you consider how
tempting it is in these days of multimillion-dollar contracts
for a successful director to play it safe. Though one could
argue that all Scorsese films are the same, one could just as
easily argue that no two are alike. Sometimes they're almost
too powerful to watch ("Raging Bull"), but they're always
amazing. Compare "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" with "New
York, New York" and "Taxi Driver" or "The Last Temptation of
Christ." Then, if you think one person couldn't stretch
himself any further, rent the rest.

   Concocts New Tax Ideas
   Aimed at Paying the Tab

CONGRESS (CNG)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The savings-and-loan bailout agency tallied
up its growing and increasingly complex funding needs,
prompting an election-year Congress to concoct new ideas for
paying the tab.
   In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee,
William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., said
the agency will have plowed through its original $50 billion
to cover S&amp;L losses by the end of the year, and will need at
least $30 billion to $40 billion more in the next fiscal year
to cover losses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On top of that, another $50 billion to $60 billion in
temporary cash will be required next year to manage assets of
S&amp;Ls seized by the government. The agency expects to recoup
those funds when it sells the assets. Furthermore, the agency
is seeking another $22 billion to defray costs of some 1988
government-assisted thrift sales, in hopes that these
expenditures could save $4 billion in the long run.
   In all, it means that for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1,
the S&amp;L cleanup agency will need roughly $122 billion in
funding, more than double what was anticipated a year ago.
Although the RTC has previously proposed the various
increases, Mr. Seidman's testimony was the first time the
agency has laid out a full package of additional funding.
   Mr. Seidman didn't sugarcoat the message to the
tax-writing committee. "Unfortunately, when it comes to loss
funds, there really are no alternatives," he said.
"Additional loss funds will have to come from the American
taxpayer."
   But several congressmen had other ideas. Rep. Paul
Kanjorsky (D., Pa.) proposed that oil companies pay as taxes
one-third of their earnings that have occurred since the day
that Iraq invaded Kuwait, curtailing the nation's oil supply.
He estimated that $15 billion might be raised.
   Other alternatives included taxing the S&amp;L industry, with
Rep. Barbara Kennelly (D., Conn.) proposing closing two tax
loopholes for S&amp;Ls, and Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.)
suggesting a steep tax on buyers of insolvent S&amp;Ls. Rep.
Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.) proposed surtaxes on unearned
income for wealthy individuals and corporations, and closing
a tax loophole that forgives taxes on appreciated capital
gains at death.
   None of the alternatives appears likely to be given
serious consideration before the congressional session ends
next month.
   The proposals underscored growing regional differences
arising over the S&amp;L cleanup, with Northeastern lawmakers
arguing that their region is paying for an economic bailout
of the Southwest. "My state got hit once," said Ms. Kennelly.
"We want to make sure a solution is found that doesn't hit us
a second time."
   Mr. Seidman also urged Congress to alter a provision in
last year's bailout law that limits the agency's borrowing
authority for temporary capital. He argued for raising the
limit, currently at 85% of the market value of the S&amp;L assets
it holds, to 100% of their value. With the agency holding
$165 billion in assets, removing that cap could free up an
additional $25 billion.
   The General Accounting Office, also testifying,
recommended that Congress quickly take that action, as well
as provide $50 billion to cover S&amp;L losses. It also urged
that the funding be included in the federal budget. "A
funding decision, whether short term or long term, must be
made soon," said Comptroller General Charles Bowsher.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, also increased
its estimate of the total costs to between $335 billion and
$370 billion, up from its earlier $235 billion, based on a
greater-than-expected number of S&amp;L failures and increased
costs for old S&amp;L sales.

   NEW YORK -- A group of United Airlines unions asked 26
banks to decide by Oct. 3 whether they will help finance a
new $175-a-share, or $3.82 billion, bid for UAL Corp., the
airline's Chicago-based parent.
   Gerald Greenwald, the unions' nominee to become UAL
chairman if the on-again, off-again bid succeeds, set the
bank deadline to be six days prior to the Oct. 9 expiration
of the unions' right to acquire UAL at a higher price.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The UAL board, which accepted a union bid of $201 a share,
or $4.38 billion, on April 9, has demanded that any revised
offer provide "commensurate value" with the $201-a-share
package.
   At a meeting of interested banks held yesterday, Mr.
Greenwald said the new offer would include $150 a share in
cash and leave 15% of the stock in the airline in public
hands.
   Financing for the proposed offer would include about $2
billion in bank debt; $750 million in debt supplied by
airline equipment vendors, possibly such as Seattle-based
Boeing Co. and the European aircraft consortium Airbus
Industrie; and $200 million in equity, possibly from a
foreign airline, such as British Airways.
   One person familiar with the transaction said that,
although the banks' reaction to the terms of the deal was
generally positive, "the problem is going to be getting over
the history of the transaction, the psychological and
philosphical factors." Two earlier versions of the buy-out
have collapsed in the past year.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
UAL shares fell $5 to close at $100, amid a sell-off in many
takeover-related stocks, sparked by adverse developments in
pending sales of American General Corp. and Corroon &amp; Black
Corp.

   NEW YORK -- Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan caused prices of short-term Treasury notes to fall
and long-term Treasury bonds to rise.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 point
yesterday, a gain of about $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, fell to 9.01% from 9.06% on Tuesday.
The price of two-year notes declined modestly, while the
yield rose to 8.05% from 8.02% on Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Greenspan, testifying before the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress yesterday morning, said that the
underlying trend in inflation hasn't improved, that the core
rate of inflation in consumer prices may have crept higher,
and that the chance of a significant break soon in the
inflation trend "would seem to have diminished, in view of
the additional pressures from oil prices."
   The entire bond market initially reacted bearishly to Mr.
Greenspan's comments. But the perception that the Fed's
anti-inflation resolve is undiluted helped long-term bonds.
Short-term issues, which have been buoyed by expectations of
an easing by the Fed, were hurt by the news.
   Though Mr. Greenspan reiterated that the Fed would be
inclined to ease policy once a "credible and enforceable"
agreement to cut the federal government's budget deficit was
forged, bond investors apparently don't view this as an
option that will be available anytime soon.
   Donald Ratajczak, director of economics forecasting at
Georgia State University, said he expects troubling news from
the inflation front to continue over the next few months.
Inflation, he said, is the country's "No. 1 issue."
   The noted inflation forecaster said the September consumer
price index will probably rise an additional 0.6% to 0.7% and
the October gauge 0.7% to 0.8%, following August's jump of
0.8%, the first month to reflect Middle East developments
fully.
   The main blame in the inflation picture falls on oil.
Crude oil futures have virtually doubled since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. October crude oil futures currently trade
at $33.18, down 23 cents a barrel from Tuesday's settlement.
   And while consumers have already seen and felt a big chunk
of the price increases stemming from the runup in oil prices,
"Clearly, there is a lagged effect coming in the consumer
price index," Mr. Ratajczak said. He said petroleum
derivative products, such as chemicals and plastics, have yet
to reflect fully the recent oil-price spike.
   "There is no question, the core inflation rate is creeping
up," he said. The core rate will probably run at a "5 1/2%
clip by year end," he said, but will gradually start to cool,
"because the economy is weak. Assuming oil doesn't go through
the roof, it could start cooling off around Christmas or soon
thereafter."
   Asked whether other price-sector increases are more
restrained than others, Mr. Ratajczak said, "When you look at
CPI, it's awful hard to see any areas that are seeing
moderation."
   He noted that an imbalance in beef and pork production
should raise food prices 5% to 6%. He also pointed out the
biggest increase in clothing prices in about five years, and
boosts in prices of the new model-year autos.
   But he said he sees price inflation beginning to moderate,
once oil prices start a downward trend. The big glitch is the
Persian Gulf crisis and what happens next. "If there's a
shooting war, all bets are off," he said, adding that it is
"very hard to speculate" on what this would mean for oil
prices because of unknown factors, such as the kind and
length of any oil production disruptions.
   Meanwhile, the federal funds rate, the interest rate on
overnight loans between banks, rose as high as 10% yesterday,
after falling to low levels on Tuesday. Traders said a big
New York City bank was bidding for funds to avoid going to
the discount window, which helped to push up the rate.
Yesterday was the final day of a two-week reserve maintenance
period, when banks often bid aggressively for funds to meet
reserve requirements.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury securities ended mixed. The benchmark 30-year
bond was quoted late at a price of 97 9/32, to yield 9.01%,
compared with 96 23/32, to yield 9.06% on Tuesday. The latest
two-year notes ended at a price of 100 3/32, down from 100
5/32. The yield rose to 8.05% from 8.02%.
   Rates on short-term Treasury bills were unchanged to
higher. The discount rate on three-month bills ended at
7.38%, for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.6%, the same as
Tuesday. The rate on six-month bills rose slightly to 7.31%
to yield 7.67%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate and Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. ended unchanged, after
spiking up initially on reports that the giant retailer has
drafted plans to buy back sizable amounts of its distressed
junk bonds.
   Macy's 14.5% senior subordinated debentures, due in 1998,
which traded as high as 56, ended at about 54. The company's
14.5% subordinated debentures, maturing in 2001, ended
unchanged at 40, after climbing two points in early trading.
   High-yield dealers said that investors initially bid up
the bonds on the report of the proposed buy-back, but that
skepticism then took over.
   "When the market didn't see any followthrough and any
evidence that the company was buying the bonds, they weakened
again," a trader said. He also cited questions about whether
Macy can "line up financing" to buy back its bonds. As
previously reported, a top official at Macy said the retail
chain would consider selling a 20% stake in the company for
$300 million, which it would use to buy back some of its
debt.
   In the broader high-yield market, junk bonds, or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, were unchanged to lower.
   In the investment-grade market, two Yankee issuers tapped
the debt market. Yankee issues are dollar-denominated bonds
sold by foreign entities. The province of Manitoba sold $350
million of 10-year debentures, priced to yield 9.542%,
through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The province simultaneously sold C$300 million of 10-year
debt in the Canadian market, which was priced to yield
11.25%.
   The kingdom of Malaysia made its debut in the U.S. credit
markets, offering $200 million of 10-year bonds, which were
priced to yield 10.036%, through underwriters led by Salomon
Brothers Inc.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Finance Ministry bought 90 billion yen ($652.7
million) of 10-year government bonds yesterday, a move
designed to support the bond market ahead of next week's
10-year government bond auction.
   Since February, the ministry has bought bonds several
times, often around the time of an auction. In doing so, the
ministry is attempting to support bond prices artificially,
which would enable the government to offer a coupon rate on
the bonds as low as possible, dealers said.
   The government bond buy-back gave mild support to the bond
market in the morning, but dealers said the influence was
small.
   In trading, the current benchmark 10-year government bonds
ended at a price of 81.20, down 0.02 point, to yield 8.56%.
(When calculated using the semiannual compound method, the
yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.79%, according to Salomon
Brothers Inc.)
   In London, prices of British government bonds ended mixed
after comments from Otto Poehl, the head of West Germany's
Bundesbank, the central bank, knocked prices of long gilts
lower.
   Mr. Poehl said Britain's economic difficulties might delay
sterling's entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The comments caused prices of the benchmark long-term bond to
decline 1/2 point.
   West German bonds ended unchanged, and French treasurys
ended modestly firmer in listless trading.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Investors couldn't wait to get their hands on an issue of
$100 million Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
consolidated notes sold in yesterday's session.
   The notes, won by a BT Securities Corp. group, sold out
within 10 minutes of the sale, an underwriting official said.
   Meanwhile, municipal bonds ended the session unchanged in
stagnant dealings.
   The notes, which are rated MIG-1/SP1-plus, and mature
March 15, 1993, are priced for reoffering as 6 1/4% issues at
par.
   "The deal was done and closed immediately after the sale;
$80 million was sold pre-sale and the balance went within 10
minutes," Steve Milano, vice president, municipal
underwriting, at BT Securities, said. "All of the bonds went
to permanent investors."
   The dual tax exemption for many New York and New Jersey
residents, as well as the issuer's high ratings, accounted
for the large amounts of retail and institutional interest in
the deal, the underwriting official said. "It's one of the
highest-quality bonds you can find in New York" with a short
maturity, Mr. Milano said.
   In related market activity, Union Bank of Switzerland
denied it is having talks with Philadelphia. The bank's
statement was a response to a Dow Jones News Service report
that Philadelphia is discussing with the bank the possibility
of borrowing $500 million. The story quoted a person close to
the negotiations as saying that Union Bank would lend the
city $500 million and then resell the debt in the form of
bonds to private investors. The term of the loan would range
from one to 10 years and probably be structured as a general
obligation bond.
   Philadelphia general obligation bonds have shown little
reaction to the latest flurry of financial news. Traders said
the bonds traded to yield about 9.5%, equal to levels late
Tuesday.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue, due 2018, was unchanged at 97 1/8 to
97 3/8, to yield 7.42%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities prices were little changed in
late dealings.
   Morning trading was dominated first by the August
housing-starts data and then by reaction to Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before the congressional
Joint Economic Committee. The market was underpinned by news
that housing starts dropped 1.7% last month, for the seventh
consecutive monthly downturn. Mr. Greenspan's statements
tugged the markets downward, but losses were regained after
the Fed's "Beige Book" report on business conditions in the
12 Fed districts was released. The report found that economic
activity in most of the districts "is expanding more slowly
or declining."
   Only one new mortgage-backed issue was announced in
yesterday's session, a $500 million issue of Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, remic mortgage
securities that is being offered in eight classes by Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. A remic, or real estate mortgage investment
conduit, is a type of security underwritten by Wall Street
firms that provides a method of dividing up the income flows
from many mortgages into new securities with various interest
rates and maturities to attract banks, insurers and other big
investors to the home-mortgage market.
   The offering, Series FHLMC Gold 1008, is collateralized
with Freddie Mac 9% Gold PCs, or participation certificates.
   Mortgage securities lagged behind U.S. Treasurys, as
10-year notes were up about 1/4 point on the day. Yield
spreads consequently widened slightly, as Treasury yields
fall relative to mortgage securities yields.
   In the secondary market, Government National Mortgage
Association, or Ginnie Mae, 9 1/2% issues for October
delivery were unchanged at 98 13/32, Freddie Mac Gold 9 1/2%
issues were off 1/32 at 98 7/8, and Federal National Mortgage
Association, or Fannie Mae, 9 1/2% issues were down 1/32 at
98 22/32.

   Professors Customize Textbooks, Blurring
   Roles of Publisher, Seller and Copy Shop

   College textbooks, monoliths of the publishing industry,
are being pulled apart at the seams by new computer and
photocopier technology.
   The technologies are allowing professors to custom-design
textbooks for their courses, picking articles and excerpts at
will and having them produced cheaply in extremely limited
editions. These new custom books have triggered a fierce
marketing war in the $2 billion college-textbook market by
blurring distinctions among publisher, bookseller and copy
shop.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Behind the struggle is a grass-roots academic movement
that is changing the way college courses are taught.
Retailers estimate these customized books make up about a
10th of all college texts today, up from virtually nothing 10
years ago. Most of them are simple photocopies, but advances
in computers have made it possible for a professor to order
chapters from a publisher's data base, add personal handouts
and receive a laser-printed paperback days later. Professors
are pushing the new technology because it lets them keep up
with fast-changing fields and put their own distinctive
stamps on reading lists.
   The trend is throwing the traditional book business into
disarray. Copy shops are suddenly metamorphosing into
publishers and bookstores. Bookstores, finding themselves
elbowed out of the distribution channel, are scrambling to
turn themselves into publishers. And publishers are dreaming
up elaborate new strategies to beat the photocopiers at their
own game.
   "College stores and publishers are in the midst of a major
transition into being service industries," says Kenneth
Green, a senior researcher at the University of Southern
California's Center for Scholarly Technology. Mr. Green
foresees a day when students and professors will call up
texts, software and data from workstations on campus. The
publishers' and bookstores' roles will be to update the
computer systems and help people use them.
   Signs of the new battle are everywhere. One canny national
chain of copy shops, Kinko's Service Corp., runs a successful
service called Professor Publishing at about 200 outlets
around the country. Kinko's solicits course reading lists and
then creates bound anthologies that it sells to students. The
business is diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars away
from bookstores and publishers.
   The book industry is fighting back. Eight big publishers
have sued Kinko's for copyright violations, in a closely
watched case scheduled to reach trial in a New York federal
court next month. Kinko's, based in Ventura, Calif., claims
its service falls within the bounds of permissible copying.
Booksellers and teachers hope the case will clarify gray
areas in the copyright law, which permits "fair" educational
photocopying but doesn't clearly define what that means.
   Meanwhile, book companies are racing to adapt themselves
to the new textbook marketplace. This summer, McGraw-Hill
Inc., one of the country's biggest publishers, is starting a
project that lets professors order tailor-made versions of
college textbooks. The publisher loads a book and lots of
supplementary articles onto a computer and prints out
whatever material a teacher wants, in any order. McGraw-Hill
says, in some cases, it might ultimately bypass bookstores
altogether, by letting professors dial up the data base from
their personal computers.
   "We're trying to move the whole publishing industry in
this direction," says McGraw-Hill Chairman Joseph L. Dionne,
a former high-school teacher. Customizing all published
material -- magazines, newsletters and someday maybe even
consumer books -- is a crucial part of McGraw-Hill's
long-term strategy, he says.
   Another big publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, has a new joint
venture to create custom textbooks with the biggest operator
of college bookstores, Follett Corp. Follett will take
professors' orders, run off copies and sell the anthologies,
while Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Paramount Communications
Inc., will line up reprint permissions. Chicago-based
Follett, which runs about 300 stores, also has a venture in
the works to enter the copy-shop business.
   Custom publishing should heat up even more in October,
when Xerox Corp. is expected to introduce its long-awaited
first digital copier. The device will turn printed pages into
computer data that can be manipulated, copied, laser-printed
or transmitted. Xerox won't discuss the product, but
officials familiar with the company's plans expect it to
target custom publishing as an important market.
   The rush to produce custom textbooks is also leading to
some low-tech approaches. To compete with a new McGraw-Hill
customized accounting book, publisher Richard D. Irwin Inc.,
a unit of Times Mirror Co., has been ripping the spines off
its rival text, punching holes in the pages, and offering
chapters in loose-leaf binders.
   These developments will provide consumers with the means
to shape books in the same way that technology is giving
people control over other media. Movies and TV shows today
are grist for the videocassette recorder. Recordings get
mixed and matched on home tape decks and on a popular new
machine called Personics, which gives record-store customers
their choice of songs on a cassette.
   For students, the new customized texts can offer lower
prices. The first book in McGraw-Hill's project, an
accounting text by Robert and Walter Meigs, costs $43.95 in
its conventional form. The first customized versions,
featuring only the chapters a professor actually plans to
use, might typically cost half to two-thirds of that.
McGraw-Hill sets the price and pays royalties based on how
many selections a professor orders.
   On the other hand, customized textbooks can't always be
resold to other students, since teachers like to fiddle with
their reading lists from year to year. That's good news for
publishers and bookstores that compete against the used
marketplace, but for students, it wipes out an important
source of cash and bargains.
   For authors, customized books offer the possibility of a
wider audience and a new way to keep books current. Louis
Fisher, author of a constitutional law book that McGraw-Hill
is also offering in customized form, looks forward to
regularly updating his text by dropping new decisions and
articles into his data base.
   But he worries about his status in a publishing system
that cuts his words loose from the printed page and sends
them floating freely in an electronic data base: "What
happens if someone wants only 70% of Chapter Eight? The
student may not get the whole picture the way I want to
present it, and that's a little troublesome."
   He also has qualms about having his work thrown into the
same electronic pool with other authors. "Maybe I think the
article is incompetent and unprofessional," he says. "I would
be in a sense promoting an article that was poorly researched
and below standards."
   To some extent, these are issues that authors already face
in traditional anthology publishing. "There's always the risk
that your book could be juxtaposed with some demeaning thing
on a bookstore shelf for that matter," says Michael Sandel, a
Harvard political scientist who uses photocopied anthologies
in his courses. "Once you write a book, you lose a certain
amount of control over its interpretation and its
presentation anyhow."
   McGraw-Hill says it plans to let authors veto material
they don't want to be alongside, but it admits the policy
could make its customized books less attractive to teachers.
"The author may eliminate his market," worries Robert Lynch,
director of the custom-publishing project.
   The spread of computers on campuses is sure to make the
textbook market even more chaotic. Students and teachers are
starting to have access to optical scanners that can store
images of book pages on computer disks.
   "If illegal copying is currently having an impact, the
advent of electrocopying could increase it tenfold," warns
Gary Shapiro, deputy executive director of the National
Association of College Stores. The association represents
2,900 stores with about $5 billion in revenues. "The
potential impact of technology on the textbook makes the
future of this product, the primary reason for our industry's
existence, uncertain," he says.
   At the same time, many universities are setting up
powerful networks that will someday be linked to personal
computers in all of their offices and dormitory rooms.
"Inevitably, the students are going to get to the point where
they've got a quiz coming up on Chapter 13, it's a pain to
read it on the screen, so they'll print it out for
themselves," says Robert Follett, chairman of the Follett
bookstore chain. "That does bypass the bookstore. And at this
point, I don't have an answer for that."
