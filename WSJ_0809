   U.S. Seeking Ways
   To Curb Demand
   For Imported Oil

ENERGY DEPARTMENT (ERG)

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is trying to think
up ways it can quickly curb Americans' big appetite for
imported oil without appearing to look like the Carter
administration.
   The Energy Department is brainstorming on a laundry list
of proposals for conserving energy, increasing domestic
production and switching fuels that is a far cry from the
Carter days of thermostat controls and crash programs to
build synthetic-energy plants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Americans everywhere must do their part," President Bush
said yesterday, plugging energy conservation in his televised
explanation of why he's sending troops to defend oil-rich
Saudi Arabia.
   The proposals, which are still undergoing changes but
could be sent to the president's desk later this week, reject
the concept of new regulations, gasoline-rationing plans or
price controls. Instead, they focus on ways to remove
barriers to production and rely more on carrots than sticks
in encouraging energy conservation.
   One of the most controversial ideas on the list is
dropping the speed limit back down to 55 miles per hour,
which would save 100,000 barrels of oil a day. The
administration isn't endorsing the idea, an Energy Department
official said, but wants to present all options and leave it
up to the White House to decide what's politically feasible.
   In the end, it also will be up to the White House to
decide whether there's enough of an energy shortfall to issue
a national call for more conservation and domestic
production, similar to President Carter's famous cardigan
sweater address in which he called the 1979 energy crisis the
"moral equivalent of war."
   Another measure would encourage fuel-switching by
industries; estimates are it could replace 160,000 barrels of
imported oil a day. Higher prices have already begun to
persuade industries, many of which adopted dual-fuel capacity
after previous energy crises, to switch from oil to more
plentiful natural gas. Energy Department officials said they
are trying to identify ways to remove barriers, such as
transportation problems, that could inhibit fuel-switching.
   Simply asking Americans to inflate their car tires to
manufacturers' specifications could save 70,000 to 90,000
barrels a day. Other advice is: don't top off gasoline tanks,
double up on car trips, and drive the more efficient car if
there's a choice.
   "There are a number of things that could be done that
don't impair people's lifestyle, but if we did enough of them
it would make a difference," said Linda Stuntz, deputy
undersecretary of energy for policy. "It sounds almost hokey,
but it really could make a difference."
   On the production side, the Energy Department is
considering ways to boost sagging domestic output, including
asking states to delay or relax specific environmental and
drilling regulations that reduce production for the duration
of a shortage, said Ms. Stuntz.
   Department officials in particular are studying the new
$2.5 billion Point Arguello oil-drilling project off the
coast of Santa Barbara, Calif. The project's three drilling
platforms, built by a consortium led by Chevron Corp.'s
Chevron U.S.A. Inc., are ready to pump as much as 100,000
barrels of oil a day, but the company can't get the oil to
shore because it can't get state and local permission to
build a pipeline or use tankers because of environmental
concerns.
   Ms. Stuntz said ways are being explored to try to free up
the production, including perhaps involving the Coast Guard
in ensuring the safety of tankers. "We're trying to turn over
every rock we can find. There aren't that many places where
there's that much production virtually available at the turn
of the tap."
   The department hasn't yet totaled how much imported oil
could be offset by the measures it has in mind. The list is
still subject to review by Energy Secretary James Watkins
before going to the White House.

   Europe's Brightening Economic Outlook
   Is Clouded by Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait

   While Europe was celebrating the liberation of its eastern
wing and the prosperity of its fast-unifying West, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein stepped in to rewrite the script.
   As a result, the decade that was supposed to usher in a
radiant future for all Europe now is on shakier ground.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Faced with rising energy bills, the European Community now
expects slower growth and higher prices -- a recurrence of
the "stagflation" virus that plagued industrial economies in
the 1970s. But those effects seem mild when set against the
potentially devastating blow the Middle East crisis may deal
struggling Eastern Europe.
   For four decades, Eastern Europe was insulated from
fluctuations in energy prices -- including the two big energy
shocks of the 1970s -- by virtue of Soviet oil and gas, which
flowed in at heavily subsidized prices. Now that they're
shifting to market prices and hard-currency payments for
energy, the Eastern Europeans in effect will have to absorb
three energy shocks at once -- the two they missed plus the
one Saddam Hussein set off with his invasion of Kuwait.
   "The Eastern European contracts will switch to
hard-currency accounting with the Soviet Union, and this in
itself will have a severe impact," says Peter Havlik, an
energy specialist with the Vienna Institute for Comparative
Economic Studies. Add to that the price increases arising
from the Middle East crisis, "and it'll have an even greater
negative impact."
   Of course, the consequences for all of Europe depend on
how long the crisis goes on and how high the price of oil
rises. But oil-price increases of some magnitude are
considered inevitable.
   The added pain of higher-than-expected energy costs comes
when the former Soviet satellites are already reeling from
the jolts of moving to market-oriented economies. Fears are
growing that the worsening economic outlook will stir up
social discord in Eastern Europe and make it harder for
governments there to stick with reforms. As a result, the
major industrial nations may well be called upon to beef up
already generous aid programs.
   "The impact of $20-to-$30 a barrel oil prices is
catastrophic for Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, " says David
Roche, European strategist for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
London. "And it increases substantially the costs to West
Germany of supporting a collapsing East German economy."
   The Middle East crisis will probably set back the
still-embryonic programs for cleaning up the East's ravaged
environment. Mr. Havlik of the Austrian economics institute
predicts that expected oil-price increases will force
Czechoslovakia to keep several aging, and possibly unsafe,
nuclear reactors in operation. And throughout Eastern Europe,
brown coal, a major source of sulfurous pollutants, will
continue to be a needed source of energy.
   Eventually, Prague economists speculate, the worsening
economic outlook will push Czechoslovakia to give up its
policy of sticking to a low level of foreign debt. By
contrast, Bulgaria, whose hard-currency earnings could be
completely wiped out by the rise in energy costs, probably
couldn't increase its borrowings if it chose to: It hasn't
been able to keep up with payments on its $10 billion current
foreign debt. Similarly, Poland, staggering under a $40
billion debt, probably won't be able to look to increased
borrowings.
   In Western Europe, the shocks in the oil markets are
decidedly less ominous, but are clouding the economic
optimism of the past three years. Economists are looking for
both higher inflation and lower growth.
   Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, says that
the crisis has shattered the general sense that Europe's
recent good times would go on indefinitely. (The Bank for
International Settlements essentially is the central bank for
the world's central banks.)
   "There's always been a nagging question about how long the
expansion could go on," Mr. Lamfalussy says. "Until these
events, I thought our prospects were quite good. We had a
good engine in Europe and Japan, and a slowdown in the U.S.
that wasn't that worrying. Now the chances of a world-wide
slowdown have increased, and increased in a rather unpleasant
scenario -- with a stagflation side."
   West Germany's Bundesbank, Western Europe's chief guardian
against inflation, insists there's no reason to assume
there'll be a new bout of stagflation. "Our economists say
there shouldn't be a complete revision of their assumptions,"
says an official of the central bank in Frankfurt. "But
there's concern."
   That concern will grow as oil prices rise, private
economists predict. Some time in the fall, many believe, the
Bundesbank will raise interest rates, setting off a similar
round of increases in Europe.
   The Middle East crisis also is expected to complicate the
EC's march toward monetary and economic integration. "This is
going to affect some countries differently from others," says
Thomas Berger, a director in London of Lombard Odier &amp; Cie.,
a Swiss investment concern.
   Spain, Portugal and Italy remain heavily dependent on
imported oil. In addition, the Mediterranean nations haven't
made the strides their northern allies have in pushing
through energy-saving conservation policies.
   Elsewhere, though, "the economies aren't in the same
situation as in 1973 and 1978," says Michel Develle, director
of economics with Banque Paribas in Paris. "The share of oil
in France's total consumption was 69% in 1973 and in 1988
it's 41%. During the same period West Germany's share dropped
from 56% to 41%."
   Britain, an oil producer, stands to increase its oil
revenue. But this advantage may be eclipsed by higher energy
costs that could drive up Britain's already worrisome rate of
inflation, currently nearing 10%. That makes it harder for
the Chancellor of the Exchequer to bring down base interest
rates, now at 15%. Thus, Britain may have to put off further
its full entry into the European Monetary System, which links
together the major EC currencies within set bands of
fluctuation.
   After a year of political changes in the East and
expectations in the West, the Middle East crisis will alter
the psychological climate and cramp the flow of investment.
   Europe's robust growth in recent years has been largely
attributed to a boom in capital-spending as companies
restructured and expanded in anticipation of a larger and
more dynamic marketplace in the 1990s. On the heels of Iraq's
invasion, S.G. Warburg warned that as corporate earnings fall
off, there will be "cutbacks in capital spending plans --
especially against a backdrop of continued high interest
rates."

   Forms Six-Member

   NEW YORK -- Chemical Banking Corp. created a six-member
"office of the chairman" to run the bank-holding company and
its principal bank subsidiaries.
   Walter V. Shipley, the 54-year-old chairman and chief
executive officer of Chemical Banking, said that he, Vice
Chairman Robert J. Callander and four other executives will
constitute the new office, which replaces a 15-man management
committee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Callander, 59, was named president of the holding
company. The four other executives are Edward A. O'Neal Jr.,
46; William H. Turner, 50; William B. Harrison, 47; and Marc
J. Shapiro, 43. Messrs. O'Neal, Turner and Harrison were
named vice chairmen of the Chemical Bank subsidiary. Mr.
Shapiro continues as president and chief executive officer of
Texas Commerce Bancshares. The four positions are equal in
stature, Mr. Shipley said.
   Mr. Shipley said Chemical has been telling analysts and
investors for the past year that they should view the company
as four basic businesses -- an institutional bank, a
technology-based transaction business and two regional banks,
one in New York and the other in Texas. "We have now
positioned those four businesses at the top level of the
organization," he said.
   In the new structure Mr. Harrison will be responsible for
world-wide institutional banking activities, Mr. O'Neal will
run the transactions business, Mr. Turner will be responsible
for regional banking in New York and Mr. Shapiro will
continue to run the Texas bank.
   The naming of three vice chairmen is somewhat reminiscent
of an earlier structure in which Chemical had three
presidents. In 1983 the company named Mr. Callander, Robert
Lipp and Thomas Johnson, presidents. But Mr. Lipp left
Chemical in 1986 and the organization returned to a more
traditional structure, with Mr. Callander serving as one of
two vice chairmen and Mr. Johnson as the sole president. Mr.
Johnson left Chemical last December. The other vice chairman,
Richard S. Simmons, 62, plans to retire Oct. 15.
   Mr. Shipley said the reorganization of Chemical's top
management isn't a prelude to further cost-cutting measures,
noting that Chemical's expenses declined in each of the last
three years. "This corporation is operating at lower expense
base today than it was in 1987," he said.
   Chemical laid off about 2,000 employees in 1987 and 1,000
more earlier this year.

   Roll-Up Trash Can
   Cuts Down on Waste

   BAG HOG, a new trash container, is better looking than a
plastic barrel, and it devours less of the Earth's resources.
   Made of rugged, recyclable plastic, the Bag Hog is
shipped, stored and sold flat and unpackaged. Instructional
graphics, locking tabs and a quick release system allow the
user to turn flat sheets into cone-shaped containers in
seconds. Trash bags are attached at two keyholes by pushing
the bags through with index fingers.
   Designed by John Lonczak, Tony Baxter and Simon Yan of
John Lonczak Design in New York, the Bag Hog last night
received one of this year's 16 gold awards for design
excellence given by the Industrial Designers Society of
America.
   One juror, Peter Lowe, praised the Bag Hog, which is made
by stamping, for using "less energy to make than a molded
container and less plastic to enclose a given amount of
trash."
   Sold by Form Farm Inc. of New York, the Bag Hog isn't for
every situation. Designer Lonczak advises "discretion" in
using the bottomless product for liquids. And he sees a
"potential problem" in getting Bag Hog to lie flat again
after it's been in use.
                                                                                                       

   Creating a New Recipe
   For Satellite Dishes
                                                                                                       

   HOW DO you get more homeowners to install TV dish antennas
when most dishes are big and ugly? Design one that's small
and beautiful.
   But a smaller antenna on the ground requires a more
powerful satellite. General Electric's Satcom K-1 satellite
has 45 watts, which makes it about twice as powerful as the
competition and able to send quality TV signals to antennas
that are half as big. GE could simply have shrunk a standard
antenna by half. Instead, it opted for a total redesign.
   "The size of a dish is a big deal with homeowners, but so
is its looks," says Joan Fu, an engineer with GE American
Communications in Princeton, N.J. "We hope aesthetically
pleasing antennas will attract customers."
   Charles Keane and Steve Monti of Boston's Gregory Fossella
Design, a McCalla Lackey company, conceived the new antenna,
which last night received an IDSA gold award. The elliptical
dish is 45 inches long. The antenna is designed to be mounted
on the peak of a roof, on a wall or standing free. With 20%
fewer parts, it's less expensive to produce and easier to
install.
   Jury Chairman Gianfranco Zaccai said the new antenna shows
that "it's possible, through sensitive design, to tame a
technological artifact which often litters the landscape of
America."
                                                                                                       

   Gobi Aims to Improve
   Design in Barren Niche
                                                                                                       

   GERALD Hirshberg came away from the meeting "angry and
frustrated." Once again, the Nissan Motor big shots had
argued that an inexpensive car had to be "bland, spartan and
uninteresting." Mr. Hirshberg, a vice president of Nissan
Design International, San Diego, set out to prove his bosses
wrong.
   His anger led to the Gobi car/truck, which Nissan is
considering for production. Designed with the help of Bruce
Campbell and Diane Taraskavage, the Gobi received an IDSA
gold award.
   "Androgynous" is how Mr. Hirshberg likes to describe his
creation. The helicopter-like passenger cocoon seems
feminine, while the rugged, corrugated, fold-down sides of
the cargo bed have a masculine look. Yet Mr. Hirshberg
believes the whole vehicle will appeal to both sexes. "More
and more men are becoming comfortable with the feminine
component in all of us," he says, "and more and more women
are not afraid of changing a tire.
   "I'm sure somebody can find a place for a gun rack in the
Gobi," concludes Mr. Hirshberg, "but I hope they don't."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   OTHER gold medal winners included a voting machine that
combines easy access for people in wheelchairs with a simple
set of electronic switches. The machine was designed by James
Bleck, Scott Wakefield and John Thrailkill of Bleck Design in
Chelmsford, Mass., for Sequoia Pacific Systems of Jamestown,
N.Y. . . . A gold medal went to an all-weather stacking chair
designed by Warren Snodgrass and Charles Roth of Design
Technology in Mill Valley, Calif., for Tropitone Furniture,
Irvine, Calif. The chair has a seat and back of perforated
aluminum sheet on a frame of aluminum tube.

   WASHINGTON -- By comparison with the vast, sprawling
Smithsonian Institution a mile or so away, Tom and Meredith
Hughes's Potato Museum on North Carolina Avenue was -- so to
speak -- small potatoes.
   Yet where else were its 500-plus visitors a year likely to
encounter a 4,000-year-old Peruvian potato? Or a sendup of
"Olympia," Manet's portrait of a reclining nude, with a
potato -- nude, naturally -- replacing the female model? Or a
rare copy of Carl Claudius's privately published 1954 opus,
"Vicissitudes of an Esculent," with this matchless tribute:

   "Wipe out apple, apricot,
   Yam, and peanut, and tomato:
   World would wig but long could not
   Wag along without potato]"
                                                                                                       

   Alas, the world must wag along without the Potato Museum.
It closed in June, when Mr. and Mrs. Hughes's landlady
reclaimed the three-story townhouse they had rented to house
it. Unless the Hugheses can recruit moneyed sponsors, the
unique institution may remain closed.
   The Hugheses insist they aren't fanatics. They just happen
to love potatoes.
   They once traveled through the Ardennes forest in Belgium
to locate a farmer who grew an unusual hand-shaped variety of
potato, the "Coene di Gatte" (Walloon for "Cat's Paw"). They
had to provide the name of a mutual aquaintance before the
farmer would admit that he grew the rare breed, so suspicious
was he of potato espionage.
   They've tracked the legend of Potato Creek Johnny, who
supposedly found the biggest gold nugget ever unearthed in
the neighborhood of Deadwood, S.D.; traversed Andean peaks to
see the birthplace of potato cultivation; and visited an
Australian-built potato chip factory in remote southwest
China in search of ever more exotic potato lore. In Mr.
Hughes's analysis, the potato is even responsible for the
fall of communism in Eastern Europe.
   "The Poles feed about half of their potato crop to their
animals," Mr. Hughes, who is 45, explains. "The potato crop
failed because they have no blight-resistant potatoes, so
they had to slaughter a lot of their animals. The meat that
was left went out of the country to get export money, so the
people had no meat, which led to the huge shortages, which
led to the strikes and the rise of the Solidarity movement."
   For 15 years, the Hugheses engaged in a labor of love as
organizers and curators of the Potato Museum. Mr. Hughes, a
fifth-grade teacher, began collecting potato curiosities in
Europe. He and his wife, living in Belgium, were fascinated
by the Belgians' affection for the potato and its prominence
in their diet. When they read in a newspaper that Ireland
didn't but should have a Potato Museum, they decided to found
one.
   Their museum's library contained more than 350 books,
including the seminal "The History and Social Significance of
the Potato," by Redcliffe N. Salaman, first published in 1949
by Cambridge University Press. The museum displayed old and
rare potatoes, completely dehydrated. Visitors were asked to
make donations of $2.50 for each adult and $1 per child. The
Hugheses gave guided tours.
   But keeping the museum going was tough. "We were asking of
ourselves not only to be administrators and tour guides, but
professional development people," Mr. Hughes says. "When the
landlady wanted her house back, it was sort of a relief." The
Hugheses have stored the museum's contents in the basement of
their home in Great Falls, Va.
   The couple figures the logical sponsor of a new museum
would be the potato industry, but the industry seems cool.
"Collecting memorabilia, though interesting, is not the
efficient way to promote potatoes," says Robert Mercer,
president of the National Potato Promotion Board. "We've
never really considered it."
   The Hugheses have made repeated requests for support, both
moral and financial, from companies such as H.J. Heinz Co.'s
Ore-Ida Foods division, but to no avail. "It's baffling how
you can send out a proposal to a big corporation and hear
nothing," Mrs. Hughes, 44, says. But Sue Gearhart, a
spokesperson for Ore-Ida in Boise, Idaho, says the Hughes
proposal, submitted this spring, will be considered at a
meeting yet unscheduled of the company's donations committee.
   The lack of support has left the Hugheses steaming. "If
they've taken a small-potatoes mentality to all of this,
we're not," says Mr. Hughes, who sees the industry misgivings
as half-baked: "Their marketing notion is that you back up
the truck to the store, and you dump the potatoes off, and
that's it.
   "We are talking to your customers all the time about the
potato," Mrs. Hughes adds with obvious agitation. "Come on]
Wake up]"
   The Hugheses have attracted some support. One fellow
'tater touter is Jean-Louis Palladin, owner and chef of the
exclusive Jean-Louis restaurant here. To extol the "pomme de
terre's" virtues for a Japanese documentary-film team, he
once prepared a seven-course meal, from appetizer to dessert,
with potatoes central to every dish. Dessert, if you're
wondering, was sweet-potato sorbet with candied sweet
potatoes.
   John Niederhauser, this year's recipient of the
prestigious World Food Prize for his work on creating new
types of blight-resistant potatoes, sits on the board of
trustees of the Potato Museum. Other museum trustees are F.
Lane Heard III, a partner in the Washington law firm of
Williams &amp; Connolly; Charles G. Burck, a Fortune magazine
editor, and Merle Jensen of the University of Arizona,
designer of the Land Pavilion at Disneyworld's Epcot Center.
   Prof. Jensen thinks a sponsor will eventually be found.
"It's just mind-boggling that that person hasn't come
forward," he says.
   The Hugheses have heard from several communities
interested in attracting the museum. Money is the sticking
point. "They view us as eccentric millionaires who somehow
don't need to be paid," Mrs. Hughes says, although in fact
the Hugheses are middle-income. Would-be suitors have
included Monte Vista, Colo., Grafton, N.D., and Shannon,
Ireland. The latest entrant is the Kensington area on
Canada's Prince Edward Island. "I was quite impressed with my
conversations with Mrs. Hughes," says Heather Mountain of the
Kensington and Area Chamber of Commerce. "They have a passion
about the potato and everything about the potato."
   The Hugheses still publish several hundred copies of each
edition of "Peelings," the newsletter for museum members, and
are busy preparing a potato display for a Smithsonian
Institution exhibit about the legacy of the European
discovery of America. They also continue to pursue their
ultimate dream -- "the fireworks at the end of the picnic,"
Mr. Hughes says -- a World Food Museum.
   The idea is for a federation of many community-based
museums built to glorify the world's foods, of which the
Potato Museum would be only a part. A "Disney or Epcot-type
experience," Mr. Hughes says, it would include exhibits,
simulated food rituals from around the world and a restaurant
where patrons could pick their own food, watch it being
prepared and eat it. Until then, the Hugheses intend to
broaden their own horizons. "Next," Mr. Hughes says, "we're
going on to tomatoes."

   Workplace:
   Survey Fortifies Parental-Leave Backers

   Backers of parental-leave laws have new ammunition against
business charges that such legislation is costly and
unworkable.
   The majority of employers surveyed in the first four
states to adopt parental-leave laws -- Oregon, Minnesota,
Wisconsin and Rhode Island -- said "they were experiencing
neither serious increases in costs . . . nor difficulty in
administering and implementing the legislation," according to
the Families and Work Institute, a New York-based nonprofit
consulting and research firm that conducted the survey with
funding from the Ford Foundation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The survey is believed to be the first comprehensive study
examining specific effects on employers of state parental and
family leave laws. It could influence long-sought federal
legislation, as well as state efforts to establish or expand
leave programs. The study "once and for all puts to bed the
cost argument," contends Kathy Bonk, co-director of the
Communications Consortium, which has been promoting the
federal legislation.
   But opponents of leave laws say the survey's results are
flawed and its motivations are political. "If I'm trying to
get {parental leave} enacted into law, what better thing to
say than here's a study that says there's no impact or the
impact's overblown," says John Motley, vice president of
government affairs for the National Federation of Independent
Business, the largest group representing small business.
   The push for a national law stalled last month after the
House sustained President Bush's veto of family-leave
legislation. The measure would have given workers at
companies with 50 employees or more up to 12 weeks off
annually in unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption or the
serious illness of a family member. But backers plan to
continue their efforts, and many states are forging ahead
with their own proposals. Currently, 26 states have some form
of job-protected leave. More than 12 additional states have
bills pending, either to establish or expand such programs.
   Business groups have vigorously fought such measures on
the ground that employers need flexibility in offering
benefits to workers. They raise concerns over the cost of
finding and training replacement workers and covering health
insurance for employees on leave. They also say the measures
would reduce existing benefits and favor only highly paid
employees who can afford to take unpaid time off.
   But "in terms of cost and disruption to employers, it just
hasn't panned out," says Michele Lord, senior research
associate at the Families and Work Institute. The four state
laws examined by the group's survey offer job-protected
unpaid leave and the continuation of health benefits.
   Rhode Island's law, enacted in 1987, covers birth,
adoption and the serious illness of a child for up to 13
weeks and applies to companies of 50 or more employees.
Minnesota's law, also enacted in 1987, grants leaves of up to
six weeks for birth or adoption and covers companies with 21
or more employees. Oregon's law, enacted in 1988, grants up
to 12 weeks for birth or adoption for employees in companies
of 25 or more. Wisconsin's more comprehensive law, also
enacted in 1988, offers six weeks of family leave for birth
or adoption, two weeks for the serious illness of a child,
parent or spouse, and two weeks for the employee's own
serious illness. The law covers employers of 50 or more.
   The survey, which was begun 1 1/2 years ago, looked at a
representative sample of employers in each state selected
from state labor and employment agencies' data bases.
Questionnaires were developed with help from state business,
labor and child-care advocates.
   The institute says the businesses surveyed ranged in size
from under 20 employees to more than 500 and represented an
array of 12 industries in each state.
   A majority of employers surveyed in each state said costs
for health benefits, training, unemployment insurance and
administrative duties hadn't increased as a result of the
legislation. Nearly half the employers surveyed in Rhode
Island, Oregon and Minnesota said the legislation was
extremely or moderately easy to implement, and 42% said so in
Wisconsin.
   When asked how they replace employees on leave, the top
choice of employers across all four states, or 59.8%, was to
assign the work temporarily to other employees. In addition,
28.8% said they used outside temporary replacements, 3.6%
paid employees overtime, and 3.3% used permanent
replacements.
   Many employers said they didn't have the difficulties they
had expected with the law, according to the survey. A big
Oregon company with 538 employees, 70% of them women, said
eight women had taken leave in the year after the law passed
and only one didn't return to her job.
   "The statute helped define the company's policy and give
all employees equal treatment, so they know what to expect,"
a company official said. The company's biggest problem was
dealing with administrative details, such as allowing the use
of accrued vacation for leave purposes.
   An Oregon bank said it used "rover tellers" during leaves.
About 25% of its employees took the full 12-week leave, and
it called turnover related to parental leave "a minor
addition" to its overall turnover rates. The bank's one
difficulty: A branch manager and an assistant branch manager
took leave at the same time. Overall, a bank official said,
the law was "good for business and worth its weight in gold
with respect to the parent-child relationship."
   But Christine Russell, House liaison for the Chamber of
Commerce, says the survey results don't present an accurate
picture because state laws are different from the proposed
federal law. "The bottom line is, it's still a mandate, and
what works in Wisconsin may not work in New Mexico," she
says. Mr. Motley of the independent business federation says
it's too early to draw conclusions about the state programs
surveyed.
   In the survey, some employers complained of costs and
hassles in administering the laws. One employer said the
paper work was "overwhelming" and that he had difficulty
trying to understand and implement the law. He griped that
"legislators don't know what employers want in legislation,"
adding that his predominantly male manufacturing work force
would prefer higher salaries and higher contributions to
health-care insurance.
   The survey also included parents and found that low-income
parents returned to work from leaves much sooner than other
parents. In Oregon, 42% of parents surveyed said they came
back from leave because they couldn't afford to stay out
longer. The same reason was given by 41.8% of parents
surveyed in Minnesota.
   The survey results are preliminary; full details will be
released in the fall.

   Robert D. Joffee Helps to Support

   ROBERT D. JOFFEE EARNED BIG FEES and great satisfaction
giving legal advice to Time Inc. on its purchase of Warner
Communications Inc. last year. He found his reward, however,
fighting building permit battles and small-claims contract
disputes for no fee at all.
   Mr. Joffee, a 47-year-old partner in the prestigious New
York law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, is also an active
board member of the Jericho Project, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to helping homeless people recovering from alcohol
or drug abuse find shelter and jobs. Started seven years ago
as an outreach program of three Episcopal churches, Jericho
today operates on an $800,000 annual budget, providing job
counseling and subsidized rent for 59 people in a scruffy
Manhattan welfare hotel.
   Lawyer Joffee joined the group in 1985, attracted by its
efforts to rehabilitate instead of simply house those with
substance-abuse problems. His firm, like many others,
encourages pro bono, or free, work by members on behalf of
those who can't afford legal services. But the Harvard Law
graduate has gone the extra mile, giving about 20% of his
professional time to Jericho and other causes. His
contribution to Jericho alone could equal about $28,000 a
year in legal fees, based on what partners in firms of
Cravath's stature command from corporate clients.
   "Even though Bob's own workday is full, he has time for
us," says Gene Estess, Jericho's executive director and a
former Wall Street options trader. If Mr. Joffee is away,
Jericho staffers simply leave a message on his answering
machine. "We couldn't operate without him and we couldn't
afford to pay for his legal and business advice," says Mr.
Estess.
   Even during last year's lengthy high-pressure tangle of
negotiations and court battles -- as Time fought a hostile
bidder and completed the $14 billion acquisition of Warner
Communications -- Mr. Joffee had time for Jericho. However,
he concedes he briefly had to delegate some of the Jericho
load to two associates. "I don't think we let anything fall
between the cracks at Jericho," he says.
   Mr. Joffee's major Jericho challenge since late 1988 has
involved plans to convert a five-story former Harlem hotel
into a permanent Jericho residence for 56 people. He handled
a legal dispute with the first architect over payment
schedules and oversaw the yearlong eviction proceedings of a
liquor store from the old structure.
   He has also dealt with about six state and city agencies
to complete the facility, with occupancy now scheduled for
October. (Even with the resources, skills and perseverance of
an advocate like Mr. Joffee, the project fell eight months
behind schedule, snarled in red tape that he had to unravel.)
   His current legal work for the group is hardly material
for an "L.A. Law" script. For instance, he is working on a
conduct code to spell out how both employees and residents at
the new facility can be lawfully tested, on a regular basis,
for use of drugs and alcohol without violating their privacy.
In addition, he is studying such weighty matters as Jericho's
liability for, say, lost or scorched clothing should Jericho
open a laundromat business on the ground floor of the rebuilt
Harlem structure.
   Mr. Joffee is also continuing to search for new Jericho
board members. Over a business lunch, he recently convinced a
fellow corporate lawyer to sign on; at a cocktail party/fund
raiser for Jericho at his apartment he persuaded a successful
psychiatrist, who has an apartment in the same building, to
become a board member.
   "Helping those less lucky than myself is very satisfying,"
says Mr. Joffee. "In some way it pays back for the luck I've
had in my life." Students in his high school must have sensed
something: The class of '61 voted him most likely to succeed.

   See This Man for a Really Clean Driving Machine

<LP>
   Burbank, Calif. -- God -- and Bill Larzelere -- are in the
details.
   Since 1975, Mr. Larzelere has run an automotive shop
catering to people who want their vehicles to shine like a
cheap suit, and antique-car collectors who enter auto shows
where a dust mote in the air-conditioning vent can spell the
difference between first and second place. In a town where
you are what you drive, and where car washes and so-called
car detailers proliferate, Mr. Larzelere is viewed by devoted
customers as every bit the equal of the Almighty.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Often, even new cars fresh out of the dealership are taken
to Mr. Larzelere's Burbank Boulevard shop for some spit and
polish before their highly discriminating owners drive them
home.
   "There's such a quantity of cars that goes through a
dealership and the cars aren't really finished or prepared or
cleaned after shipping," says Mr. Larzelere, a burly,
reassuring 46-year-old. "In a lot of instances we get paint
that's scratched or full of buffer swirls."
   New car, old car, Datsun or Duesenberg, it's all the same
to Mr. Larzelere, who can take cleanliness "as far as the
customer wants."
   Some customers -- Mr. Larzelere calls them clean freaks --
want to take it pretty far. Take, for example, the woman who
brought in her new Mercedes pointing out traces of grease
around the boltheads that fasten the seat to the floor, or
take the man distressed about the barely discernible dirt
around the levers of the steering column. "We make notes on
some of these people to know what they're looking for. The
Sagittarians are the worst," says Mr. Larzelere, a mustached
Pisces, who drives a well-rusted -- but reasonably clean --
1962 Dodge.
   When Mr. Larzelere is readying a car for a prestigious
show like Pebble Beach's Concours d'Elegance, no detail is
too minute. The screwheads that hold together various parts
of the car are lined up so that the grooves all point the
same way. The carpet nap is brushed so that it all stands in
the same direction, the trunk toolbox is tidied and the tires
-- including the spare -- are pumped up to equal pressure.
   Mr. Larzelere traces his passion for clean machines to a
childhood spent watching his father restore race cars, and
hanging out with the hot-rod-crazed older guys in the
neighborhood. "I used to take care of their cars, and in
exchange they'd let me use them for dates," he says. "When I
started building my own cars I always made sure they were
clean because I didn't want to get dirty working on them."
   The tools of Mr. Larzelere's trade include Pledge (dandy
for dusting and cleaning car interiors and for chassis and
engine compartments). He uses a cotton similar to the fiber
used in sanitary napkins for applying polish and removing
wax, Q-tips or skewer strips to clean cracks and crevices,
plain soap and water to clean the underside of the car and
fine-grade sandpaper to grind out imperfections in exterior
paint surfaces. Waxing and polishing, a complicated
eight-step process, are done under the unforgiving scrutiny
of a portable fluorescent lamp.
   "Bill has a relationship with paint that very few people
have," says longtime customer Bruce Meyer, owner of Geary's,
a purveyor of crystal and china in Beverly Hills. "After your
car is painted you need someone who knows how to sand it and
polish it. Bill knows how to make dry paint look wet."
   It is work that requires the forbearance of Job and the
serenity of Mr. Rogers. "I've learned to become really
tolerant," says Mr. Larzelere. A lucky thing considering he
counts among his customers a man who, while renovating his
home went through six different toilets because he didn't
like the sound of the flush. "He's the kind of guy," says Mr.
Larzelere, "who would pick up his car from me Friday and
bring it back Saturday if he used it Friday night." Another
longtime customer visits his car while it's being detailed,
going so far as to photograph the progress. Some of the cars
Mr. Larzelere so carefully details never get driven; they'd
only get dirty again goes the thinking.
   A former clean freak himself, Mr. Larzelere once
plastic-wrapped the underside of his car in a futile attempt
to protect it from the rain. "My biggest pet peeve," he says,
"are people who have a nice car and don't take care of it
correctly or neglect it by leaving it outside in all
seasons."
   Or leaving ketchup-coated french fries under the seats.
"We have taken some interesting stuff out of cars," says Mr.
Larzelere. "We did a car that belonged to somebody who took
out a celebrity. The celebrity had too much to drink and got
sick in the car." Naturally, Mr. Larzelere was called the
next day to police the area, "which I felt was out of my
jurisdiction," he says. "I thought the person responsible for
the mess should clean up after himself but. . . ."
   The concrete block and wood wall that wraps around Mr.
Larzelere's shop bears no sign; nothing reveals the nature of
the business conducted inside the enclosure, and the shop's
number is unlisted. Referrals have given Mr. Larzelere more
work than he can handle. "If someone wants to find him badly
enough they find him," says Mr. Larzelere's wife, Barbara.
Indeed, one man who read a newspaper article revealing that
the shop was on Burbank Boulevard spent weeks driving up and
down the strip, stopping at different places until he found
someone who could locate Mr. Larzelere.
   During my visit, one of the shop's two hoists held a
disassembled 1969 Maserati Ghibli Spyder whose engine,
chassis and inside were being fully restored. On the other
was a movie producer's 1988 Lamborghini Countach, in for a
cleaning. Mr. Larzelere prefers to work on only three or four
cars at a time -- one customer has been waiting a year for an
appointment -- but he has to allow for emergencies like,
well, water spots.
   "I've had customers call me at midnight, one o'clock in
the morning," says Mr. Larzelere. "They were driving out of
Chasen's and the restaurant turned on the sprinklers and they
have water spots on their cars. I had another guy call me
who'd been driving somewhere and somebody threw something on
the car and he had to get it off immediately or his world
would end, I suppose."
   "They act like Bill is a doctor, that he's on call 24
hours a day," says Mrs. Larzelere. "I've had to be rude."
   It must be the doctor-sized bills that confuse the people.
A basic detailing -- interior, exterior, wheels and tires,
doorjamb, trunk jamb -- takes about a day and a half and runs
$350 (the average price elsewhere is about $100). More
elaborate jobs like car restorations can run into the months
and thousands.
   "Bill charges more than average but I can't deny the
quality of his work," says Lillian Bin, the manager of a
Beverly Hills law office, who has her Mercedes detailed every
three months. "If there's a bit of nail polish on the head
liner he won't miss it. If there's dirt buildup on the
armrest or water spots on the doorjamb he always finds them."
   Some people are a bit bewildered by it all. Several years
ago, a man brought in his wife's Ferrari convertible for
extensive detailing. A month went by, then another and
another. The wife was getting suspicious. "She said it didn't
take three months for a car to be washed," says Mrs.
Larzelere. "She thought Bill must have destroyed it."
   "This car wasn't cleaned," insisted the woman when she and
her Ferrari were finally reunited. "It had a hysterectomy."

   WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
lowered its ratings on securities of Potomac Electric Power
Co. and medium-term notes issued by the Potomac Capital
Investment Corp. unit.
   The rating concern said its actions affect a total of
about $2.2 billion in securities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Based on a review completed last Thursday, Moody's said it
concluded the utility has a weakened cash flow position and
higher capital spending levels, because of planned
construction of several peaking facilities from 1991 to 1993.
Also, the District of Columbia Public Service Commission
recently cleared a rate increase that was less than Potomac
Electric had requested.
   A Potomac Electric spokeswoman said, "We are disappointed
in the downgrade and we are addressing one of Moody's
concerns, namely the regulatory rate situation." She said the
utility hasn't decided whether to file for reconsideration,
appeal the decision or request another rate increase.
   Moody's lowered ratings on Potomac Electric's first
mortgage and secured pollution-control bonds to double-A-3
from double-A-2, debentures and medium-term notes to
single-A-1 from double-A-3, and preferred stock to double-A-3
from double-A-4. The unit's privately placed medium-term
notes were downgraded to single-A-1 from double-A-3.
   The prime-1 rating on commercial paper of both the utility
and unit weren't reviewed or changed.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Potomac Electric shares closed at $20.25, off 12.5 cents.

Inc. have begun seeking necessary government approvals for
the transaction.
   Honeywell Federal Systems, a 1,600-employee company based
in McLean, Va., provides systems integration, computer
products and technical services to the U.S. government. It
had sales of $274 million in 1989. Honeywell Inc. retained
the federal systems division after placing most of its
computer operations into a joint venture with Groupe Bull of
France in 1987. Last year, Groupe Bull purchased majority
ownership of the joint venture, originally called Honeywell
Bull, and renamed it Bull HN. NEC Corp. of Japan is a
minority investor. Honeywell Federal Systems has been the
exclusive distributor of Bull HN products to the federal
government.

   By agreeing to sell the federal systems division,
Honeywell is shedding the last remains of its computer
manufacturing, sales and service operation, which generated
$1.9 billion in revenue in 1985, or about a quarter of
Honeywell's overall business. It leaves Honeywell, a
Minneapolis-based company with 1989 revenue of $6.1 billion,
as a controls systems company, providing products like
thermostats and industrial-process control systems to homes,
buildings, manufacturers, and the space and aviation
industries.

   Sluggish Tourism Is No Holiday for Resort Businesses

   Weak Season Means Too Much Room
   At the Inn, Entrepreneurs Lament

   CHARLEVOIX, Mich. -- To some entrepreneurs, running a
business in a cherished old resort town like this Lake
Michigan retreat is the ultimate daydream.
   But this summer has been anything but a daydream for Nancy
DeHollander, an owner of a bed-and-breakfast here, who can't
fill her rooms. While weekends have been fully booked,
weekday traffic has been slow. Overall, she says, her
business through July declined 15% from a year earlier.
Unless things improve this month, she says, she will have to
postpone a remodeling project.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sluggish business in the tourist industry is particularly
hurting small businesses in resort towns such as this, where
virtually all the visitors come for pleasure. Unlike large
hotels in cities and big-resort areas, the small innkeepers
here can't hope for big convention and business-travel volume
in November to make up for vacant rooms in August. Much of
the town's prosperity depends on summer, when the population
is said to at least double from its normal 3,300.
   And now, in the wake of the Middle East crisis, increased
anxiety about the economy and rising gasoline prices only add
to the problem.
   Forced to make their big money in a few short months, the
resorts here have suffered from this summer's weather. June
was unusually cool and damp here. July temperatures
fluctuated wildly -- and this month began unpromisingly.
"It's too cold for people to get into bikinis," sighs Donald
Ward, owner of a charter-fishing company, as he surveys a
harbor of idle boats.
   But weather is only the beginning. As signs of economic
slowdown have grown in recent months, especially in the
Midwest and Northeast, wary consumers have trimmed their
vacation spending. That's making for a "soft" summer in
tourism, says James Cammisa, publisher of Travel Industry
Indicators, a Miami-based newsletter.
   Of course, resort prosperity varies from place to place.
But Charlevoix isn't exceptional. Dane Wells, an owner of the
Queen Victoria Inn, a bed-and-breakfast in Cape May, N.J.,
notes that more of his customers are requesting early-morning
check-ins to avoid the cost of staying the prior night. Among
other woes, that creates a morning jam-up for him: He can't
turn over rooms, beach tags and parking permits to new
arrivals when his departing guests haven't checked out.
   In South Beach, Ore., Becky Hogan, owner of a gas station
and convenience store, hears more complaints these days about
rising gas prices. She estimates her average sale has dropped
50 cents to $3 this year. In business since 1987, she says
this is shaping up as her most difficult year. "I'm not
getting rich," she says.
   For small operators in older resorts like century-old
Charlevoix, penny-pinching merely exacerbates a longer-term
challenge: changing vacation habits. With cheaper air fares,
travelers have more vacation choices than in the past, and
they are traveling farther afield. They don't depend on a
nearby resort as their parents often did. What's more, travel
industry studies show people are taking shorter trips --
perhaps a long weekend rather than a two-week jaunt.
   Betsy Ellison, vacationing in Charlevoix for two days,
typifies the new type of traveler. Lounging on the breezy
porch of a bed-and-breakfast, while sipping her morning
coffee, the 43-year-old teacher notes: "These last couple of
years, I've been doing short trips -- four or five days -- to
save for the year when I'll go to England."
   The soft economy is intensifying competition among small
Charlevoix businesses. As in other resorts, retail fads have
led to gluts. Right now, the town's five-block downtown strip
is overrun with tiny T-shirt shops -- and locals predict a
shakeout.
   Mary Walker, an owner of the Beached Whale T-shirt shop,
says she hasn't raised her prices in two years, but her sales
are still flat this year. She claims that too many low-end
retailers are grabbing for the same piece of pie.
   In addition, competition from nearby tourist towns is
heating up. In recent years, numerous hotels have sprouted
along U.S. 31 -- the main thoroughfare connecting Charlevoix
with its rivals. At the 15-room, geranium-decked Archway
Motel, owner Sandy Alward, noting passing vehicles, says many
seem to keep driving right on through this year. She offers
free coffee, Home Box Office on cable television, and a pool.
She cut her prices this year by as much as 13% to a range of
$48 to $80. But she says her occupancy level has fallen to
80% from 90% anyway.
   Not all small businesses are suffering this season. Many
that cater to upscale tourists are posting fat increases in
business. Some travel industry experts say affluent tastes
are driving the market these days. And Charlevoix has long
attracted wealthy industrialists from Detroit and Chicago.
   The Weathervane restaurant, on U.S. 31, is busy catering
private parties. The Irish Boat Shop is selling many
30-to-40-foot vessels, priced from $20,000 to $50,000. And
Mettlers of Charlevoix, a designer sportswear shop, says
sales through mid-July were running 18% ahead of a year
earlier.
   Lou Mettler, the concern's tanned, casually attired owner,
says his well-heeled clientele come from all over the
country. A top General Motors Corp. official, he says
happily, just ordered two suits.

   Scientists Identify
   Gene That Triggers
   Marijuana's `High'

   Fluke Discovery Could Spawn
   New Medicines That Have
   Herb's Therapeutic Effect

   LONDON -- A crucial clue to the mystery of how marijuana
produces its "high" was discovered, opening the door to new
medicines that have marijuana's therapeutic effects.
   Scientists at the U.S. National Institutes of Mental
Health said they found and reproduced a gene that apparently
confers sensitivity to marijuana. The gene is a blueprint for
a natural chemical in the brain that binds with marijuana's
active ingredient -- in essence, a chemical "lock" into which
the marijuana "key" fits to produce some of its effects. The
discovery was reported in today's issue of Nature, a leading
British scientific journal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such a chemical mechanism has long been suspected and
studied by scientists, but the cloning of a gene for it
represents an important medical advance, said Solomon Snyder,
a neural researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
With the gene as a clue, he said, researchers can begin
unraveling the mystery of marijuana's effects. Ultimately, he
said, the research may lead to new medicines.
   "Marijuana research, in principle, could offer terrific
therapeutic drugs," said Mr. Snyder, whose discovery 17 years
ago of a chemical "receptor" for opiates led to new,
artificial pain killers. Marijuana has been known by Western
scientists since at least the 19th century to dull pain,
suppress vomiting and aid sleep. Though rarely allowed in the
U.S., in some European nations marijuana and its derivatives
are sometimes prescribed to treat glaucoma or control nausea
in cancer chemotherapy patients.
   The NIMH scientists, led by Lisa A. Matsuda, stumbled onto
the marijuana discovery while following another avenue of
brain-chemistry research. According to their report, they
were studying rat genes for a known family of chemical
"receptors," a class of molecule that receives the chemical
messengers, or neurotransmitters, involved in communication
among brain cells. One of the genes, which they isolated and
reproduced using standard genetic technology, served no
obvious function.
   By coincidence, they noticed that the gene -- labeled SKR6
-- showed up most often in those parts of the rat brain most
stimulated by marijuana in lab studies. Subsequent tests
confirmed that the gene, in rodents anyway, was the template
for a natural receptor molecule that binds with marijuana's
psychoactive ingredient, called delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.
The scientists have yet to find a similar gene in humans,
however.
   The receptor gene, the scientists said, may be one of many
involved in marijuana's effects. Each gene may control a
different effect of marijuana -- some blocking pain, others
producing euphoria. By identifying those receptors involved
in the drug's therapeutic effects, a medicine could be
tailored to bind only with them -- and not with the
psychoactive receptors. Some drug companies, including New
York-based Pfizer Inc. and Sterling Drug Inc., have already
been hunting such marijuana substitutes.

   Autos:
   VW Offers
   Money-Back
   Guarantee

   TROY, Mich. -- Volkswagen, struggling to boost its U.S.
sales, is offering consumers something they can't get from
any other car maker: their money back if they aren't
satisfied.
   The offer, which starts tomorrow, applies only to the
Volkswagen Passat, a midsized sedan that the German auto
maker introduced earlier this year. Under the program, Passat
buyers have three months or 3,000 miles to decide whether the
car meets their expectations. If they don't like the Passat,
Volkswagen will refund all of their money, virtually no
questions asked.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A few auto makers have experimented with satisfaction
guarantees in the past, but they have required buyers to
apply the refunded money toward the purchase of another
model. General Motors Corp.'s Oldsmobile division, for
example, gives unhappy buyers credit for the full price of
their Olds. But the credit is good only toward the purchase
of a different Olds model.
   To be sure, VW is a small player in the U.S. with only
1.4% of the U.S. car market. Still, competitors will almost
certainly watch the German auto maker's move closely to see
if consumers accept it as an alternative to increasingly
confusing and costly cash rebate discounts.
   Officials with the U.S. arm of Volkswagen AG simply want
the move to jump-start sales of the Passat. "Our goal is to
say to the public, `At least consider us,'" said William J.
Young, Volkswagen of America Inc.'s vice president in charge
of U.S. VW operations.
   Volkswagen officials had high hopes for the Passat when
they brought it out in February. The car is the biggest model
VW has sold in the U.S., and the company predicted it would
steal sales from the highly popular Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus
and Honda Accord sedans. The 1990 Passat, at $14,770 to
$19,200, is priced slightly higher than those models. The
Accord, for instance, ranges from $13,095 to $17,345.
   VW officials projected they would ultimately sell 3,000 of
the cars a month, but sales have fallen far short of that
goal. Through July, Volkswagen has sold just 8,558 Passats --
an average of 1,426 a month. That's a big reason why VW's
U.S. sales -- 83,637 vehicles through July -- look to fall
well short of the internal goal of 200,000 vehicles for the
year.
   "We have to break new ground even if we're too small to
really lead the industry in a different direction," says
Robert La Torre, owner of LaTorre Volkswagen in Reseda,
Calif. "With our sales the way they've been, we need to stand
out with consumers."
   The money-back offer certainly is different. It's "one of
the most aggressive marketing tactics ever seen from an auto
manufacturer," says Christopher Cedergren, an analyst with
J.D. Power &amp; Associates Inc., an Agoura Hills, Calif.,
research and consulting firm. "One of Volkswagen's
fundamental problems is getting people to drive its cars. The
Passat is going up against the Accord and Camry, which have
the image of walking on water."
   VW's failure to keep pace as Japan's largest auto makers
pushed into the family sedan market is a major reason why the
auto maker's U.S. market share has tumbled so far since 1970.
That year, VW's share of the U.S. market peaked at 7% -- more
than all other importers combined.
   VW has tried to be more aggressive since Mr. Young took
over in February 1989. At the start of the 1990 model year,
VW cut prices on its models in hopes of weaning consumers
from rebates.
   But the lower-price, no-rebate strategy produced only a
0.6% increase in sales through July this year. Mr. Young, in
a news conference at VW's headquarters here, reiterated the
company's resolve to stay away from rebate offers. VW prices
will rise from 1.5% to 2.3% this fall.
   If Oldsmobile's experience is any guide, it's not a cinch
that consumers will rush in because of the offer.
   Oldsmobile has offered a guaranteed trade-in allowance on
all its vehicles since the start of the 1990 model year last
fall. Olds says it attracted about 12% more first-time buyers
of its cars because of the offer. But Oldsmobile's total
sales for the model year through July are off 20.3% from last
year's dismal sales.
   One reason more auto makers haven't offered money-back
guarantees is uncertainty over how many vehicles will be
returned, and the complex logistics of re-selling the
returned vehicles.
   But Volkswagen officials said a survey of Passat owners
showing 97% satisfaction emboldened them to try the tactic.
Mr. Young said the plan came together over the past two
weeks. Oldsmobile says fewer than 1% of the cars sold under
its program were returned.
   About the only Passats excluded from the guarantee are
fleet or rental cars, as well as those abused or damaged.
   "We're trying to avoid a hostile point of exchange with
the customers," said William A. Gelgota Jr., director of
marketing for VW in the U.S. "We're not going to tie people
up with a lot of questions."
   Volkswagen plans to let employees drive the returned cars
and sell some of them as used vehicles through dealers. The
offer will run until Oct. 31. But VW officials said they may
extend the guarantee if it works.

   VOLKSWAGEN AG's U.S. sales and marketing arm is offering
buyers of the Volkswagen Passat a full, money-back guarantee
for 30 days or 3,000 miles after the purchase of the car.
Yesterday's editions stated a longer period of time could
elapse under the offer.

   China's nuclear enterprises, which have been losing money
due to declining military orders, are looking for foreign
investment to help increase production of civilian products,
an official report said.
   About 40,000 of China's workers in the nuclear industry
are idle, a result of a sharp decrease in the demand for
military orders in the past few years and a two-year
austerity program that tightened credit to halt runaway
inflation, the China Daily reported. Last year, the industry
posted a profit for the first time in three years, due
largely to its civilian products, the report said.
   In 1989, civilian goods accounted for 42% of the
industry's production -- six times more than in 1980. They
included rare earth metals, man-made diamonds and medical
equipment as well as such non-nuclear items as smoke alarms
and chemical fertilizers, the report said.
   The nuclear industry has set a goal of producing two
billion yuan ($422 million) of civilian goods by 1995 -- a
150% increase over last year, the paper said.
                                                                                                       

   ITALIAN JEWELRY CHAIN SOLD
                                                                                                       

   Kuwayama Kikinzoku Corp., a Japanese jewelry maker, and
Japanese trading company C. Itoh &amp; Co. bought 15% of the
outstanding shares of Valestra 1882 S.p.A. of Italy for $3
million, the Japanese companies said. According to officials,
Kuwayama bought a 10% stake in Valestra, while C. Itoh
acquired 5% of the outstanding shares of Valestra, described
as the top jewelry chain in Europe. Valestra is in Vassano,
Italy, and has sales networks in 30 countries, officials
said.
                                                                                                       

   NO MORE GOOSE STEP

   East German soldiers will no longer march the goose step
because it is out of step with the country's new democratic
ways, East Germany's defense minister announced. The goose
step, widely linked to Germany's militaristic past, no longer
fits the armed forces' image, Defense Minister Rainer
Eppelmann said, according to the ADN news agency. A trademark
of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, the goose step was dropped by

   TAIWAN'S CHINA INVESTMENTS
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan investors poured US$240 million into China's Fujian
Province in this year's first six months, double that of the
year-earlier period, according to an official report. Wang
Hao, a senior provincial official dealing with overseas
investment, was quoted in the China Daily as saying
investment had built up momentum over the course of the year,
with the average expenditure rising to $2 million from
$800,000 in 1988. Increasing amounts have been put into
technology projects and infrastructure works instead of the
traditional labor-intensive factories, he added.

   France and Germany are promoting their respective
languages in Eastern Europe. In France, the cabinet said the
promotion of French in the newly democratic region should be
"a major component of foreign policy." The Hachette
Foundation is sending 100,000 French-language books to
Romanian libraries, while Alliance Francaise plans to open
schools to teach French in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary; it already has schools in
Romania, Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia. In West Germany,
meanwhile, the Goethe Institute plans to open schools to
teach German in Moscow, Prague and Warsaw.

   Trinidad and Tobago acting Prime Minister Winston Dookeran
announced a reconstruction program to repair businesses
damaged during the recent coup attempt.
   Mr. Dookeran also announced a social-assistance program
and said public buildings, including the fire-gutted police
headquarters in Port-of-Spain, would be repaired soon.
   The acting prime minister said that the cabinet at its
next sitting would work out the details of the programs.
   Industry and Enterprise Minister Bhoe Tewari has estimated
that property damage in Port-of-Spain is at least $70
million. The official death toll from the failed coup and
subsequent looting is 24.

   Turkey Wins
   Praise, Leverage
   With Iraq Stand

   ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Few perceptions of strategic value
have changed as quickly as those regarding Turkey.
   The crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has turned a new
light on a country where only recently Turkish commentators
were complaining that with the end of the Cold War, Turkey --
a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- was
slipping off the world's strategic map. Now it is coming into
its own under the leadership of President Turgut Ozal, who
yesterday was termed "a staunch friend of the United States"
by President Bush.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The change in perception isn't just in Washington. Europe
also is applauding Turkey's firm stand on the United Nations
embargo of Iraq. Even formerly patronizing Middle East powers
such as Iran, and Iraq itself, have sent envoys as
petitioners to Ankara, the nation's capital.
   Such treatment contrasts with the European Community's
polite refusal in December to deal with Ankara's application
to join the EC, condemnations of Turkey's human-rights
record, a pro-Armenian bill before the U.S. Congress this
year, and what Turkey had seen as a tilt toward Greece by the
U.S. and Europe.
   It's unlikely that changes in these stances will be the
only price the West has to pay for Turkey's support in the
Kuwait crisis. Sources in Washington, who asked to remain
anonymous, told the Associated Press that Turkey is seeking
compensation of as much as $2 billion in exchange for
shutting down the Iraqi oil pipeline that crosses its
territory. U.S. officials said the question of compensation
probably will come up in talks with Secretary of State James
Baker, who is to meet with Turkish leaders today.
   President Ozal himself estimated that the U.N. sanctions
will cost Turkey $2 billion a year. Iraq was Turkey's second
biggest trading partner last year, with $1.1 billion of trade
and more than $250 million in transit fees for Iraq's
trans-Turkey oil pipelines, now blocked by Ankara.
   But Turkish public opinion is largely behind the U.N.
sanctions. "We have complaints, but we have to respect the
decision of the government," said Osman Gelikoglu, head of
the International Transport Association that represents
Turkey's 300,000-truck transport industry, a third of which
works on Iraqi routes.
   "It was one of those times we had to choose and say which
values we really believed in," said an Istanbul tour
operator. "This is a chance to prove we want to belong to
Europe."
   But Turks fear the subject of military intervention,
especially a possible U.S. request to use American bases in
Turkey against Iraq. Fourteen U.S. F-111 attack bombers are
already on "routine training" at the NATO base at Incirlik,
500 miles from the Iraqi border.
   "We have said that we will implement the U.N. decision.
There should be no further burden" on Turkey, said Mr. Ozal,
who hasn't ruled out use of the bases.
   A senior government official, also anonymous, told the
Associated Press that Turkey is unlikely to join a
multinational force in Saudi Arabia. But the official said he
doesn't expect Turkey to "say yes or no right away" to any
American request for use of the NATO base for any Gulf
intervention.
   Any involvement of Turkey's 800,000 troops is likely to
arouse bipartisan protest unless the troops are part of a
U.N. effort, diplomats say. Opposition parties have called
the Turkish parliament out of recess to discuss the crisis
Sunday.
   "Whatever any other country does, we will do," said
right-wing opposition leader Suleyman Demirel. "But nobody
can say to us, `Come on, you Turkish lions,' and send us to
the Gulf."
   Deniz Baykal, deputy leader of the main Social Democrat
opposition, also warned: "We don't see ourselves as the
gendarme of the region, and nobody else should do so."
   Commentators have been quick to point out that many
Turkish cities are within range of Iraqi chemical weapons.
Some also said any number of U.S. guarantees or offers of
compensation aren't enough to justify violating the
traditional regional neutrality of Turkey.
   "Turkey went into the hell of the Korean War to get
accepted in NATO. Now we are risking the curse of the Gulf in
order to get into Europe and look good to America," wrote
Mumtaz Soysal in Milliyet, a liberal newspaper. "One of our
most common proverbs says, `Do not get mixed up in Arabs'
business.' Saddam's dictatorship doesn't concern the Turkish
people one jot."

   Shearson Dismisses
   Broker for Remarks
   On Money's Allure

   Firm, Amid Image Polishing,
   Declares Clash of Views

   NEW YORK -- It doesn't pay to be blunt on Wall Street
these days, especially if you work for a firm that is trying
to clean up its image.
   Just ask Mal Lowenthal, a stockbroker. He was fired by
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., after making some crusty
remarks about the brokerage business to Dan Dorfman, a USA
Today columnist.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview published in the newspaper last Friday,
the 55-year-old Mr. Lowenthal called the securities business
"dirty." Twice, in response to two separate questions, both
regarding complaints about brokers, he said: "Our product is
money. And money attracts scum."
   Mr. Lowenthal also said in the interview that investors
should avoid a broker who "focuses solely on his firm's
research for ideas. This means he's a dummy who can't think
for himself."
   Though Mr. Lowenthal didn't mention Shearson by name, his
comments didn't sit well at the firm, which today becomes
virtually entirely owned by publicity-minded American Express
Co.
   In a statement, Shearson said: "Mr. Lowenthal's views on
the financial services industry, our firm and the people who
conduct our day-to-day business do not conform with the
firm's philosophy of quality service. Our employees are
dedicated and highly professional people. In light of our
fundamentally different views, we believed it to be in the
best interests of the firm to end the relationship."
   Shearson said later that the dismissal isn't an effort to
gag the firm's employees, who generally have free reign to
talk to news reporters. But the action underscores the
no-nonsense style of Shearson's new chairman, Howard L. Clark
Jr., a former American Express executive. Top Shearson
officials are on a campaign to bolster the firm's image. In
recent months, for example, Shearson has been roiled by a
management shake-up and a record quarterly loss.
   Reached yesterday at his Shearson office, where he was
packing his belongings into cartons, Mr. Lowenthal said he
wanted "to put the thing to bed." He said Shearson told him
he had painted the firm in a bad light. "But that wasn't my
intention," he said.
   Mr. Lowenthal said that Mr. Clark called him early Friday,
furious about the published remarks, and that senior
management told him the firm had gotten numerous phone calls
"looking for my head." Shearson insiders said these calls
came primarily from other Shearson brokers.
   Mr. Lowenthal, an 11-year Shearson veteran, said he
already has interviewed with several other securities firms,
and was hoping to hook up with one by next week. He said he
was heartened by a petition that circulated yesterday among
some Shearson brokers, asking the firm to rescind its
decision to dismiss him.
   The move is the second high-profile firing of a
brokerage-firm employee for speaking bluntly to news
reporters. In March, Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. fired a
securities analyst, Marvin Roffman, for making critical
remarks in The Wall Street Journal about the financial
prospects for the New York real estate developer Donald
Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J.

   Suggest Clients
   Buy Back Stock

   NEW YORK -- Investment bankers are telling client
companies to consider buying back their stock now that share
prices have plummeted in the recent market plunge.
   "We are talking to clients and suggesting they invest in
their own equities," says Peter DaPuzzo, co-head of Lehman
Brothers world-wide equities division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Buy-backs, whose popularity soared after the October 1987
stock market crash, trailed off significantly in recent
months. But now, they may be back.
   So far this week, nearly 30 firms have announced buy-backs
although many of those decisions had been made prior to the
most recent market turbulence. Investment bankers say more
are expected as the market stabilizes.
   Richard Franyo, head of investment banking at Alex. Brown
&amp; Sons Inc., says he alerted the firm's bankers Monday that
they should be looking for corporate stock buy-backs.
   "It's clearly something we should be calling our clients
and talking about," Mr. Franyo says.
   Alex. Brown itself yesterday authorized the buy-back of as
many as 500,000 additional shares in a buy-back program that
now totals about 760,000 shares.
   Jim Timmins, a partner at Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. in the
capital markets department, says that for some time his firm
has been advising mature technology companies to consider
buying back stock. (Most young technology companies consume
any cash on hand through expansion and don't have room to
consider buy-backs or dividends, he notes.) Many of the firms
that had been advised responded by setting prices for their
stocks at which they would consider such action.
   "The recent sell-off brings prices into the target ranges
that people had established previously," Mr. Timmins says.
   He says his firm has gone back to those firms now that
share prices have dropped, suggesting they take another look.
   "Before it was theory, and now it's practice," he says.
   However, Lehman Brothers investment banker Michael Madden
notes corporations may be less enthusiastic about buy-backs
this time around than they were after the October 1987 market
crash or the jolt in October 1989.
   "A number of events have come about in the last few months
or days that have influenced their thinking so they may not
be as aggressive as in the prior two periods," Mr. Madden
says.
   Among the most significant of those events are the sudden
spike in the price of oil and the looming possibility of a
recession soon. Those considerations are likely to make
companies think twice about spending cash now that could
provide a financial cushion later on.

   NEW YORK -- Crashing oil prices and defensive moves by the
U.S. and other nations against Iraq sent investors running
back to stocks. The threat of war kept the dollar firm
against most currencies.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.26 points to
2734.90.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The markets rocked again in volatile trading as statements
from President Bush, Iraq, and U.S. military leaders burst
across news wires throughout the day.
   Crude oil futures for September delivery fell $2.35 a
barrel to $25.96 in wild trading. In the stock market, shares
of oil producers plunged as well, but the broad market staged
its first significant gain in six days as investors gained
confidence that higher oil prices would not prevail.
   "The main motor of the stock market -- oil -- was going
the right way," said Edward Laux, head of block trading at
Kidder Peabody. "And investors are going after the stocks
they love to love."
   The year's favorite growth stocks advanced sharply: Home
Depot gained 1 3/8 to 34 3/4; Wal-Mart Stores rose 1 5/8 to
30 1/4, and Motorola jumped 3 1/4 to 76. Investors also
pursued a host of recession resistant companies, such as drug
and consumer concerns.
   "It was a special type of stock that gained -- stocks not
too related to the general economy and that have predictable
earnings," said John McElroy, principal at 1838 Investment
Advisors.
   Many stock investors remain fearless about the economic
outlook. A recession will bring interest rates down and boost
stocks, they argue; the rise in oil prices is strictly
temporary, the investors believe.
   "I can't think of a reason not to buy stocks," said Roger
Engemann, head of a Pasadena, Calif., investment firm that
bears his name. "I welcome a recession as an investment
manager -- it will bring interest rates down." He said such
growth issues as Philip Morris and Eli Lilly are cheap and
investors should buy.
   Meanwhile, bearish strategists can think of every reason
to sell stocks. Richard Hoey, chief U.S. economist at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, says the stock market's 25-point
rebound is hardly impressive given the $2 plunge in oil.
   "There are three Bs for the bears: Baghdad, budget and
banking system," said Mr. Hoey. He believes escalating oil
prices will raise mortgage rates, which will be a sharp blow
to consumer confidence. Without consumer spending, economic
growth will slow, giving U.S. budget negotiators a thorny
dilemma: too many spending cuts will push the economy into a
deeper recession; too few will cause long-term bond rates to
shoot higher as the government finances a widening deficit.
   Mr. Hoey also predicted that as the economy softens,
creditors will cut back further on loans and other sources of
funding that many businesses need. He is advising investors
to sell stocks and raise cash.
   The dollar firmed against most major currencies except the
yen. Bassem Snaije, first vice president at Banca della
Svizzera Italiana, said military tension in the Middle East
kept the dollar strong against the West German mark, but
falling oil prices underpinned the yen. Still, he added,
given weak economic growth in the U.S., the dollar's strength
is tenuous.
   "The dollar is a sale one way or another," said Mr.
Snaije. "All we need to know is who is going to win" in the
Middle East.
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks finished higher. Advancing issues on the New York
Stock Exchange led decliners 1,015 to 601. Big Board volume
totaled 190,400,000.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar gained against most currencies. In late New
York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5925 marks and
149.80 yen compared with 1.5875 marks and 150.95 yen late
Tuesday.

   BRUSSELS -- Arbed S.A. of Luxembourg and Cockerill Sambre
S.A. of Belgium said they are discussing a 50-50 joint
venture to combine their production and sales of flatsteel
products.
   The share prices of both companies surged about 10% after
the talks were disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are seeking a European dimension comparable to that of
British Steel, Usinor-Sacilor and Thyssen," a spokesman for
Cockerill Sambre said. The two companies said bigger scale is
necessary to "assure the future of these activities in terms
of applied research, new technologies and investments."
   The joint venture would have annual sales of around 130
billion Belgian francs ($3.96 billion), about half from each
company. Both companies derive around a third of their sales
from flat-steel products. The two said they would retain
their separate identities and pursue their other activities
independently.
   Within three months, the two companies aim to reach a
preliminary conclusion on whether to pursue the proposed
joint venure.
   Cockerill Sambre is about 85%-owned by Belgium's Walloon
regional government. The Luxembourg government owns about 31%
of the voting rights in Arbed, and Societe Generale de
Belgique S.A. owns 25.5%.

   Rumor in Grain-Trading Pits
   Says Buyer Got Spooked

   CHICAGO -- Did North Korea try to buy U.S. corn?
   That's the summer's most intriguing tidbit in the
grain-trading pits here, where brokers use a simple strategy:
buy on rumor, sell on fact.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many rumors never pan out. But this time the details,
sketchy as they are, are enough to have grain exporters
worrying privately that one of them might have unknowingly
broken the law by helping the hard-line Communist government.
   "It is strictly taboo," said an official of one major
grain firm. U.S. firms are banned from doing business with
North Korea by the Trading With the Enemy Act. In recent
years, transgressions have been on the mundane side,
involving travel agents and tour operators arranging trips to
three other countries on the enemies list: Vietnam, Cambodia
and Cuba.
   Grain, however, is a political powder keg.
   Washington got upset in the 1970s when U.S. grain
merchants quietly sold large amounts of crops to the Soviet
Union. Amid soaring food prices in the U.S., Congress
required grain exporters to disclose their sales to the
government.
   "This one might have fallen through the cracks," said an
export expert at the Agriculture Department, which tracks
overseas grain sales.
   A spokesman at the Treasury Department, which enforces the
trading ban, said it is aware of the North Korean report but
hasn't any evidence of a misdeed. The department can grant a
license to ship goods but usually it does so only for
humanitarian purposes.
   Policing the grain trade is difficult. The origin of a
shipment such as corn can easily be lost as it changes hands.
And attractive deals can pop up in the most unlikely places.
For example, several U.S. grain merchants have received
overtures to buy rice from Vietnam, which has had an usually
large harvest.
   Here's the North Korea rumor: Because that country can't
openly buy corn from the U.S., a Singapore dealer is thought
to have acted as the middleman to arrange shipment. While the
corn was en route, however, word about it started to pop up
in the West. The North Korean government, perhaps anxious
about how it might look for it to need corn from the U.S.,
got spooked and scrapped the deal, the story goes.
   Traders believe that North Korea eventually got the corn
it needed from China.

   THE SAVINGS RATE may shrink further as oil crisis forces
spending changes.
   "Disruption means less income, and less income means less
saving," says Franco Modigliani, the Nobel-laureate economist
at MIT. Savings are crucial to help finance a "dis-saving"
government, and to provide business capital. An oil-price
rise of 6% or 7% won't have much effect, Mr. Modigliani says,
noting: "I would begin to worry at 30%." Harvard economist
Lawrence Summers says even the price hikes so far mean
"you're likely to see some reduction in the savings rate over
the next several quarters." But he adds that "in the long run
it's not likely to have a big effect." Personal savings have
been meager for a while.

   WEFA Group's Larry Kimbell recalls that in the two earlier
oil shocks, about 50% of marginal gains in disposable income
went for energy needs. MIT's Mr. Modigliani says saving is
off world-wide, due to big government deficits and slowing
global economies. He notes some demographics also hurt: Women
swell the work force but add less to savings than to overall
income because of expenses for child care, home help and
prepared food. The oil crisis tops off a tankful of economic
woes, but Jesup Josephthal's David Bostian sees a possible
benefit: "motivation to save more, if the cash drain isn't
overwhelming."
   The 1989 savings rate recently was revised downward by
nearly one percentage point to 4.6%.
                                                                                                       

   SICK OF THE '60s? Too bad. Retailers hope retro rags will
dress up fall profits.
   After heavy discounting in women's apparel last year,
stores aim for firmer margins with reborn miniskirts,
stretch-pants, bodysuits (a.k.a. catsuits), psychedelic
leggings, "tent" dresses and little A-line Jackie ensembles.
In the first half, women's and children's clothing sales
inched up 0.7% to $96.8 billion in real dollars, pressuring
profits, says Edward Johnson, of Johnson Redbook Service. He
adds, "Fashion doesn't make as much difference as the price."
   Kal Ruttenstein, head of fashion direction at
Bloomingdale's, stresses updates, like the new Puccis. Groovy
in the '60s, the Sequel Decade's version has subtle changes
-- a modern shoulder, different darts. Joan Kaner, New York
fashion director at Neiman-Marcus, says of the '60s: "The
clothes were very futuristic. I think we gave it up all too
quickly." Will "go-go" go over again with over-40 women who
now have kids, careers and cellulite? "They might be in
better shape now than in their 20s," says Ms. Kaner. If not,
she notes there are options such as the short but full,
leg-flattering tent dress. She adds: "What's under the tent
is your secret."
                                                                                                       

   ROAD WORRIERS flood auto clubs with gas complaints. But
few cancel vacations.
   The American Automobile Association says members irate
over prices keep phone lines busy. But it says part of the
reason summer trips aren't being canceled is that gas still
accounts for only a small portion of expenses. It figures a
family of four spends about $172 a day for lodging and about
$30 on gas -- up from $20 before the recent increases.
Another reason: Summer is two-thirds over and so are most
vacations.
   Last summer, motorists drove their vehicles on 264 million
trips of 100 miles or more. Meanwhile, membership in major
auto clubs rises. Shell Motor Club says its ranks swell 15% a
year. Requests for help also rise. Amoco Motor Club says
calls for road service rose 3.5% last year while 5.5% more
motorists sought help mapping trips.
   Timely samaritans: 350 California Unocal stations offer
free freeway aid. Vans cruise with cellular phones, gas.
                                                                                                       

   PARTNER WANTED: Nearly 20% of 250 midsize firms polled for
Grant Thornton say their growth strategy calls for a joint
venture. Some 81% say they'd seek a foreign partner; 72%
specify Japanese.
                                                                                                       

   CHARGE IT TO EGOTISM: Citibank tests a credit card with
the owner's photo. The bank hopes the card will thwart theft
and appeal to consumer vanity.
                                                                                                       

   ADOPT-A-BEACH, a cleanup program of the Texas General Land
Office, seeks a hand from plastics firms. Exxon Chemical pays
to convert 5,000 pounds of Texas trash into 12 plastic,
barnacle-proof benches.
                                                                                                       

   HEALTHY BANKS HARRUMPH at being tarred with the troubled
S&amp;L brush.
   An advance promo for a recent ABC-TV "Nightline" episode
about failing banks and thrifts pictured Key Bank of Western
New York in Buffalo. That evening, host Ted Koppel apologized
for "scaring the daylights out of depositors." The gaffe
footage related to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s
earlier closing of Permanent Bank for Savings and its
subsequent purchase by KeyCorp. Healthy KeyCorp units were
deluged with calls and some withdrawals.
   During the program, Stanford economist Dan Brumbaugh got
things roiling again by calling most of the nation's 10
largest banks "near true insolvency." Several incensed big
banks said that a few customers, citing the remarks, withdrew
all their funds the next morning. McKinsey &amp; Co.'s Lowell
Bryan calls the economist's comments "unhelpful" and
"inaccurate." Oh, yeah? Mr. Brumbaugh replies the comments
are "helpful" and "accurate."
   Overall, banks benefit from S&amp;L woes. In 1989, small
deposits rose 17% at banks despite moderating rates.

   Sears Chief Takes Over Merchandising
   As Firm's Retailing Approach Falters
   ----

<LP>
   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. Chairman Edward A. Brennan
reassumed the reins at the company's giant merchandising
operation in what amounts to an admission that the company's
retailing approach isn't working.
   The 56-year-old Mr. Brennan ousted his merchandising
chief, Michael Bozic. The move reflects the company's growing
frustration over its failure to turn around its $31
billion-a-year retailing business. Mr. Brennan, who ran the
Sears retail business in the early 1980s, insisted in a
statement that he still has "confidence" in the strategy of
adding national brands to its stable of house labels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But he said, "We need to move faster and step up its
implementation." He added: "We will focus our efforts on
reducing costs and improving profitability" while
"aggressively" revamping stores to emphasize national brands
in key product categories.
   The 49-year-old Mr. Bozic, chairman and chief executive
officer of the Sears merchandise group since 1986, was given
the new title of president and chief operating officer of the
group. But the executive was stripped of responsibility for
Sears's core retail business -- its 850 U.S. stores -- and
lost his seat on the corporate board of directors.
   The change in command comes just days after the disclosure
that Sears and its crosstown rival, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.,
had discussed a merger. Montgomery Ward is run by Mr.
Brennan's younger brother Bernard, who has cut costs sharply
and revived profits at that company. He is understood to have
proposed that he lead Sears along a similar path. A Sears
spokesman denied that there was any connection between the
talks and the management shakeup. But the talks, though
terminated, certainly pointed out weaknesses to Sears
executives.
   Sears is also in a prolonged earnings slump, including an
especially disappointing first half. Net income fell 47%,
partly because expenses grew more rapidly than retail sales.
And Sears's stock price, which has hovered below book value,
lately has been setting new 52-week lows. Yesterday, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock
closed at $29.625, down 37.5 cents.
   Mr. Brennan, who led the merchandise group to its peak
earnings year in 1984, will continue to oversee the company's
Allstate insurance, Dean Witter brokerage and Coldwell Banker
real estate operations as corporate chairman and chief
executive.
   But Mr. Brennan, who has been criticized by investors for
focusing on the company's financial service operations and
giving short shrift to retailing, clearly intends to get more
involved in the core business. One sign is that he plans to
move key merchandising executives to corporate offices on the
68th floor of the Sears Tower so he can work more closely
with them. They include Laurence E. Cudmore, the 54-year-old
former Canadian retail chief who joined the Sears merchandise
group staff as president of stores last year in a surprise
move. Under the new management structure, he reports directly
to Mr. Brennan, bypassing Mr. Bozic.
   Messrs. Brennan, Bozic and Cudmore were unavailable for
comment. But Mr. Cudmore said in an interview earlier this
year that he believed he was tapped for a top job because, as
a newcomer to corporate headquarters, he could be "objective"
and wouldn't base decisions on "a personal agenda." He said
he viewed "improving our financial performance" as his
biggest challenge.
   In a memo to Sears employees yesterday, Mr. Brennan hinted
that more changes are in the works. He said his decision
followed "an intensive study of all aspects of our
operations." One outside director was more blunt. Asked if
Sears will cut more costs, he said: "I would certainly hope
so."
   Analysts said Mr. Brennan might make further cuts in
Sears's huge headquarters staff, close outdated stores or
even trim the company's advertising budget to produce
short-term earnings.
   But some people in the industry questioned how much Mr.
Brennan, a third-generation Searsman who can rhapsodize for
10 minutes about the merits of a house-brand Kenmore washer,
is willing to change. They pointed out that he approved Mr.
Bozic's decisions. "Ed is so steeped in history and
tradition," said one person familiar with the situation. "He
bleeds Sears blood."
   Nevertheless, at Sears, Mr. Brennan is viewed as a more
charismatic leader than Mr. Bozic, whose strength is plotting
strategy.

   BASKING RIDGE, N.J. -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
named Richard S. Bodman senior vice president, strategic
planning and corporate development, effective Aug. 23. Mr.
Bodman, 52 years old, succeeds John Segal, who left last year
to become vice chairman of Contel Corp., the Atlanta-based
telecommunications service company.
   Mr. Bodman is currently president of Washington National
Investment Corp., a Washington, D.C.-based investment firm
that acquires large minority positions in companies with
sales ranging from $50 million to $500 million. His
background reinforces AT&amp;T's recent strategy of making
acquisitions and joint ventures with smaller companies as it
tries to enter new markets. In July, AT&amp;T announced it would
acquire parts of Western Union Corp.'s business services
group, including the EasyLink electronic mail service and
Telex wire service. Last year, it acquired Istel Ltd., a
London-based information services company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, Mr. Bodman will be a member of AT&amp;T's
executive committee; the company rarely admits those
recruited from outside to join that committee. An AT&amp;T
spokesman said Chairman Robert E. Allen was "looking for new
perspectives."

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The National Park Service, in a
concession to longstanding environmental concerns, said it
would move the operations of 20 agency buildings from
Yosemite National Park to El Portal, a town outside the
park's southwest border.
   Although the agency didn't indicate when the move would
occur, the decision was praised by the Wilderness Society as
an important step in relieving the national park of
increasing congestion and pollution. A year ago, the park
service said the move, which was conceived in a 1980 general
management plan, may be unrealistic.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Park officials said plans call for razing most of the
smaller buildings inside the park and incorporating them into
a central maintenance facility in El Portal. Officials had
previously made plans to move housing for agency employees
outside the park.
   Wilderness Society officials said the move was "an
important step in the right direction," but noted that
several facilities, including the park's main administrative
offices, would still remain in the park.

   SANTA FE PACIFIC Corp. (Chicago) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it may upgrade its ratings on debt of this
railroad, natural resources and real estate concern, if Santa
Fe's financial flexibility improves. Ratings under review
include the company's senior subordinated payment-in-kind, or
PIK, debentures, rated single-B-2. The rating concern also is
reviewing several issues of Santa Fe's subsidiary, the
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway: equipment trust
certificates, rated single-A-3; mortgage bonds, Baa-3; and
adjustment mortgage bonds, Ba-1. Moody's said it views
favorably Santa Fe's refinancing of its PIK debentures, its
proposed spinoff of its real estate and energy units, and its
plan to speed up the restructuring of its railroad
operations. The refinancing, which includes an offer to
exchange equity for $200 million of the debentures, could
improve the company's leverage and debt coverage if
bondholders tender enough of their holdings, Moody's said,
and the railroad restructuring could enhance the company's
cash flow.

   WASHINGTON -- The Interstate Commerce Commission gave
truckers permission to pass on fuel-cost increases to
shippers more quickly.
   The commission, citing the "sudden and often severe
escalation" in fuel costs because of the Persian Gulf
conflict, gave truckers permission temporarily to raise their
rates with only a three-day notice instead of the usual
seven-day notice.

   "It is obvious," the ICC said, "that motor carriers must
be afforded an improved opportunity to adjust rates, fares
and charges to offset unanticipated fuel expenditures."
   The action was in response to a request by the American
Trucking Associations and other trucking groups, which had
asked the ICC to let truckers raise rates with only a one-day
notice. Kenneth Simonson, an American Trucking Association
economist, said that the group was "happy" with the ICC
action.
   The three-day notice requirement will be in effect until
Sept. 23, the ICC said. The commission took similar action
last January in the face of rapid fuel-cost increases. For a
45-day period, it allowed truckers to raise rates after only
a three-day notice.

   Hollywood Hustlers

   Hollywood has inspired all sorts of fiction, from
potboilers to apocalyptic satires. Now Elmore Leonard has
written a Hollywood novel that can take its place with the
best of them. "Get Shorty" (Delacorte, 292 pages, $18.95) is
at least the funniest crime thriller ever set among the
hustlers and con artists of the movie colony.
   In Mr. Leonard's Hollywood, everyone used to be someone
else. Chauffeurs turn into film investors. Movie stars were
once struggling bit players. Copywriters and former ingenues
have become studio executives.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chili Palmer, the offbeat protagonist in this fast-paced
and cleverly plotted tale, comes to Hollywood with a more
interesting "back story" than most. "Connected" to a mob
family but never a full member or "made guy," the
Brooklyn-born Palmer for years co-ran a quick-loan business
in Miami. His specialty was collecting from slow pays by
staring at them in a certain menacing way and saying simply,
"Look at me."
   As one Hollywood player tells Palmer, "With your
experience, you could always become an agent."
   At first, all Palmer wants is to become even in the books
of the wise guys who took over his former business. He goes
to California to find a very slow pay who skipped Miami with
a great deal of money. Once on the Coast, Palmer agrees to
look up another overdue LA account for a Vegas casino.
   This deadbeat is Harry Zimm, head of ZigZag Productions,
producer of 49 feature motion pictures, including the "Slime
Creatures" series, "Grotesque" and "Grotesque, Part Two." To
Palmer he looks "like a guy who drove a delivery truck or
came to fix your air-conditioning when it quit, a guy with a
tool kit." But Zimm sees himself as a still-viable Hollywood
entity, with a script under option that could make him "an
overnight success after thirty years in the business." All he
needs to get the deal started, he says, is half a million
dollars.
   Palmer, a major moviegoer, can't resist telling Zimm his
own idea for a film, a story drawn from his loan-sharking
experiences. Zimm, in turn, lets Palmer read his precious
property, and the two men become partners of a sort. Chili
Palmer sets about acclimating himself to his new
surroundings: learning what wheels to rent, what lingo to
spout. "If they say it's `for a specialized audience' or it's
`a cast-driven script,'" he reminds himself, "that's a pass .
. . there were a lot of terms you had to learn, as opposed to
the shylock business where all you had to know how to say was
`Give me the . . . money.'"
   Mr. Leonard is no stranger to such encounters. Many of his
books have been bought for films, and he himself has written
several screenplays. (References to various Leonard projects
and associates are hidden throughout "Get Shorty.") The many
industry types who are paraded past for the reader's
enjoyment all look and sound and act like the awful truth.
Especially biting is the portrait of the talented but
pretentious megastar who thwarts more movies than he makes.
   Illusion and reality keep blurring for the characters in
"Get Shorty." Real life is different from the movies, the
hard guys keep telling the screen guys. But everyone has
trouble remembering this. The movie people persist in framing
life through a lens, and the "civilians" can't help inserting
movie scenes into their reality. The author brings these
perceptual problems to a head in some cinematic-style moments
of truth that are at once very amusing and highly effective.
   There is the expected amount of violence in this Elmore
Leonard thriller: several beatings, two abrupt deaths. But
for many LA readers, the most shocking event in the book will
be when a frustrated screenwriter insults a major star during
a studio meeting.
   ---
   Some fun is had with an earlier Hollywood era in "As Crime
Goes By" (Bantam, 325 pages, $3.95), a paperback original and
the first in a projected series of period mysteries by Diane
Shah. The year is 1947, and the amateur sleuth is Paris
Chandler, a young female "legman" for a newspaper gossip
columnist.
   Paris is the daughter of a Warners screenwriter and a
former B-movie actress, and also the widow of one of the LA
Times's Chandlers. For the time being (while her late
husband's estate is being contested), she lives in a mansion,
is chauffeured in a 1939 Bentley and works at her former
in-laws' rival paper, the Hearst-owned Examiner.
   When a beautiful starlet who tried to plant a false gossip
item with Paris is murdered, Chandler is drawn into a search
for the killer. She uncovers a whole covey of actresses kept
by a married director, a weekly high-stakes poker game in
which Hollywood honchos are perhaps being fleeced, and a
possible connection between the dead starlet and another
recent murder victim dubbed "The Black Dahlia."
   Paris and her cronies are likable enough, and the mystery
and its resolution are capably handled by Ms. Shah (a former
sports journalist and magazine editor). What's especially
nice though is the evocation of late '40s LA. Except for an
occasional seeming anachronism of slang, the period is
convincingly rendered with a flair that goes beyond research.
It's surprisingly pleasant to be taken back to a time when
people listened to music at 78 rpm, a time when the movies'
main competition was . . . the radio.

   Rise in Pretax Net
   Of 6.5% for Period

   LONDON -- SmithKline Beecham PLC, an Anglo-American health
and household products company, said it had a 6.5% rise in
second-quarter pretax profit, as the period's performance was
highlighted by continued sales growth, strong trading profits
and significant debt reduction.
   The two companies that merged in July 1989 to form the
present concern were previously known as Beecham PLC of the
U.K. and SmithKline Beckman Corp. of the U.S. The results are
the second set reported on a quarterly basis since the
merger.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a news conference yesterday, Chief Executive Robert P.
Bauman said he was "delighted" with the company's
performance. He attributed the strong trading profit partly
to rising profit margins. "That is the result of the merger,
and the increased efficiencies we're getting," he said.
   Unlike other executives in Britain who have reported
earnings recently, Mr. Bauman was fairly upbeat about his
company's prospects. "We do plan to see continued earnings
improvement," he said.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, SmithKline equity units (made up of five ordinary
shares plus one preferred share) closed at $46.875, up $3.50.
   Year-earlier figures represent like-for-like comparisons,
as if the merger had been in place in the second quarter of
1989. A year-earlier dividend payment wasn't included in the
results.
   Pretax profit rose to #197 million ($369.2 million) from
#185 million in the second quarter of 1989. These figures
were at the top end of market expectations, which ranged
between #175 million and #200 million.
   Sales climbed 2.5% to #1.21 billion from #1.18 billion.
Per-share earnings rose to 9.3 pence, up 2.2% from 9.1 pence
in the corresponding year-earlier period.
   Health and household products analyst Barbara Arzymanow of
Kleinwort Benson Securities in London said the market
welcomed SmithKline's earnings, which she said were better
than widely expected.
   Several SmithKline Beecham drugs posted strong sales
gains. Sales of Augmentin, an antibiotic, rose 32% in the
second quarter and 36% in the first half; sales of Engerix-B,
the company's hepatitis-B vaccine, grew 75% in the second
quarter and 95% in the first half. Sales of Tagamet, the
SmithKline Beecham anti-ulcer drug subject to increasing
competition, rose 6% in the second quarter but slipped 1% in
the first half.
   Roughly 45% of SmithKline Beecham's sales are in the U.S.,
while Britain and continental Europe account for about 40%.
Sales in Japan account for much of the remaining 15%.

   Tracking of Assets
   Of Kuwait in U.S.
   Proving Difficult

   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury is having trouble tracking down
the tens of billions of dollars of investments that Kuwait
holds in the U.S., but expects to issue regulations for these
frozen assets soon, according to an administration official.
   The regulations will lay down codes of conduct for the
treatment of these assets, which along with Iraqi investments
in the U.S. were frozen by President Bush following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait is estimated to hold about $50 billion of assets in
the U.S., according to David Mizrahi, editor and publisher of
MidEast Report, a New York-based newsletter that tracks Arab
investments in the U.S. These are mainly held in real estate,
stocks and bonds, he says, adding that Kuwait's investment in
oil refiner Santa Fe International probably ranks among the
largest Kuwaiti holdings in the U.S.
   The Treasury -- for the time being, at least -- declines
to quantify Kuwait's investments in the U.S. In a recent
briefing, Richard Newcomb, the department's director of
foreign assets control, would only say they are
"significant."
   Iraq, in contrast to Kuwait, has relatively small
investments in the U.S., probably a few hundred million
dollars or less.
   One of the reasons that Kuwaiti investments may be hard
for the Treasury to track is because the country and its
citizens, in common with many rich Arabs, have generally
preferred discreet and low-profile investments in the U.S.,
bankers familiar with Kuwait's investment strategy say.
Kuwait has generally avoided shareholdings of more than 5% in
publicly quoted companies in order to avoid the requirement
to disclose holdings.
   Kuwait's desire to build up an international oil
exploration and refining business seems to be the exception
to that general rule. A Commerce Department report on foreign
direct investment in the U.S. for 1988 lists only one Kuwaiti
investment in the U.S. for that year: the $28.6 million
acquisition of Exploration Co. of Louisiana Inc. by the
Kuwaiti government.
   In the mid-1970s then-Treasury Secretary William Simon
agreed that rich Middle East nations wouldn't be subject to
public country-by-country breakdowns of their investments in
the U.S., according to Mr. Mizrahi. But Mr. Mizrahi contends
that such breakdowns have been kept confidentially by the
Treasury.
   Meanwhile, the administration recently set out its policy
to Kuwaiti banks in a letter dated Aug. 5 from the Treasury's
Mr. Newcomb to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   Mr. Newcomb's letter sets out four categories of Kuwaiti
banks. The first comprises banks that are considered "blocked
entities" that can't make transactions with persons under
U.S. jurisdiction. They include Bank of Kuwait and the Middle
East, Burgan Bank, Central Bank of Kuwait, Credit de Bergues,
Kuwait Finance House and Savings and Credit Bank. Also
blocked are banks over which Kuwait is deemed to have "de
facto control" -- Al-Ahli Bank, Commercial Bank of Kuwait,
Industrial Bank of Kuwait and Gulf Bank.
   There are also five banks with some Kuwaiti government
ownership; these institutions' transactions will be
authorized pending a final determination by Aug. 18. Another
category is made up of 11 banks that Mr. Newcomb's letter
says "shouldn't be considered" blocked entities but on which
the department is seeking more information by Aug. 18.

   Office-Seekers Revive 1970s Campaign Strategy
   Of Bashing Oil Companies Over Spike in Prices

   WASHINGTON -- Early this week Celinda Lake, a Democratic
political consultant, got on the telephone with a half-dozen
of her clients seeking office across the country and gave
them some simple advice: If your opponents have taken money
from the oil companies, call a news conference right now and
denounce them.
   Oil-company bashing, one of the staples of politics of the
mid-1970s, is back in style.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even the staunchly pro-industry Bush administration
provided some jabs for the oil companies. The president
yesterday urged the oil companies "to do their fair share"
and "show restraint." Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
warned: "Those who are doing the gouging will hear from the
president."
   Though the crisis in the Persian Gulf isn't a week old,
the dramatic increases in gasoline prices already have
emerged as a potent political issue. Josie Heath, a
Democratic senatorial contender in Colorado, has placed her
attacks on major oil companies at the center of her campaign.
Democratic Rep. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, where driving
distances make gasoline prices a critical economic factor, is
visiting the small towns of his state and complaining that
"there's some evidence of price-gouging and profiteering
going on by the major oil companies."
   Many of the lawmakers competing for House and Senate seats
this fall cut their political teeth on the ankles of oil
company executives in the 1970s, and this tactic fits
comfortably into their campaign repertoire. It also affords
Democratic candidates an opportunity to make political points
at a time when the public is rallying around a Republican
president.
   "It's a made-to-order issue for politicians whose
stock-in-trade is economic populism," says James Reichley, a
political scientist at the Brookings Institution. "But it's
also a way for conservatives to show that they're not
controlled by economic interests."
   Indeed, some Republicans are preparing arguments much like
those of their Democratic colleagues. "We sometimes need a
big corporate-culture person to attack so we can show we're
not one of them," says Linda DiVall, a Republican political
consultant. "The oil companies seem to qualify."
   That calculation -- along with an effort to keep prices
down with the time-honored Washington tool of jawboning --
was behind the president's remarks yesterday. Mr. Bush said
he hoped the "rapid spike in oil prices will not be
permanent" and that "things will return much more to normal
in the market."
   Other administration officials are picking up the
offensive. "The administration sees the need now for some
low-level populism," says Kevin Phillips, a Republican
political theorist who has called for the GOP to take a more
populist approach. "Yes, the president's remarks are implicit
jawboning of the companies, but the president is also
signaling to the companies that if they do gouge, politics is
going to push him toward taking some action against them," he
said.
   Some Republicans, such as Rep. William Dannemeyer of
California, have taken a different tack, arguing that the
crisis underscores the nation's vulnerability to Middle East
instability and that the U.S. must be more aggressive about
pursuing other sources of energy -- including oil buried off
the California shore and in the Arctic, as well as nuclear
energy.
   The rhetoric already has reached white-hot temperatures.
Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut charges that
"the oil industry of this country is plundering us just as
Saddam Hussein is plundering Kuwait." Democratic Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts says that the early price increases
raise "questions about even patriotism and the better
interests of the economy of this country." And Democratic
Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada says that "apparently the laws
of economics only work one way, against the interest of the
consumer."
   Meanwhile, Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) is trying to
drum up support for a broad federal antitrust investigation
of the oil companies. "It doesn't seem that what goes up must
come down," he says. Mr. Schumer adds that the companies may
not be colluding, but suggests that the situation consists of
"large companies winking at each other" on pricing. He says
he wants the government to go further than the Justice
Department's current plan of tracking down individual
allegations of price collusion and to undertake a "complete
antitrust investigation." And Democratic Rep. Bruce Morrison,
a Connecticut gubernatorial candidate, vowed to introduce a
bill in Congress to restore the windfall-profits tax.
   Oil company excutives, who were summoned to a series of
hearings on Capitol Hill earlier this week, gave a number of
explanations for the price spike: that oil is paid for at the
time of delivery, regardless of price at the time of the
contract; that oil companies have in fact showed restraint
because they have yet to pass on to consumers the full costs
of rising crude-oil prices; and that they are as much victims
of the market as manipulators, since they purchase gasoline
on the fluctuating spot market as well.
   But some oil companies moved to respond to President
Bush's request, at least temporarily. Atlantic Richfield Co.
yesterday said it would freeze wholesale fuel prices for one
week, although the company said in a statement it will have
to reassess its position if the market doesn't stabilize in a
week's time.
   Some political consultants are cautioning their clients of
the dangers of attacks on the oil companies. "There's
extraordinarily strong hostility toward the prices
immediately going up," says Paul Maslin, a Democratic
pollster. "But candidates have to be very cautious. People
are also worrying about the safety of U.S. soldiers."
   Even so, anger has moved swiftly from the pump to the
politicians. For the past several days, gas station operators
have been complaining to the Service Station Dealers of
America, their Washington trade group, of concern, even
abuse, from customers. "People are really mad at the major
oil companies, and we want to keep them mad at them," says
Joseph Coach, executive director of the group. "We're telling
people to call their congressmen. Congress is ready to go on
the attack."
   Even before the Persian Gulf crisis and the ensuing run-up
in gasoline prices, oil companies weren't very popular with
U.S. consumers. In The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of
Buying" poll last year, for instance, only 6% of those
surveyed said they had a great deal of trust and confidence
in the oil industry -- while 22% named it as one of the
industries they had the least amount of confidence in.
   The oil companies, already battered by the Exxon Valdez
oil spill, seem peculiarly vulnerable to populist political
attacks, much like the railroads of the late 19th century.
"They have become the Darth Vader of corporations," says Ms.
Lake, the Democratic political consultant. "It's open season
on them for politicians."
   The companies already are on the defensive, with some of
them being told by their high-priced lobbyists and publicists
that they miscalculated in permitting pump prices to escalate
so swiftly and so dramatically.
   "The money they are going to spend digging themselves out
of the hole will far exceed however much they made in the
first 48 hours," says one lobbyist for a major oil company.
"It's clear: You don't pass on a price increase during a
major crisis."

   Money-Fund Assets
   Surge $6.8 Million
   On Mideast Crisis

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Assets of money-market mutual funds soared
$6.8 billion in the latest week, as many investors sought
refuge from the fallout of the Middle East crisis.
   Assets of 431 taxable funds surged $5.6 billion to a
record $391 billion at the close of business Tuesday,
according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Investors also
poured $1.2 billion into tax-exempt money funds, which
reached a record $79.9 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some mutual-fund companies said that much of the
money-fund inflow was from investors switching out of stock
and bond funds. "A lot of people are taking a wait-and-see
attitude, and money funds are a good parking place," said a
spokesman for Boston-based Fidelity Investments.
   A spokesman for Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa., said
40% of the "substantial inflows" into its eight money funds
came from exchanges, while the rest was from new sales.
   The $5.6 billion jump in the assets of taxable money funds
was greater than the increase in the week following the 1987
stock market crash, when investors poured in $5.4 billion.
But while inflow following the crash was equivalent to a 2.3%
rise in money-fund assets, the latest inflow represented a
smaller 1.4% increase, said Donoghue's editor, Martha
Wittbrodt.
   The largest weekly increase in money-fund assets was in
the week ended Jan. 9, when they ballooned by $10 billion.
Fund assets rose $6.7 billion in the week ended July 11,
1989. In both cases, however, the increases were largely
caused by technical factors, Ms. Wittbrodt said.
   The inflow in the latest week came despite a further
decline in money-fund yields, the Holliston, Mass.-based
Donoghue's newsletter reported. The average seven-day
compound yield, which assumes reinvestment of dividends,
dropped to 7.78% from 7.84%.
   Average maturity of the taxable funds increased to 45 from
44 days. That's within the range of the last few months; the
average maturity has been as short as 29 days and as long as
53 days in recent years. Money funds invest in such things as
shortterm Treasury securities, commercial paper (short-term
corporate IOUs) and bank certificates of deposit.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.50% from 7.56%. The average 30-day simple yield
also eased, to 7.58% from 7.62%, and the average 30-day
compound yield dropped to 7.87% from 7.91%.
   Yields on tax-exempt funds were also down. The average
seven-day compound yield of 226 tax-free funds dropped to
5.19% from 5.21%, Donoghue's reported. The latest yield is
equivalent to 7.21% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket
and 7.75% for someone paying 33% in taxes.

   Biggest Robbery in History -- You're the Victim

   A man was murdered in my neighborhood in New York the
other day. He was a 33-year-old advertising man. The phones
in his apartment building were out of order, so, in late
evening, he stepped out to the corner phone to call a
colleague. A would-be robber came by and shot him dead.
   Murders in New York are hardly unusual -- last year, there
were 1,905, one every four and a half hours -- but the murder
in my generally quiet neighborhood was different. It wasn't a
domestic dispute. It wasn't a drug deal. It wasn't a gang
fight. Rather, it was a robbery in which the holdup man,
according to police, was a homeless person, one of several
who have taken over a little nearby park where mothers and
children used to gather.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Times ran his picture last week. I've seen him often.
   I read about the murder the same day I read yet another
story about yet another increase in the amount of money we're
going to have to pay to keep the savings-and-loan industry
afloat. Now, it's up around $500 billion, including interest.
I'm sure there will be higher estimates in coming months. But
what difference does it make? The figures became numbing
months ago.
   Yet I wondered: Would my neighbor be alive if just some of
that money had been earmarked to help the homeless? How much
money is the federal government spending on the poor,
deranged people who have no place to live?
   The answer, nationwide, is about $598 million. That's just
a little more than one-tenth of 1% of the amount we'll spend
on the savings-and-loan scandal. That puts in perspective, a
little, the enormity and enormousness of the scandal. Here is
the government spending half a trillion dollars to rectify
bad decisions -- sometimes just dumb, sometimes criminal --
made by executives and directors who, it turns out, were
accountable to no one.
   Why isn't anyone upset about this?
   Here are some other comparisons with that $500 billion
bailout:
   The entire cost of World War II, in current dollars and
including service-connected veterans' benefits, is about $460
billion. That's $40 billion less than the bailout.
   The cost of the Vietnam War, including benefits, stands at
$172 billion. Korea was $70 billion. World War I was $63
billion. The Civil War was $7 billion -- 1 1/2% of the cost
of the savings-and-loan debacle.
   The National Cancer Institute spent $1.3 billion on cancer
research last year. The National Institutes for Health spent
$582 million on heart disease, $171 million on lung disease,
$170 million on blood disease. Add them up: Less than
one-half of 1% of the S&amp;L money.
   Why isn't anyone upset?
   Across the country, corporations, foundations and
individuals give away about $100 billion a year. In other
words, if every charitable gift from every company, every
foundation, every living human and the will of everyone who
died this year were earmarked to bail out the
savings-and-loan industry, it wouldn't be enough to handle
the cost even without worrying about the interest on that
cost.
   If you add up the budget of every state, you get total
expenditures of about $450 billion, or at least you do if you
add up the fiscal 1987 figures, the latest I could find.
Again, less than the savings-and-loan bailout.
   You get the idea. It's hard to find anything in this
country -- or in history -- as costly as the savings-and-loan
scandal. No war, no defense program, no social program, no
other scandal has ever cost what this will cost.
   Why isn't anyone upset?
   All of the ads in all of the newspapers, on all of the
television stations and networks, on all of the billboards
and everywhere else cost the advertisers about $100 billion a
year. If you add up the assets of Prudential and Metropolitan
Life and Equitable Life and Aetna and Teachers Insurance and
New York Life and Connecticut General and Travelers and John
Hancock and Northwestern Mutual you still don't get to $500
billion. The 1988 profits of all the companies on the Fortune
500 list added up to just $115 billion.
   Why isn't anyone upset?
   Probably because the savings-and-loan horror isn't a crime
like the murder of the man in my neighborhood. There is no
one, identifiable victim, other than the taxpayer. There is
no one, identifiable perpetrator, other than the system.
   Yet, again, you wonder: If just a piece of that money
could be directed elsewhere, how many murders could be
prevented, how many homeless could be helped, how many
diseases could be conquered, how many police could be hired,
how many parks could be built?
   For it just isn't right. The advertising man in my
neighborhood is dead. The homeless man in my neighborhood is
in jail. But the people -- officers and directors, mainly --
who are costing us $500 billion, robbing us of money to cure
diseases or educate the poor or just pay off our debt, are
still free to enjoy the riches of life.
   Why?

liberally lubricating the elevator's cable, and Continental's
chairman and chief executive officer arrived for lunch all
splattered in oil.
   "Life," Mr. Theobald says, "is full of ugly surprises."

   Especially at Continental. While the banking industry has
been muddling along from one lending disaster to the next,
Continental has been muddling one step behind. After spending
a good part of the decade trying to recover from its 1984
collapse and federal rescue, under Mr. Theobald Continental
has raced to catch up with the competition -- only to find
that the competition now includes foreign banks and Wall
Street investment firms as well.
   Continental's lost time was evident last month when it
reported a second-quarter loss of $56.7 million. The loss was
largely due to a big charge taken to cover the cost of firing
900 employees -- quite a few of them high-priced talent hired
during the past two years. As it turned out, some businesses
Continental was dying to get into -- notably foreign exchange
and futures trading -- were businesses better gotten out of.
   The quick retreat, along with Continental's lackluster
earnings, once again stalls the turnaround of the biggest
individual banking failure in U.S. history. What's more, with
its size, payroll and influence in the industry all
diminished, it's less clear just what the government saved
with its $4.5 billion bailout. With the industry headed
toward consolidation, even some big banks that never suffered
Continental's woes are expected to disappear.
   Some people question Mr. Theobald's strategy of being a
pure commercial bank serving medium- and large-sized
companies. "I've always been somewhat skeptical of the
strategy," says William M. Isaac, a banking consultant who,
as Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman, oversaw
Continental's bailout.
   Noting the fierce competition in commercial banking, Mr.
Isaac worries that Continental, which suffered an
international deposit run in 1984, is again totally reliant
on fickle purchased deposits. "I'd like to see them
reconsider the retail arena," where depositors rarely pull
out, Mr. Isaac says. "It's not too late."
   But Mr. Theobald isn't having any second thoughts. "I
wouldn't do a thing differently," he says. Noting that
Continental had scant consumer business to build on when he
arrived three years ago, he says the all-business strategy
was his only option.
   So, Continental has taken its best shot at selling a wide
array of new-fangled banking services like interest-rate
caps, and currency swaps. Big loans are still made, including
lots to leveraged buy-outs, but they're mostly resold to
other banks that can raise deposits to fund loans more
cheaply than Continental. In these areas, Continental has
made a lot of progress, but it still lags far behind
better-established competitors J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Bankers
Trust New York Corp.
   Continental and other bank stocks have been pummeled in
recent weeks because of loan-quality fears. In composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, its shares
closed at $11.375, up 37.5 cents. Late last year, however,
Continental shares traded as high as $26.625.
   The Continental Mr. Theobald inherited in 1987 was
essentially rudderless. The management team the FDIC had
hired -- retired oilman John E. Swearingen and retired banker
William S. Ogden -- bickered often during their three-year
tenure and didn't get much beyond stabilizing the place. When
their three-year hitch was up, Mr. Theobald was available,
having been edged out earlier for the top job at Citicorp. He
says he'd turned down job offers from other, less troubled
banks because he "wanted to take on one monumental
challenge."
   He set his all-business strategy, sold off Continental's
meager consumer operations, and launched an advertising
campaign that, like Mr. Theobald himself, spends as much time
ridiculing other banks for trying to be
all-things-to-all-people as it does pointing out that
Continental is just one thing.
   A Harvard MBA, Mr. Theobald split the commercial lending
department in two -- origination and distribution -- with one
team to make the loans and another to sell most of them off.
Walter J. Bloomenthal, a 19-year Continental veteran who
heads up loan distribution, says he sometimes ignores the new
reporting lines and takes his cue from "the origination
people -- because that's where the business is."
   Bringing Continental up to date also meant hiring a lot of
new faces, many at top dollar, including some up-front
signing bonuses and first-year-end bonuses guaranteed
regardless of performance, bankers say. S. Waite Rawls III
was lured from Chemical Bank in New York by the prospect of
being, at age 39, one of the youngest vice chairmen at any
major bank in the country, and placed in charge of all
trading and distribution. He made $625,000 last year, and
brought in scores of other trading officers to work under
him.
   The salaries were big enough that even as the number of
employees declined, Continental's expenses swelled.
Meanwhile, the lucrative leveraged buy-out lending business
sagged, and Continental found that it couldn't break into the
big leagues of foreign exchange trading. By the second
quarter of this year, when the big charge and other one-time
items are omitted, Continental was a bank only breaking even.
   The layoffs will trim the bank's overall payroll to about
6,500 and save $75 million a year. For those remaining,
making a profit will be easier, but job security less
certain.
   Continental recruited Michael P. Kamradt away from J.P.
Morgan in March 1989 to market so-called portfolio risk
management services. "They were pretty hot on a number of
areas," Mr. Kamradt recalls. But in little more than a year,
the bank began pulling back, and "I lost my belief in their
commitment." He left in June for another financial services
job.
   The staff cuts won't be enough to return Continental to
its profit goals. Revenue, which fell 19% in the second
quarter versus a year ago, will have to increase. Aside from
a Latin American interest payment now and then, which is
unpredictable at best, it isn't clear from where the added
revenue will come. Continental does have about $300 million
of real estate left to sell, which should bring hefty gains,
though Mr. Theobald won't say how rapidly he'll cash in.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Theobald is hoping to soon rid himself of a
couple of nasty distractions. One is the FDIC's remaining 26%
stake in Continental, which he calls a "continuing
embarrassment" to the bank. The Federal Reserve Board has
been reluctant to approve acquisitions or new banking powers
for Continental while it remains a partial ward of the
government.
   The FDIC Aug. 1 registered the shares with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in preparation for sale, but the
stock's recent plunge makes an offering seem unlikely for
now.
   The stock's plunge has also left Mr. Theobald's personal
options to buy 500,000 Continental shares at $21.50 each a
long way out of the money. His pay last year was $1.15
million.
   The other distraction is Continental's ownership of First
Options of Chicago Inc. The unit, which has lost more than
$250 million since Continental bought it in December 1986,
guarantees and processes options and futures trades. In the
1987 stock market crash, that turned out to be a disastrous
risk. And since then, revenue has plunged as trading volume
has fallen off.
   Mr. Theobald, who while at Citicorp oversaw a competing
bid for First Options, was slow to cut Continental's losses
in this case. Up for sale since last year, it is still
hemorrhaging, $9 million in the latest quarter. Spear, Leeds
&amp; Kellogg, the Wall Street firm that sold First Options to
Continental for $126.5 million, has been negotiating to buy
it back -- for a lot less.

   World Markets:
   Tokyo Analysts Worry Margin Calls Could Start
   New Wave of Selling, Further Battering Prices

   TOKYO -- As if Tokyo's sorely battered stock market needed
more to worry about, some analysts are getting scared that
margin calls soon could bring a fresh avalanche of selling.
   That fear was lurking in many securities industry
officials' minds yesterday as the Nikkei average of 225
stocks took its second-steepest fall ever, plunging 1978.38
points, or 6.6%, to 28002.07, narrowly above the
psychologically important 28000-point barrier. The drop, the
most devastating yet in a rout of share prices this year,
brings the indicator to its lowest level in 15 months. The
worst drop on record is the 3836.48-point decline of Oct. 20,
1987, in the midst of the Black Monday crash.
</LP>

   London trading, meanwhile, was shaken by Tokyo's drop, as
well as renewed domestic concerns. A modest round of
last-minute buying trimmed the sharp losses suffered at the
outset of trading, however.
   The market rode a rollercoaster in Tuesday morning
trading. After posting gains of about 584 points during the
first hour, the Nikkei index began to lose ground rapidly. By
late morning, the index was off more than 300 points from
Monday's close. The Nikkei index then turned around again to
cut most of its losses, finishing the morning session at
27924.88, down 77.19 points from Monday's close.
   Toshihiko Fujiwara, an analyst at New Japan Securities
Co., attributed Tuesday morning's early rebound to the yen's
slight recovery in morning trading and to bargain-hunting in
the wake of Monday's plunge. The dollar was quoted at 159.03
yen at midmorning, up from 158.95 yen at the New York close.
   At the end of Monday's trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei index
was down 28% from its high of 38915.87, reached at the end of
last year. That drop represents a loss of the equivalent of
more than $1 trillion in market capitalization.
   Turnover was light yesterday and buyers were scarce. In
part, stockbrokers blamed rising but unsubstantiated concerns
that investment trusts in Japan soon might face big
redemptions from nervous individual investors. Such
redemptions could force the trusts to liquidate their
holdings in the market.
   Another worry was a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
the country's leading economic newspaper, that some life and
casualty insurance companies might start liquidating their
stock holdings to return to cash. Although insurers said they
haven't altered their investment plans, the report caused
some analysts to fear worse declines in Tokyo. Akio Ishida, a
senior manager at YTB Investment Management Co., an affiliate
of Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Corp., worries the sell-off could
trigger a world-wide stock market downturn.
   Aggravating those new concerns, the ever-stronger dollar
sailed easily higher against the yen. For the first time in
three years, the U.S. currency broke the 160-yen level,
before slipping slightly to close Monday in Tokyo at 158.95
yen, up from 158.35 late Friday in New York. Investors are
concerned that Japanese authorities may resort to an
interest-rate increase to stem the yen's continuing decline.
That would hurt stocks by making fixed-interest investments
relatively more attractive and by raising the cost of
borrowing money to invest in the stock market.
   Already, the market's severe drop-off is raising concerns
that small investors, who still dominate trading on many days
and have been buying stock in spite of the market's steep
descent, may face difficulties associated with earlier stock
purchases made on credit. Demands by lenders for partial or
full repayment of loans for stock purchases could further
erode confidence and prices on the stock market.
   "We will have some more unfortunate affairs, I am afraid,"
admits a senior executive at Daiwa Securities Co. "The margin
situation is not so good."
   Indeed, from the stock market's point of view, it has been
getting worse. Recalling that stock prices rebounded after
the October 1987 Black Monday crash, many small investors
here have kept buying stockseven while the market has
plummeted. As a result, the total value of stock held on
margin in Japan totaled 10.06 trillion yen ($63.59 billion)
as of March 23, down fractionally from a record 10.15
trillion yen a week earlier, but up sharply from about 7.8
trillion yen a year ago.
   According to analysts who track the amount of stock
outstanding bought on margin, or credit, the total now is
roughly the equivalent of one in every 10 shares that
normally trade on the market. The percentage is so high
because as much as two-thirds of the 469.97 trillion yen in
stock listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
is held through cross-ownership of Japanese companies and
never trades. Even still, as many as one in five shares
outstanding in some stocks is owned on margin.
   When an investor buys on margin, he puts down a proportion
of a stock's value -- now 40% -- and borrows the rest,
usually through a securities company. That gives him
leverage; if the stock goes up, he can sell it and reap the
profits on all the stock he controls. The purchase also opens
him to big losses; if a stock goes down, a lender usually
will ask for the borrower to cough up the equivalent of the
value of the decline in all the stock. Thus an investor who
puts up $40 to buy $100 of stock would have to put up again
an amount equal to his entire original investment if the
value of the stock fell to $60.
   Because of yesterday's "decline, almost everybody who
bought on credit will be required to put up additional
collateral," predicts Toshihiko Yoshimi, a senior analyst at
Yamaichi Securities Co.
   Such margin calls can force small investors to bail out of
stocks. Under Japanese rules, investors have six months to
clear up margin transactions that are outstanding.
   Benedicte Ivey, a saleswoman at the securities arm of the
French bank Credit Lyonnais, has compiled a list of public
companies that she describes as "margin horrors" because of
the relatively large amount of their stock held on margin.
   Among the companies are such well-known firms as Minebea
Co., a ball-bearing and semiconductor maker, with 7.21% of
its stock as of the start of last week held on margin; Nippon
Mining Co., a metals firm, with 5.73% of its stock held on
margin; Hitachi Zosen Corp., a heavy-equipment maker, with
3.53% on margin; and Pioneer Electronic Corp., a consumer
electronics maker, with 6.25% of its stock held on margin.
   The Japanese issues with the largest balance of shares
held on margin were two obscure companies with a close
following of market speculators: about 16.5% of the stock in
Iseki &amp; Co., an agricultural machinery maker, is held on
margin, while more than 22% of the stock in Tsugami Corp., a
machine-tool company, is held on margin.
   In London, Wall Street's modest comeback from its opening
lows helped steady London nerves and led several traders to
forecast that today would see U.K. shares on the rise.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index fell
26.3 points to 2221.6. The index was down 36.3 points at one
point, and the day's highs came as trading opened, with the
FT-SE 100 off 23.4 points.
   The Financial Times 30 share index was off 20.6 points at
1748.1. Volume was 515.2 million shares, up from 453.7
million shares Friday.
   Elsewhere in Europe, prices closed lower in Paris,
Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid and
Milan. South African gold stocks closed sharply lower.
   Meanwhile, prices closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong,
Manila, Wellington, Seoul and Singapore, and were higher in
Taipei.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   The `Phil' on Pelican Bay

   Naples, Fla. -- The Philharmonic Center for the Arts, a
breathtakingly elegant cultural showcase, completes its
200-performance opening season this month with a schedule
that includes Lionel Hampton, "The Wiz," the Santa Fe
Ensemble, and the resident Naples Philharmonic. The tills are
full, bills paid and hopes high.
   The 90,275 square-foot, $19.4 million "Phil," situated on
Pelican Bay a few miles north of Old Naples, contains a
1,221-seat auditorium, a 300-seat "black box" theater, two
double-deck art galleries, a sculpture garden, and some
scrumptious bathrooms. The architect Eugene Aubry (who
designed Houston's Wortham Theater Center) wrapped the whole
thing in a light-hearted arrangement of parapets and spires
and fronted it with a nifty portecochere.

<TEXT>
   Green (the color of money) predominates inside the
building: green Italian marble, green painted Palladian
columns, green carpet, green plush seats. Befitting a jewel,
the proscenium is framed with a 42-inch curved band covered
in gold leaf.
   From the beginning in 1983, when a small hall for the
local orchestra was a baby idea, Myra Janco Daniels has been
the force behind the project. She dreamed, cajoled,
envisioned, planned, explained, insisted, solicited, got the
land, stood her ground, booked performances, budgeted, and
hung in there with the tenacity of a bulldog. Mrs. Daniels
takes credit, along with Mr. Aubry, for the green scheme, but
she is far more interested in the Phil's bottom line, which
is black.
   "We're running it like a business," she declares. "I
believe, without sounding sour to my fellow colleagues in
this business and hall, that we need more corporate thinking
in the arts. There are surely people in the corporate world
who love the arts as I do, who can bring to it a dimension,
an orderly business fashion."
   This pitch went over big in Naples, often touted as
home-away-from-home for the world's largest concentration of
retired CEOs. Since the 1890s, when a group of wealthy
Kentuckians established it as a fishing resort where jackets
and ties were laughable nonsense, Naples has had a moneyed
reputation. The $32,650 per capita income of Collier County
(skewed downward by pockets of migrant workers and the low
pay scale for hourly workers), the 648 golf holes (highest
per capita number in the nation) and the preponderance of
dress shops and financial services over bookstores and
theaters have not bestowed upon Naples the reputation of a
cultural hotbed.
   Over the years, Naples did develop pockets of "culture": a
couple of large visual arts groups, a theater company, a
Community Concert series, a small band, a small orchestra and
spasmodic building plans. Co-op ventures did not fare well,
an artsy trait that Mrs. Daniels does not like: "Art people
need to grow up and know there's a piece of pie for everyone.
Traditionally there's been too much pettiness and jealously.
This happens throughout the country. Groups have their
territories. The training of people in the arts is for
segments; they don't understand the broad scope, that the
arts are a business, and they ARE."
   Mrs. Daniels entered the culture/cash fray in Florida with
a love for music and years of advertising experience. In
1965, when she was National Advertising Woman of the Year,
Draper Daniels bought the company she was running and shortly
afterward she married Draper Daniels. When he retired she
moved with him to Florida.
   Soon after Mr. Daniels's death in 1983 she went to a
concert of the 12-member Naples-Marco Philharmonic. Learning
of its desperate plight, she offered to help with telephone
solicitation. She collected a little money and got a promise
from a Mrs. Hayes for $25, which she went in person to
collect. What follows is the stuff of Naples legend.
   Mrs. Hayes turned out to be Frances Pew Hayes of the Sun
Oil Pews, her check was for $25,000, and Myra Daniels forgot
about retirement.
   She has not been without detractors. There are those who
think she's "pushy," or who think her personal pleas
disrupted the financial channel "ad nauseam." A fight brewed
over the site's location (Westinghouse Communities, the
community-development arm of Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
solved that with benevolent self-interest -- a gift of prime
Pelican Bay property). And one individual even ran testy ads
in the Naples newspaper ("Dear Mrs. Daniels, you are ruining
this community. . . .").
   But Mrs. Daniels persevered, and has made an extra effort
to include her detractors in the center's activities: "Some
of them lost out because we sold everything before they
decided to join us -- boxes, seats, every doorknob. The only
thing I think we haven't sold are the urinals."
   In addition to million-plus gifts from Westinghouse
Communities, Curtiss E. Frank, the State of Florida and Mrs.
Hayes, nearly 800 contributors gave from $1.19 (for one
brick) to $775,000. Early in March, Mrs. Daniels announced
that Mr. Frank's final bequest had paid off all construction
costs. Pausing only for a quick breath, she then announced a
campaign for a $20 million endowment. Once the endowment is
in place, she intends to attempt answers to current
criticisms -- including ticket prices, which are too steep
for non-millionaire winter residents and wage-earning locals.
   Ticket sales constituted 68% of the center's earned income
for the initial season. Mrs. Daniels says that is more than
double the sales of other major halls. The Academy of St.
Martin-in-the-Fields, Nureyev and several others sold out
months in advance. But rows of seats remained empty for the
Chamber Music series ("Next year we're going to call it
something different, `Intimate Music' maybe").
   The Phil, along with Collier County's enormous growth over
the past decade, has changed the face of Naples. Vestiges of
the old days linger, however. A season ticket holder ($1,695
for 61 performances), elegantly dressed for the opera gala in
a black skirt and muted-print blouse, confided to me that
she'd come directly from a barbecue: "I just whipped off my
windbreaker and put on my pearls in the car."

   KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- Upjohn Co.'s hypnotic Halcion drug,
under fire from critics who say it has serious negative side
effects, will carry a "more prominent" label warning of
possible amnesia side effects.
   However, a committee of the Food and Drug Administration
declined, for now, to order stronger measures in response to
reports that Halcion, one of Upjohn's leading products,
causes unusual levels of anxiety, insomnia, hallucinations or
amnesia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A company spokeswoman said Upjohn "is very pleased with
the outcome" of the FDA study. "We felt confident that the
review underscores the safety of Halcion," she said.
   In a recent report, the FDA advisory committee said "it
wasn't clear that the actual incidence of adverse reactions
with Halcion was higher except for amnesia."
   As a result, the committee recommended that the "physician
label warning regarding amnesia be strengthened to emphasize
that this seemed to be a greater risk with Halcion."
   The committee added: "The types of adverse events being
reported were common to the sedative/hypnotic class of drugs,
as well as to alcohol, and aren't specific to Halcion."
   Possible amnesia side effects are already mentioned in the
product's label warning. But an FDA spokeswoman said the
committee "wants to see it a little more prominent and in
more detail." Language for that item is pending FDA approval.
   While the FDA's findings should help allay some concerns
surrounding Halcion, the FDA must also address a petition
submitted by the Public Citizen's Health Research Group of
Washington, D.C., that asks the agency to revise Halcion's
labeling and accuses the FDA of "suppressing" or "ignoring"
reports of the side effects.
   The FDA spokeswoman said the agency hasn't responded to
the group's petition.

   Two More Suits
   Allege Ill Effects
   Of Lilly's Prozac

   CHICAGO -- Eli Lilly &amp; Co. was hit by two more lawsuits
charging that its new antidepressant drug Prozac causes
thoughts of suicide and has other destructive side effects.
   The suits are the third and fourth of their kind in recent
weeks. Each seeks unspecified punitive damages against the
drug maker on behalf of patients using Prozac, which has
quickly become the most widely prescribed antidepressant in
the country. A Lilly spokeswoman declined yesterday to
comment on the litigation. The company reiterated, however,
that its data on Prozac, which has been used on more than two
million patients, don't show "a cause-and-effect relationship
between our product and suicidal thoughts or acts."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One suit, filed late Tuesday in state court in Marion
County, Ind., seeks unspecified damages on behalf of Janet C.
Sims, a 23-year-old woman from Noblesville, Ind. She claims
Prozac caused her "to suffer grievous, serious and severe
permanent physical and personal injuries, mental and
emotional distress, pain and suffering, adversely affecting
her earning capacity and ability to enjoy life."
   Another claim, filed in federal court for the Northern
District of Illinois in Chicago, asserts that a suburban
Chicago man, Ralph Langer, attempted suicide after taking
Prozac in 1988 by intentionally driving his car into a truck.
Mr. Langer, who is seeking $1 million in compensatory damages
and unspecified punitive damages, fractured two vertebrae in
the accident and still suffers from the injuries, according
to the complaint.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lilly
common closed at $78.375 a share yesterday, up $2.625.
   Last month, Lilly was sued in state court in Suffolk
County, New York, for $150 million in damages by a New York
woman, who charged that Prozac caused her to make attempts at
suicide. Separately, the widows of three victims in a
September 1989 mass shooting by a Prozac user in Louisville,
Ky., also filed suit in state court in Jefferson County, Ky.,
seeking $150 million in punitive damages.
   In a recent internal informational document on Prozac, the
Food and Drug Administration described the reports of adverse
effects as "not unexpected . . . Many {of the reports}
involve events that are already described in Prozac's
labeling" and "are of the type that would be expected . . .
in depressed patients," the agency said. Prozac's labeling
warns of the general risk of suicide in depressed patients,
the agency said.
   However, the FDA said Lilly recently revised its Prozac
labeling to include specific mention of cases where patients
exhibited "obsessive preoccupation with thoughts of suicide"
after taking Prozac.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   ABA Votes to Rescind Stand on Abortion

   Members of the American Bar Association's policy-making
body voted to abandon a resolution it adopted only six months
ago that favored abortion rights.
   The ABA's House of Delegates, by a vote of 200 to 188,
instead supported a resolution that acknowledges that
questions related to abortion are "extremely divisive" and
that the ABA, "for the good of the association, will not
adopt a policy supportive of a particular viewpoint."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is highly unusual for the ABA, an organization of
365,000 members nationwide, to reverse itself on such a
position. But since delegates voted 238-106 last February in
favor of a resolution supporting a constitutional right to
abortion, there has been a deep split within the ABA over
whether any position should have been adopted. Some 1,500
members have resigned in protest of the pro-abortion
resolution, and more had threatened to do so if it wasn't
repudiated.
   Anthony R. Palermo, a Rochester, N.Y., lawyer who led the
battle to rescind the pro-abortion rights measure, said
yesterday that he is neither "pro-life or pro-choice," but
that he believes the ABA shouldn't become an advocate in the
abortion debate. He said he didn't know how much money had
been donated for the campaign to rescind the policy or from
where the money came.
   However, Chris Robling, a Chicago-based consultant hired
by Mr. Palermo to lobby ABA members, said that Mr. Palermo's
efforts received financial and other support from
anti-abortion lobbying groups. He said the neutrality
advocates had used these groups' mailing lists and telephones
to persuade lawyers to put pressure on delegates. Mr. Robling
estimated that "not more than $50,000" was spent on lobbying
efforts that included a poll conducted by the Wirthlin Group
in Orem, Utah. Opponents said they believed the figure was
considerably higher.
   The ABA's approval of an abortion rights policy had meant
that the organization could file friend-of-the-court briefs
in abortion cases and lobby against legislation cutting back
abortion rights.
   The vote to reverse the ABA's abortion stance came in the
wake of a 885-837 vote on Monday by ABA members to rescind
the abortion rights resolution. That vote, taken by the ABA
assembly, wasn't binding, however. The assembly was open to
any ABA member who had registered to attend the annual
convention in Chicago.
   Before the vote yesterday, delegates listened to almost
three hours of debate. John Curtin Jr., a Boston lawyer who
is the ABA's incoming president, argued that the pro-abortion
rights stance had been too divisive, and that the ABA has "no
new or persuasive insights to add to this debate."
   Sara-Ann Determan, of the Washington law firm Hogan &amp;
Hartson, the ABA member who led the campaign to pass the
resolution last February, urged delegates not to "yield to
pressure on a matter of principle" just because a
"well-financed and highly motivated minority of our members
has dissented."

   EX-BROKER CONVICTED of fraud in over-the-counter stock's
initial offering.
   A jury in federal court in Manhattan convicted Joseph
Tavormina, a former New York stockbroker, of 31 counts of
conspiracy, securities fraud and mail fraud. Mr. Tavormina
and five co-defendants were accused of fraud in the initial
public offering of Memory Metals Corp., now known as Memry
Corp., in March 1985. They also were accused of manipulating
the stock price of Memory Metals and another over-the-counter
company, Memory Protection Devices Inc., in late 1986 and
early 1987.
   Mr. Tavormina's attorney, Barry Fallick, said his client
plans to appeal. Mr. Tavormina remains free on bail pending
his sentencing before federal judge Kenneth Conboy.
   At the heart of the charges against Mr. Tavormina is an
alleged scheme to artificially inflate the price of the
stocks. Prosecutors alleged that the stock was issued to
certain defendants and their associates to control the price
at which the stock would sell once public trading began. The
stock prices later were boosted through an elaborate system
of fictitious accounts used to trade the stock back and
forth, prosecutors alleged.
   Four of the other defendants have pleaded guilty to
certain charges and have cooperated with the government; the
trial of the last defendant has been delayed for medical
reasons.

   A JUDGE AWARDED FILIPINO seamen $32 million.
   The federal judge in Tacoma, Wash., ordered a Japanese
shipping company to pay the $32 million in back pay and
punitive damages to 21 Filipino seamen who the company
admitted underpaying for voyages between the U.S. and Japan.
It is believed to be the largest wage award ever in a
maritime case.
   Judge Jack Tanner ruled that Delica Shipping Co., a
Panamanian corporation owned by the Japanese shareholders of
Inui Steamship Co., had engaged in "flagrant, malicious,
indifferent and unconscionable" conduct toward the crew of
the Vanuatu-flagged ship.
   The seamen had alleged that they were ordered to sign two
sets of payroll receipts. One showed wages conforming with
international standards; the other showed actual pay, about
80% less.
   The judge awarded $150,000 in back wages, $15 million in
compensatory and penalty wages, and $17 million in punitive
damages. Scott Stickney, a Seattle lawyer for some of the
seamen, said that his clients, who were fired by the company,
were compensated for future lost wages.
   Although all parties in the suit were foreign, U.S. wage
laws are applicable to foreign seamen docked in U.S. ports.
Joseph Stacey, a Seattle lawyer who represented Delica
Shipping, could not be reached for comment.

   MOST CHARGES against a Shuwa Corp. unit are dismissed.
   A state court judge dismissed most of the claims of a
former accountant of Shuwa Corp.'s U.S. unit who alleged that
two top company executives in Los Angeles frequently beat him
at the office.
   An attorney representing the unit, Shuwa Investments
Corp., and its president, said the suit is set for trial in
early September. The trial will be of a single count of
assault and battery for incidents that the accountant alleged
occurred during a one-year period that ended August 1989,
when the suit was filed.
   Accountant Hajime Tanioka, who resigned last year, asserts
that Takaji Kobayashi, Shuwa Investments president, and
Takeshi Shiratori, executive vice president, at various times
kicked him, struck him with fists, and hit him with a
telephone, a calculator and a book.
   The two executives deny the allegations. Mr. Kobayashi's
father is chief of Tokyo-based Shuwa, the parent company.
Closely held Shuwa owns the Arco Towers in Los Angeles and
large office buildings in other U.S. cities.
   Judge Richard A. Lavine ruled on Tuesday that a one-year
statute of limitations invalidated five of the six counts in
Mr. Tanioka's original complaint, said Terry Sanchez, Shuwa
Investments' attorney; he declined to comment on the
remaining count.
   A former secretary to a Shuwa Investments vice president
who is a cousin of Takaji Kobayashi, filed a separate suit in
November 1988 alleging that the vice president committed
battery, harassment and sexual assault. The vice president
has denied the allegations. An attorney for Shuwa in that
suit didn't return telephone calls.

   KEITH HARING ESTATE settled a lawsuit against Playboy.
   The estate of the late pop artist sued Playboy earlier
this year for alleged copyright infringement in reproducing
and selling four of Mr. Haring's works as limited-edition
posters. Under the settlement, Playboy agreed to recall and
stop marketing two of the $225 posters based on Mr. Haring's
"bunny" drawings, but it will be able to continue selling the
other two works.
   Playboy also agreed to include a disclaimer stating that
its reproductions of Mr. Haring's work are "made without the
participation or approval of Keith Haring or his estate."

   Nynex Paid More
   Than It Disclosed
   To Supplier Firms
   ----

   New data retrieved from a Nynex Corp. billing system show
that the company paid about $10 million more than it already
disclosed to firms represented at annual "perverts
conventions."
   The new information covering sales between 1984 and 1988
was disclosed as part of a rate case in New York state. It is
being examined by state regulators, law enforcement officials
and other parties to the rate case who have been concerned
about connections between attendance at the bawdy Florida
gatherings and special deals with the company's Materiel
Enterprises purchasing arm. The weeklong Florida parties were
organized through 1988 by a top Nynex purchasing manager, who
was fired that year after a company investigation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Nynex spokesman emphasized that the amount involved is
relatively small compared with the $215 million of goods and
services Materiel Enterprises bought over the 1984-1988
period from all 33 suppliers represented at the perverts
conventions. During that period, Materiel Enterprises' total
purchases amounted to $3.1 billion, much of which went to the
regional phone company's former parent, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.
   The spokesman said the new data had no statistically
significant effect on a study it released late last month
showing no correlation between suppliers' sales to Materiel
Enterprises and attendance at the Florida gatherings.
   Nevertheless, some "pervert club" companies that Nynex had
said it didn't do business with turned up on the new list of
payments. Other companies, which Nynex officials said had
only tiny transactions with Materiel Enterprises, actually
received payments exceeding $1 million in some years. In all,
about $10 million of payments were tracked on a Materiel
Enterprises billing system, known as Xmap.
   The Nynex spokesman said the Xmap system is used for goods
and services the company uses internally, such as paper clips
or temporary office help. A separate billing system was used
for goods and services that Materiel Enterprises bought for
resale to other Nynex companies.
   The company has labeled the underlying sales data a trade
secret, covered by a protective order in the rate case.
   But interviews and testimony submitted in the rate case
indicate that some unusual payments were made through the
Xmap system. For example, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., auto body
shop whose owner was a friend of Lawrence Friedman -- the
Nynex manager who was fired for organizing the "perverts
conventions" -- received several hundred dollars one year.
Earlier testimony in the rate case indicated the owner had
helped to "arrange for women" to attend the gatherings.
   Other recipients of Nynex payments included a moving
company that hired another ex-Nynex employee who was fired
for his participation in the conventions. The moving company
received payments exceeding $1 million in both 1987 and 1988.
   Scott J. Rafferty, a Nynex whistle-blower who was
dismissed in 1986 when the consulting operation he headed at
Nynex's tiny Telco Research unit was disbanded, said the
additional information flies in the face of earlier rate case
testimony. A redacted version of Mr. Rafferty's supplemental
testimony indicates that all attendees were either affiliated
with Nynex or Nynex suppliers.
   The company spokesman pointed out that company documents
listing suppliers and payments are trade secrets. "We are put
in the position of having to respond to a document" that is
confidential, the Nynex spokesman complained.
   The unearthed billing data weren't included in the 1988
investigation of the perverts conventions conducted by Nynex.
As a result of that probe, Nynex dismissed Mr. Friedman, who
had been a Materiel Enterprises vice president, and John
Marino, who assisted Mr. Friedman in organizing the Florida
parties. Mr. Friedman, who settled a subsequent lawsuit
against the company for $1 million, has moved to Florida.
Nynex disciplined seven other employees who attended the
gatherings, which included women hired to provide
entertainment and sex for attendees. The company has said it
shared the results of the investigation with regulators in
1988.
   The Nynex spokesman said the company hadn't focused on
data from the Xmaps system earlier because it believed that
problems of favoritism among suppliers or harm to customers
would more likely show up in data from its other billing
system, which generally handled larger transactions. A search
of that system indicated no problems, he said.
   In response to its recent problems, Nynex announced last
week that it was setting up a special ethics office and a
review committee. Nynex Chairman William Ferguson also plans
to send letters to employees assuring them that the company
won't retaliate against whistle-blowers.

   Episcopalians Happily
   Avoiding Extinction

   Let us hope your readers got past the eye-catching but
irrelevant headline on Wade Clark Roof's July 20
editorial-page article highlighting some trends in U.S.
religion -- "The Episcopalian Goes the Way of the Dodo." The
headline was not only misleading but, happy to say,
erroneous.
   Those interested in statistics might reflect on the
following: There are about 2.5 million Episcopalians in the
U.S., in 7,500 congregations (a number that has stayed fairly
constant), with 8,200 full-time priests in 100 dioceses. Far
from extinct, wouldn't you say? And, Sunday attendance is up
24.7% since 1974 in Episcopal churches, which have the
highest per capita of giving of all the mainline churches.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's also interesting to note that George Gallup, whose
data was cited in the table accompanying the article, said in
an overview of a recent study done by the Gallup Organization
of "The Spiritual Health of the Episcopal Church," that the
church is "substantially orthodox . . . committed to growth .
. . open to change . . . and {wanting more involvement in}
ecology, matters of justice, war and peace."
   Headline aside, thanks for running the article and for the
challenge it contains for all of the churches, to quote: "The
religiously non-affiliated have grown to 9% today from 2% in
the early 1950s. . . . Many within this group have dropped
out from the mainline Protestant and Catholic churches. . .
."
   This time, as we approach the millennium, is the Decade of
Evangelism for the Anglican Communion, the Roman Catholic
Church, and others as well. We have a saving message to
share. Let us get beyond the numbers game and our concerns
about "how we are doing" as institutions and share the Good
News in word and deed.

   Regarding Yale President Ezra Stiles's erroneous
prediction in 1783 that a future America would be "divided
about equally among Congregationalists, Presbyterians and
Episcopalians," Thomas Jefferson's crystal ball was even more
clouded.
   Writing to a friend in 1822, Jefferson said, "I rejoice
that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief,
which has surrendered its creed and conscience to neither
kings nor priests, the genuine doctrine of only one God is
reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now
living in these United States who will not die as Unitarian."

   With regard to "Folklore and Furnace: A Tale of Two NEA
Grantees," Leisure &amp; Arts, July 24, I had two reactions.
   The first is that being a large employer in an area is a
strange justification for an arts grant. Perhaps Appalshop
Roadside Theater, with an annual budget of $1.6 million and
37 employees, might just as appropriately qualify for
assistance under state or federal small-business assistance
programs, but it might have to meet some minimum criteria
that NEA recipients don't have to meet -- like being
self-supporting after having received subsidies for 20 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The second reaction is that I am glad Franklin Furnace
Archives Inc. was able to raise $17,000 from willing
contributors. Surely it is better for society overall that
contributions to the arts be voluntary rather than coerced. I
find it disturbing that it is considered a fair exchange that
money I have worked to earn and pay taxes with is considered
well spent if it pays someone to smear chocolate syrup on
herself in public. And I am baffled that while I can go to
jail for not paying my federal income taxes, someone gets
tax-free money from the government to behave in ways that I
attempt to prohibit my six-year-old from doing in his own
home. (His actions, just as Karen Finley's, also must be seen
in context to be understood.)
   The issue is not obscenity -- the issue is that the
federal government (or any government) should spend tax money
on things that are at least as important and serious to
society as a whole as the efforts the government expends in
raising funds to pay for such expenditures.

   Wary of Mideast Blowup, Many Brokers Aren't Pushing Stocks

   NEW YORK -- Just a few weeks ago, many of Ted Peck's
clients were awash in stocks. Some were even borrowing money
to buy still more shares.
   Now the Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. broker says he
has slashed some clients' stock exposure to 40% and cut back
the leverage. It's no time to bet big on stocks, he tells
many of them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You don't bottom fish in shark-infested waters," advises
Mr. Peck. Noting the external forces playing on the stock
market these days, he sighs and says, "This is in the laps of
the gods."
   Since the October 1987 stock-market crash, Wall Street has
lectured investors to buy on stock-price drops, and that
strategy has largely paid off. But some brokers and Wall
Street executives say this time is different: There are too
many unpredictable forces -- Middle East tensions, volatile
oil prices and the budget deficit -- to prod investors back
into the market just yet, they say.
   With such potential market minefields out there, "It's
kind of hard to ask people to take risks," says Raymond
"Chip" Mason, chairman of brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc.,
Baltimore. "That's why you're not seeing many (brokers)
saying, `Go, go, go.'"
   In recent days, several big securities firms have urged
investors to slash exposure to stocks and bonds, including
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley Group Inc., Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. and Primerica
Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Dean Witter, in fact, suggested that investors move a
hefty 20% of their investment portfolios into cash, compared
with zero before. Smith Barney pushed its cash recommendation
up to 20% from 15%, reversing a recommendation made just
three weeks earlier.
   "We may be in for a period of extreme volatility" in the
market, says Smith Barney portfolio strategist A. Marshall
Acuff Jr.
   Many brokers privately say they don't always follow their
firm's advice. But at least in this case, they are simply
preaching the only gospel that small investors are willing to
listen to. Investors are still smarting from the 1987 crash,
the 1989 "minicrash" and the tumultuous declines of last
spring. While investors don't seem to be engaging in panicky
selling -- another lesson from the 1987 crash -- many aren't
willing to believe the market has hit bottom yet, either.
   "October 1987 cured a lot of people, frightened them,"
says William Lauder, a 68-year-old retired attorney and
active investor in Amityville, N.Y. "The little fellow . . .
is going to be cautious, and his brokerage house -- if it has
any sense of the small clients -- it's going to reflect that,
too."
   Mr. Lauder says he would ignore his broker if the broker
were touting buying opportunities now. "This Mideast thing
has kind of exacerbated the situation to the point where I'm
very cautious," he says, adding, "I think it's going to get
worse on a gradual basis before it gets better."
   Not every broker, however, has told clients to cool it.
Stanley Lee, a PaineWebber Inc. broker in New York, says he's
telling investors to buy selectively even though he expects
volatility in the next few months and says prices could fall
further. Investors who buy Philip Morris in the mid-40s, for
instance, might see it fall to $38 a share in a crunch, Mr.
Lee says, "but it's still a good opportunity." Philip Morris
closed yesterday at $45.625 a share, up 37.5 cents, on New
York Stock Exchange composite volume of three million shares.
   Some Wall Street executives think they've got the Middle
East situation figured out. It's "analyzable," says Michael
A.M. Keehner, head of the 1,400 brokers in General Electric
Co.'s Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. unit. "We see this by its nature
as basically being a short-term crisis" that the Bush
administration will take care of, he says. Investors should
"take a look at high-quality growth stocks which do seem to
be available," Mr. Keehner urges.
   Still, many brokers are reluctant to push too hard too
fast. Despite exhortations of his branch manager to "go out
there and sell," a Dean Witter broker confides, he has
counseled caution to clients wanting to jump in and buy
stocks.
   The broker, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of
reprisal, said "I'll go through the month without the (sales)
numbers I need rather than burn the hell out of people."
   Even brokers who emphasize the long term are cautious. "I
haven't called a single client and said, `We've got all this
cash, let's go in and buy,'" says Michael Cohen, a broker for
A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla. "But I'm
saying buy slowly -- particularly if we see more dips in the
market."
   One thing's certain: Any spurt in the market -- such as
yesterday's 24.26-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average -- makes it easier for brokers to persuade their
clients to jump back in.
   For example, at Raymond James Associates Inc. in Sarasota,
Fla., branch manager Arthur O'Connor says he suddenly had
success selling "high-quality growth stocks" to his mostly
older clients, some of whom had left the stock market
completely in the past couple of months. One investor has
just put half his money back into stocks, Mr. O'Connor says,
and he hopes others will put back at least a third.
   His pitch? "We've been through these kinds of (oil-related
market plunges) before, in 1973 and 1974, and it worked out
before," Mr. O'Connor says.
   But he quickly adds: "I'm not saying it's going to be a
smooth ride by any means back to 3000."

   LOS ANGELES -- Spelling Entertainment Inc. said it "is no
longer exploring a possible sale of the company."
   Spelling, an entertainment production and distribution
company, put itself on the block 10 months ago, saying it had
retained Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
unit and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to look into "various
strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value,
including the possible sale of the company."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the time, it said several companies had expressed an
interest in Spelling. The company was put on the block just
six months after control of the concern switched to
Cincinnati investor Carl Lindner from producer and founder
Aaron Spelling. At the time of the announcement, some
analysts said they didn't think the company was that
attractive because of little continuing programming.
   Spelling executives couldn't be reached for comment about
how much interest had been generated. The company said in a
press release that the interest it had received didn't
reflect management's valuation of the company.
   In the third quarter ended April 30, net income fell
nearly 64% to $954,000, or three cents a share, from $2.6
million, or nine cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
declined 40% to $37.4 million from $62.1 million.

   Halfway through a concert by the folk music duo Buskin &amp;
Batteau -- after they croon "The Boy With the Violin," "When
I Need You Most of All" and "I'd Rather Be in Love" -- the
pair treats the audience to an unusual medley.
   The tunes, which they composed or co-wrote, are familiar
to anyone who has seen or heard television and radio
commercials for some of America's best-known products: "Can't
Beat the Feeling," "The Heartbeat of America" and "Just for
the Taste of It," among others.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   David Buskin and Robin Batteau are folk singers at heart,
but that isn't how they earned the bulk of their living.
Along with their partner Susan Hamilton, they are one of the
most successful commercial jingle-writing teams on Madison
Avenue.
   Their company, HB&amp;B Productions Inc., was responsible for
some catchy, if sometimes annoying, commercial tunes for such
products as Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Chevrolet, Cadillac,
Cheerios, Burger King and McDonald's.
   But after 18 months, the partners called it quits and
disbanded the company Aug. 1. Even though they made a pile of
money from writing jingles -- more than they could ever have
hoped to earn as the proverbial starving folk artists -- they
instead want to pursue writing musical compositions that last
more than, say, 30 seconds.
   Mr. Buskin, 46 years old, says he plans to concentrate on
concerts with Mr. Batteau and writing songs for other
recording artists, including Judy Collins. Mr. Batteau, 42,
says he will perform concerts but he also wants to continue
writing jingles, for Crushing Enterprises Inc., another New
York jingle-writing company that he previously worked with.
Ms. Hamilton, a 20-year veteran of jingle writing and a
Fulbright scholar, is moving to Los Angeles to produce albums
and write songs.
   HB&amp;B was formed to integrate the trio's various
businesses, including songwriting and jingles, as well as
producing records and concerts. "But it never worked out that
way," says Ms. Hamilton. "We spent all our time writing
jingles." Her own company, HEA ("it stands for Hamilton et
al.," she says) will remain in business, in part to write
jingles.
   "The wages are a lot better than folk singing," admits Mr.
Buskin, whose first successful stab at jingle writing was the
"Just Watch Us Now" campaign for National Broadcasting Co. in
1984.
   "But the more accounts we kept winning, the less time we
had time to concentrate on our first love, which was the
music and the concerts," he continues. "We started turning
down gigs because we were exhausted from jingle writing. The
advertising business became a sponge for every available
moment of free time."
   Mr. Batteau sounds like a throwback to the '60s' values.
"We wanted to be able to concentrate on the art of
songwriting, as well as the craft," he says. "We're proud of
our jingles, but we're moved by our songs."
   The duo Buskin &amp; Batteau have performed in clubs, such as
New York's Bottom Line, and on college campuses since 1979.
After five albums and only moderate success on the folk-music
trail, Mr. Buskin turned to jingles to make money. "It was at
a low point in my life," he says. "I was nearly broke. I
noticed some of my friends who wrote jingles had houses in
Connecticut and that was attractive." Mr. Buskin, it should
be noted, now has a house in Connecticut.
   While Mr. Buskin was racking up jingles, such as "All
Aboard America" for Amtrak and "We Deliver, We Deliver" for
the U.S. Postal Service, Mr. Batteau was reluctant to join
his partner.
   "I'm a kid of the '60s," says Mr. Batteau. "I didn't want
to get corrupted or feel like I was sleeping with the
capitalist enemies. Also, I didn't want to fail at it. It
took some years of trying to make ends meet before I decided
to give it a shot."
   After several failed attempts, Mr. Batteau's first success
in jingle writing came with the airliner BWIA International,
owned by Trinidad &amp; Tobago Airways Corp. in Trinidad. "And
then nothing," he says. "I came in second in a lot of
competitions for about a year. I admit I was getting a bit
jealous of David." But then Mr. Batteau won an assignment for
the "Unsinkable Taste of Cheerios" jingle.
   His most famous jingle remains "The Heartbeat of America"
for Chevrolet. It was written in 1986 and remains on the air.
"It was written in about five minutes and easily put me on
the map," says Mr. Batteau, who sounds amazed at his own
accomplishment.
   But the allure of jingle writing has ebbed for Messrs.
Buskin and Batteau. Not only do they want to spend more time
on songwriting and concerts but on political activities as
well. They are involved with the late singer Harry Chapin's
World Hunger Year project, for instance. They also wrote the
theme song for the New York City mayoral campaign of David N.
Dinkins, "City of Cities."
   With the pressure of jingle writing lessening, Buskin &amp;
Batteau are returning to writing songs and performing, most
recently with Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie in Washington last
Friday. They also co-wrote about half of the tunes on Judy
Collins's new album, which has the working title "Fires of
Eden" and is scheduled to be released next month.
   Buskin &amp; Batteau are proud of their jingles and, in fact,
look forward to their performance of the medley in concert.
Apparently, so does the audience.
   "It's funny," says Mr. Batteau, "these commercials, like
Diet Coke, get booed when they show up before a movie in a
theater. But when we do them, they get cheered."

Terms weren't given.
   A newly formed holding company will be led by Al Hirzel

Gredinger, who had previously owned GGK. The new holding
company, which will remain private, will hold 100% of GGK and
65% of Trimedia.
   The company said it is merging the two networks in a bid
to "become one of the major European integrated
communications consultancies."
   Lois/GGK, headed by high-profile ad man George Lois, has
offices in Chicago and New York with total billings of about
$190 million. The shop creates ads for Alberto-Culver Co.,
Time magazine and No Excuses jeans.

   Iraq May Draw on Anti-Zionism
   In High-Stakes Bid to Woo Arabs

   JERUSALEM -- Saddam Hussein has staked his government's
future on the outcome of the Persian Gulf conflict and
represents a more formidable foe to the West than he did 24
hours ago, according to Middle East analysts in Israel.
   The Iraqi president is unlikely to withdraw from Kuwait,
they say, and he has launched a campaign aimed at other Arab
states that could undermine the attempt at an economic
embargo of Iraq. As part of this campaign, analysts expect
him to step up his invective against Israel and possibly his
military posture as well.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Saddam has tied himself to the mast," says Amatzia Baram,
a Haifa University professor and an expert on Iraq. "Either
the ship sails on or he goes down with it."
   The reason the stakes are so high, Mr. Baram says, is that
the Iraqi president's rule is based on "hayba," an Arabic
word that connotes a mixture of terror and reverence. This
means that once his aura of omnipotence is lost, it becomes
possible for rivals to topple him or even for the people to
rise up in the streets against him.
   Saddam Hussein also has raised the ante for his Arab
neighbors. By invoking the Palestinian cause in his statement
about the takeover of Kuwait, and by implying that Kuwait is
a stop on the road to the liberation of Jerusalem, "Saddam is
going over the heads of Arab leaders and straight to the
masses," Mr. Baram says. In fragile governments with a strong
anti-Zionist tradition, such as in Saudi Arabia, this could
force rulers to try to get the West to ease up in its
reprisals against Iraq.
   "The one thing all Arabs still hate much more than Saddam
is Israel," a military source says.
   Saddam Hussein also reiterated his "share-the-wealth"
message, which analysts say is a linchpin of his ambitions in
the region. If he can weather the storm over the seizure of
Kuwait, Saddam Hussein could use his prestige and the wealth
from Kuwait to offer aid to such Arab nations as Egypt while
encouraging dissidents in nations opposed to him, such as
Syria and Saudi Arabia.
   "The question now is who cracks first," says Joseph
Alpher, deputy head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies in Tel Aviv. "If Arabs start wavering, and body bags
start coming home to America along with rising oil prices,
people may question the current U.S. stance."
   Analysts say Saddan Hussein has only until about tomorrow
to go into Saudi Arabia, if he plans to, as the U.S. military
presence there will be too strong after that. But although it
may be militarily feasible for Iraq, analysts here generally
doubt that Baghdad will seek to move against Riyadh.
   They also don't expect Arab leaders to forge a face-saving
compromise whereby Iraq could withdraw from Kuwait while, for
example, holding on to strategic islands or a few billion
dollars.
   The question then becomes, how long can Iraq withstand
Western pressure? Analysts say an economic embargo won't
pinch hard for several months. They also are pessimistic
about the chances of toppling Saddam Hussein from inside
Iraq, where no real underground opposition is believed to
exist. Assassination also would be difficult, as the Iraqi
president is heavily guarded, rarely leaves the nation and
has executed those who show signs of dissenting or of
becoming a rival.
   "He is probably the most paranoid leader in the world
today," says Mr. Baram. He is believed to have survived 10
assassination attempts since 1979. He also weathered an
eight-year war with Iran that cost an estimated half-million
Iraqi lives and brought no tangible gain.
   "Any self-respecting population would have strung him up,"
Mr. Alpher says.
   Israeli military sources also acknowledge that
intelligence on Iraq is less than in other Arab nations. "We
see Jordan, we see Syria, we know them," says a military
source. "But we don't taste Iraq."
   At the same time, the source says, "Iraq is fertile ground
for recruiting people who despise Saddam." Among them are the
country's large Kurdish minority, families of murdered
political dissidents and Shiite Moslems, who make up roughly
half of Iraq's population and who have sometimes chafed under
the rule of Saddam Hussein's Sunni Moslems.
   More likely, analysts say, would be a coup by military or
security officers. If the economic situation becomes
desperate because of the embargo and Iraq finds itself with
few allies, "then people might decide it's a choice between
saving Saddam and saving Iraq," says Mr. Baram. Even so, a
coup might not end Iraq's aggressive stance. "You can chop
off the head but you still have the body," Mr. Baram says,
referring to the army, security services and ruling Baath
Party, all run by Saddam Hussein's friends.
   Some analysts still hope a formula will be found that
allows Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait while saving face. They
say President Hussein has demonstrated an ability to abandon
once-cherished creeds for immediate benefit. For instance, in
the mid-1980s, when Iran appeared close to winning the war,
Saddam Hussein mended fences with Cairo to get much-needed
Egyptian support, despite having led the Arab drive to
isolate Egypt for its earlier peace treaty with Israel. The
Iraqi leader even made conciliatory noises toward Israel to
secure Western backing.
   But with Saddam Hussein and President Bush having thrown
down the gauntlets, few analysts think any middle ground is
left.
   "The ladder has been there waiting, and Saddam has
declined to climb down," says Asher Susser, head of the Dayan
Center for Middle East and African Studies in Tel Aviv. "The
only course now is attrition or collision."

   Economy:
   Fed Says Economy Slowed Before Crisis

   Weakness, Affecting East,
   Midwest Particularly,
   Preceded Oil-Price Rise

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy was slowing markedly even
before oil prices shot up, according to a new Federal Reserve
survey.
   "Business and banking contacts . . . generally report
continued economic growth, though most noted that the pace
was slow or had slackened recently," the Fed report said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The increasing weakness was particularly evident in
residential and commercial construction, but in many parts of
the country the Fed also found manufacturing to be "flat,"
retail sales to be "soft to a little higher than a year ago"
and growth in bank loans to be "slow."
   The new Fed report, prepared in July by the 12 district
Federal Reserve banks, adds to the accumulating evidence that
the U.S. economy is edging closer to recession, if it isn't
already in one. It follows last week's employment report that
suggested a significant weakening in the economy in July. The
Fed has said that it is trying to avoid a recession, and the
new signs of a deteriorating economy put pressure on it to
lower interest rates, even as the spurt in oil prices adds to
the inflation rate.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, speaking to the
National Press Club yesterday, suggested that it's time for
the Fed to lower rates. "We think that although inflation is
important, that the maintenance of economic growth, and even
the pushing of economic growth, is very, very important," he
said.
   The chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
Richard Rahn, said yesterday that the group is forecasting a
recession for the first time since 1981, and he blamed the
Fed.
   "The impending recession is not the result of Iraqi
adventurism in the Middle East," said Mr. Rahn, a frequent
critic of the Fed. "It is due to bad economic policy by the
U.S. government. The Federal Reserve has left the economy no
margin of error, and by fulfilling Murphy's law, the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait only makes a bad situation worse." Mr.
Rahn predicted the economy will grind to a halt in the
current quarter and enter a recession in the fourth.
   The domestic economy, while paramount, isn't the Fed's
only concern. Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, said that it will be "very
difficult" for the Fed to lower short-term U.S. interest
rates while interest rates overseas and long-term interest
rates in the U.S. are rising.
   The Fed survey found economic conditions particularly weak
up and down the Eastern Seaboard and in some parts of the
Midwest. Other regions continue to grow, albeit slowly. The
word "recession" was mentioned only once, and that came in a
quote from a building-supply company in the Minneapolis area.
   Construction activity is down from last year's levels in
nearly all regions. Unsold houses are discouraging new
construction and putting downward pressure on prices in many
areas, the Fed said. In areas where the Fed asked about
commercial construction, most respondents saw "weak or
slackening activity." There are still hot spots, though. The
San Francisco Fed said housing markets in Las Vegas and
Sacramento are still "vigorous."
   Weakness in the manufacturing sector is also widespread,
the Fed found. Philadelphia-area manufacturers reporting
declining activity in July outnumbered those posting gains by
nearly 2-1. Defense industries are laying off workers in
several regions. Textile and furniture sales are down.
   One bright spot is the U.S. steel industry. Because Europe
is using more of its own steel, it is exporting less to the
U.S., and U.S. producers report stronger orders as a result.
Aside from steel, business for U.S. exporters is also up.
   The Fed survey found that the pace of commercial loan
growth has slowed recently, both because a slow economy has
reduced borrowers' demand for loans and because of the credit
crunch that prompted the Fed to ease its grip on credit
slightly last month. Some Chicago banks said business loans
are expanding less than they expected. Philadelphia bankers
expect only "minor gains" in business lending.
   The Fed report was prepared for the next formal meeting of
the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee, scheduled for
Aug. 21. At times of economic uncertainty, the committee
often confers by telephone.
   Here's a synopsis of the Fed's survey, region-by-region:
                                                                                                       

   Boston
                                                                                                       

   Second-quarter growth at companies in this district was
slow and slowing. Retail sales were flat to down from a year
earlier, with clothing and home items down. Availability of
bank credit remains a problem for half the respondents.
Exports outperformed domestic sales, boosting total sales
above mid-1989 levels at more than half of the firms
surveyed. (The Boston Fed covers Massachusetts, Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and most of Connecticut.)
                                                                                                       

   New York
                                                                                                       

   Developments are mixed, with unemployment below the
national level but consumer spending soft, vacancy rates
slightly higher in Manhattan and homebuilding slower
throughout the area. Continuing contraction in downtown
Manhattan financial firms was responsible for higher vacancy
rates, but declining rents and other concessions may boost
rentals. Unemployment declined in western New York, but
coming plant closings in Buffalo, N.Y., and Hoboken, N.J.,
cloud the outlook. Demand for both residential and commercial
real estate loans is weaker than a year earlier.(New York,
northern New Jersey and Fairfield County, Conn.)
                                                                                                       

   Philadelphia
                                                                                                       

   Economic conditions appear stagnant, with little or no
growth seen for the remainder of the year. Just over half the
manufacturers surveyed reported steady business. Retailers
see a slow summer with a possible pickup in sales in the
fall. Bankers described slow lending, with virtually no new
commitments in commercial lending. (Eastern Pennsylvania,
Delaware and southern New Jersey.)
                                                                                                       

   Cleveland
                                                                                                       

   Consumer spending rebounded moderately in June and
continued into July. Manufacturing output has been better
than expected, with the strong demand for steel abroad and
weak domestic prices helping sales. Inflationary pressures
remain, with purchasing agents expecting 4% to 5% inflation
by the end of the year. Higher crude oil prices will add to
those pressures. Funds remain available for single-family
home construction, with lending tighter for multifamily
units. (Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky and
northern West Virginia.)
                                                                                                       

   Richmond
                                                                                                       

   Business conditions weakened, with tourism and retail
sales down. Manufacturing activity softened, with furniture
sales down. Respondents said that textiles sales are also
down, with several textile plants closed. Prices were up for
both materials and merchandise. Exports were mixed at area
ports. Loan requests were steady, but 40% of financial
institutions report lower-quality applications. (Virginia,
Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, the District of
Columbia and most of West Virginia.)
                                                                                                       

   Atlanta
                                                                                                       

   The region is growing slowly. Big-ticket items are selling
well below last year's levels, with respondents reporting
that weakness continues in commercial and residential
construction. Manufacturing is mixed, with textiles,
automobiles and furniture weak but paper, aluminum and farm
equipment sales increasing. Droughts have resulted in heavy
losses in the region, particularly Georgia and Tennessee.
Export demands from the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and
Japan have helped poultry sales. (Georgia, Alabama, Florida,
eastern Tennessee, southern Mississippi and southern
Louisiana.)
                                                                                                       

   Chicago
                                                                                                       

   Manufacturing contributed slow but consistent growth, led
by increases in orders for truck engines and electronic
parts. Steel shipments in the third quarter are expected to
be ahead of seasonal gains. Commercial and industrial lending
was at or below expectations, with construction lending hurt
by restrictions on savings and loan associations. Crop prices
have been volatile, largely due to speculation over crop
yields. (Northern Illinois, Iowa, lower peninsula of
Michigan, most of Indiana, southern Wisconsin.)
                                                                                                       

   St. Louis
                                                                                                       

   Economic growth continues to be sluggish. Manufacturing
activity has weakened recently, and many defense contractors
are cutting back production. High vacancy rates and flat
rents have halted apartment building except in Louisville.
Lending has slowed, and crops are reported in fair to good
condition. (Eastern Missouri, Arkansas, western Kentucky,
western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, southern Illinois
and southern Indiana.)
                                                                                                       

   Minneapolis
                                                                                                       

   The economy appears reasonably healthy, with
resource-related industries showing no signs of weakening.
The forestproducts and mining industries continue to prosper,
with generous rainfall improving the outlook for farmers.
Unemployment is declining. While new car sales are soft,
overall retail activity looks fairly good. Tourism remains
the brightest spot in the area's economy, with spending
doubling over the past two years. (Minnesota, Montana, North
Dakota, South Dakota, northern Wisconsin, upper peninsula of
Michigan.)
                                                                                                       

   Kansas City
                                                                                                       

   Growth continues at a moderate pace. Retail sales are
unchanged or slightly higher than a year earlier but mixed
over the past three months. Manufacturing is sluggish.
Housing starts are down from last year but have stabilized
over the past month. Wheat yields are above average across
the area, with Kansas reporting its largest crop on record.
Higher yields, however, should drive down prices and limit
income gains for area farmers. (Western Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, northern New Mexico.)
                                                                                                       

   Dallas

   Slow economic growth continues, with some promising
developments. Retail sales growth is outpacing the rest of
the nation. Construction continues its moderate growth, with
an upturn in both the single and multifamily markets.
Manufacturing presents a mixed picture, with steel,
telecommunications, and refineries reporting higher sales,
while paper, fabricated metal, and some semiconductor
producers reporting weakness in their respective markets. Dry
weather has agricultural producers nervous, with some cotton
growers abandoning their crops. Prices remain high, however,
with livestock indexes up 7%. (Texas, northern Louisiana,
southern New Mexico.)
                                                                                                       

   San Francisco
                                                                                                       

   The West continues to enjoy economic expansion in most
sectors despite some losses in defense industries. The
service sector continues its robust growth, and retailers
report strong growth in several areas. Wages and prices
remain stable, with few rises larger than 4% to 5%.
Construction has slowed from its torrid pace of a year ago
along the California coast, but homes are selling well and
prices are rising in most parts of the West. Manufacturing
and agriculture remain stable, with growth in some
heavy-equipment orders balancing losses in the defense
sector. (California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Utah,
Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii.)

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mirrors being built for a $747 million
series of weather satellites have been found to warp and
become useless in the temperature extremes of space, NASA
officials said.
   The problem marks the second time in recent months that a
NASA project has been seriously affected by failed mirror
technology. Engineers found in June that a mirror aboard the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope was ground to the wrong
specifications.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for NASA said the new flaw was discovered by
ITT Aerospace, a subcontractor for the project, and that the
weather satellites can't be completed and launched until a
solution is found. The mirrors are being built for a
satellite to be launched in February 1992 as the first of
five in a series of robot weather observers.
   Agency spokesman Bryan Dunbar said engineers for NASA, ITT
and Ford Aerospace, the prime contractor, are scrambling to
correct the problem in time for the 1992 launch, and it is
possible that there could be no delay if a solution is found
quickly.
   Managers of the NASA program were not available for
comment, Mr. Dunbar said.
   NASA is supervising construction of the weather satellites
for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The
craft scheduled for 1992 launch will supplement the single
satellite that NOAA now has for cloud-cover observations over
the U.S.

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department is investigating
charges of alleged "dumping" of advanced electronic displays
by Japanese firms. The inquiry is opposed by some U.S.
computer makers that use such components in their portable
and laptop models.
   The department is acting on a complaint by U.S. display
producers that 12 Japanese firms, including Sharp Corp.,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Hitachi Ltd. are
selling these displays to U.S. users at far lower prices than
their home-market or production costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the department verifies these charges and the
International Trade Commission determines that such dumping
is hurting U.S. display producers, the U.S. will be required
to impose anti-dumping duties on these Japanese imports to
offset whatever price advantage they may have over domestic
products.
   The Advanced Display Manufacturers of America, the trade
group that filed the complaint, said it conservatively
estimates the value of the Japanese imports at more than $90
million annually. The seven small or medium-sized producers
that make up the ADMA also claim that the Japanese have 90%
of the U.S. market for these displays.
   The ADMA petition has drawn sharp opposition from Apple
Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp. and Tandy Corp., which
warned the ITC Tuesday that higher duties for Japanese
displays could price their own models out of the market.
Lawyers for International Business Machines Corp. said the
firm is preparing a statement also opposing the ADMA
petition.
   The products involved in the petition are thin-panel
displays, using such technologies as active-matrix liquid
crystal displays, electroluminescence and gas plasma. They
are mostly used for laptop computers and aircraft cockpit
displays, but there is potentially a more lucrative market in
high-definition television.
   The Japanese companies, seeking to have the petition
dismissed, have challenged the U.S. producers' ability to
adequately supply the American market. "The petitioners do
not have the technology, the production know-how or the plant
capacity that the commercial market requires," Lawrence
Walders, a counsel for the Japanese firms, said in a
statement to the ITC.
   The other Japanese suppliers named in the petition are
Fujitsu Ltd.; Hosiden Electronics Co.; Kyocera Corp.;
Matsushita Electronics Corp., a unit of Matsushita Electric
Industrial; NEC Corp.; Optrex Corp.; Seiko Epson Corp. and
Seiko Instruments &amp; Electronics Ltd., both units of Hattori
Seiko Corp.; and Toshiba Corp.

   Occidental Outlay
   In Hammer Project
   Is Backed by Court

   LOS ANGELES -- A legal battle over Occidental Petroleum
Corp.'s outlay of about $90 million for a museum to house its
chairman's art collection took a decisive turn yesterday,
when a Delaware court quashed shareholder objections to a
settlement.
   The ruling by Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett of the
Delaware Court of Chancery approved an agreement between
Occidental and several shareholder groups setting terms for
the museum and other company contributions to charitable
ventures by Dr. Armand Hammer, Occidental's 92-year-old
chairman and chief executive officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among other things, Vice Chancellor Hartnett held that
Delaware's "business judgment rule" likely embraces even this
large corporate outlay on a charity designated by a company
officer. The business judgment rule holds that a
well-advised, well-informed board is free to make a "business
choice" about what's best for a company in a wide range of
circumstances. The fight over Occidental's contribution,
though far removed from the dramatic takeover challenges
often argued in Delaware's courtrooms, nonetheless cut to the
heart of management and directors' powers and prerogatives.
It laid bare details of the oil company's outlays that proved
closely intertwined with its chairman's acquisitive tastes in
art.
   Vice Chancellor Hartnett wrote that "on balance"
shareholder objections to Occidental's financing of the
"Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center" would
"likely be dismissed before or after a trial because they all
fall within the ambit of the business judgment rule."
   The judge thus concluded that, although "the benefit to be
received by the corporation and its stockholders from the
settlement is meager, it is adequate considering the fact and
circumstances."
   Although he approved the settlement, Vice Chancellor
Hartnett cut to $800,000 the $1.4 million in fees that
Occidental had agreed to pay its opponents' lawyers. The
proposed fee drew considerable attention during argument over
the settlement on the grounds that it amounted to an
inducement from Occidental for lawyers to settle the case.
   The judge, who had earlier expressed doubts about the
proposed fee, held that "the value of the {settlement's}
benefit is significantly less than plaintiffs' claim."
   As previously reported, the settlement limits Occidental's
contributions to charities controlled by Dr. Hammer to 1.33%
of the previous year's total common stock dividend -- a
figure that has grown as Occidental issues more shares. The
pact also requires that Occidental's name as well as Dr.
Hammer's appear on the museum, and that direct construction
costs for the museum be limited to $60 million. Occidental
also has provided an annuity for museum upkeep that boosts
its total outlay.
   The debate over the settlement grew out of objections by
Alan R. Kahn, a New York investment adviser, to a pact worked
out last year by other plaintiffs objecting to Occidental's
museum venture. Mr. Kahn yesterday declined to comment on the
court's decision and refused to say whether he will appeal.
   In the course of Mr. Kahn's objections to the settlement,
a number of details were discovered about the collection that
has been closely associated with Dr. Hammer. Among the
disclosures: Occidental paid millions of dollars for some of
the most famous pieces of art.
   More recently, a niece who is the sole heir of Dr.
Hammer's late wife, Frances Hammer, has filed suit claiming
ownership to a large portion of the collection.
   Despite the debates surrounding the museum, which is
nearing completion next to Occidental's corporate
headquarters, Dr. Hammer said yesterday that he was "very
pleased" with the Delaware decision. He said the museum plans
to open Nov. 28 with an exhibit of the works of Russian
artist Kasimir Malevich.

   GM May Shut Down
   Up to Eight Plants
   Due to Local Strike

   DETROIT -- A strike over local grievances at a General
Motors Corp. parts-making plant in Flint, Mich., could force
shutdowns at as many as eight GM car and truck assembly
plants within two days, the company said.
   The almost immediate impact of this local walkout on GM's
operations demonstrates how vulnerable the Big Three auto
makers will be should contract talks with the United Auto
Workers union fail to produce a new national contract by the
Sept. 14 strike deadline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Flint parts plant is a "key" operation for GM because
it supplies gas tanks and certain other critical components
to a majority of GM's North American assembly plants,
including those that build some of the company's most
profitable luxury car lines, a GM spokesman said. It's not
clear yet how deeply the strike will cut into GM's
production, he said.
   But GM President Lloyd E. Reuss, at an industry conference
in Traverse City, Mich., expressed concern that GM could lose
momentum in the market because the company has relatively
lean inventories of new cars. "The marketplace doesn't wait
any more," Mr. Reuss said.
   Union officials said the walkout yesterday morning at an
AC Rochester division plant in Flint was a reaction by
members of United Auto Workers union local 659 to
"longstanding local grievances" over work practices, health
and safety issues, and subcontracting of work outside the
plant.
   But GM's plan to shut a portion of the factory by 1992 and
lay off about 600 of the 2,800 union workers there is "a big
emotional issue" behind the walkout, one UAW official said.
Union leaders were quick to draw the parallel between the
Flint situation and the broader grievances about GM plant
closings and layoffs that are a focus of the national talks.
   "The company's uncooperative stance (at AC Rochester) does
reveal the very insensitivity and lack of respect for its
work force that we have said must be addressed throughout the
corporation," said Stephen P. Yokich, UAW vice president.
   In effect, the AC Rochester strike is a warning to all the
Big Three U.S. auto makers that the UAW won't have to expend
its resources on a mass walkout to cripple a target auto
maker's operations this autumn.
   GM, like Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., no longer
warehouses large inventories of parts to supply assembly
operations. Instead, many parts-making plants build and ship
components to assembly plants on a "just-in-time" basis.
   This practice cuts inventory carrying costs. But it also
means that any disruption in the supply lines quickly
translates into lost output. When Canadian truckers blocked
bridges between Ontario and Michigan in May, the cutoff in
the flow of parts forced production cuts at nine Big Three
facilities.
   Negotiations to settle the dispute are scheduled to resume
today, UAW and GM officials said.

   Pacific Enterprises Says Large Charge
   Led to $229 Million Second-Period Loss

   LOS ANGELES -- Pacific Enterprises, stumbling in its
effort to diversify, said it took $275 million in charges on
its drugstore and oil operations, resulting in a $229 million
second-quarter net loss.
   The loss, equivalent to $3.34 a share, compared with net
income of $53 million, or 78 cents a share, in the
year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose 3.8% to $1.60 billion from
$1.55 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pacific Enterprises stock closed at $39.75, up $1.125,
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   However, analysts said the earnings report included
disquieting elements, including apparently growing problems
for the company's retailing operations. "The indication is
that the problems there are a lot worse than some of us had
anticipated," said Janet Dzwierzynski, an analyst at Duff &amp;
Phelps Inc., Chicago.
   Pacific Enterprises disclosed, among other things, that
its head of retailing resigned effective July 31, that it may
close as many as 10% of its 1,070 drug and sporting-goods
stores, and that further major management changes may be in
store.
   Based in Los Angeles, Pacific Enterprises is the parent of
Southern California Gas Co., the nation's largest
gas-distribution operation. It acquired Thrifty Corp., a
chain of drug and sporting-goods stores, in 1986 for about
$800 million in stock, a transaction that left many analysts
leary at the time. Pacific Enterprises also has built up its
oil and gas operations over a period of years.
   The charges include $175 million in write-downs of Pacific
Enterprises' large oil and natural-gas operations. The
writedowns, which were anticipated by analysts, are required
under accounting rules as a result of low oil and gas prices
prevailing at June 30. The company said it wouldn't have to
have taken the charge at today's elevated prices. However,
once taken, the charges can't be reversed.
   In many ways, the write-down of oil and gas assets
"removed a sword that had been hanging over the company's
head," said David N. Fleischer, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Far more surprising was the $100 million in write-downs
for retailing operations. More than half of that amount was
due to anticipated closings of between 5% and 10% of the
company's stores over the next two years, a spokesman said.
The remainder is for write-downs to store inventories.
   Pacific Enterprises said that Daniel A. Seigel, 48 years
old, an executive vice president of the parent company, was
named president and chief operating officer of Thrifty
effective immediately. He succeeds Richard G. Eils, 52,
president and chief executive officer of the unit, who
resigned "to pursue other interests."
   According to a spokesman, Pacific Enterprises is
conducting a search for a number of new senior executives for
Thrifty. He didn't say how many. The new employees may
include a new chief executive officer, a post that has been
left vacant in the wake of Mr. Eils' resignation.
   Setting aside the write-down, Pacific Enterprises retail
operations showed a profit of $2 million, down 82% from $11
million a year earlier. Pacific Enterprises cautioned that
"disappointing retailing earnings are expected to persist
through the remainder of the year."
   Excluding its $175 million charge, the company's oil and
gas operations had profit of $16 million, a 20% decline from
$20 million a year earlier. The latest period's profit
includes the benefit of reduced depletion expense from the
write-down, a benefit that analysts said will boost reported
profit in future periods. Cash flow, however, fell in the
latest quarter to $43 million from $53 million a year
earlier.
   The only operation to show a higher profit was the
utility, which earnings rose 7.4% to $58 million in the
latest quarter from $54 million a year earlier.
   In the first half, the net loss totaled $161 million, or
$2.44 a share, compared with net income of $120 million, or
$1.80 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 2.9% to
$3.51 billion from $3.41 billion.
   The latest results underscored the continuing questions
about Pacific Enterprises, analysts said, as to whether --
and when -- the company can make its diversification efforts
pay off.
   Prudential-Bache's Mr. Fleischer sees at least one hopeful
sign. Pacific Enterprises has halted the series of retail and
oil acquisitions that added to its woes. "It seems that
they're going to stop digging a deeper hole and deal with the
hole they're in," he said.

   American Air Plans 10% Fare Increase;
   Other Big Carriers Likely to Follow Suit
   ----

<LP>
   American Airlines announced a 10% fare increase, as
expected, making it likely that more major carriers will
boost ticket prices.
   The carrier, a unit of AMR Corp., cited higher jet fuel
prices, which have risen about 20% since July, much of that
coming in the wake of the Iraq crisis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Shortly after American's move, Midway Airlines, typically
one of the last carriers to accept a fare rise, said it also
will raise fares 10% starting tomorrow. America West Airlines
said it would do the same, and Southwest Airlines said it
will raise fares slightly. Delta Air Lines, which is also
slow to match increases, said ticket price increases are
"likely."
   Despite American's move, it will take the participation of
Delta, along with other major carriers such as UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines unit and USAir Group for the planned increase
to take effect. Airlines usually don't institute a fare rise
without all other carriers matching it.
   Although oil costs fell yesterday, industry analysts said
the carriers will probably still push through fare increases
since they've been paying higher jet fuel prices for a number
of days.
   A spokeswoman at American said the carrier is still going
ahead with its plans to raise domestic and Caribbean fares
10% tomorrow and to boost international fares Aug. 15. She
said it would take American at least a month to recover from
the additional fuel costs it has already seen.
   There appears to be an appetite for an industrywide fare
increase. "A lot of comptrollers, chief financial officers
and investor relations people at the airlines are
shell-shocked at the increases in fuel prices," said Timothy
Pettee, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
   Northwest Airlines, a unit of NWA Inc., said it will delay
until tomorrow an $8 one-way surcharge that it was planning
to implement today. Since no other carrier has matched the
surcharge, it's likely that Northwest will drop it and jump
on board with a 10% fare increase.
   The 10% fare rise was first proposed early this week by
Pan American World Airways, which initially planned for it to
take effect today. The Pan Am Corp. unit is postponing the
effective date until tomorrow, in order to stay in line with
American's action.
   Delta officials were apparently stunned earlier this week
when prices rose five cents a gallon in a single day.
Industry analysts say that a penny increase in aviation fuel
expenses costs the airline industry millions in additional
costs. Fuel costs usually account for at least 12% of an
airline's expenses.
   American said that every one-cent increase in the price of
jet fuel per gallon adds about $2 million a month to its
costs. American uses about 200 million gallons of jet fuel
monthly.
   According to one estimate, the industry faces an
additional $500 million in expenses because of the surge in
fuel costs. Analysts said that a 10% fare rise would probably
recover the incremental cost increases. They added, however,
that such a large increase probably wouldn't stick for the
rest of the year as traffic wanes and airlines resort to
discount promotions to attract fliers.
   In a statement, American said it "wants to be fair with
its customers and we are especially sorry to do this because
we know that higher fares will create hardships for many."
   In fact, the fare increases could backfire if airlines
drive away too many customers during an already sluggish
travel and tourism season.

   War fears? Increased chances of recession?
   These are the days that make Wall Street's short sellers
smile.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Short sellers make money on bad news. They borrow a stock
and immediately sell it, hoping the price will decline.
Eventually, they must buy shares to replace the ones they
borrowed. But if the stock drops enough in the meantime, they
profit.
   In the past three weeks, they have profited big -- but
mostly by luck. Iraq's tanks rolled at exactly the right time
for many short sellers, who had been increasing their
positions for other reasons.
   In mid-July, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had
been surging, ran into resistance as it approached the 3000
mark; it then fell back. Later in the month, government
reports showed increasing evidence of a sagging economy.
These developments caused many short sellers to fatten up
their positions.
   So, when Mideast hostilities broke out, they were in a
perfect position to benefit, even though they hadn't
anticipated Iraq's military move any more than other
investors did.
   "I don't want people to think I'm looking for a war," says
Kurt Feshbach, one of the three brothers in Palo Alto,
Calif., who make up the nation's largest team of professional
short sellers. "I don't want people to die. However, I
wouldn't mind some fireworks."
   Mr. Feshbach says his firm's managed accounts, entirely
devoted to short selling, were up about 29.5% through July.
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the accounts have jumped an
additional 11.5 percentage points, bringing the year-to-date
gain to 41%. (By contrast, the DJIA is down about 1% this
year.)
   Mr. Feshbach won't name the specific stocks he has shorted
(there are about 200), but says many of them are bank issues.
"We love our shorts in banks," he says. "We have some
high-tech shorts, but not big names. Some biotech. A couple
of insurance stocks {insurers with large real estate
holdings}. And a couple of takeover plays."
   Michael Murphy, a San Francisco money manager who runs a
$40 million portfolio, almost all of it on the short side,
says he's shorting full blast. His main accounts are 100%
short, rather than carrying a 20% to 30% cash position as
they normally do. This is "not because of Iraq," he says, but
because of "fundamental problems in the economy." He predicts
the Dow industrials will fall below 2250 by March.
   Mr. Murphy's shorts are mainly in defense stocks, casinos,
savings and loans, banks and airlines. In recent days, he has
partially covered (bought back borrowed shares in) some of
his positions in airlines such as AMR Corp. and Delta Air
Lines Inc., and banks such as Bank of Boston Corp.
   But Mr. Murphy is keeping a full short position in
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. and in various casino
stocks. And he has actually increased his short position in
defense stocks.
   The bounce up in defense stocks on news of Mideast
hostilities is "just silly," he claims. He thinks Congress
will proceed with major defense spending cuts.
   So far this year, Mr. Murphy says his short-selling
accounts are up 22%; they were up about 10% at the end of
June.
   James Chanos, whose New York firm Kynikos Associates is
among the nation's largest short sellers, says he is shorting
"companies in the hotel business, a variety of New York large
commercial banks, companies in the airline and airplane
businesses, and companies that sell Nintendo cartridges." An
investor in the firm says that accounts were up 27% through
the end of July, and about 34% through Tuesday.
   Mark Howard, co-owner of JRO Associates, a New York
investment partnership, both sells short and buys stocks
conventionally. At the moment, he says, he is about 60% on
the short side.
   One of Mr. Howard's biggest positions is in Japanese put
warrants -- securities that rise in value if the Tokyo stock
market falls. "This situation in Iraq . . . is a much bigger
negative for Japan than it is for us," he says. "They are
completely dependent on imported oil, and a decent part of it
came from Iraq."
   If the Iraqi invasion hadn't happened, "our markets would
have been going down anyway," Mr. Howard says. "This just
speeded up the process. Recession is sort of becoming obvious
to everybody."
   In the last few days, Mr. Howard covered his short
positions in such big stocks as American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., Dow Chemical Co., Compaq Computer Corp. and
Digital Equipment Corp. He still has short positions in
Genetics Institute Inc., L.A. Gear Inc. and Newbridge
Networks Corp., among others.
   Neil Dolinsky, a principal with C.C. Dunnavan &amp; Co. in
Minneapolis, runs a short portfolio of about 100 stocks. Last
week, he added to his positions in 28 of them.
   Unlike Mr. Murphy, he covered his positions in most
defense stocks, including Lockheed Corp., Raytheon Co.,
General Dynamics Corp., Loral Corp. and Martin Marietta
Corp., when hostilities broke out. However, he held his
positions in McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Northrop Corp.,
citing their debt loads and the possibility that Northrop
might be barred from military contracting.
   John Brooks, an analyst with Davis, Mendel &amp; Regenstein
Inc. in Atlanta, does short-selling for his own account and
also advises clients on short-selling. He says that it might
soon be time to short-sell oil stocks, which have skyrocketed
on the Mideast news.
   "These oils have just gone nuts on the upside," he says.
Although oil futures were trading yesterday at about $26.50 a
barrel, Mr. Brooks thinks that's just a panic reaction. "My
guess is somewhere between $20 and $21 is a more realistic
level," he says.
   Robert Doviak, who runs a Dallas investment partnership,
Doviak Partners, says he is about "75% short" at the moment.
"I think we're going to have a 100-point rally in the Dow the
next week or so," he says. Then he plans to use borrowed
money to "go more than 100% short."
   He expects "a series of mini-crashes" in which the Dow
industrials slide 50 to 150 points at a crack. Investors, he
says, have gotten the idea from the 1987 crash and 1989
mini-crash that it's smart to buy when the market is down.
"When everybody figures this is a sure formula to make money,
the formula breaks."

   The Bush administration's efforts to head off the damaging
economic effects of an oil shortage began to show success, as
crude oil prices fell as much as $3 a barrel. But serious
questions remain about where prices will settle.
   While Saudi Arabia and some other oil-exporting nations
are prepared to increase production to offset any shortages
caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, it will be several weeks
before they can get up to full speed. Even then, world oil
production may fall short of pre-crisis levels by as much as
a million barrels a day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, the administration continues to drag its heels
on a key decision to help make up the oil shortage by pumping
oil out of its strategic reserves. Oil experts say use of the
reserves would go a long way toward keeping oil prices below
$25 a barrel and cushioning the effect on the U.S. economy.
   So far, the administration can claim surprising success in
its strategy to head off the damaging effects of high oil
prices. It has apparently won an agreement from Saudi Arabia
to produce an additional two million barrels of oil a day,
and an agreement from Venezuela to produce an additional
500,000 barrels a day. Mexico also announced plans to chip in
an additional 100,000 barrels temporarily, and other
oil-producing nations are expected to bring the total
additional production to about 3.5 million barrels a day.
   That's still short, however, of the four million to 4.5
million barrels a day that was being supplied to the world by
Iraq and Kuwait. And in the volatile oil markets, which are
driven by psychology as much as substance, a shortage of
500,000 to a million barrels a day in a
53-million-barrel-a-day business can be critical in driving
prices higher.
   As a result, the Bush administration's decision on whether
to use its reserves could hold the key to whether prices
continue to move down, or head up again.
   President Bush said the White House would "explore"
whether to use its reserves to help make up the shortfall.
Inside the administration, however, the issue is still
causing deep divisions. The Department of Energy is pushing
for use of the reserves, and would like a presidential
decision by the end of the week. But Budget Director Richard
Darman and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu are
resisting that move, fearing it involves unnecessary
manipulation of the market place.
   The U.S. is scheduled to discuss the use of strategic
petroleum reserves with its allies at a meeting in Paris
tomorrow. In an interview last night, James Watkins, the U.S.
energy secretary, said his department could get oil flowing
out of the 590 million-barrel reserve in two weeks and that
it could "quite possibly" draw down enough to meet U.S.
energy needs and to share with countries that don't have
government inventories.
   Mr. Watkins also suggested that, although oil prices have
been oscillating, since 1988 they've averaged a nominal $18 a
barrel. Because of this, he said, he would "feel better about
prices anything below $22 and down to $18. Close to $18 to
$20 is the way it should be."
   While the White House debated the use of strategic
reserves internally, a few oil producing nations quietly
began to boost output. None of the countries involved,
however, would talk about their actions or what promises they
made the Bush administration.
   "This is an extremely sensitive political matter," said an
oil official with one of the Persian Gulf producers.
   Saudi petroleum ministry officials reached in Jeddah
declined to comment about either their production levels or
their plans. But people familiar with Saudi developments said
the kingdom is preparing to advance its output by up to the
two million barrels a day the Bush administration had sought.
   It is understood that Saudi officials assume that their
maximum sustainable capacity is about 7.5 million barrels a
day, though that hasn't been tested in some time. The kingdom
recently has been producing 5.4 million barrels a day.
Getting to full capacity would take the Saudis a minimum of a
few weeks, people knowledgeable about the country's oil
operation said.
   Venezuela also is believed to have begun increasing its
oil production even before it advised the U.S. it could
supply more oil. In all, Venezuela is expected to be able to
raise output some 600,000 barrels a day, although Venezuelan
officials were cautious in their comments. President Carlos
Andres Perez said only that production could be increased
400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day if necessary. But he said
this would have to be part of a "collective agreement" by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Nigeria also said it is willing to increase oil production
200,000 barrels a day if other OPEC members agreed. "I
believe that it is unfair for Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
alone to take up whatever shortfall has been created by the
tension in the Persian Gulf," Jubril Aminu, Nigeria's oil
minister, said.
   Iran said it could supply some 500,000 barrels a day more
to world oil markets. Some oil experts question that, but the
issue remained academic. Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil
minister, called for OPEC members to continue to restrict
output to their quotas for the time being.
   Similar advice came from the United Arab Emirates, which
formerly was notorious in OPEC for ignoring its quota. But
Japanese buyers, hurt by the boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti
crudes, apparently are being told that they can expect more
UAE crude coming their way. It's generally assumed the UAE
will increase output 500,000 barrels a day.
   A further 200,000 barrels or so could be produced as
additional oil by other OPEC members. That would provide a
total of around 3.5 million barrels a day.
   While this wouldn't be enough production to offset all the
oil cut off from Iraq and Kuwait, it would cushion the impact
on world oil markets. Also, the three OPEC producers of Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and Iran have huge inventories of oil in
storage or in tankers at sea -- 50 million barrels, by some
estimates -- that could be immediately sold into the market.
"Indeed, the two big components of oil on the water (stored
oil) are Saudi Arabian and Iranian," said Roy Mason,
publisher of Oil Afloat.
   Meanwhile, White House foot-dragging on whether to use the
strategic petroleum reserve has begun to draw criticism from
some outside experts. "The trick to get the benefit of the
strategic petroleum reserve is to use it early," says William
Hogan, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government.
"There's a danger we will procrastinate because we aren't
sure what to do."
   Members of Congress are pressing as well. The
administration has made "a major strategic mistake" by not
using the reserve sooner, Rep. Thomas McMillen (D.,Md.) said
at a hearing this week. And Rep. Mary Rose Oakar asked:
"Couldn't the strategic petroleum reserve be used somewhat
like the Federal Reserve uses its monetary powers in
financial markets to provide economic stability to petroleum
markets? Why isn't this being done?"
   One White House aide argued, however, that movements in
oil prices over the past week weren't enough of a disruption
to justify use of the reserves. "I would define a disruption
in geopolitical terms if the Iraqis invade the Saudi oil
fields," the aide said. "But in current market conditions, I
don't think the price has moved enough."
   John Easton, assistant secretary of energy for
international affairs, will discuss the use of oil reserves
with U.S. allies today at a meeting of the International
Energy Agency in Paris. Administration officials have said
the U.S. will use its reserves only if its allies agree to do
the same.
   Some analysts say that if the president decides to draw
down, say, a million barrels a day, he could perhaps reduce
oil prices to the low $20-a-barrel range, and consequently
help hold down gasoline and other energy costs.
   "The psychology of the market would really calm down if
that's done," says Joseph Stanislaw of Cambridge Energy
Associates, who predicts oil prices could then remain at
around $25 a barrel until the crisis is resolved.
   "Prices aren't going to go back to $20," says Antonio
Szabo of Bonner &amp; Moore, a Houston consulting firm. "But they
may be more like $22 to $24, if all these things happen."
Analysts quickly add, however, that oil prices will skyrocket
if the Iraqi military attacks Saudi Arabian production
facilities in the next few days.
   Yesterday's declines left oil prices still $10 above the
year's lows. In heavy trading yesterday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the futures price of crude oil for
September delivery fell $2.35 a barrel to $25.96. Futures
prices of the North Sea's Brent crude was down as much as
$2.80 a barrel on the London-based International Petroleum
Exchange.
   Even so, the volume of crude oil flowing into world
markets is beginning to decline rapidly as the global
sanctions against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil take their toll.
According to a leading monitor of its output, OPEC production
was down two million barrels a day in the first week of
August from late July's 23 million barrels a day. Another two
million-barrel drop is expected for the second week.
   Meanwhile, after waffling through several days of
agonizing consultations among its oil ministers, OPEC itself
backed off from any coordinated response to the reduced
exports. Nor would it endorse any breaking of the July
production agreement that had been designed to shrink oil
supplies rather than increase them.
   "Fears expressed regarding possible disruptions in oil
supply in the short term are rather a result of psychological
and speculative factors than of real market fundamentals,"
said Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and OPEC's
president, after one member pressed for an emergency meeting
on output limits.
   But sooner or later, OPEC experts said, the exporters'
organization will have to address the supply issue as a
group. "Otherwise, it will be faced with unilateral actions"
by those member countries that can produce more, said Bahman
Karbassioun, a former OPEC official and Vienna-based
consultant.

   Dollar, Yen Climb as Standoff Continues
   In Mideast but Oil-Supply Threat Lessens

   NEW YORK -- The U.S. dollar and yen climbed against
European currencies as the standoff in the Persian Gulf
continued, but a crimp in world oil supplies grew less
likely.
   Comments by President Bush during the early New York
trading session that U.S. military forces had been deployed
to Saudi Arabia only for defensive purposes and not to oust
Iraq from Kuwait kept dollar buying from dominating the
foreign exchange market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But with little chance of a quick resolution to the
crisis, few bold dollar-sellers emerged. The dollar wavered
above and below 1.5900 marks throughout global trading and
ended in New York at 1.5925 marks, up from 1.5875 marks late
Tuesday. The U.S. unit was unchanged at 1.3385 Swiss francs.
   The yen, which had been the weakest major currency since
Iraq's invasion, gained from profit-taking sparked by an
unsubstantiated rumor in the Asian market that the Bank of
Japan was about to raise the discount interest rate. The
yen's appreciation, especially against the mark, encouraged
stop-loss yen buying when European and North American banks
opened.
   Abigail Cook, a New York vice president for corporate
foreign exchange with Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., said
that technical demand for yen had accumulated since last
Thursday as the Japanese unit declined with hardly a pause.
   Improving attitudes toward the yen were a 3% rebound in
Tokyo stock prices and Iran's announcement it would supply
Japan with 550,000 barrels of oil a day to help make up for
lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti production. Venezuela also said it
could increase its output by as much as 500,000 barrels of
oil a day.
   Late Tuesday, U.S. officials had said Saudi Arabia agreed
to increase its own massive oil production. The Saudis didn't
pledge a specific amount, but the U.S. had been seeking an
additional two million barrels a day, half the normal output
of Iraq and Kuwait.
   The improved world supply picture, combined with
profit-taking, pushed crude oil prices lower yesterday. The
September contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell
$2.35 a barrel to $25.96 a barrel.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted
about a yen lower at 149.80 yen, compared with 150.95 yen
late Tuesday. The mark and Swiss franc fell to 94.15 yen and
112.03 yen, respectively, from 95.06 yen and 112.86 yen late
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 149.65 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
150 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5935 marks; in Tokyo Wednesday, it closed at 1.5848 marks.
   "The yen has been like a pingpong ball in a hurricane,"
said Jerry Egan, chief dealer for Bank of Boston.
   Sterling sank to 280.15 yen from 282.41 yen previously.
Late in New York, the pound was also trading at $1.8696, down
from $1.8720 late Tuesday. The British currency, however,
climbed to 2.9753 marks from 2.9710 marks late Tuesday.
   Dollar trading remained agitated and headline driven. A
"deep dichotomy" between dollar-bearish U.S. economic
weakness and dollar-bullish Mideast posturing is "tearing at
the market," Mr. Egan said.
   "The most important thing for the people in the pits is to
not try to explain movements, but to be ready to quote a
price that's not going to lose you money," Mr. Egan said.
"This is one of the most difficult markets I've seen."
   Noted Ms. Cook of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai, "a lot a people are
tuckered out. They just don't have the stamina to keep these
{long-dollar} positions. People are getting really bitter
about holding positions."
   Ms. Cook explained that dealers want to keep enough
dollars to protect themselves from a new military clash, but
that whenever the situation seems to calm down, "you see some
of the big boys trying squeeze out those long-dollar
positions so they can buy dollars cheaper."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $383.20, down $1.30. Estimated volume was
a heavy five million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$381.75 an ounce.

   LONDON -- Increasing tensions in the Persian Gulf sharply
boosted shipping insurance rates for the second time since
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Lloyd's of London, a British insurance market, led
world-wide price increases that have boosted some marine and
energy insurance coverage twentyfold since the invasion.
Lloyd's also reduced the time during which it will cover
ships on a standard policy -- which also boosts insurance
costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There has been little new demand for insurance for ships
calling at Persian Gulf ports since hostilities broke out,
London brokers say. This appears to stem more from the risks
of attack than from rising costs. Nevertheless, a material
increase in the cost of insurance will surely be cited by oil
companies as a reason for higher gasoline prices.
   As tensions escalated, Lloyd's said its underwriters began
charging an additional war-risk premium of 0.25% of the
insured value of ships entering Persian Gulf waters. That
price is 10 times the previous rate, set after the invasion.
Moreover, Lloyd's brokers will charge the rate for a
seven-day period, compared with a 14-day period previously.
   The new rate means owners of a ship valued at $20 million,
a typical value for a supertanker, will pay an additional
$50,000 for Persian Gulf coverage. Shipowners previously were
paying about $10,000 for a full year's coverage.
   For ships going to Kuwait, Iraq and northern ports in
Saudi Arabia, Lloyd's underwriters are charging 1% of the
insured value, up from 0.5%. Cargo rates also are rising.

   Bush Seeks a Cut in Deficit

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush said it's still "absolutely
essential" to get an agreement with Congress to reduce the
federal deficit even in the face of a slowing U.S. economy.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, meanwhile, said budget
negotiators "ought to pick up the pace" and urged that the
deficit be reduced while the economy is still growing,
however slowly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In remarks to the National Press Club, Mr. Brady said he
doesn't think the U.S. is slipping into a recession, but he
reiterated his view that the economy isn't growing as rapidly
as the administration wants.
   Because of the deteriorating economy and the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, congressional budget negotiators already
are rethinking their original goal of reducing the projected
deficit for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, by $50 billion.
The talks are to resume after Labor Day.
   Mr. Bush, in a news conference called to discuss the
Middle East, declined to criticize congressional Democrats,
but he signaled that he may do so soon. "Stay tuned," he
said. Before the budget talks were suspended for the August
congressional recess, Mr. Bush told top Democrats that he was
abrogating their agreement to avoid partisan criticism. So
far, he hasn't said anything in public.
   Mr. Brady, referring to a possible securities-transfer tax
as "one of the 80 possibilities looked at by the
administration and Congress," said that "nobody's proposed
it."

   NEW YORK -- Setting aside its concerns about the turmoil
in the Middle East, the stock market advanced for the first
time this month as investors went looking for bargains.
   But the worries about recession that have intensified
since Iraq invaded Kuwait and oil prices soared continued to
hold sway over the market. Shares of companies expected to
deliver better earnings in any economic climate paced the
market's reversal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a six-session
losing streak by gaining 24.26, or 0.9%, to 2734.90. The
average had fallen a total of 7.1% during its string of
setbacks, with most of the loss following the invasion.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
climbed 3.52 to 338.35, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index gained 1.95 to 185.40 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index gained 3.48 to 313.56. Advancing issued totaled 1,015,
compared with about 601 decliners.
   Although trading remained active, Big Board volume failed
to surpass 200 million shares for the first time since the
invasion. Volume reached 190,400,000 shares, compared with
231,580,000 Tuesday.
   Analysts said the U.S. decision to send troops to Saudi
Arabia -- in what President Bush and administration officials
described as purely a defensive role -- eased the market's
fears that the Middle East crisis would worsen.
   "Bush gained a lot of respect, and I think he's got a lot
of people rooting for him now," said William M. LeFevre, a
market strategist at Advest Inc., Hartford, Conn. "Investors
are convinced that the problem has been contained."
   Share prices rose throughout the morning and peaked at
midday as investors digested the statements from Bush, along
with statements from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein saying he
would seek "full unity" of Iraq and Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, the rise in oil prices collapsed after the
Saudis said they would increase their oil production to
offset losses resulting from the international boycott of oil
from Iraq and Kuwait. Crude-oil futures fell sharply in New
York trading, with September contracts on West Texas
Intermediate losing $2.35 a barrel to $25.96.
   The Dow Jones Transportation Average rose 26.64 to 991.42,
its first gain since July 26. A rebound in UAL, whose stock
had fallen 38% since the average last recorded a gain,
accounted for most of the latest move.
   The plunge in oil prices took its toll on energy stocks.
Exxon fell 1 5/8 to 51 3/4 on trading of two million shares,
Texaco dropped 1 7/8 to 62 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and
Chevron went down 1 3/4 to 76 7/8; those losses depressed the
industrial average by about 10 1/2 points.
   In response to the Saudis' promise to boost oil
production, Dean Witter Reynolds recommended that investors
cut their cash levels in half, to 10% from 20%. The firm
boosted its recommended stock and bond allocations by five
percentage points each, to 70% and 20%, respectively.
   John D. Connolly, chairman of the firm's investment
committee, said the recommended cash position had been raised
from zero to 20% immediately after the Iraqi invasion. As a
result of the Saudi decision, "The dire outlooks about
recession will have to be rethought," Mr. Connolly said.
   Investors snapped up consumer stocks with a track record
of earnings improvement, along with other growth stocks.
   Philip Morris added 3/8 to 45 5/8 on three million shares,
Coca-Cola gained 1 5/8 to 44 and Procter &amp; Gamble jumped 2
3/4 to 80.
   Boeing rallied 1 to 53 on two million shares and Waste
Management rose 1 1/2 to 39 1/8 on 1.5 million shares.
   SmithKline Beecham equity units rose 3 1/2 to 46 7/8,
pacing an across-the-board rally among drug stocks, as 1.3
million issues were traded. The British-based company
reported a 6% increase in second-quarter pretax profit from a
year earlier.
   Alza climbed 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 on the American Stock
Exchange. The Food and Drug Administration granted marketing
approval to a treatment for chronic pain which uses Alza's
drug-delivery system to administer a drug produced by a unit
of Johnson &amp; Johnson.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson rose 1 7/8 to 67 1/8. Among other major
pharmaceutical issues, Merck rose 2 1/8 to 85 1/8,
Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 1 3/8 to 61 1/2, Schering-Plough
gained 1 1/4 to 46 1/2, American Home Products went up 2 1/8
to 47 7/8 and Eli Lilly added 2 5/8 to 78 3/8 on 1.5 million
shares.
   UAL jumped 13 1/2 to 114 1/2, breaking a seven-session
losing streak in which the stock plunged a total of 62
points. American Banker reported that the union-led group
seeking to acquire United Air Lines' parent company in a
$4.38 billion buy-out will ask the UAL board for another 30
to 90 days to obtain financing.
   Woolworth, which posted a 4.2% increase in second-quarter
earnings, advanced 1 1/2 to 28 7/8. Other retailing issues to
post sharp gains included Wal-Mart Stores, which went up 1
5/8 to 30 1/4 on 2.3 million shares; Toys "R" Us, up 1 1/2 to
28 1/2; Gap Inc., up 2 3/4 to 53 3/4; and U.S. Shoe, up 1 to
15 1/2.
   MCA gained 1 1/2 to 47 and CBS climbed 6 3/4 to 176 after
Morgan Stanley cited the two companies as potential takeover
targets for Walt Disney. Analyst Alan Kassan said in a report
to the firm's sales force that he thinks Disney is
considering a major acquisition, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report. Both Disney and MCA declined
comment.
   Other media and entertainment stocks also rallied,
including Disney, which rose 4 5/8 to 108. Eastman Kodak rose
1 1/8 to 41 1/8 on 1.5 million shares, Paramount
Communications went up 7/8 to 37 1/4, Time Warner rose 1 to
85 3/4 and Mattel added 1 3/8 to 17 7/8.
   Ethyl rose 1 5/8 to 30. The company told analysts that
General Motors endorsed its new gasoline additive in a letter
delivered to the Environmental Protection Agency, according
to the investor report. The EPA is expected to decide by Nov.
5 whether to approve the additive, designed to cut auto
emissions.
   Pep Boys Manny, Moe &amp; Jack added 3/4 to 13 3/4. Standard &amp;
Poor's is adding the issue to the S&amp;P 500 after Monday's
close to replace General Instrument, the target of a buy-out
by Forstmann, Little &amp; Co.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.19
to 340.03. Volume totaled 15,020,000 shares.

   FRANKFURT -- West German retail sales were up a real, or
price-adjusted, 2.7% in June from a year earlier, and rose
3.8% on a nominal, or unadjusted, basis, the government's
statistics office said.
   The data marked a modest slowing from the rates in May,
when retail sales climbed a real 8.9% and a nominal 10.9%
from a year earlier. May's nominal rise was the first
double-digit increase in that category since March 1988, when
sales climbed 13% in nominal terms and 7% in real terms.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Saudi Arabia expect that Arab
soldiers eventually will join the U.S. and British forces
sent to the Saudi kingdom, but that won't be certain until
after a meeting today in Cairo.
   Separately, the Bush administration also disclosed it is
reaching out to Syria and Iran, two longtime Washington
adversaries, to seek their help in pressuring Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait. And Secretary of State James Baker said
the administration has held "extended discussions" with
Yemen, Saudi Arabia's southern neighbor, which has appeared
sympathetic to Iraq since the invasion. The Yemeni Embassy in
Washington, though, denied intelligence reports that it has
allowed the deployment of Iraqi aircraft to its airfields.

   The addition of Arab soldiers to the arriving U.S. and
British forces is deeply important to Saudi Arabia. Unless
such troops are added, the Saudi ruling family will be
vulnerable to charges in the Arab world that it is being
controlled by Western powers in Saudi Arabia's confrontation
with Iraq.
   But even if such troops arrive, the Saudi ruling family
has taken a huge longterm risk by turning to the West for
protection. Though U.S. forces may have been essential to
offset any immediate Iraqi threat, their presence also likely
will sow the seeds for long-term agitation by other Arabs,
who will use the deployment to paint the Saudi rulers as
Western puppets.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would like to provide the
Saudis with political cover by sending his own soldiers to
Saudi Arabia. But Mr. Mubarak wants Egypt's own deployment to
be blessed by the rest of the Arab world so that he, too, can
avoid charges that he is operating as a U.S. agent.
   So Mr. Mubarak has called an emergency meeting of Arab
leaders in the Egyptian capital where, diplomatic sources
say, he hopes to push through a resolution blessing the
creation of a multinational Arab force. The force would be
charged with acting as a buffer between Saudi Arabia and
Iraqi forces occupying neighboring Kuwait. Saudi leaders hope
that troops from Morocco and perhaps a few other nations will
join the force.
   And some Arab diplomats here said that even if the summit
doesn't pass such a resolution, Mr. Mubarak may use the
failure to act as an excuse for sending forces anyway.
   President Bush, at a news conference held after he
announced the dispatch of U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia,
sounded confident that Arab troops would follow.
   Mr. Bush said the Saudis hadn't told the U.S. for certain
that there would be Arab troops, "but it would not be at all
surprising if there was an Arab component in that force, not
at all." Technically, there probably already are a few other
Arab soldiers in Saudi Arabia from nations in the Gulf
Cooperation Council, a Persian Gulf military alliance the
Saudis belong to, but they would be a small contingent in the
kingdom on routine business.
   Egyptian officials assume that Iraq's Hussein will boycott
the meeting, diplomats here said. And they think that Syria,
though it often attacks U.S. intervention in the Middle East,
will go along with a multinational Arab force because it is
an enemy of Iraq. Syria, in fact, originated the idea of
holding a meeting now.
   Though worried about the delay in formation of a force of
Egyptian and other soldiers, U.S. officials remained
optimistic that one will fall into place in the next few
days. Senior Pentagon officials say that -- in a visit this
week with Defense Secretary Richard Cheney -- Mr. Mubarak
indicated that once the U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia he
would move fairly quickly to ship some Egyptian forces into
Saudi Arabia.
   "It wasn't a firm pledge to have so many thousand troops
in place by a given day," one official said, but rather a
"general meeting of the minds about the need to have an Arab
force" helping to protect Saudi Arabia.
   Mr. Mubarak also agreed that if the military situation
warrants, he will agree to have U.S. planes and troops based
in Egypt. No specific numbers were discussed, but thousands
of troops may be involved if a shooting war breaks out. The
U.S. always has coveted access to an Egyptian military
facility at Ras Banas on the Red Sea, near Saudi Arabia.
   Morocco's King Hassan appeared less supportive of the idea
of sending in troops, officials said, although he too
indicated a willingness to participate in some Arab force.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State Baker disclosed that the
U.S. is making overtures to Syria, as well as sending feelers
to Iran, as part of its campaign to pressure Iraq. Mr. Baker,
speaking to reporters accompanying him on a trip to Turkey to
consult about the Persian Gulf crisis, said Assistant
Secretary of State John Kelly will be sent to Damascus for
talks with Syrian leaders and then will go to Saudi Arabia.
And he said that Iran has been contacted through third
nations.
   The long-term political problems for Saudi Arabia
unleashed by this crisis may be just as hard to deal with as
the short-term military worries. Saudi leaders were left with
a choice of facing Iraqi troops alone or enduring criticism
from other Arabs for turning to the U.S.
   U.S. analysts long have believed that the Saudi royal
family is vulnerable to attacks from Shiite Moslems critical
of both its wealth and its ties to the West. Now U.S.
analysts have begun to believe the move could unleash
long-term political attacks on the Saudis. "They've signed
their death warrant," says one knowledgeable U.S. source with
intelligence expertise.
   Others think Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has so changed Arab
politics that this is unfounded. "The Arab order as they've
known it and as we've known it has changed dramatically,"
says Judith Kipper, a Middle East analyst at the Brookings
Institution. "Nothing applies any more. All the old rules are
out the window."
   A key indicator, some analysts suggest, is whether Mr.
Mubarak will succeed in sending troops alongside U.S. forces
without stirring up the anti-U.S. internal forces he also
fights to control. "The key here is Egypt," says Geoffrey
Kemp, a former National Security Council staff specialist on
the Middle East who now is at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. "If Egypt holds together and Mubarak
shows some spine -- as he has done so far -- and contains his
own radicalism, I think the Saudis will get through it."
   In an attempt to ease Saudi and Egyptian political
worries, the Bush administration has emphasized to Arab
leaders that it is seeking only temporary access to bases,
airfields and ports to cope with the current crisis. "We've
tried to reassure them that these are extraordinary steps to
cope with an extraordinary situation," said one official.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. hopes to complete a bilateral
free-trade agreement with Mexico by December 1992, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills said.
   At the White House, President Bush said he would notify
Congress in September of the two governments' intention to
negotiate such an agreement. Under U.S. law, Congress first
must authorize these negotiations, which are likely to get
under way in June 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari indicated earlier this year that they intended to
negotiate such an agreement to forge tighter economic links
between their two countries.
   Ambassador Hills told reporters that the proposed
agreement would cover trade in goods and services,
investments, and protection of intellectual property rights
of companies doing business in both countries. The agreement
won't cover immigration issues.
   Mrs. Hills and the Mexican commerce minister, Jaime Serra
Puche, submitted a joint report to their presidents,
recommending that the two countries undertake formal
negotiation of a bilateral free-trade accord.

   With reference to your June 25 article "Smoking Curbs Get
a New Lift From EPA Plan," I can only ask why the government
did not begin smoking restrictions back in 1964, when the
first surgeon general's warning on smoking was issued.
   Tobacco is the only drug that has absolutely no good uses,
especially when used as intended. Yet, the tobacco industry
(death merchants) and many smokers continue to fabricate
excuses to allow this travesty to continue, rather than to
work to find ways to solve the multitude of problems created
by tobacco consumption.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When I hear of the tobacco states creating legislation to
actually promote smoking, rather than to attempt to curb it,
I can only say that the responsible politicians are not
exercising the prime objective of the government: to protect
the people.
   A lot of people in this country need to wake up. While we
claim to be fighting a "war on drugs," the tobacco industry
continues to commit homicide at the rate of 400,000 Americans
each year. We must do everything we can to stop them.

   President Bush's rhetoric is low-key, but his actions
these past few days can be seen as a systematic preparation
for dispatching the Iraqi aggressor and setting up permanent
protections for the world's oil sources around the Persian
Gulf.
   First the President rallied worldwide economic sanctions,
primarily a boycott of Iraqi oil and a freezing of Iraqi
assets. He moved from there to gain U.N. support for a
military blockade of Iraqi ports. He obtained Saudi Arabia's
acquiescence for the dispatch of U.S. forces to that country,
something the Saudis had never before been willing to allow.
Then he began moving air, naval and ground forces to the
region. Yesterday, he went on TV to give a calm explanation
of all this to the American people and the world. Tomorrow,
Secretary of State James Baker will visit U.S. NATO allies in
Europe to plot further strategy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   NATO cooperation is already unfolding. Britain offered air
and naval forces yesterday after a cabinet meeting. West
German law prohibits out-of-country use of German forces, but
Bonn yesterday said the U.S. could use German bases for
supporting the Gulf action. Italy, a country that has far
stronger naval forces than most people know, seems likely to
have a part in the deployments, though it has made no
specific commitments. Turkey, a NATO member, has been visited
by U.S. F-111s that are technically on an "exercise" but also
happen to be within easy striking distance of Iraq. Even the
Saudi air force, equipped with the best planes oil money
could buy, is not nothing.
   "I have told our brothers in Iraq, I am afraid that Iraq
will be struck by a harsh strike from the outside. Don't
think that the fleets are just going to sit there sleeping,"
Egyptian Presidnet Hosni Mubarak said in an address
yesterday. This warning to Saddam Hussein should not be
overlooked even though President Mubarak denied reports from
Washington that he has committed Egyptian forces to the Bush
deployments. He would prefer an all-Arab force, but surely
must know it is too late for that. Having watched his boss
Abdel Nasser overreach himself against Israel 23 years ago,
Mr. Mubarak wants an immediate Arab summit to try to talk
Hussein out of his madness.
   For once deployments are in place, with or without
Egyptian troops, Saddam Hussein will face a multinational
force with enormous destructive power. Constructing an
overwhelming force would take several weeks, but by then it
would guarantee, if necessary, a short and decisive conquest
of Iraq. Saddam's missile batteries could be taken out, and
his air force destroyed. With no air cover in a desert
region, his tanks and armored personnel carriers would be a
shooting gallery for allied pilots. Meanwhile, his arms sit
in the hot desert sun, waiting.
   If Saddam launches a pre-emptive strike of his own, that
will make things messier, but will have little bearing on the
final outcome. The other thing would be capitulation, but the
capitulation probably would have to be total, most likely
including disarmament and the installation of a new, moderate
leadership in Iraq. This, and not some mushy compromise, is
certainly the appropriate object of the efforts now being
expended by President Bush and the whole NATO alliance.
   The task, however, would not end with Saddam Hussein. The
allied forces will be in position to take steps to ensure
that there are no further crises of this type in the Persian
Gulf. That will entail a permanent force of some power in the
region.
   It would also mean that all Mideast governments will be
held to higher standards of behavior than has been the case
in the past. Syria, which allows radicals to play hostage
games with the West on territory that is nominally under its
control, will want to reconsider its position. Iran's
Rafsanjani will have a new reason to press for a
rapprochement with the West. Libya's Gadhafi will find
himself very lonely. Little King Hussein of Jordan, who
decided at the wrong time to hold Saddam Hussein's coat, has
some rapid calculating to do.
   The boldness of Mr. Bush and the West means, in short,
that the world changed suddenly a few months ago and Arab
dictators missed the signal. Their big friend, the Soviet
Union, lost a Cold War and suddenly has become desperate for
Western economic aid. It can no longer offer much help to its
Middle East "clients." Saddam blustered that, without the
Soviets, he would have a free hand. On present course, he now
is learning that just the opposite is true.
   A great opportunity has dropped into the laps of George
Bush and his NATO allies, in short, an opportunity to pacify
one of the world's most troublesome regions. The President is
approaching that opportunity in a systematic way. It seems
unlikely that he will let it slip through his fingers.

   Actors' Equity has read new meaning into the term the
Great White Way. This week it barred acclaimed English actor
Jonathan Pryce from re-creating on Broadway his role in the
London hit "Miss Saigon." Mr. Pryce is white and his
character is Eurasian. It follows, according to Actors'
Equity, that his appearance would be "an affront to the Asian
community." The producer has canceled the show, which by the
way has parts for 34 minorities, mostly Asians. We hadn't
realized that the people in theater, not to mention
Manhattan's economy, were so flush that they could kill plays
for such novel reasons.
   Black actor Denzel Washington opens off-Broadway next week
in Joseph Papp's production of "Richard III," the humpbacked
English king. Somehow, we doubt that Actors' Equity will
launch a protest against this casting or berate Mr. Papp for
not hiring the handicapped.

   Over-the-counter stocks regained some more ground as
investors took advantage of the OTC market's recent steep
losses to buy shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 5.65 to 407.73, a 1.4%
gain, compared with a 0.9% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Advancing stocks again outpaced decliners, 1,225 to
729, as volume eased to 144.8 million from 165.5 million
Tuesday.

   Virtually all sectors of the OTC market advanced. The
Nasdaq 100 index jumped 5.85 to 411.16, and smaller
technology, industrial and utility issues also continued
recovering some of their recent losses.
   Despite nervousness about developments in the Middle East,
investors stepped in to buy stocks that are much cheaper than
they were a week ago, said Ralph Costanza, head of OTC
trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham. "There are
opportunities in selected names," he said, adding that both
small and large investors were shopping among a broad array
of stocks.
   Michael Phillips, an OTC trader with Interstate-Johnson
Lane, Charlotte, N.C., said those traders who had sold
borrowed stock, in anticipation of price declines, began
buying shares to repay their loans late in the day.
   "About 3 p.m. {EDT}, people started to get a little
nervous about their short {positions}," Mr. Phillips said. He
added that traders kept a close watch on news from the Middle
East, but said that they seemed to be growing accustomed to
the crisis.
   Microsoft rebounded 2 1/4 to 63 1/2 amid positive comments
from analysts and a general advance among technology issues.
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst Scott H. Smith restored
the Redmond, Wash., software maker to the brokerage firm's
list of stocks recommended to buy, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Mr. Smith, who removed the stock from the list in May
because of its price, also upgraded his investment opinion on
Microsoft to "buy" from "moderately attractive," DJPIR said.
An assistant to Mr. Smith said the analyst expects the
company's new products and global marketing strategy will
contribute to a 30% growth rate in fiscal 1992 and 1993, even
if the U.S. economy enters a mild recession.
   First Boston analyst Charles R. Wolf also was said to have
raised his rating on Microsoft to "buy" from "hold."
   Among other technology stocks, Sun Microsystems rose 1 5/8
to 30 1/4; Conner Peripherals added 5/8 to 23 1/2; Novell
gained 2 1/4 to 45 7/8; Oracle Systems ascended 1 1/8 to 16;
Apple Computer climbed 5/8 to 40 1/8, and Adobe Systems
advanced 3/4 to 30.
   Other technology issues were mixed: Intel fell 3/4 to 37
1/8; Seagate Technology eased 1/8 to 11, and Software
Toolworks slid 1/8 to 11 3/8. The Nasdaq Industrial Index
rose 7.53 to 436.54.
   Earnings reports fueled rises in several stocks. Scitex
surged 3 3/8 to 37 after the Israeli computer-graphics
concern reported net income of $1.02 a share in the second
quarter from 40 cents a year earlier. The stock rebounded 2
3/8 Tuesday after falling sharply because of the Mideast
crisis.
   Integrated Waste Services rose 1 to 7 1/8 after the
waste-management concern reported that second-quarter net
income doubled to 10 cents a share.
   Candela Laser jumped 3 3/4 to 16 3/4 after the Wayland,
Mass., maker of medical lasers reported operating income for
the fourth quarter ended June 30 climbed to 24 cents a share
from nine cents a year earlier.
   Bullish comments also sparked a 5/8 jump in Medco
Containment Services to 24 1/8. Charles Mele, general counsel
of the Fair Lawn, N.J., provider of prescription drug
mail-service programs, tied the rise to comments by Merrill
Lynch analyst Richard Vietor, according to DJPIR. Mr. Vietor
repeated a "buy" opinion on the stock and called it the
brokerage firm's "Focus Stock of the Week."
   Good Guys rebounded 4 1/2 to 22, regaining most of the
ground the stock lost since last Wednesday, when it closed at
23. Analysts told DJPIR they weren't aware of any
developments at the Burlingame, Calif., specialty retailer to
explain the gain, but said Good Guys' sales appear to be
strong.
   Altera rose 3/4 to 11 1/2 after the San Jose, Calif.,
maker of integrated circuits said it plans to withdraw a
proposed offering of 2.5 million shares of its common stock
because of unfavorable market conditions.
   United Healthcare eased 3/4 to 16 5/8, despite reporting
Tuesday that net income rose to 32 cents a share in the
second quarter from 14 cents a year earlier. However, this
newspaper reported yesterday that United Healthcare's
chairman, Kenneth Simmons, recently sold all of his holdings
in the Minnetonka, Minn., health maintenance organization.
   Equity Oil fell 3/8 to 6 5/8 after the Salt Lake City oil
company reported a loss of 11 cents a share for the second
quarter, compared with net income of two cents a year
earlier. The company said the second-quarter loss was due to
a non-cash charge of $1.96 million from the abandonment of
two wells in Pecos County, Texas, and a non-cash charge to
leasehold abandonments of $336,000.

   New York City's
   Fish Market Called
   Corrupt by Official

   NEW YORK -- The court-appointed administrator overseeing
Manhattan's Fulton Fish Market, one of the largest seafood
markets in the world, said the operation remains rife with
violence and racketeering.
   The administrator, Frank H. Wohl, blamed New York City
authorities for much of the problem. Mr. Wohl, appointed by a
federal judge in 1988 in response to allegations by the U.S.
government that the market is dominated by organized crime,
accused the city of being afraid to enforce the law in the
market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Although the city of New York has ample authority to
regulate the Fulton Fish Market, that authority is almost
entirely unexercised," Mr. Wohl said in his midterm report to
federal Judge Thomas Griesa. "The city has abdicated many of
its municipal responsibilities in the market to whatever
forces choose to exercise control."
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan sued to take over
the fish market in 1987 because of racketeering allegations,
but Judge Griesa rejected that request. Instead, he appointed
the administrator, whose job is to investigate the market for
any signs of mob influence and to help enforce a court order
against racketeering and extortion by any of the private
companies that do business at the market.
   Mr. Wohl also has some rule-making powers. Frustrated with
the city, he said he soon will propose his own regulations to
discourage extortion by unloaders at the market. He also
asked federal prosecutors to pursue fraud charges against
certain wholesalers.
   "To a large extent the racketeering activity in the Fulton
Fish Market simply fills a void left by the absence of any
legitimate organizing authority in the market," Mr. Wohl said
in the report. "The result is a frontier atmosphere, in which
the prevailing attitude is that the Fulton Fish Market is a
sovereign entity where the laws of economic power and
physical force, not the laws of New York City, prevail."
   Mr. Wohl said the city is even afraid to enforce traffic
rules in the market, located near Manhattan's financial
district downtown. Instead, the workers make and enforce the
rules -- allegedly beating a motorist in the face a few weeks
ago with loading hooks, for instance, after a dispute. Mr.
Wohl said that even though the incident occurred on a street
crowded with market workers, no witnesses could be found when
police investigated.
   Mr. Wohl listed several areas in which the city has failed
to exercise its authority. Businesses in the market operate
without valid leases, licenses or permits as required by law,
he said.
   Mr. Wohl said in the report, "City officials have
expressed a concern that city employees wouldn't be safe
performing their functions in the market, and that
law-enforcement officers detailed to protect the city
employees would be subject to the corrupting influence of the
market."
   A spokesman for New York Mayor David Dinkins couldn't be
reached for comment.

   Keystone Camera Products Corp. said it boosted its
borrowing ability, helping the Clifton, N.J., company to hire
270 additional employees to handle a $3.5 million backlog of
Christmas orders.
   The Congress Financial Corp. unit of CoreStates Financial
Corp., a Philadelphia-based bank holding company, agreed to
allow Keystone to borrow as much as an additional $600,000 on
a short-term basis. The funds, with additional credit and the
proceeds of Keystone's sale of its interest in a lease, will
permit the company to boost its work force to about 800.

   Kenneth H. Bacon's July 23 article on drug-abuse treatment
so clearly points out the need for a re-evaluation of the
approach to funding treatment.
   I have a 19-year-old son who is making remarkable progress
in his recovery from drug addiction and alcoholism through
the efforts of the Straight New England program in Stoughton,
Mass. Yet, despite the fact that he (and our family) will get
a year's intensive treatment, much of it the functional
equivalent of conventional inpatient treatment, for a cost
comparable with 60 days of traditional residential programs,
and despite the fact that the rate of sobriety among
adolescents two years after graduation from Straight is at
least as good as conventional treatment, it has been
impossible so far to get significant reimbursement from my
company's health insurer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As Mr. Bacon's article points out, adolescents need longer
treatment than adults; programs like Straight New England
provide this treatment at reasonable cost.
   The insurance-reimbursement process seems to create an
incentive to look first to conventional treatment, even if
it's neither clinically more effective nor preferred by
client or family.
   Only after exhausting available benefits is there a
(financial) reason to try a clinically and economically
effective nontraditional program such as Straight New
England.
   This is a waste. And all it requires to be rectified is a
willingness and procedure for insurers to evaluate and accept
evolving cost and clinically effective treatment programs
promptly.

   FDIC Considers Raising the Premiums
   On Banks' Fund That Backs Deposits

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is
expected next week to consider raising the premiums paid by
banks into the fund that backs up their deposits.
   Amid all the controversy over the savings and loan crisis,
in which taxpayers will be called on to pay at least $150
billion to cover the insolvent insurance fund for thrift
institutions, the adequacy of the fund for banks has also
raised some concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   FDIC officials have said they expect the bank fund could
suffer a loss this year as big as $2 billion, which would
reduce the fund to about $11.2 billion. The fund backs up
about $2 trillion in insured deposits at the nation's banks.
   The FDIC's chairman, William Seidman, said he has asked
the FDIC staff to review the agency's financial outlook for
1990 and 1991 to determine whether a premium increase may be
necessary. Depending on the outcome of the review, the
increase would be considered and possibly voted on at a
Tuesday FDIC board meeting, Mr. Seidman said.
   The FDIC chief said he hadn't yet decided whether he
believed the premiums should be increased. But his comments
suggested that a boost may be in the offing.
   "It's a judgment matter and we'll be discussing it," Mr.
Seidman said. "If the indications are that the fund will be
reaching all-time lows and we have concerns about what we
might be facing, we'd have to do everything we could to
increase our resources."
   The bank premiums have already been nearly doubled by the
S&amp;L bailout law, signed by President Bush a year ago today.
That law raised the annual premiums from 8.3 cents per $100
of deposits to 12 cents this year and 15 cents in 1991.
   The law also gave the FDIC the power to raise premiums on
its own, but not more than 7.5 cents in any one year. Thus
the FDIC could raise the premiums as high as 19.5 cents per
$100 of deposits next year.
   Just last week, Mr. Seidman told the Senate Banking
Committee that the $13.2 billion currently in the fund
translates to about 70 cents for each $100 of insured
deposits, the lowest level in "modern history," he said.
While the FDIC believes $1.25 for each $100 is a healthy
level, a $2 billion loss this year would drop the fund to
about 60 cents per $100.
   "Some of the statements I've been making could be said to
be paving the way {for a premium increase} if our review
shows it's necessary," Mr. Seidman said. He has also said he
believes the FDIC fund is sufficient to handle the banking
industry's problems without taxpayer funds, disputing
assertions by some outside analysts.
   Other factors would seem to suggest that the FDIC will
have to raise premiums. Recent statistics point to a slowing
economy, and the oil price hikes following Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait add to the threat that the economy could tumble into a
recession. Moreover, real estate values in many areas of the
country are weakening just as banks are finishing a binge of
real estate lending. All these ingredients could produce more
bank failures for the FDIC to handle.
   Premium income this year is expected to be just over $3
billion, said John Bovenzi, a top aide to Mr. Seidman. Next
year's increase to 15 cents would bring in another $750
million, because each one cent increase generates about $250
million in premiums for the FDIC.
   Troubles in the banking industry, particularly in Texas
and the rest of the Southwest, over the past few years have
depleted the strength of the bank fund. In the past two years
it has suffered the first losses in its history: $4.24
billion in 1988 and $851 million last year.

   We are writing in response to your July 24 article
concerning NASA and the Earth science community's Earth
Observing System (EOS). Plans for the U.S. Global Change
Research Program, as submitted by President Bush to Congress,
include within NASA's Mission to Planet Earth the EOS
program, scheduled for the late 1990s. Smaller Earth Probes
are to be launched earlier in the decade. Together, through
their sensors, data systems and science teams, the programs
are designed to expand our nation's capability to observe and
understand the changes of Earth's system as it responds to
human as well as natural perturbations. Discoveries are being
made rapidly in atmospheric chemistry, ocean and ecosystem
dynamics, and how they interact with and affect our climate.
It is therefore imperative that we develop an integrative
view of our planet and its biosphere.
   NASA Director James Hansen has proposed a pair of small
satellites to help fill a gap in current monitoring of
Earth's climate. The satellites would focus on certain
physical aspects of the climate system and are meant to
complement EOS. Mr. Hansen has stated that they are not meant
to be a substitute for EOS.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Within the Global Change Program, EOS is to be the first
integrated system for observing and understanding complex
interactions among the myriad components of Earth's system.
It will be coordinated with European and Japanese satellites;
simultaneous operation for many of these satellite sensors is
crucial to studying global change. A delay in the program
would greatly reduce our potential to evaluate and ultimately
predict changes in our climate, the quality of our air and
the ability of ecosystems to supply us with food, fiber and
water. The Earth Probes, possibly including the small climate
satellites, are essential for using the data from EOS to
observe, diagnose and predict global change.
   There remain many uncertainties in global change
predictions that will be addressed by NASA's Mission to
Planet Earth. The issues of the cloud-climate and the
ocean-climate feedback address responses of atmospheric
heating to changes in atmospheric composition. That is, we
must know how CO2 and other greenhouse gases will change over
time as well as their effect on climate. The rate of change
of CO2 and these trace species in the atmosphere will
determine the degree to which our forests, rangelands and
agriculture will be affected.
   Recent work has shown that our understanding of the uptake
of fossil fuel CO2 by the oceans and land vegetation is
inadequate. EOS includes sensors designed to improve this
understanding. Gauging the impact of humans on vegetation,
the oceans and the chemistry of the atmosphere is of extreme
importance in understanding our fate. Understanding the
controls over the rate of change of gases in the atmosphere
and of changes in the rest of the planet (land, oceans) is as
critical as knowing the rate of atmospheric heating in
deciding on policy.

   Oil Companies Bend in Wake of Public Outcry

   Phillips Reduces
   Gas Price; Arco
   Plans a Freeze

   Stung by public outcries of price gouging and an
admonition by President Bush to "show restraint," several
major oil companies said they were either cutting or freezing
gasoline prices.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. said it is reducing its wholesale
gasoline price by 4.5 cents a gallon, effective yesterday.
Atlantic Richfield Co. said it is freezing prices for a week.
British Petroleum Co.'s U.S. unit said it will hold prices at
current levels. And a Chevron Corp. spokesman said the
company was "holding for the moment" but can't commit for a
full week because the marketplace is so volatile.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's the kind of response the president sought from the
industry," said James Watkins, the U.S. energy secretary.
"It's truly commendable."
   Gasoline prices nationwide have soared an average of 16
cents a gallon since Iraq invaded Kuwait last week. The
run-up sparked intense congressional hearings earlier this
week that had oil companies on the defensive. A number of
states and the federal government said they would look into
charges of antitrust violations.
   Then, toward the end of his speech yesterday morning, the
president said: "I'm asking the oil companies to do their
fair share. They should show restraint and not abuse today's
uncertainties to raise prices."
   Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., said it was
cutting prices at some of its gasoline terminals because of
declining prices in the petroleum market. The company said it
would review its prices daily. Chairman C.J. Silas said the
company "supports the actions being taken by President Bush"
and will continue to show restraint in its gasoline pricing.
   In Los Angeles, an Arco spokesman responded, "We are
complying with President Bush's request to hold the line on
prices." He said the freeze only applies to prices going up.
If the marketplace allows, Arco could cut its prices within a
week, the spokesman said.
   Arco's policy initially drew some snickers in light of the
huge industrywide run-up that has already occurred. But the
spokesman said the company, known as an aggressive
price-cutter, had only raised its wholesale prices four cents
a gallon since the Iraqi invasion. Arco has an advantage over
some of its West Coast competitors, such as Chevron, because
its supply, in effect, is its own Alaskan crude. Unlike most
other oil refiners, Arco doesn't have to buy much oil in the
open market.
   San Francisco-based Chevron, meanwhile, said it will raise
prices "only when it becomes absolutely necessary." Chevron
Chairman Ken Derr urged the company's dealers and jobbers to
also exercise restraint.
   BP America Inc., based in Cleveland, said it would be
"looking for opportunities to reduce some prices" if it can
do so without "generating a run on storage terminals that
would prevent us from supplying our customers."
   While other companies didn't immediately announce any
changes, more shifts are possible in reaction to these
initial moves. By breaking with the industry pattern of the
past week, these companies may be putting competitive
pressure on their rivals, both in the marketplace and from a
public relations standpoint.
   Most big oil companies that didn't announce any changes
yesterday generally scrambled to endorse the President's call
for pricing restraint.
   In White Plains, N.Y., Texaco Inc. said it "fully supports
President Bush's call for the exercise of restraint on
gasoline prices." The company added, "We have been doing so
in recent days, and we fully intend to continue."
   Amoco Corp., based in Chicago, said it was committed to
"prudent and responsible pricing." The company said it has
increased its wholesale gasoline prices on average only 10
cents a gallon since Aug. 1, compared with a run-up of 20
cents on the spot gasoline market.
   In a telegram to the president, Mobil Corp. Chairman Allen
Murray wrote, "We will continue to show restraint in the face
of escalating prices for crude oil and petroleum products
purchased by our U.S. marketing and refining business." Mr.
Murray went on to say that while Mobil has raised gasoline
prices, it hasn't yet recovered all of the higher costs it
has incurred.
   Exxon Corp. said it will continue to price "its products
in a responsible manner that reflects overall market and
supply conditions."

half to 34 billion francs ($6.4 billion) from 33.2 billion
francs in the 1989 first half.
   The company said sales were virtually flat on a comparable
structural basis. Saint-Gobain attributed the loss to
weakness in the U.S. dollar and the British pound against the
French franc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decline in the dollar hurt the company most, a
spokesman said, because the U.S. unit's loss of about 10%
against its French counterpart severely devalued the
company's U.S. revenue in franc terms, even though the volume
of Saint-Gobain's business in the U.S. market held close to
first-half 1989 levels.
   The spokesman said North American operations accounted for
about 22% of the company's revenue.

   NEW YORK -- Turmoil in the Persian Gulf reverberated once
again through the credit markets yesterday, disrupting the
Treasury's big quarterly auction of government securities.
   "It was a horror show," said F. Ward McCarthy Jr., a
managing director at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates.
"This auction was an absolute disaster. The bidding was
sloppy, and it looks like a lot of people tried to miss the
auction."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The disappointment in yesterday's auction spilled over
onto the broader bond market, causing prices to gyrate
wildly. The market recovered later in the day with the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond posting gains of about 3/8
point, or $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
   The Treasury had difficulty selling $10.5 billion of
ten-year notes yesterday in the second portion of the
government's three-part $32.25 billion quarterly refunding of
the federal debt. The ten-year note sale followed a weak
three-year note auction on Tuesday.
   Analysts said investors and dealers avoided the auction
due to fears that spiraling oil prices and Mideast turmoil
will lead to rising inflation -- the bane of the bond market.
The poor auction results also reflect the lack of buying by
Japanese and other foreign investors.
   "When I called some of my clients overseas, they seemed to
suggest that U.S. rates are not that attractive and not worth
the currency risk," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of
Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.
   Foreign institutional investors -- especially from Japan
and the Middle East -- have been big buyers of U.S. Treasury
securities at previous auctions. But in recent months, yields
on government bonds in Japan have risen sharply and are now
nearly as high as U.S. yields. As a result, Japanese
investors are keeping their cash at home. Investors from the
Middle East, preoccupied with more important matters, didn't
show up in a big way either.
   At yesterday's Treasury auction, the average yield on the
10-year notes was 8.77%. But because there wasn't enough
demand at the average yield, the Treasury was forced to
accept bids as high as 8.84% to complete the auction.
   The uncommonly wide spread between the average and high
yield, called a "tail," is an indication that bond dealers
were reluctant to bid for the securities. The tail at
yesterday's auction was the longest since May 1980, according
to Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   "Dealers did not bid aggressively because they did not see
any interest from their client base," said Lawrence Leuzzi, a
trading manager at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. (Only a small group of
brokerage firms and commercial banks are allowed to bid at
Treasury auctions. These firms then resell the securities to
customers. Individuals, however, can purchase securities
directly from the Treasury through "noncompetitive" tenders.)
   Another indication that the Treasury had difficulty
selling its securities was the "bid-to-cover" ratio, which
measures the number of bids the Treasury receives for each
one it accepts. At yesterday's sale, bid-to-cover ratio was
1.59, the lowest since 1978, according to Dean Witter. The
bid-to-cover ratio averaged 2.37 at the 12 previous 10-year
note auctions and was 3.0 at the previous 10-year note sale
in May.
   William Brachfeld, manager of trading at the New York
office of Japan's Daiwa Securities Inc., estimates that the
"Big Four" Japanese securities firms bought 15% of the
ten-year notes, down from 25% to 30% at recent 10-year
auctions. And much of yesterday's purchases went into
speculative trading accounts, not long-term investment
accounts.
   Shortly after the auction ended, dealers who bought the
bonds were forced to cut prices in an attempt to attract
buyers. As prices slid, traders said that demand suddenly
materialized.
   "Some investors were afraid to buy at the auction, but
when the average yield reached 8.80%, investors found that to
be very attractive," said Thomas Murphy, a managing director
at Salomon Brother Inc.
   Noncompetitive bids at yesterday's auction, the best
indication of demand from individual investors and small
institutions, totaled $560 million compared with $659 million
at the previous 10-year note auction in May.
   The auction results sent shock waves through the bond
market and caused prices to abruptly reverse directions. Bond
prices were 1/4 point higher before the auction results were
announced, then fell 1/4 point when the government released
the auction statistics at 2:30 p.m. EDT. The market improved
later in the day and prices ended mixed.
   The Treasury's quarterly auction continues today with the
sale of $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds.
   Economists and dealers are not optimistic about the
prospects of today's auction. "If {investors and dealers} are
running away from the 10-year notes like this, one can only
wonder what's going to happen when it comes time to buy the
{30-year} bond," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko
Securities.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury prices ended mixed yesterday, with short-term
notes posting modest losses while long-term bonds posted
gains.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
about 99 3/32 to yield 8.82% compared with 98 23/32 on
Tuesday to yield 8.86%. The new three-year notes, which were
auctioned Tuesday, ended yesterday at a price of 99 17/32,
down from 101 3/32 on Tuesday. The issue's yield rose to
8.16% from 8.14%.
   Prices of the old ten-year notes ended at 100 27/32, up
from 100 21/32 on Tuesday. The yield fell to 8.72% from
8.75%.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk-bond market disregarded stock market gains and
ended weaker yesterday.
   Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 25
points higher at 2734.90, most junk-bond prices finished
between 1/4 and 3/8 points lower. Junk bonds are high-yield
high-risk corporate securities that have low credit ratings
or no credit ratings at all.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds closed unchanged to slightly higher.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese government bonds ended sharply higher as
short-covering in the final hour of trading developed into a
mad scramble to buy Japanese government bonds and futures
contracts.
   The rally was triggered by news that Saudi Arabia plans to
increase production of oil. Fears that oil shortages would
lead to higher prices and spiraling inflation has shaken bond
markets around the world, but the Japanese market was hurt
the hardest.
   The hectic short-covering drove down the yield on Japan's
benchmark 10-year bond below 8%. The jump in prices quickly
pushed developments in the Persian Gulf into the background
as traders feared the market would get away from them.
   "Traders didn't have time to think about the situation in
the Middle East," said one dealer at a major Japanese
commercial bank. For traders taking positions day-to-day the
late surge in prices "was very fearful," he said.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year bond ended at a price of
83.97, up 0.93 point. The issue's yield fell 0.20 percentage
point to 7.875%. (When calculated using the semiannual
compound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.29%,
according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   The heavy buying hit futures first and quickly spread to
the cash market. "Then there was massive buying by securities
houses," said one dealer, especially by the so-called Big
Four Japanese securities firms. "People went on a sort of
panic buying spree" as prices started to pick up in the
middle of the afternoon and "shorts were afraid the market
was moving away from them."
   Dealers and professional traders, betting that prices will
fall, sometimes sell borrowed securities and hope to profit
by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities. That
is called a short sale. Short-covering occurs when the
dealers buy securities to replace what they borrowed.
   Bond prices ended weaker in Europe, although trading was
generally light in most markets. French government bonds fell
sharply as market participants remained gripped by the Middle
East crisis. But prices were just moderately lower in West
Germany and Britain.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were generally flat to 1/4 point lower.
   The market's downward bias was primarily because of swings
in Treasurys and continued inflation worries.
   Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 finished virtually
unchanged at 97 3/4, with the yield falling to 7.37% from
7.38% late Tuesday.
   In new issue activity, $600 million of Massachusetts
general obligation bond anticipation notes were priced by a
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. group.
   The notes, which are due Oct. 17, 1990, are 7% issues
priced to yield 5.95%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended unchanged to slightly lower,
after once more following Treasurys in a session dominated
again by oil prices and the crisis in the Middle East.
   The market's volatility didn't stem a rush of new issuance
in the real estate mortgage investment conduit and
assetbacked sectors.
   Three Remic issues totaling $1.3 billion and two
asset-backed deals totaling $660 million were priced this
session.
   In the secondary market, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues were off 1/32 at 98 14/32, Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were off 1/32 at 98 5/32
and Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were
also down 1/32, at 98 22/32.
   In the market for new Remics, details were announced for a
$500.25 million Fannie Mae deal through Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
that is backed by Fannie Mae 9.5% 30-year securities; a $300
million Fannie Mae issue through Citicorp that uses Fannie
Mae 9% 30-year securities and a $500 million issue of
collateralized mortgage obligation Remics through Salomon
Brothers Inc. that uses Ginnie Mae 9% 30-year securities.
   As for the asset-backed sector, two of the many deals that
are expected to be priced in the near-term were priced
yesterday.
   There was a $500 million issue of Discover Card securities
backed by credit-card receivables. The securities have a
coupon rate of 8.75% and were priced at 99.765 to yield 8.87%
through Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The underlying credit-card receivables were sold by
Discover Receivables Financing Corp., a unit of Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co., and are being serviced by Greenwood Trust Co.
   In the second offering, $160 million of Southeast Bank
securities backed by credit-card receivables have a coupon
rate of 8.60% and were priced at 99 21/32 to yield 8.762%
through Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
   The seller and servicer of the underlying loans is
Southeast Bank, a unit of Miami-based Southeast Banking Corp.

   Make no mistake. Saddam -- "He Who Confronts" -- is a
world problem. Not an Arab problem. Nor a problem simply for
the Japanese and the Europeans, who derive even more of their
oil from the Persian Gulf than does the U.S. Nor a short-term
problem the world can soon forget after oil markets
accommodate Saddam's actions with a modest increase in the
price of a barrel of oil to the $25 mark that he had been
pressing on OPEC. Nor is it a long-run problem that the U.S.
can dispose of simply by reducing U.S. dependence on imported
oil.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait -- if not reversed -- will be an
economic and political disaster of global proportions. It
will affect the First, Second and Third Worlds. Saddam
Hussein is a murderous neighborhood bully bent on expanding
indefinitely the neighborhood he terrorizes. Perceptions of
that fact, with varying degrees of clarity, have evoked the
extraordinary sanctions voted in the United Nations and the
belated but at last swift actions taken by the U.S., Europe,
the Soviet Union and even China, and by developing countries,
including key Arab states. The Soviet position is important
not only because it makes possible the U.N. consensus, but
because the changes in the Soviet Union free the U.S. and its
allies to use force if necessary in the Persian Gulf without
fear of opening vulnerabilities to Soviet attack.

<TEXT>
   The oil shocks starting in 1973 marked the end of the
post-World War II "Golden Age" of unprecedented economic
growth in the industrial democracies. Between 1973 and 1986,
Japanese gross domestic product slowed to an annual growth
rate of about 4% from nearly 10%. Other industrial countries
slowed to about 2% from 4% or 6%; the growth-retarding effect
of the oil shocks accounted for much of this decline. The
cumulative loss in GDP due to the oil shocks exceeded $10
trillion in 1986 dollars. (A good deal of that damage
resulted from price controls and other government
interventions aimed at spreading the damage more equitably.)
Saddam Hussein can do much more harm. He can impose a
military discipline far more effective than any OPEC
consensus.
   Nor will the disasters be exclusively economic. Saddam has
shown that he won't hesitate to use force. If he thinks he
can get away with it, he'll move into Saudi Arabia to seize
direct ownership of this largest pool of low-cost oil
reserves. He plainly intended his cool lies about invading
Kuwait to support a "free Kuwait" independence movement to
display his contempt for world condemnation and so
calculatedly to inspire fear.
   He is neither grateful nor appeased by the plentiful
economic and military aid he has received from the neighbors
and industrial democracies he now threatens. Hitler sometimes
talked eloquently of peace and played on British guilt about
the harshness of Versailles. Saddam is never Mr. Nice Guy. He
exploits his reputation for unswerving brutality. As we face
him down, we should take care not to save face for him so
that, frustrated now, he can simply try again.
   The foreign ministries and intelligence agencies of Europe
and the U.S. long ignored the obvious about Saddam Hussein.
He has made clear the extent of his ambitions and the
ruthlessness with which he moves to achieve them for at least
15 years. He wants to control oil markets to realize
political aims that go far beyond economic power. He has, of
course, demanded that all foreign powers stay out of the Gulf
and the Indian Ocean. But his interests cover the
Mediterranean as well. Ten years ago, for example, his two
top ministers told a thrilled interviewer that his aims
included "the removal of American bases in Portugal, Spain,
Greece, Turkey and Cyprus."
   Anyone who dominated oil markets solely to maximize
long-term economic gain would pursue "moderate" price
policies. That's not Saddam. In the short run he would set
extortionate prices to recoup quickly the enormous costs of
his disastrously miscalculated attack on Iran. Once
established in control, he'd use sudden and massive changes
for large political ends.
   One major political end would be to quicken the increase
of his already formidable military power and extend its
reach. His million-man army and 5,500 tanks, etc., strike
fear in his neighbors. But to extend the range of his
intimidation he has already tested a ballistic missile of
800-to-1,000-kilometer range, and a space-launch vehicle with
a very large first stage. Such a vehicle makes feasible an
intermediate-range ballistic missile carrying a 500-kilogram
warhead that would menace Southern Europe -- as well as the
Middle East and much of the Soviet Union. With the wealth he
would accumulate if unchecked, it would not be hard for him
to buy the development of an even larger space launch vehicle
that could be adapted, with appropriate guidance, to carry
lethal warheads to intercontinental distances.
   What is more, increased oil revenues would help him
accelerate his development of warheads for mass destruction.
He has bought from the Western democracies the capacity to
make chemical weapons and is pushing the development of
nuclear weapons. The Israelis destroyed the nuclear research
reactor he bought from the French. But they did not touch the
facilities sold by the Italians that can separate
weapons-grade plutonium from spent reactor fuel -- which, as
a world-wide problem of waste disposal, is in plentiful
supply.
   In short, if we do not confront Saddam Hussein now, we
will find it much harder when he has extended the range of
his intimidation.
   The U.S. and its allies must face these facts squarely.
The widespread condemnation, including that of the Soviet
Union, is all to the good. The U.N. sanctions are even better
and have undoubtedly helped to induce swift international
action against Iraq. The U.S. has been moving the naval units
needed for an effective blockade of a kind contemplated in
Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter. As soon as our forces are in
position we should put it into effect to enforce the U.N.
economic embargo and to prevent the embargo from slowly
dissipating. Both the British and the French have said they
would support a naval blockade and we are moving ships to
effect that support.
   But the more effective the embargo, the greater Iraq's
incentives to apply counterpressure by shutting off Saudi
production; and Saddam has shown he is a risk-taker. Iraq has
a formidable regional force, but if it moves on Saudi Arabia,
it has vulnerabilities that the U.S. can exploit -- with
appropriate access en route and in the theater and with the
help of our allies.
   Experts, who during the Iran-Iraq War repeated the foolish
stereotype that "Iraq can lose but only Iran can win" now
talk as if Iraq is invulnerable to forces that could be
brought into the area. It's not. Saddam's moves into Saudi
Arabia will almost surely face resistance by U.S. airborne
and mechanized divisions and air forces based in Saudi
Arabia, Oman, Diego Garcia and Turkey, with possible support
by British and Arab forces. Iraq's extended lines of supply
through featureless desert without cover would make its
forces ideal targets for precisely applied land-based air
power of sufficient range.
   Precise weapons, stealth and other advanced techniques for
penetrating defenses should also make possible highly
effective and discriminate air attacks against key military
targets -- including Iraq's air and missile forces, and
stocks and production facilities for chemical or nuclear
weapons. Ironically, precise air attacks against refineries
and stocks of refined products could leave Saddam awash in
crude oil while denying the fuel to support his military and
also avoiding widespread and long-lasting impairment of crude
production capacity. They could avoid indiscriminate
collateral damage to civilians in a war likely to be fought
before television cameras. Avoiding as much harm as possible
to Iraq's terrorized population is a political as well as
moral necessity.
   Turkey, it should have always been clear, has a key
military as well as economic role to play in Persian Gulf
contingencies. But NATO, in the past two decades,
increasingly took the view that the defense of the massive
interests of NATO members in the Persian Gulf was not a NATO
affair. Implicit was the threat that an attack on one of its
members that grew out of a Persian Gulf contingency would not
invoke the NATO guarantee.
   Turkey, therefore, reserving the use of its NATO bases for
NATO contingencies, has understandably refused any plans for
using its bases in the Persian Gulf. Turkey's shabby
treatment by the European Community and by a NATO preoccupied
with implausibly extreme contingencies on the inter-German
border has reduced Turkish ardor to be helpful. But Mr. Bush
and Mrs. Thatcher, said Monday that an attack on Turkey, a
member of NATO, would be an attack on all NATO. That is a
crucial step in making the Turkish bases recently occupied by
U.S. F-111s available to counter an Iraqi invasion in the
Gulf. If that is now NATO policy, it will reverse a long
history of deterioration starting with President Johnson's
statement in 1964 that the NATO guarantee might not apply
even in the case of a Soviet attack on Turkey that grew out
of the Cyprus crisis.
   In sum, if either the economic embargo or a blockade
enforcing it should lead Mr. Hussein to make his threatened
invasion of Saudi Arabia, he will get more than he bargained
for. Now is the time for closing the economic vise.
   Now is also better than later for confronting him in the
oil market. Consuming countries are in a strong position to
continue indefinitely the embargo on Iraq and Kuwait with the
cooperation of most of the other OPEC countries, especially
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Unused production capacity in
OPEC countries other than Iraq and Kuwait is enough to
restore OPEC production to its average level during 1989.
Once panic subsides, that should be more than enough to keep
crude oil prices at or below their levels before the invasion
of Kuwait. Moreover, oil stocks in the consuming countries
are high as a result of government stockpiling and the steady
growth in OPEC production over several years. These stocks
give insurance even against a temporary disruption of Saudi
production, if that should result from further aggression by
Iraq.
   The U.S. Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy, in
its report of January 1988, emphasized that the U.S.
government and NATO have neglected military dangers in the
Persian Gulf and in other places where they have massive
interests. The U.S. and NATO mistakenly took these critically
important contingencies as if they were "Lesser Included
Cases" of the two extreme attacks that have preoccupied us:
an unrestrained nuclear attack on the U.S., and a massive
conventional invasion through the Fulda Gap in West Germany.
These extreme contingencies were always far-fetched. In 1989,
half of this key commission conclusion became transparently
obvious as the countries in Eastern Europe moved to
independence and disintegration became evident within the
Soviet Union itself. We may be lucky that Saddam Hussein has
made the other half equally clear sooner rather than later.
   With the increasing spread of weapons of mass destruction
and high technology for delivering them, new strategy, forces
and technologies need elaboration; the plausible important
contingencies are not "lesser included cases" of the
extremes. These cases call for smaller but different forces,
rather than the proportionate reductions that members of
Congress, eager to reduce budgets and at the same time
protect weapons production and bases in their districts, are
likely to provide. This is particularly so since the air
space and bases to which the U.S. needs access in order to
protect its critical interests overseas are not in any
congressman's district.
   The ability of the U.S. to project suitably discriminate
power in a timely way in the Persian Gulf or other threatened
areas has eroded as it has lost such access. It will erode
further unless the administration and Congress recognize the
massive changes that have taken place -- and the great
dangers that will persist and grow. According to the New York
Times, just before the crisis in Kuwait, Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney had been moving toward a strategy that sounds
very much like what's required. The present crisis should
give a powerful impulse not merely to prevent excessive cuts
but, even more essential, toward reshaping U.S. forces to
meet the real dangers.
   The present crisis will test Europe's willingness to join
in the defense of its most important interests. It will test,
also, the future of NATO and its ability to develop strategy,
force structure and technology appropriate to the massive
changes under way in the world.
   A U.S. military presence in Europe will continue to have a
role in protecting U.S. interests in that vital region.
Europeans still want that presence. But it can't be justified
by the contingency of a massive Warsaw Pact invasion through
the center of Europe. More plausible contingencies, like the
present one in the Persian Gulf, call for a forward force
flexible enough to react quickly and for the bases to provide
a sustained defense against aggressions that affects our
interest.
   Saddam Hussein, who needs to be thrown out of Iraq as well
as from Kuwait, illustrates what should have been obvious all
along: that even as communist empires break up and many of
their parts move toward democracy and free markets, the world
will continue to present military dangers to critical
interests of the U.S. and its allies. We need a strategy and
forces shaped to meet these very real dangers.

   As the air fills with predictions of economic downturn,
the Mitchell Recession may soon be upon us. But by now it may
have some Republican fingerprints on it; we'll have to call
it the Budget Summit Recession.
   We started talking of the Mitchell Recession last year,
when the Senate majority leader personally stopped a cut in
the capital-gains tax. Now a slowdown has indisputably set
in, but the only lesson Washington seems to draw is that it
could be tough sledding for the hallowed budget summit's
agenda: higher taxes (for sure) and (maybe) spending cuts.
And now, Senator Mitchell has done it again. He stopped the
World's Greatest Deliberative Body from even holding a vote
on cutting the capital-gains tax.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We, and others who predicted tax cuts would produce the
'80's recovery, believe a cut in the capital-gains rate would
be the fastest way to jump-start the sagging economy. And
last Saturday, GOP Senators Bob Kasten and Connie Mack,
joined by Democratic Senator Richard Shelby, wanted to offer
a simple amendment to a bill raising the debt ceiling: Cut
the capital-gains tax to 15% after a one-year holding period.
   Senator Mitchell brought up a bill for a long-term
increase in the debt ceiling, but asked for unanimous consent
that no substantive amendments be allowed. Senator Kasten
objected, saying he wished to bring up capital gains. So
Senator Mitchell withdrew the long-term bill, and asked for
approval of an alternate for a short-term extension through
October 15. Since the House was on the verge of recessing for
a month and some debt-limit bill was essential, Senator
Kasten had to withdraw his amendment.
   The Mitchell maneuver also sidelined an amendment by his
fellow Democratic Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, which would
have cut the Social Security payroll tax on middle- and
lower-income taxpayers. Senator Mitchell, understand, is in
politics to raise taxes, not cut them.
   This time, however, he apparently had Republican allies.
Bob Dole, the GOP Minority Leader, made it clear he didn't
want a vote on either amendment. The Treasury Department
lobbyists were also all over the Senate cloakroom Saturday,
telling Senators that Kasten-Mack would weaken chances for a
budget-summit agreement; they even pressed the old argument
that a capital-gains cut would lose revenue.
   The Treasury lobbying raises the question whether the
department basically supports the capital-gains cut that
George Bush backed during the Presidential campaign. Senator
Mitchell, it seems, has the President stuck to the summit tar
baby.
   No doubt it would be tidier if such a cut entered the
economy by a route other than a bill to increase the debt
limit. But we offer last weekend's incident as part of our
continuing coverage of Senator Mitchell's insistence on
playing the troll under the public-policy bridge and blocking
all action on capital gains.
   The Majority Leader's it-shall-not-pass stance leaves us
here: Unemployment is rising, Saddam Hussein has upset oil
markets, the stock market has a bad case of the jitters, the
real-estate market is in the tank, bankers are fearful of
making loans, the S&amp;L debacle is engulfing Washington. But
the idea of cutting the tax rate on capital gains is an
anathema on which the Senate isn't even allowed to vote.

   Borneo International Furniture Inc., Asia's largest
furniture manufacturer and retailer, said it will open a
retail showroom in New York, marking its entry into the East
Coast market.
   The Korean company, commonly known as BiF Korea, said it
purchased a 55,000-square-foot building near the Empire State
building for $11 million. Two floors of the 11-story building
will open to the public this fall; the rest will open after
the completion of a $3 million renovation. The company also
said it has leased a 182,000-square-foot warehouse and
distribution facility in Bergen County, N.J., where it will
eventually operate a second showroom.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   BiF Korea, which sells contemporary, Italian-style home
and office furnishings, entered the U.S. market in 1981, and

million.

   Peat Marwick's
   Horner to Leave
   Top Positions

   NEW YORK -- KPMG Peat Marwick, the consulting and
accounting firm, said Larry D. Horner won't seek re-election
as chairman and chief executive officer of the firm's U.S.
and international practices.
   The 56-year-old executive could have run for an additional
three-year term; Peat Marwick's mandatory retirement age for
the positions is 60. But Mr. Horner, a veteran of 35 years
with KPMG and its predecessors, said that the issues the firm
faces require an executive who will be able to stay on for a
longer tenure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   KPMG has 1,850 U.S. partners and a total of 6,100 partners
world-wide, and is considered the largest of the Big Six
consulting firms. The firm was formed out of the December
1986 merger of Peat Marwick International and Klynveld Main &amp;
Goerdeler.
   Mr. Horner took over the top spots at Peat Marwick in 1984
and analysts say he was the driving force behind the merger.
He took over KPMG's international organization, based in
Amsterdam, in 1988. His terms at KPMG's U.S. and
international practices end Oct. 3 and Dec. 31, respectively.
   "He had the foresight to see this global economy we're
growing into; . . . too many CPAs tend not to see the forest
for the trees," says Arthur W. Bowman of Bowman's Accounting
Report in Atlanta. "For the types of clients the Big Six
serve, you need this more-global" operation.
   KPMG's U.S. practice posted $1.77 billion in revenue for
the year ended June 30, 1989. World-wide, KPMG posted total
revenue of $4.75 billion for the year ended Sept. 30, 1989,
reflecting revenue from firms that have been merged into KPMG
since Sept. 30.
   In a severely competitive climate, KPMG has a strong
client base in most major markets world-wide. Mr. Horner says
one challenge for his successor is to continue to build and
solidify the firm's position. Prior to the merger, Peat
Marwick had 70% of its business in North America and 30%
elsewhere; those percentages at KPMG now are 45% and 55%,
respectively, Mr. Horner estimated.
   A major challenge facing Mr. Horner's successor is how to
manage a firm in which the partners number in the thousands.
"How do you coordinate the various interests?" Mr. Horner
asks rhetorically. The solution "will take longer than the
three {more} years I would have had" at KPMG, he says.
   Neither Mr. Horner nor Mr. Bowman will speculate on a
possible successor to KPMG's at the U.S. practice.
Nominations for the positions will be finalized Sept. 20, and
the U.S. firm's partners will vote early in October.
   KPMG's executive committee has nominated P.J. Butler,
senior partner of the U.K. practice, to succeed Mr. Horner at
the international practice. The council overseeing the
international practice will vote on that recommendation in
September.
   Mr. Horner sits on a number of boards of charitable
organizations. He said he hasn't decided what he will do
after leaving KPMG.

   IRAQ ANNEXED Kuwait and the first U.S. troops landed in
Saudi Arabia.
   Baghdad declared that the emirate it overran a week ago
was "part of Iraq." As American troops, aircraft and ships
converged on the region, Bush said the U.S. military aim is
to defend the Saudis. He expressed hope Kuwait can be freed
through economic pressure on Iraq. As Arabs prepared to meet
today in Cairo to discuss joining a multinational army in
Saudi Arabia, Jordan's King Hussein said he would refuse to
recognize Baghdad's "annexation."

   The Iraqis moved surface-to-surface missiles into Kuwait
that can carry chemical warheads. Bush said the use of such
weapons "would be intolerable." One military flashpoint may
come today, when an Iraqi-owned tanker attempts to take on

   The Bush administration said it is reaching out to Syria
and Iran, two U.S. adversaries, for help in pressuring Iraq.
And Baker said "extended discussions" have been held with
Yemen, which has appeared sympathetic to Baghdad.

   Firm Had Loss for Quarter,

   Computer Factory Inc. reported a net loss of $7.3 million,
or 85 cents a share, for its third quarter ended June 30 and
said it plans to consolidate some retail operations.
   The Elmsford, N.Y., computer dealer has suffered more than
most from the withering price war on personal computers over
the past year and a half. Computer Factory's stock has lost
more than 85% of its value over the past two years, closing
yesterday at $2.25, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Computer Factory said part of its loss could be attributed
to a $2.6 million charge related to the consolidation, but it
also had a loss of $4.7 million from operations. That
compares with net income of $82,000, or one cent a share, in
the year-earlier period. Sales climbed 2.3% to $83.9 million
from $82 million.
   The company said it will try to return to profitability by
closing some of its smaller, marginal branches and
consolidating them into so-called superstores, which will
offer a broader array of products. Computer Factory said it
plans to open four of the large stores over the next nine
months.
   In the nine-month period, the company had a net loss of
$10.4 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with year-earlier
profit of $6.5 million, or 73 cents a share. Sales rose 6.7%
to $297.7 million from $279.1 million.

   Marketing Brief -- PolyGram N.V.:
   Analysts Estimate Earnings
   Fell 15% to 25% in 1st Half

   PolyGram N.V., the recorded music company 80%-owned by
N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, is expected to report
Tuesday that its first-half net income fell 15% to 25%,
London investment analysts said.
   Several analysts predicted, however, that PolyGram would
still show a rise in net for the full year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first half was disappointing partly because of
teething problems with two record labels PolyGram has
acquired in the past 13 months, Island International Ltd. and
A&amp;M Records Inc. Analysts said efforts to blend those labels
into PolyGram's distribution system held up some record
releases and produced exceptional costs.
   In addition, the acquisitions increased PolyGram's
interest costs. Analysts also noted that the year-earlier
half was exceptionally strong.
   James Golob, an analyst at S.G. Warburg Securities,
estimated that PolyGram's first half net tumbled 25% to 111
million Dutch guilders ($62 million) from 148 million
guilders ($83 million) a year earlier. But he predicted that
full-year net would rise 11% to 370 million guilders.
   Analysts at James Capel &amp; Co. forecast a drop of about 15%
for the half and a rise of 13% for the year.
   Despite the slow start, Warburg's Mr. Golob said that the
"strategic logic of the two acquisitions is still very much
intact." Long a powerhouse in Europe, PolyGram has said it
aims to use Island and A&amp;M to bolster its presence in the
U.S.
   Philips sold 20% of PolyGram late last year in a public
offering totaling about one billion guilders.

   HOUSTON -- John Peters's work gives new meaning to the
phrase "commercial art."
   He doesn't photograph tractors or design corporate logos.
The artist, whose portfolio includes Warholesque acrylic
tributes to pop stars, sells advertising space on his
canvases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There aren't enough {art buyers} in Houston to support me
in the horrible style I'm accustomed to," the 32-year-old
says, deadpan. So, for a fee, this tall Texan lets
advertisers hawk discos, hair salons, clothing stores and the
like to gallery goers. As many as a dozen ads, presented in
footsquare boxes along both sides and the bottom edge, adorn
his creations. They are silk-screened -- the
"quintessentially careerist art form," he sniffs.
   For critics, who might argue that the ads obscure his art,
Mr. Peters has this ready reply: "My art is already obscure."
   Mr. Peters got his inspiration from a Houston art show
last December called "Primal Screen." Ads sold by Mr. Peters
and the other exhibiting artists paid for the cost of
materials for 18 canvases. "Primal Screen" promoters called
it a celebration of "the notion that nothing could be more
valid than art with no integrity whatsoever." Press kits for
the event included a so-called review proclaiming the art-ads
merger a "touchingly blatant tryst of culture and sponsor."
   Next month, Mr. Peters plans a solo exhibition with ads
nestled around his art, which is heavy on stylized images of
such "celebrity idols" as comedian/actor Eddie Murphy and
singer/actress Madonna. This time, the artist has hired a
salesperson to sell ads on commission for as much as $1,000 a
pop. Several advertisers, including a nightclub, a clothing
boutique, an art gallery and Houston's Menil museum, seem
happy to pay Mr. Peters's price.
   John Hilliard, a Houston art collector, has purchased
several of Mr. Peters's canvases. At first, he concedes, he
thought Mr. Peters's works were a joke. But now that he owns
seven Peters paintings, the young collector considers them
"cutting edge."
   For advertisers who really believe in the medium, one
Peters work bought by Mr. Hilliard must have been especially
tempting. Unfortunately for them, Mr. Peters sold no ad space
on it.
   In huge, black letters, that canvas reads simply, "Your ad
here."

   Japanese Investors in U.S. Firms Grow
   More Willing to Take Minority Stakes

   Japanese buyers of U.S. companies are increasingly
preferring to ride in the back seat rather than take the
driver's seat.
   After displaying a marked preference for obtaining
controlling stakes in U.S. companies, Japanese corporate
buyers are more willing to accept minority equity positions
when investing in the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of 103 takeovers and related transactions in the first
half of this year, 42, or 41%, were minority investments,
according to Ulmer Brothers Inc., a New York-based merchant
bank specializing in Japanese investments. That compares with
29 minority investments in the comparable period of 1989 and
nine for 1988.
   Overall, Japanese direct investment in the U.S. continued
to grow: Japanese investors paid $3.91 billion for their 103
publicly reported acquisitions and investments. That's up 39%
from $2.79 billion for stakes in 74 U.S. companies in the
first half of 1989, according to an Ulmer Brothers report.
   However, analysts noted that the amount was still below
the $5.99 billion that the Japanese invested in U.S.
companies in the first half of 1988. Moreover, some said
there was a good chance that investment for 1990 would be
below the $13.7 billion total for 1989. They noted that
Japanese companies have shown a growing appetite for
acquisitions in Europe and Asia.
   Japanese portfolio investment in American securities has
also been falling. In the first quarter, Japanese investors
sold a net $700 million of U.S. stocks and unloaded $3.9
billion of U.S. Treasury securities. Analysts believe the
trend has continued since then.
   Japanese foreign portfolio investment, which involves the
buying and selling of stocks and bonds, is normally much more
volatile than their overseas investments in companies, which
tend to be long-term.
   "Political sensitivity is the prime factor for the
increase in minority stakes," said Ko-Yung Tung, a New
York-based partner at O'Melveny &amp; Myers who specializes in
U.S.-Japanese business. He added that Japanese government
officials have been jawboning Japanese companies "to have a
lower profile in foreign investments, particularly in the
U.S."
   Mr. Tung said, "We have gone from trade friction to
investment friction." The root cause of this tension lies in
the expanding overall presence of Japanese multinational
corporations in the U.S.
   But Mr. Tung said the most recent strains can be
attributed to "the one-two punch" of Sony Corp.'s $3.45
billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
late last year followed immediately by Mitsubishi Estate
Co.'s purchase of 51% of Rockefeller Group Inc. for $846
million. That gave Mitsubishi a minority stake in Rockefeller
Center in New York.
   In addition, some earlier big Japanese investments haven't
worked out so well, contend analysts. "Some Japanese
companies have found that they simply paid too high a price
for U.S. acquisitions, something that has also been noticed
by the Japanese corporate community at large," said Daniel M.
Schwartz, managing director at Ulmer Brothers.
   For instance, he said that many American investment
bankers contend that Bridgestone Corp. paid too much in its
$2.6 billion acquisition of Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in
1988. Shortly after the deal closed, a major Firestone
customer, General Motors Corp., began phasing out the tire
maker as a supplier, except for the new Saturn division.
   Another factor is that more small and medium-sized
Japanese companies are investing abroad for the first time.
That, Mr. Schwartz said, accounts for the increase in smaller
transactions, especially those valued at less than $20
million, as well as the growth in minority investments.
Japanese companies, even very big ones, often prefer to
experiment with an initial small investment when venturing
overseas for the first time.
   Overall, Japanese merger activity in the first half
concentrated on the computer industry, followed by chemicals
and financial services. California, accounting for 31 deals,
remained the most popular investment location, followed by
New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, Massachusetts, Hawaii and
New Jersey.
   Despite this healthy pace, Mr. Tung of O'Melveny &amp; Myers
and others believe that by year end the picture may change.
They contend that while the number of Japanese acquisitions
and investments in the U.S. will remain the same or increase,
their dollar value will decline.
   They say the aggregate value of all transactions can be
skewed by a single mega-deal. And "these transactions are so
visible that many Japanese companies are loath to make these
kind of investments in the U.S.," said Mr. Tung. "Rather than
being accused of taking over corporate America, they will
take a lesser percentage to appear as co-investors with
Americans."
   Moreover, merger experts said Japan's corporations are
increasingly turning their attention to Europe to take
advantage of the planned abolition of trade and investment
barriers between the 12 countries of the European Community
in 1992 and the recent opening of Eastern Europe.
   "The bloom is off the flower in terms of Japanese
investment in the U.S.; they're tired of America already,"
said Mr. Tung. Besides Europe, he said, Japanese companies
are increasing their direct investment in Asia, "their
backyard." He pointed specifically to Japanese investment in
Thailand and to Japan's increased reliance on Indonesia as a
supplier of oil.
   Mr. Schwartz argued that "the U.S. will remain the major
recipient of Japanese overseas acquisition funds, but
European candidates are looming larger in the minds of
potential Japanese acquirers."

   WASHINGTON -- Barely two months ago, some of the U.S.
Army's top brass assembled at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., to hear
the result of a secret war game. The powerful army of
"Shattland" had plunged into the rich oil fields of
"Audialand."
   Based on the maps used in the game, Shattland was Iraq.
Audialand was Saudi Arabia. And the outcome was nightmarish:
The U.S. could not overpower the enemy without wiping out
production facilities at the world's biggest oil fields,
sending the world economy into a tailspin for many months
thereafter.

   Now, the U.S. faces the danger of fantasy becoming
reality, and the next 48 hours pose the most vulnerable
period. With the U.S. just beginning to convey a massive
military force to the Persian Gulf region, Iraqi ruler Saddam
Hussein has a window of opportunity of about that much time
to freely deploy his formidable army, possibly unleash his
vast chemical-weapons stockpile and test whether the West's
ships really intend to blockade his oil shipments.
   "If Saddam is going to move militarily, he's going to do
it very soon," says William Cohen of Maine, the ranking
Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
"He won't want to wait until we have everybody in place
there."
   One flashpoint may come as soon as today, when an
Iraqi-owned supertanker attempts to take on Iraqi oil from
the Saudi oil terminal at Yanbu in the Red Sea. According to
industry and other sources, the Iraqis may be using the ship
to force a confrontation with a powerful U.S. naval force
situated near the port. The U.S. hasn't formally declared a
blockade, but U.S. forces are unlikely to simply let the
Iraqi ship pass.
   Both Iraq and the U.S. yesterday appeared to move closer
to confrontation in their public statements. Iraq declared
that it had formally annexed Kuwait, dropping all pretense
that it intended to pull out of the nation it invaded last
Thursday. Referring to the buildup of Western forces in the
region, Iraq said, "We will fight your criminal force. . . .
The blood of our martyrs will burn you."
   President Bush, saying that "a line has been drawn in the
sand," vowed in a televised address that he wouldn't tolerate
the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The president stressed that
U.S. troops are intended to defend the Saudi kingdom, not to
drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   The president said he hopes to free Kuwait through
economic pressure on Saddam Hussein, which continued to mount
as the world's oil-consuming nations -- and, just as
importantly, many of its leading oil producers -- joined
together in a campaign to cut off Iraqi oil without causing
global economic dislocation.
   The Arab world continued trying to sort out its response
to the action in the Middle East. Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak called for an emergency meeting in Cairo today at
which Arab leaders will agonize over whether to support
putting a multinational army in the path of Saddam Hussein.
King Hussein of Jordan, who had been supportive of Iraq, said
he would refuse to recognize the official annexation that
Saddam Hussein announced yesterday in Bagdhad.
   The most pressing question on the minds of many now is:
Just how tough is Iraq? Its army, battle-trained and wielding
the most modern Soviet-made tanks and air-defense weapons,
has already impressed U.S. experts with the skill and
efficiency of its 2 a.m. blitzkrieg attack on Kuwait last
Thursday.
   Its airpower is no match for the U.S. But on the ground,
where any confrontation would be likely to matter most in the
opening scenes, the Iraqi army is far from the rag-tag
assemblage it was 10 years ago when it first attacked Iran.
   The prospect of facing hundreds of thousands of soldiers
in the desert is daunting enough for the U.S., but Iraq's
chemical arsenal adds an additional dimension to the threat.
The Iraqis have moved surface-to-surface Scud missiles into
Kuwait -- missiles that can carry chemical warheads.
President Bush yesterday singled out chemical weapons. Their
use, he said, "would be intolerable." He added: "It would be
dealt with very, very severely."
   The potential U.S. response to a chemical weapons attack,
according to U.S. officials, could include raids from B-52's
now positioned on Diego Garcia, a base in the Indian Ocean.
Their most likely aim would be to pulverize Iraq's most
sensitive weapons facilities, including those that produce
chemical weapons and those that are experimenting with
missiles and nuclear and biological weapons. Another possible
bombing target, of course, might be Saddam Hussein himself.
   It remained unclear precisely what force the U.S. is
dispatching to meet the 100,000 or more heavily-armored Iraqi
troops massed on Kuwait's border. President Bush, Secretary
of Defense Richard Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, refused to disclose
the size of the force they have committed. "We will deploy
adequate forces for the mission," said Gen. Powell.
   Privately, U.S. officials say the estimates for the
eventual U.S. commitment of troops, which began landing at
Saudi bases yesterday afternoon, go as high as 40,000, and
would include a carefully-tailored mix of light and armored
units that may have to remain there for weeks or months. The
duration of the U.S. commitment will, the officials added,
depend on Iraq's response.
   As time passes without an Iraqi military move, the U.S.
position grows stronger, military experts say. "Every hour
that goes by without an attack now is good," said Paul K.
Davis, director of strategy assessment at the Rand Corp. in
Santa Monica, Calif. "It indicates that he {Saddam Hussein}
is probably facing up to the fact that things have not gone
his way in the world."
   Mr. Davis, who previously worked on Middle East deployment
scenarios in the Pentagon, expects that it will take "days,
not hours" for the U.S. soldiers and airmen arriving to
acclimate themselves to the hot desert arena where they may
have to fight.
   The use of chemical weapons by Iraq would make the battle
conditions all the more intolerable -- necessitating gas
masks and rubberized suits in an area where temperatures
regularly exceed 100 degrees. "The really appalling thing for
American forces on the ground is the fact of being forced
into anti-chemical warfare gear which will be quite
intolerable in the desert," said Elizabeth Sigmund, a British
chemical-weapon expert. "Let's hope they don't have to."
   By her measure, Iraq has stockpiled thousands of tons of
mustard gas, a World War I chemical that burns the skin. It
may also have hundreds of tons of Sarin, a nerve gas
developed from insecticides by the Germans in World War II.
One drop on the skin can cause convulsions and sudden death.
   Among Mr. Bush's advisors, though, Gen. Powell expressed
the most confidence about the outcome. He pointed out that
the 3,000 paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division that
were now encamped in the desert, primarily to guard U.S.
fighter aircraft, have been trained to fight in heavy,
charcoal-impregnated chemical weapons gear in the deserts of
California.
   Even the mere threat of chemical weapons may have a
powerful psychological effect on troops and civilians --
especially technicians in the Saudi oil fields, who are
particularly important now that the Saudis are being counted
on to increase oil output significantly.
   But no one can predict the mind of Saddam Hussein. Instead
of ordering his tanks, troops and chemical warheads into
Saudi Arabia, he has the opportunity to create an incident
today, using the supertanker that arrived at the Saudi port
of Yanbu yesterday.
   The port sits at the end of one of the major pipelines
from Iraq's oil fields. If, as some industry and other
officials believe, the captain demands that the Saudis honor
their contractual commitment to fill the tanker, the U.S.
will have to decide whether to stop the giant ship, using the
awesome combat power of the nearby carrier Eisenhower and its
twelve escort ships.
   While pondering his water options, Saddam Hussein must
weigh his major vulnerability to attacks from the air. More
than 100 U.S. aircraft, largely F-15s coming from Langley Air
Force Base in Virginia, have already arrived to augment the
two carriers and their 80 warplanes each.
   Geoffrey Kemp, a former National Security Council Middle
East specialist now at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, says that despite its hard-fought years
up against Iran, the Iraqi army has never before been
confronted with that kind of air power. Indeed, most of
Iran's jet fighters were either destroyed in the early days
of the war or were grounded for lack of spare parts.
   "I think we're overestimating the ease with which he can
roll into Saudi Arabia," Mr. Kemp said.
   Although the sudden U.S. moves to Saudi Arabia may seem
ad-hoc, they draw on the experience of many war games, such
as the one staged in Leavenworth last June by the Army
Materiel Command. The Army's Saudi games began more than ten
years ago, when U.S. and Saudi officials began to worry that
Soviet armored forces could quickly sweep down through Iran
or Iraq and take the oil fields. U.S. policy assumed then
that the Saudis would not give U.S. forces basing rights, at
least not in the initial stages of a conflict.
   The real-life scenario began Saturday when, according to
Mr. Cheney, the White House began planning to send him to
Saudi Arabia. The following afternoon, he and Robert Gates,
the president's deputy advisor for national security; Paul
Wolfowitz, Mr. Cheney's top policy aide; and Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, soon to become overall commander of the growing
nucleus of U.S. forces, were aloft.
   In Jeddah, after two hours of discussion, King Fahd, the
Saudi ruler, gave his approval to the military options the
U.S. officials presented. As Mr. Cheney put it, the Arab
leaders agreed that Saddam Hussein's menacing behavior
"represented a qualitative shift in the rules of behavior" in
the Middle East.
   After the Sunday meeting, Mr. Cheney immediately called
President Bush and the president authorized him to give the
orders to the Joint Chiefs to set their plans in motion,
assigning specific U.S. units. The orders were issued Monday
evening, and the first U.S. unit to move -- believed to be
the command staff of Gen. Schwarzkopf's Central Command at
Tampa, Fla. -- took off at 7:30 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
   By midnight, paratroopers of the Ready Brigade of the 82nd
Airborne Division, the nation's most often-alerted unit, were
lining up at Pope Air Force Base in Fayetteville, N.C., to
take their places on the hard, nylon-webbing seats in the
transports that would carry them and their hastily-assembled
gear on the long trip across the Atlantic.
   Meanwhile, flight after flight of F-15's was taking off
from Langley Air Force Base heading east, seeking the line of
airborne tankers that were hovering, mid-ocean, to refuel
them. What military planners call the "aluminum bridge"
across the Atlantic was now in operation.
   Hundreds of Air Force reservists -- men and women with
practiced skills in the art of airlifts -- were moving across
the U.S. to help prepare other units. Army reservists
prepared mechanized infantry units, which will likely use
eight fast "roll on roll off" ships to carry them across the
Atlantic and through the Suez Canal.
   In the Indian Ocean, the Navy was moving special
pre-positioned ships toward the Gulf from their base at Diego
Garcia. They are designed to supply Marine forces, which can
be flown rapidly from U.S. bases to "marry up" with their
equipment at points where the ships arrive. Indeed, according
to the Associated Press, hundreds of marines had already
appeared last night near Khafji, an oil-terminal city near
the Saudi border with Kuwait where the Japanese-owned Arabian
Oil Co. operates. That may indicate that the job of
protecting the oil fields belongs to the Marines.
   Gen. Powell dismissed concerns that the early arrivals
might face the greatest danger, saying that fighters and
attack aircraft from the carrier Independence, believed to be
in the Gulf of Oman, were close enough to the Saudi shore to
provide air cover to the arriving troops. The Eisenhower,
from its position in the Red Sea, can also hit Iraq. Soon a
third carrier task force, led by the Saratoga, will arrive in
the Eastern Mediterreanean, putting it within lethal range.
That group includes the battleship Wisconsin, carrying cruise
missiles that can be aimed precisely toward Iraqi targets.
   Each carrier hauls a kind of mini-Air Force, including
radar search planes and planes specially equipped to jam
enemy communications and radars, along with a powerful
assemblage of bombers and fighters. The planes use special
"buddy stores," or refueling kits that would allow them to
reach their targets in the area -- generally more than 600
miles, or a little more than an hour's flying time, away --
and return safely.
   Summing up his views of the potential enemy, Gen. Powell
said, "We view them as a capable military force. But they're
not invincible and they're not ten feet tall."

   Oil Companies Bend in Wake of Public Outcry

   A Guide to Why
   And What Next
   At the Pump

   Consumers are steaming over the unprecedented gasoline
price run-up that began literally overnight following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait last week.
   Since Aug. 1, pump prices have jumped more than 16 cents a
gallon to an average of $1.24 a gallon. Each day at that
level costs U.S. motorists about $50 million more than before
the Middle East crisis began.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Politicians berated oil-industry executives in hearings on
Capitol Hill Tuesday. And yesterday morning President Bush
publicly admonished oil companies to do their "fair share"
during the crisis to "show restraint" with gasoline prices.
Still, despite all the furor, considerable confusion remains
about just who did what and why -- and what might happen at
the gasoline pump next.
   Here are some commonly asked questions:
                                                                                                       

   Q: Oil prices fell sharply yesterday, so can we expect
gasoline pump prices to fall overnight the way they rose
overnight?
   A: Not that fast. It looks like some are headed down, but
don't rush out looking for a bargain everywhere this morning.
Gasoline in the commodity market fell more than six cents a
gallon yesterday, and Phillips Petroleum Co. cut wholesale
prices some yesterday. Atlantic Richfield promised to freeze
prices for a week. BP and Chevron Corp. say they are holding
for now.
   Don't look for huge declines, though. You may think you
have been gouged by the price run-up, but oil companies think
you have been lucky. They say crude prices jumped as much as
$10 a barrel since early July; that should translate into at
least a 25-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline prices once the
crude is refined. So by that reckoning, prices still aren't
up enough.
   But back to the price-lag question. "Retail prices go up
much faster than they come down," says a spokesman for the
Automobile Association of America. And he's right. Some
experts suggest that's because it's generally a dramatic news
event that triggers an upswing and the slow-moving
marketplace that brings prices down. If the marketplace lets
a company hold onto a higher price, it does.
                                                                                                       

   Q: It sure sounds like oil companies are ripping us off;
are they?
   A: There's no doubt Big Oil is making a lot more money now
than a month ago, mostly because it's selling its crude for a
lot more money. Its refinery profit margins of well over $4 a
barrel are also high right now, because it is, indeed,
selling high-priced gasoline that was made with $18 crude
instead of $28 crude. But oil companies are telling the truth
about what happened at the pump; competition actually
restrained gasoline price increases until the Iraqi invasion.
In July, companies weren't able to pass along rising crude
costs into gasoline pump prices.
   Third-quarter and especially fourth-quarter profits could
be enormous if these market conditions last, but companies
may try to mask some of that surge. "All the companies have a
huge piggy bank that allows them to hide gains of an
extraordinary type" in their earnings reports, says Bernard
Picchi, a Salomon Brothers Inc. oil analyst, referring to oil
companies' ability to take certain charges at times of their
choosing.
   At the retail level, location can determine whether
dealers are experiencing a windfall. "If he doesn't feel any
competition, he's free to charge whatever he wants to
charge," Mr. Picchi says. But if a dealer is competing
against a company-owned service station in a heavy-traffic
area, odds are he's facing some price heat and his margin may
actually have been cut by the price rises.
                                                                                                       

   Q: What can I do about all this?
   A: A few things could ease your pain. If you're buying
higher-priced, high-octane gasoline, check the owner's
manual. You might be pleased to discover you don't need it.
Octane of 87 is sufficient for the vast majority of cars on
the road today, auto makers say. The price difference between
regular unleaded and super unleaded can be as high as 20
cents a gallon, so if you drop all the way from premium to
regular, you've eliminated all of the recent price boost.
Voila -- and your car is still happy.
   About 30% of all gasoline sold is super unleaded; "oil
companies are really making a killing" on that growing
consumer habit, Mr. Picchi says. He figures motorists are
unnecessarily "octaning up" to the tune of $3.8 billion a
year.
   Obviously, you can also keep an eye out for the cheapest
station regardless of the brand. There are still many local,
cut-rate brands around. And you usually don't have to worry:
"Gasoline is gasoline," Mr. Picchi says. In fact, it's common
for one company to sell another company's gasoline under its
own brand name, and for off-brand stations to buy from
brand-name refiners.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Why don't companies wait to raise prices until that
higher-priced crude actually arrives as gasoline at the
corner service station?
   A: Companies say they must base their gasoline prices on
the "replacement cost" of the crude oil they are buying in
today's markets. About two-thirds of all the oil imported to
the U.S. is priced at a "spot market" cost once it hits U.S.
shores, so companies are immediately paying for higher-priced
crudes to fuel their refineries. "People think oil prices
take 60 days to pass through the system, but that's not the
case," says Ken Miller, a senior principal at the consulting
firm Purvin &amp; Gertz Inc. in Houston.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Do oil companies talk to each other about price?
   A: God forbid, they say. "We have no conversations with
other oil companies on price," says Robert Rauscher,
marketing vice president for Amoco Corp. "We make doggone
certain we don't even come close." One public relations
executive for a major oil company says he was lectured for
several hours earlier this week by company lawyers on
antitrust law. "They're absolutely paranoid about signaling
price changes," the executive says. "It's a very sensitive
and real issue."
                                                                                                       

   Q: How come gasoline prices moved up seemingly in unison?
   A: The gasoline market, like the crude oil market, is an
international commodity market, and prices have surged across
the globe for the same reason in each -- fear of supply
disruption. Traders looking at computer screens from New York
to Singapore, as well as giant companies, big wholesalers and
even corner service stations, all know the up-to-the-minute
price. "We look at gasoline prices every day," says Amoco's
Mr. Rauscher.
   At corner service stations, the cause is a little
different. They generally don't have much inventory and get
new shipments often. "The average guy in the corner station
has a supply of less than a week," Mr. Rauscher says. "The
product moves through {the entire system} very rapidly." So
when the truck arrives and the station operator has to pay
more immediately, he raises his price accordingly -- and
immediately.
   In addition, gasoline imports play a big role. The U.S.
imports about 16.8 million gallons of gasoline a day from
places like Europe and South America, and most of the time
when it arrives here, it commands the spot commodity-market
price, not the price that prevailed when it left home. Plus,
some gasoline-exporters now are holding onto inventories,
driving the price of foreign gasoline up more. Europeans in
particular, says Mr. Miller of Purvin &amp; Gertz, "are going to
be holding onto their own {gasoline} there."
                                                                                                       

   Q: Couldn't a company hold the line or undercut its
competitors and try to gain market share?
   A: It could, but most experts agree that would be risky.
If a refiner's wholesale price is way below everybody else's,
then every dealer in town could head for that terminal to buy
gasoline, creating a run on supply.
   BP learned that the hard way on a small scale this week.
"I was out of line in price in Toledo, Ohio, and my terminal
was cleaned out," says Hugh Hanna, senior vice president for
retail marketing for BP America Inc. All it took was a gap of
five cents per gallon. What hurt even more is that five of
BP's retail stations weren't able to get any gas from the
terminal and had to close, Mr. Hanna says. "It's a very, very
small example that could be magnified all over the world."
   The same holds if a corner station sets a significantly
lower price; word travels fast. That dealer would get a ton
of business -- maybe even have lines at the pumps -- until he
ran out. Then he'd be out of business. If he couldn't buy,
beg or borrow more, a tough proposition in this market, he'd
risk alienating regular customers.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Shouldn't Washington lawmakers carry a big stick and
just legislate gasoline pricing?
   A: "They can legislate all they want," BP's Mr. Hanna
says. "But as long as we're dependent on imported crude, the
world will determine what the price will be." If lawmakers
try to set prices that are below world market prices, then
the U.S. simply "won't get any," Mr. Hanna says. Mr. Picchi
of Salomon Brothers recalls that gasoline price and
allocation controls of the 1970s actually caused shortages in
some areas.

   NEW YORK -- Continental Corp., an insurer, reported that
its second-quarter net income plunged 96% to $2.5 million, or
two cents a share, from $65.2 million, or $1.18 a share, a
year earlier.
   The company blamed the continued weak pricing environment
in the property-casualty segment of the insurance industry
for the sharp decline in earnings. Continental also said
realized capital losses and higher underwriting losses
contributed to the profit drop. It posted a realized pretax
capital loss of $11.8 million in the second quarter, compared
with a realized gain of $37.4 million a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Continental shares closed at $26.75, down 37.5 cents.
   The soft pricing cycle has hurt other property-casualty
companies. But Udayan Ghose, an analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said Continental's outlook is worse, because it
still sells primarily basic property-casualty insurance, and
it hasn't been entirely successful in carving out a regional
or product niche for itself in recent years.
   Mr. Ghose noted the weak earnings and negative cash flow
are draining Continental's capital, forcing it to pay its
hefty $2.60-a-share quarterly dividend out of surplus, rather
than earnings. The insurer hasn't covered its quarterly
dividend payments from earnings since 1987, the analyst said.
Yesterday, Mr. Ghose reduced his estimates for 1990 earnings
by 30 cents, to 90 cents a share, and for 1991 net income to
90 cents a share from $1.70.
   Continental's net for the first six months fell 68% to
$34.7 million, or 60 cents a share, from $109.4 million, or
$1.98 a share, a year earlier.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Department of Insurance
ordered Safeco Insurance Co. to roll back rates by $41
million and California State Automobile Association by $92
million in a test of the agency's authority under the
Proposition 103 insurance-reform initiative.
   Proposition 103 required the state's property and casualty
insurers to cut rates by 20%. But the state supreme court
subsequently held that any rollbacks couldn't deprive
insurers of a "fair" rate of return. The state insurance
commissioner, Roxani Gillespie, has set that rate at 11.2% in
figuring rollbacks, although the insurance industry is
continuing to challenge that rate in court.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The department set hearings for Sept. 17 on the proposed
rollbacks for Seattle-based Safeco, and CSAA, which has
offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and both entities
said they would contest the orders. CSAA is nonprofit
motorists' association.
   Proposition 103, in theory, subjects roughly 600 insurers
in the state to rollbacks, but the cuts are expected to be
relatively small because of the state high-court ruling.

   Suntory Ltd. of Japan, a privately held beverage and food
concern, said first-half pretax profit fell 10% to 5.05
billion yen ($33.6 million) from 5.63 billion yen a year
earlier, citing higher interest and investment costs.
   Net income declined 15% to 2.07 billion yen from 2.42
billion yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales rose 2.2% to 361.8 billion yen from 354.08 billion
yen, partly because of changes in Japan's tax structure.
Sales of alcoholic beverages, excluding beer, fell 5% to
204.429 billion yen from 215.19 billion yen. But Suntory
noted that the basis for the year-earlier comparison was
distorted by a consumption tax that was introduced in April
1989 and replaced higher taxes on hard liquor and wine. Sales
of beer increased 2.6% to 96.16 billion yen from 93.76
billion yen. Sales of foodstuffs rose 36% to 61.204 billion
yen from 45.127 billion yen.
   During the half, Suntory bought Cerebos Pacific Ltd., a
Singapore holding company with interests in the manufacture
and distribution of foodstuffs.

   Tokyo stock prices rebounded sharply following a series of
steep declines since Iraq invaded Kuwait a week ago.
   London stocks ended fractionally better in hectic, choppy
trading, as investors assessed the minute-by-minute
developments in the Middle East.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Tokyo, after a volatile morning session, stocks rose
steadily in the afternoon encouraged by firming bond prices,
traders said. Both markets responded favorably to reports
that Saudi Arabia had agreed to increase oil output to help
make up for the shortage in world supplies because of the
embargo of Iraqi oil.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues ended Wednesday at
28509.14, up 856.07 points. Thursday morning in Tokyo,
however, stocks fell 247.26 points to 28261.88.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
580 million shares, up from 526.4 million shares Tuesday.
Advancers outnumbered decliners 819 to 173, while 102 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section gained 53.60 points, or 2.62%, to 2100.02.
   The second section index rose 75.06 points, or 1.87%, to
4090.69. Volume in the section was estimated at 14.1 million
shares, in line with 14.4 million shares Tuesday.
   Observers saw Wednesday's sharp advance as a technical
rebound from repeated plunges over the previous five trading
days, during which the Nikkei Index dropped 3382.59 points,
or 10.9%.
   The market opened with more buy orders than sell orders
for the first time since Friday, as overnight stability on
overseas stock markets helped to encourage institutional
buying of oversold large-capital stocks, traders said.
   "Investors regained calmness," compared with Tuesday, when
they sold in panic on the "oil shock," said Takatoshi
Okuyama, general manager of the investment advisory
department at Daiwa Securities. Even discounting the possible
impact of the Iraqi issue on the Japanese economy, stocks had
been oversold, he said.
   Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock trading at Nikko
Securities, said, "We're not overjoyed with Wednesday's
rebound," noting that uncertainty about Persian Gulf tension
hasn't changed.
   "In addition to the fact that Japan has enough oil
reserves, which ensures oil supply in terms of quantity,
Saudi's decision to increase output reduced fear for higher
oil prices," Mr. Murai said.
   "But any reverse move can push back stock prices down," he
said.
   "Both interest rates and oil prices remain high. Investors
who bought {Wednesday} are ready to dump the shares at any
moment," he added.
   A broad range of large-capital shares were targets of
institutional and dealer buying. These interest
rate-sensitive shares had plunged in the past week on
interest rate surges. But institutions such as life insurance
companies decided these shares had neared bottom, traders
said.
   All of the Big Five steel makers climbed above 500 yen
($3.32) Wednesday, with Kawasaki Steel up 32 yen to 514 yen
and Nippon Steel up 41 yen to 531 yen.
   Among shipbuilders, IHI was up 55 yen to 900 yen, while
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained 25 yen to 855 yen.
   Construction shares also advanced. Ohbayashi increased 70
yen to 1410 yen and Shimizu rose 100 yen to 1750 yen.
   Resource shares advanced strongly on rising oil prices.
But the issues finished well below intraday highs as the
report of increased oil production by Saudi Arabia prompted
selling in the afternoon session, traders said.
   Mitsubishi Oil gained 50 yen to 1320 yen.
   Nippon Oil was up 70 yen to 1450 yen. Teikoku Oil, which
owns a natural gas field in Japan, finished at 1820 yen, up
300 yen.
   Meanwhile, "confusion remains extremely high in world
equity markets," said Paul Harrison, a vice president at
Salomon Brothers International in London.
   "Money managers don't have a clear view on how the Middle
East situation will resolve itself over the next days or
weeks. Volatility is expected to remain high with constant
watching of the news tapes for the next five-minute trend,"
he added.
   On balance, the flood of major U.K. corporate news was
reasonably good, traders said, but the impact on the market
was negligible, given the environment in the Persian Gulf.
   Shares opened on a strong footing but were reduced to
losses as war rumors flooded the market. However, stocks were
driven from midafternoon lows on an early burst on Wall
Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
1.7 points to 2237.5. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
edged up 0.1 point to 1748.5. Volume was 429.2 million shares
compared with 497.5 million Tuesday.
   Throughout most of the session, investors awaited remarks
from President Bush on the deployment of U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia. These remarks were followed 90 minutes later by news
from Iraq that it is annexing Kuwait.
   The London market initially rose on these comments,
relieved the announcements "weren't of greater magnitude,"
said one trader. However, upon further reflection, some said
the developments thrust the spotlight back to the U.S., which
has said that one of its objectives in the Middle East is to
free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
   Oils stocks did well, with British Petroleum advancing 2
pence to 364 pence ($6.82), Enterprise Oil rising 3 pence to
693 pence, and Shell up 2 pence at 491 pence. Shell and BP
report second-quarter results Thursday.
   Even Ultramar, after reporting net profit slumped 42% to
#36.1 million for the first half, rose. The oil producer and
refiner's shares gained 7 pence to 354 pence.
   Dealers said part of Ladbroke Group's 10-pence fall to 291
pence is a perception that tourists would shy away from using
its Hilton hotels in the Middle East because of the tensions
there, dealers said.
   Standard Chartered gained 14 pence to 402 pence after
reporting pretax profit of #110 million for the first half.
The bank also maintained the dividend at 12.5 pence a share,
after earlier profit warnings.

   Commodities:
   Corn Futures Decline as Traders Expect a Rise
   In U.S. Crop Estimate; Soybean Prices Also Fall

   CHICAGO -- Corn futures prices drifted lower on traders'
expectations of an increase in the government's crop
estimate, which is to be released after the close of trading
today.
   Prices were also depressed by one commodity firm's
prediction of a cut in grain exports to the Soviet Union
during the next crop year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices also declined, but wheat futures
prices rebounded slightly as traders bought contracts to
offset those sold earlier.
   The government report, for July, is expected to predict an
increased corn crop this year based on "optimal growing
conditions" across much of the Corn Belt, said Richard Loewy,
president of AgResource Co., Chicago. He expects the
government figures to predict a corn crop of nearly 7.89
billion bushels, up from June's estimate of 7.85 billion
bushels. Crop yield should hover near the record of 119.8
bushels an acre, he said.
   Steven Freed, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago, predicted the July estimate could be as high
as eight billion bushels.
   A report from Sparks Commodities Inc. in Memphis, Tenn.,
that predicted lower grain exports to the Soviet Union in the
1990-91 crop year beginning Oct. 1 also depressed prices,
traders said. Sparks predicted that based on a bountiful
domestic grain harvest this season of about 218 million
metric tons, the Soviets may slash grain imports by more than
20% to about 28 million metric tons in the 1990-91 crop year.
By the end of the current crop year, the Soviets will have
imported nearly 36 million metric tons of grain, most futures
analysts estimate.
   Sparks officials declined to comment on the report.
   Some traders took issue with the Sparks figures, arguing
that the company was overestimating the Soviets' ability to
harvest their crop in light of widespread reports of fuel and
spare part shortages for combines and other Soviet farm
machinery.
   Soviet crop estimates are even more optimistic than that
of Sparks, "but they're throwing in carrots, peas and lettuce
too," quipped one futures trader.
   Corn futures for December delivery dipped 2.5 cents a
bushel to close at $2.4675.
   Soybeans also benefited from the good growing conditions
in most regions last month, although heavy rains earlier in
the year delayed planting and have resulted in a relatively
immature crop for this point in the growing season. Analysts'
soybean crop estimates ranged from 1.83 billion bushels to
1.842 billion bushels.
   The wet weather also resulted in only 58 million acres
being planted in soybeans this year, the lowest level since
1976, Mr. Loewy said.
   November soybean futures prices slid two cents a bushel to
close at $6.0725.
   The government report is expected to show that a bountiful
wheat harvest in the crop year ended May 30 boosted year-end
stockpiles by about 100 million bushels to more than 900
million bushels, analysts said. That compares with
year-earlier stockpiles of 530 million bushels.
   While such a sharp increase in wheat supplies would be
expected to depress futures prices, December wheat on the
Chicago Board of Trade gained 3.75 cents a bushel to close at
$3.005. Analysts said the price rebound was a technical
reaction to several days of lower futures prices.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: While some commodities that surged in response to
the Middle Eastern crisis, such as oil and gold, fell back
yesterday from recent advances, copper continued advancing.
Futures again established new life-of-contract highs across
the board. Demand was active, and prices ended with a closing
rush. The September contract settled with a gain of 3.65
cents a pound at $1.3095. The contract traded to its high of
the day of $1.3140 in the final minute of the session.
According to one analyst, the late buying was mainly
technical. Some computer-guided funds had been selling
contracts short in anticipation of price declines. Instead,
they rose. When they advanced above key resistance levels,
further buying was touched off. The commodity funds bought
back, or covered, their previous short sales toward the
close, analysts said. There were no new developments, but
trading continued to be fueled by Japanese and West European
demand for copper, analysts said. Steady demand from European
merchants has been present every day recently, one analyst
said. There has been concern since Iraq invaded Kuwait a week
ago that inflation induced by high oil prices could reduce
demand for copper. Analysts said that in light of that
perception, yesterday's softer oil prices could have created
some price support for copper. According to Richard Hirsch, a
metals broker for Sharps Pixley Inc., New York metal brokers,
copper's price surge has been accompanied by strong advances
in all other base metals, despite high oil prices. Also, he
said, there was strong demand for copper futures contracts in
London that was associated with the options market there.
Traders who have sold call option contracts have protected
themselves from strong advances in the copper price by buying
copper futures contracts. A call option is a right to buy the
underlying futures contract at a specified price within a
certain period.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Most futures prices eased. The December
gold contract was off $1.50 an ounce at $392.20. September
silver declined 1.8 cents an ounce to $4.87. Platinum for
October delivery was unchanged at $482.10. Analysts said
gold's slight decline was actually a very good performance in
view of yesterday's plunge in crude oil prices and the
strength of the dollar. J. Clarence Morrison, analyst for
Prudential-Bache, observed that underpinning the market and
giving gold support were a number of factors, including a
higher level of investor demand, a perceived rise in
inflation caused largely by higher energy prices, and the
instability created by the Mideast crisis.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices eased. The October contract was down
0.11 cent a pound to 10.39 cents. The Mideast crisis has had
a depressing impact on the world sugar market, one analyst
said, because it has damped demand from many of the countries
in that area, which are normally significant and steady
buyers of sugar. However, underlying support has come from
dry weather that has plagued Western Europe over the past two
years and has more recently intensified, particularly in
France. The sugar beet crop is now in its growing stage and
lacks necessary moisture for the development of the beet
content, said Peter Leavitt, vice president of Weather
Services Corp. of Bedford, Mass. Some parts of sugar-beet
growing areas in northern France since July 1 have received
only about 25% of their normal moisture, and in areas close
to and in Benelux countries, rainfall is down about 50% from
normal, Mr. Leavitt said. He also noted that very high
temperatures, between 95 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, have
accompanied the dryness, further complicating the problem. A
cold front moved through northwestern Europe a few days ago,
Mr. Leavitt said, but it didn't bring any rain with it. The
weather in East and West Germany isn't as dry, he said. The
outlook for Western Europe is for little precipitation, Mr.
Leavitt said. Harvest of the European sugar beet crop will
begin in September.

   Standard Chartered PLC of Britain, a banking concern,
posted first-half pretax profit of #110 million ($206.1
million), or 14.4 pence a share, which was in line with
market estimates and marks a modest turnaround from a loss of
#47.6 million, or 30 pence a share, a year earlier, when
results were hurt by extensive provisions for loans for
less-developed countries.
   Pretax profit was aided by a net reduction in total
developing-country provisions to #775 million from #876.1
million a year earlier. Pretax earnings before these
provisions fell 8% to #192 million from #208.2 million. But
pretax profit growth was held in check by tighter interest
margins, Third World loan sales, and relatively flat
operating results from African and Middle East operations, as
well as provisions against British corporate loans and some
troubles with advances in Australia and Hong Kong. The bank
had issued a series of profit warnings this year, largely
because of its exposure to some troubled British corporate
borrowers.

   Analysts Say Iraq Move to Have Little Impact
   On U.S. Defense Firms, but Some See Gains

DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)

   LOS ANGELES -- As unseemly as it sounds, arms makers know
that a little war can be good for business.
   After Iraq crossed the border into Kuwait late last week,
some defense stocks climbed 10%, even as the rest of the
market plunged on fears that higher oil prices would
accelerate inflation and, at the same time, prompt a
full-blown recession.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the past two days, the run-up has faltered a bit. But
the question remains: Just how much have the bellicose Iraqis
bolstered the fortunes of U.S. military suppliers?
   All in all, many securities analysts insist, very little
has changed during the past week to actually reverse the
deterioration of earnings and balance sheets across the
industry. "The rally has been driven by emotions, not
fundamentals," says defense stock analyst Michael Rosen of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham.
   "None of these companies are going to recover overnight,"
adds Howard Rubel, aerospace analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence. He
says that difficult-to-meet Pentagon contracting terms and
the melting of Cold War tensions will continue to take their
toll on most weapons producers and defense stocks, as they
have for the past year.
   Still, many predict that the situation in the Persian
Gulf, serious enough to trigger the dispatch of American
aircraft and soldiers to Saudi Arabia, will at least somewhat
slow the defense stock slide. And clearly, there are specific
Defense Department programs -- surface ships and fighter
jets, for instance -- that are likely to benefit from the
flex of Saddam Hussein's muscle if Congress decides to soften
plans for tough military spending cuts.
   "This is a stark reminder of the volatile world in which
we live and the irrationality of certain national leaders,"
asserts Stanley Pace, the chairman of General Dynamics. "This
fact necessitates that the U.S. remain militarily strong and
able to meet all contingencies."
   General Dynamics' lot, some think, has improved because
increases in orders for M-1 tanks and F-16 fighters are a
strong possibility. The company also makes submarines, and
virtually all firms that outfit the Navy may find Kuwait's
loss their gain. Among the biggest surface-ship makers are
Litton Industries and closely held Bath Iron Works. Robert
Costello, former Pentagon acquisition chief, says that one
area potentially spurred by the Iraqi incursion is fast
sealift ships, large vessels that are "swift and highly
flexible."
   Missile makers also may find more opportunities. Raytheon
is perhaps the most prominent producer of missiles, including
the Patriot, which the Saudis and Israelis want to add to
their arsenals. Iraq's show of force virtually ensures that
Congress will approve those sales, which could eventually
account for $2 billion or more in revenue. The Iraqi attack
also cements the relatively solid position of
defense-electronics companies such as Loral and E-Systems.
   But for every defense dollar that pours into one of these
projects, it likely takes away from another program. Even
after the Iraqi assault, for instance, the Senate proposed
scaling back the Strategic Defense Initiative, the
space-based missile shield known as "Star Wars."
   Strategic weapons, such as Northrop's B-2 Stealth bomber,
also shouldn't find much relief in the current climate.
Although some lawmakers argued this past week that Iraq's
actions were sound reason to keep the embattled program
going, the fact remains that the plane has been sold
primarily for its nuclear-bomb-carrying capability. "I'm not
sure that all the talk really changed any votes," says one
congressional aide. In the case of other programs targeted by
budget-cutters, such as Grumman's top-gun F-14 fighter, it
may simply be too late to try to save them.
   Of course, which companies ultimately win and lose will
depend a lot on whether Iraq dares to push into Saudi Arabia
and risk a major conflict. The trickiest thing to sort out,
meanwhile, are those companies that may see both pluses and
minuses as a result of the Iraqi onslaught.
   Take, for example, McDonnell Douglas. The nation's No. 1
defense contractor can certainly make a better case to
Congress now to keep open its F-15 fighter line; Saudi
Arabia, fearful of what Iraq's next move could be, is among
the countries that want more of the planes. In addition, the
company's C-17 military cargo aircraft is just the kind of
project that is likely to get a lift from the turmoil in the
Middle East.
   Yet McDonnell Douglas also has a $1.8 billion contract
with Kuwait to deliver 40 F/A-18 Hornet strike fighters
beginning in 1992. That sale suddenly becomes uncertain.
Moreover, a recession could have dire consequences for
McDonnell Douglas's massive commercial aircraft division.
   Boeing is another mixed bag. The company could conceivably
see its faltering military segment helped by the Iraqi
invasion. Along with Textron's Bell subsidiary, Boeing makes
the V-22 tilt-rotor Osprey. The White House wants to kill the
potential $20 billion program, but some analysts think that
lawmakers now will be more open to the aircraft.
   But, even more important, Boeing's robust passenger-jet
business could be hurt by an economic slowdown. Although a
rise in oil prices could eventually force airlines to buy
more fuel-efficient planes, Boeing would probably see orders
dropping off and options going unfilled, at least in the near
term.

   Bear Stearns Aide
   Suspended by SEC
   In Insider Case

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- A Securities and Exchange Commission
administrative law judge suspended a Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
broker for at least two years for his alleged role in a
celebrated insider-trading scheme involving former LTV Corp.
Chairman Paul Thayer.
   The decision, against William Mathis, an Atlanta sales
representative for the New York-based brokerage house, stems
from alleged trading on insider information in the takeover
bids by LTV for Grumman Corp., Anheuser-Busch Cos. for
Campbell Taggert Inc., and Allied Corp. for Bendix Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SEC said that Mr. Thayer, who was on the boards of
Anheuser-Busch and Allied, passed inside information to Billy
Bob Harris, a former A.G. Edwards &amp; Co. broker who, in turn,
tipped Mr. Mathis. In 1985, Messrs. Thayer and Harris pleaded
guilty to criminal charges of obstructing justice and lying
to the SEC during the investigation. They each received
four-year prison terms and later were forced to disgorge
profits.
   Mr. Mathis, the former captain of the New York Jets team
that won the Super Bowl in 1969, agreed to an SEC injunction
in 1988 the day before he was to be tried for his role in the
scheme. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, he agreed to
a settlement prohibiting him from violating securities laws
in the future.
   The SEC then attempted to sanction Mr. Mathis partly
because the agency said he netted more than $750,000 from the
transactions. But Mr. Mathis argued that he couldn't be
sanctioned in a way that would deprive him of his livelihood
without a separate finding by the agency that he violated
securities laws. Since he hadn't admitted any wrongdoing in
the consent injunction, he argued that SEC was overstepping
its authority.
   Mr. Mathis's lawyer said his client considers the two-year
suspension "absolutely unjustified." Mahlon Frankhauser, the
lawyer, said his client was being penalized "merely because
he agreed to the entry of an injunction without admitting or
denying any violations." Mr. Frankhauser said Mr. Mathis
probably wouldn't appeal the decision because "he has been
both financially and psychologically exhausted by the staff
of the Securities and Exchange Commission."
   An administrative law judge, Brenda Murray, rejected Mr.
Mathis's arguments, siding with the SEC that it was in the
public interest to bar him from the securities business. The
administrative law judge agreed with the agency that Mr.
Mathis lied to the SEC and to the New York Stock Exchange in
their investigations about the trading.
   For example, Mr. Mathis told the SEC that he borrowed
money from Mr. Harris's father to buy Grumman shares and that
Mr. Harris recommended that Mr. Mathis buy Grumman stock, the
administrative law judge said. But in earlier SEC testimony,
Mr. Mathis had told the agency that he never discussed
Grumman with Mr. Harris, she added.
   "Mr. Mathis's reasons for lying or misleading
investigating authorities . . . do not in any way excuse or
mitigate his actions," the administrative law judge said.
"The evidence is that his actions were deliberate."
   Bear Stearns Chairman Alan Greenberg said, "This is
something that happened in 1982, and I feel bad about the
whole thing. I certainly like Bill Mathis." A spokeswoman for
the firm said Mr. Mathis, who has been employed there since
1970, would be leaving within 15 days.
   Mr. Mathis can apply to be reinstated to the securities
industry in two years.

   Temple-Inland Inc., of Diboll, Texas, said its Inland
Container Corp. unit agreed in principle to acquire two
box-making companies and made plans to upgrade and expand an
existing mill. The combined costs of the acquisitions and
expansion will be about $100 million.
   Inland Container wouldn't say how much it intends to pay
for either Crockett Container Corp. of Santa Fe Springs,
Calif., or Pakway Container Corp. of Indianapolis. But Inland
Container said the two privately owned companies had annual
sales in their last fiscal years totaling about $115 million.
Inland Container said its 1989 sales exceeded $1.1 billion.
</LP>

   Inland Container said the acquisitions would increase its
corrugated-box production by about 10%. The company said it
intends to keep existing management at Crockett and Pakway.
   The two acquisitions are subject to the execution of
definitive agreements, Temple-Inland said.
   Temple-Inland is a wood-products and financial-services
company that earned $207.4 million last year, or $7.50 a
share, on revenue of $2.12 billion.

CORPORATE PROFILE (PRO)

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Frank Lorenzo, who seized on deregulation to
build one of the nation's largest airline companies in a
series of controversial mergers, is leaving the industry that
he helped transform.
   Beaten by waves of bad publicity that have swept his
latest endeavors, Mr. Lorenzo is expected to announce as
early as today that he is selling most of his stake in
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. (formerly Texas Air Corp.)
to Scandinavian Airlines System and stepping down as chairman
and chief executive officer, say people with knowledge of the
proposed move.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, Mr. Lorenzo would walk away with at
least $17 million, a large sum but a fraction of what he was
worth when his airlines were flying high. Industry sources
say he didn't want to sell his stake, but believed his
continued association with the company, and criticism of his
operating style, were hurting Continental's hopes for
recovery.
   Mr. Lorenzo has been a pioneer in the post-deregulation
airline industry, helping lead the way in merging carriers,
cutting fares and using bankruptcy protection to reorganize
and break up high-cost airlines. But his innovations brought
on debilitating labor strife, crippling debt loads and
another feature of the modern-day airline industry: service
problems.
   Now Mr. Lorenzo's latest airline deal appears to be his
last, at least for years to come. The proposed purchase would
raise SAS's interest in Continental Holdings to 16.8% in
terms of equity and 18.4% in terms of voting control. SAS
already owns 9.8% of Continental Holdings, and has a seat on
the company's board.
   SAS is said to be spending about $50 million on the
transaction, and is planning to install Hollis Harris, 58,
the president of Delta Air Lines, as president and CEO of
both Continental Holdings and Continental Airlines. Jan
Carlzon, SAS's chairman and a Continental director, would
become nonexecutive chairman of Continental Holdings. The
transaction requires approval from the U.S. Department of
Transportation but doesn't violate laws governing how big a
piece a foreign carrier may own of a U.S. airline. That limit
currently is 25%.
   A Continental spokesman declined to comment on the
proposed transaction. Lars Bergvall, SAS's chief operating
officer, said he had no comment.
   Under the agreement, SAS will buy out Mr. Lorenzo's
five-year employment contract, which calls for a base salary
of $365,000 a year plus bonuses and deferred compensation of
at least $570,000. SAS is also buying all the shares of Jet
Capital Corp., a personal investment company owned by Mr.
Lorenzo and two other investors, who are selling their stakes
as well. Jet Capital's chief investment is in Continental
Holdings shares. Since there is no public market for Jet
Capital shares, their value lies in the voting power they
exert over Continental Holdings.
   Finally, SAS plans to purchase, at a premium, Mr.
Lorenzo's options to buy two million or more Continental
Holdings shares. Mr. Lorenzo will retain some of those
options and will remain on the board of directors. Under a
non-compete clause in his employment contract, Mr. Lorenzo is
obliged to stay out of the airline business for at least
seven years.
   The transaction has already received approval from the
board of Continental Holdings, sources familiar with the
transaction say.
   SAS is paying $14 a share for 2.25 million Continental
Holdings shares, almost all of which come from Mr. Lorenzo
and his two Jet Capital partners. That price is sure to sting
other common holders who have watched Continental Holdings
shares slide to yesterday's close of $4.50 a share on the
American Stock Exchange, down from about $23 a year ago. SAS
apparently chose to pay the premium in order to get the
additional voting rights that Jet Capital holds. There are
about 40 million Continental Holdings shares outstanding.
   Controversy is certainly nothing new to Mr. Lorenzo where
airlines are concerned. Over the last three years, the
50-year-old executive has been routinely vilified by Eastern
Airlines unions as they mounted a tough campaign to fight his
attempts to lower labor costs at that former unit. The result
was a bruising strike begun in March 1989 that virtually
grounded Eastern and sent that carrier careening into Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceedings, from which it still hasn't
emerged.
   Last April, the bankruptcy court judge, Burton R. Lifland,
took control of Eastern from Mr. Lorenzo, placing the carrier
in the hands of a trustee, Martin Shugrue Jr.
   That entire episode so demoralized the Texas Air empire
that it sought to distance itself from its past, changing its
name and severing all ties to Eastern. The body blows from
the Eastern affair also led to Mr. Lorenzo's decision to
leave the airline business, according to people who know him.
   The Eastern episode, which included critical headlines and
pickets outside Mr. Lorenzo's exclusive River Oaks home in
Houston, took a considerable toll on the intensely private
man and his family. He took to hiring bodyguards.
   That was in marked contrast to the Frank Lorenzo who
wrested control of Continental in 1982 in the nation's first
hostile takeover of an airline. Mr. Lorenzo, a graduate of
Harvard University's business school, had been looking for
ways to expand his Texas International Airlines, a small
regional carrier. At the time, Continental was a staid
carrier and money-loser.
   Within four years, Mr. Lorenzo had thrust the airline into
bankruptcy court, abrogated its union contracts and lowered
labor costs. He built back its operations until, in 1986, it
emerged from Chapter 11 protection having turned a profit.
   With low costs, Continental lured flyers by offering lower
fares, and a new generation of travelers took to the skies.
   But the growth of Continental itself has been anything but
steady, and Mr. Lorenzo discovered it was easier to build an
airline than to run it. Continental's top management has been
in constant turmoil, with seven chief executives in as many
years.
   But that didn't stop the acquisition-minded Mr. Lorenzo.
Riding high on deregulation, he and his Texas Air Corp. went
on to acquire People Express and Frontier and Eastern, all of
which were financially troubled. Texas Air already owned New
York Air. In 1987, Mr. Lorenzo folded all the airlines,
except for Eastern, into Continental, a merger that became
one of the airline industry's most difficult and costly.
   Continental's expansion, funded by junk bonds, was driven
by an ever-growing mound of debt, and was shaky at best. With
his new holdings, Mr. Lorenzo's empire -- briefly the largest
airline in the free world -- began to feel the full weight of
its debt: Texas Air rolled up . . . the airline industry's
largest losses ever in 1988 and 1989 -- $718.6 million and
$885.6 million, respectively.
   Mr. Lorenzo eventually broke the strike at Eastern, but
lost the airline. The labor action, mounted by Eastern's
machinists and supported by flight attendants and pilots, not
only forced Eastern into Chapter 11 protection but kept Mr.
Lorenzo in the spotlight: Angry strikers picketed the
nation's airports, handing out buttons and bumper stickers
emblazoned with the words, "Stop Lorenzo."
   But unlike his experience with Continental, Mr. Lorenzo
would not ride Eastern out of bankruptcy. After listening to
ever-smaller offers of repayment, Eastern's creditors ousted
Mr. Lorenzo and Texas Air from day-to-day control of Eastern.
   Texas Air changed its name to Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc. in June. But the parent still is on the hook
for Eastern's pension debt, which could total nearly half a
billion dollars. While Continental has made a dramatic
financial turnaround from last year and the year before, much
of its net income comes from one-time gains such as lawsuit
settlements and asset sales. Its debt service costs remain
high, and eat up much of its operating profits.
   For its part, SAS is 50% owned by the governments of
Sweden, Denmark and Norway. SAS's initial purchase of a 10%
stake in Continental, as well as a marketing agreement with
the carrier back in October 1988, has yielded many benefits.
Passenger traffic between May and December 1989 was up 40%
out of Stockholm and 100% out of Oslo, mostly because of
transfers at Continental's Newark hub.
   The company in recent years has undertaken a broad
expansion program, of which Continental is just a part.
   It now has equity stakes in Inter-Continental Hotels Corp.
(40%), Finnair (estimated 6%) and Swissair (5% to 10%, to be
finalized by the end of 1991). It bought a 24.9% stake in
Airlines of Britain PLC and 35% in LAN Chile. SAS also is in
the market for as many as 126 new MD-90s or A-320/A-321s
airplanes.
   Like other European carriers in highwage home markets, SAS
is having problems with costs. SAS has a hiring freeze and
has sold some ancillary businesses. Now its ambitious
expansion plans are being scaled back. Lars Bergvall, the
chief operating officer, said planned additions to the
airline's New York, Seattle and Los Angeles routes will be
scrapped, as will some other proposed route additions. SAS
has frozen its European fleet at its current size, and three
DC-9s are being sold earlier than planned.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Film:
   J.J. Gittes Returns in "Chinatown" Sequel
   ----

<LP>
   The 1974 movie "Chinatown" remains a stunning movie
despite -- or maybe because of -- its bleak soul. Director
Roman Polanski turned writer Robert Towne's intricately
plotted celebration of '30s detective pictures into a Gothic
commentary on the rottenness of humanity. It was Mr.
Polanski's idea to allow the story's incestuous villain to
get away with raping his daughter and then raping the land.
   Jack Nicholson, who played the cynical, honorable
detective J.J. Gittes with such bluff brilliance, would go on
to triumph many times again as an actor. But "Chinatown"
remained the best thing that had happened to producer Robert
Evans, to screenwriter Towne and to the director, Mr.
Polanski, who remains in exile 13 years after he was charged
with statutory rape. For Mr. Evans, in particular, trying to
relive the "Chinatown" experience became an obsession, or so
it has been reported frequently over the years. Now, he and
two of his former colleagues have done it in a sequel to
"Chinatown" called "The Two Jakes."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Given the enormous freight of ego and nostalgia it
carries, the mere appearance of "The Two Jakes" is a kind of
miracle and perhaps should be regarded as just that: not a
film so much as an archival object, a fascinating
documentation of a particular Hollywood fantasy at a moment
in time.
   Otherwise, taken out of context as a movie on its own
without historical reference, "The Two Jakes" is a mess.
   This is a shame because, in this era of RoboCop 2, we
could all use another "Chinatown." Besides, "The Two Jakes"
is prettier than most pictures being produced these days, and
more intelligent. Mr. Nicholson as director has relied on
cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond's astute eye to advantage;
"The Two Jakes" has a consistent and amusing period style.
And even under these difficult circumstances -- playing a
part in a movie that is all conception and the concept is
misguided -- Mr. Nicholson remains an actor you want to
watch. Even when what he's saying doesn't make very much
sense, there's a certain amount of pleasure in just listening
to the way he says it.
   According to various press reports, Messrs. Towne and
Nicholson couldn't agree on what the story should be. It's
ended up a weak imitation of the original, trying to tie in a
detective story about adultery with a larger story about
greedy developers ruining the Los Angeles landscape. The
second Jake is Jake Berman (Harvey Keitel), a real-estate
developer and cuckold who kills his wife's lover after he's
hired J.J. Gittes to incriminate the adulterers. As it turns
out, the two Jakes are linked to one another by the events
that unfolded in "Chinatown." Indeed, the plot of "The Two
Jakes," which is set in 1948, a decade and a war after
"Chinatown," relies greatly on regretful references to those
events.
   Perhaps recognizing the shaky structure of the new
material, Mr. Nicholson tries to pull the narrative together
with a lengthy voice-over. This only adds to the remote
feeling of the picture. One senses that the action has taken
place almost everywhere but where it should be taking place,
on the screen. Almost every scene seems to be missing
something, like a beginning and an end that logically connect
it to what happened before and what should be happening next.
   Not surprisingly, one of the few moments that has an
emotional pull takes place when J.J. Gittes rummages through
the newspaper accounts of the awful thing that happened in
"Chinatown." You can see from his face that he hasn't
forgotten -- and no one else has either.
   ---
   Watch out when these words precede the name of a talented
young film maker: "produced, written and directed by." Though
putting a film together requires tremendous single-mindedness
of purpose, this complex process can benefit from the
thoughtful outside voice.
   Spike Lee, however, has made a reputation with brash
brilliance, and he has been successful enough to convince
himself and, apparently, his backers that he doesn't need to
hear from anyone else. Yet almost every one of his pictures
has had notes so wildly off-key they become dangerous
distractions. In other words, a little advice wouldn't have
hurt.
   "Mo' Better Blues," Mr. Lee's latest film, may be his most
polished and his most flawed work so far. This piece about a
narcissistic horn player has a visual sophistication that
confirms Mr. Lee's position as one of the most exciting film
makers to emerge in recent years. More than almost any
director of his generation (he's in his early 30s), Mr. Lee
understands that the camera, too, can be as important an
actor as any of the human characters.
   Unfortunately, in this film his pictures vividly tell a
story that is superficial and lazy. Mr. Lee, the writer,
bothered only with show-business cliches, and only with
sketches at that. The slenderness of characterization and
thought is particularly disappointing from someone whose
films have always had an original vision. Even a jagged
picture like "School Daze" had at its core a fascinating
conceit, the battle between darker- and lighter-skinned
blacks on a college campus.
   Mr. Lee's uneven hand with actors seemed much steadier
with last summer's "Do the Right Thing." Here he's managed to
make even an agreeable performer like Denzel Washington seem
dull (except when performing the sly anti-rap, anti-love song
with lyrics by Spike Lee, in the picture's best scene).
However, the music, written once again by Spike's father,
Bill Lee, is terrific.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Movie cliches can become positively mesmerizing
when they're done with the sincerity manufactured in
Hollywood. There was something just great, for example, about
"Lady Sings the Blues," where Diana Ross did Billie Holliday
as only she could, and perhaps as no one else would want to.

   Researchers Say Drug to Treat Cancer
   May Help Sickle Cell Anemia Patients

   Medical researchers said an established anti-cancer drug
proved effective against sickle cell anemia in a small
clinical trial.
   If the results are borne out in larger studies, it could
lead to the first safe and effective treatment of the
disease, which affects 50,000 people, almost all of them
black, in the U.S. each year. The drug, hydroxyurea, has been
used to treat bone marrow disorders, skin cancer and
leukemia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the same trial, a new genetically engineered anemia
drug called erythropoietin, or EPO, yielded no improvement in
sickle cell patients, the researchers said.
   "We are very optimistic about this," said H. Franklin
Bunn, director of hematology research at Brigham &amp; Women's
Hospital, Boston, and a professor of medicine at Harvard
Medical School. "Treatment until now has been aimed at
getting patients out of acute pain crisis" and managing
symptoms while they are hospitalized, he said. "There's no
treatment that gets at the root cause of the sickling
process." In addition to relieving symptoms, the treatment
could yield huge cost savings, he said.
   The study included just five patients, and Dr. Bunn said
it is premature for the average doctor to administer the
treatment outside of an academic medical center. The study
appears in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Sickle cell anemia, named for the shape of red blood cells
among sufferers of the illness, is an inherited disease that
inhibits blood circulation, leading to joint pain, blood
clots, long-term anemia and loss of energy. The pain usually
comes in episodes, often with "explosive suddenness," Dr.
Bunn said. Symptoms can last from two to 10 days and often
require hospital treatment.
   Hydroxyurea stimulates production of a protein called
fetal hemoglobin, which blocks the sickling of red blood
cells. The protein is prevalent in the blood during fetal
development and up to about six months after birth, Dr. Bunn
said, when the gene responsible for its production switches
off. "But the gene is still there. You can look at
hydroxyurea as a way of reawakening the fetal hemoglobin gene
and getting it to go back to work."
   The five patients in the study were initially treated with
EPO, which is currently used to treat anemia in kidney
dialysis patients and which Dr. Bunn said increased fetal
hemoglobin levels in monkeys. Then three patients were given
doses of hydroxyurea. During a subsequent period, the three
patients were given both therapies in combination.
   The three patients on hydroxyurea reported markedly fewer
pain episodes, a subjective measure of effectiveness that Dr.
Bunn said was supported by analysis of blood chemistry. "They
are less anemic, their red blood cells survive longer, they
have less jaundice and they have less sickling," he said.
   But blood analysis during periods when the patients were
on EPO, with or without hydroxyurea, indicated EPO was
ineffective. "We are disappointed that it didn't work," Dr.
Bunn said, noting that there was no effect, even at very high
doses. That could rule out at least one potential market for
EPO, which is sold by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.
   Hydroxyurea, which is marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co., New York, costs about $500 a year for the average
patient, Dr. Bunn said, a price that could lead to "enormous
savings" if it keeps patients out of the hospital. An eight
to 10-day hospital stay could cost up to $10,000.
   Mark A. Goldberg, also of Brigham &amp; Women's hematology
division, was principal author of the study, which included
research done at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

   The following are letters to the editor to Friday, an
Oklahoma newspaper, by Lawrence E. Walsh, independent counsel
for the Iran-Contra prosecutions, and Robert L. Bartley,
editor of The Wall Street Journal. Friday, a weekly with some
18,000 circulation, covers the affluent areas in and around
Oklahoma City, including Nichols Hills, where Mr. Walsh has a
home.
   Mr. Walsh's letter was in response to an article in Friday
headlined "U.S. Top Dollar Prosecutor Is From Our Area,"
which cited L. Gordon Crovitz's May 30 Rule of Law column in
this newspaper, "Lawrence Walsh, Drug Cases and the Costs of
Selective Prosecution."

   Although I appreciate your interest in the work of my
office, I regret your reliance on the speculations of L.
Gordon Crovitz of The Wall Street Journal. He is a young man
who has had essentially no law practice experience and who
has never been responsible for litigation of any importance.
Neither is he a reporter. The Washington press corps, which
is perhaps the best in the world, keeps my office under
continued expert scrutiny. Mr. Crovitz is not a member of
that group, and is, in fact, avoided by the reporters of his
own publication.
   The fallacies of his various comparisons must have been
obvious to you. Essentially, he speculates as to the cost of
supporting government agencies and adds these exaggerated
estimates to the actual expenditures of my office. He then
compares this total with the actual cost of the offices of
United States Attorneys and the New York County District
Attorney without adding a comparable estimate of the cost of
their supporting services -- such as the New York City Police
Department and various government law enforcement agencies
such as the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, etc.
   He also attempts a cost-benefit evaluation based upon the
amount diverted to the Contras. In doing this he confuses the
standards of criminal and civil litigation. In civil
litigation a lawyer evaluates his probable recovery against
the cost of litigation. In criminal cases the recovery of
stolen proceeds is usually not the controlling consideration.
Incidentally, Mr. Crovitz's estimate of the amount of the
diversion is grossly wrong and the amount of probable
recovery is more like $8 million than $3 million.
   The expenses of the FBI and other government agencies
would have been substantially the same no matter who
prosecuted the case. For example, a large part of these
expenses, such as the archivists briefly assigned to the
White House, represent the cost of responding to discovery
demands of the defendant (Lt. Col. Oliver) North. These costs
were in no sense subject to the control of independent
counsel.
   Having said this, there is no question that the
prosecution by independent counsel is more expensive than a
routine prosecution. It is necessary to create a new office
with heavy overhead and the higher salaries of temporary
appointees. This becomes particularly onerous when it is
necessary to collect and store highly classified information.
The standards of security are prescribed by the intelligence
agencies, not infacility for the use of the defendants.
   Opinions may differ as to whether such a costly
prosecution should be undertaken. In this case it was the
opinion of the Reagan Administration -- through the Attorney
General -- and of the appointing court that this should be
done. There were no illusions that it would be cheap. It is
my responsibility to see that it is thorough. Actually, the
expenses of my office are reviewed in detail by the
Administrative Office of the Courts. They are updated each
month for the press. They are reported formally to the
appointing court twice a year.
   It is regrettable that The Wall Street Journal permits an
irresponsible journalist to use its editorial page. Mr.
Crovitz could have checked these facts with my office as more
experienced reporters do with regularity. This information is
equally available to Friday. My office telephone number is
202-383-8953. My home number is, of course, listed in the
Oklahoma City Directory.
   Lawrence E. Walsh
   ---
   Congratulations on your scoop on Lawrence Walsh's view of
the criticisms of his special prosecutor's office by our L.
Gordon Crovitz. The Wall Street Journal is also willing to
publish letters to the editor from offended officials, but
apparently responding to your story quoting Mr. Crovitz's
column struck Mr. Walsh as more important. While I understand
that you circulate among his wife's social set in Oklahoma,
both his forum and the personal nature of his attacks are at
best curious.
   Before dealing with the latter, a few words on the
substance. In an effort to arrive at an approximation of the
true cost of the Walsh prosecutions, Mr. Crovitz added to the
$20.8 million recorded in Mr. Walsh's office some $7.9
million the Justice Department estimated for indirect costs
such as FBI time. Mr. Walsh complains that in a cost-per-case
comparison with a normal U.S. attorneys' office, indirect
costs for the latter were not included. Mr. Walsh surely also
knows that the comparison was generous to his side in not
including in the case count the large volumes of civil
litigation covered by the budgets of U.S. attorneys. In any
event, I marvel over a mind that wants to nit-pick the
numbers given their result -- $20,242 per defendant for the
U.S. attorney in southern New York versus over $3 million per
defendant by Mr. Walsh.
   I marvel, too, over a mind that commits sentences like ".
. . a young man who has had essentially no law practice
experience and who has never been responsible for litigation
of any importance." Or ". . . is, in fact, avoided by
reporters of his own publication." Or "It is regrettable that
The Wall Street Journal permits an irresponsible journalist
to use its editorial page." One expects such language in
crank letters, not from an attorney holding a position of
responsibility and trust as a high public official.
   For the record, I count saving Mr. Crovitz from the law as
one of my life's accomplishments. He earned a degree in
jurisprudence as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, was the first
editorial page editor for our Wall Street Journal Europe, won
a law degree from Yale while continuing to work half time in
journalism. He is a member of the New York Bar, and got a
taste of law practice when Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, Mr. Walsh's
former Wall Street firm, thought enough of him to take him on
as a summer associate. In his short time there, as it
happens, he helped win a multimillion-dollar case; Robert
Fiske, Mr. Walsh's former partner, has been quoted in the
American Lawyer as saying that Mr. Crovitz was "the driving
force" behind the winning brief. This of course accounts for
the curious phrasing in Mr. Walsh's sentences on legal
experience.
   More to the point, Mr. Crovitz's journalism has become the
talk of the legal community. The New York Bar Association
gave him its first prize in its media awards for three years
in succession: 1987, 1988 and 1989. In the Loeb Awards for
Business and Financial Writing, he took first place in 1990
after having been a finalist or honorable mention in 1987,
1988 and 1989. His writings are often controversial, as an
opinion journalist's are supposed to be, but he is
increasingly recognized as the leading media commentator on
the law.
   By now, of course, the Circuit Court of Appeals has
overturned Mr. Walsh's conviction of Oliver North, and his
Poindexter conviction is jeopardized by similar error,
leaving him with even less to show for our $20.8 million,
$28.7 million or whatever. Mr. Walsh's real problem is not
irresponsible journalism. His problem is that the courts, not
overwhelmed by resumes, are ruling that Mr. Walsh has the law
wrong, and Mr. Crovitz has it right.

   Utility Debt Ratings
   Aren't Likely to Fall
   Due to Mideast Crisis

   NEW YORK -- The crisis in the Middle East is not likely to
have a significant impact on debt ratings of most utilities,
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said.
   Despite climbing oil costs, most utilities will be able to
protect their profits by passing along higher costs to
consumers, S&amp;P said in its CreditWire report. During the oil
price shocks of the 1970s, utility regulators in northeastern
states approved provisions that allow utilities to adjust
their rates to cover fuel increases. And some New England
utilities have added nuclear generating capacity or converted
plants to other fuels, S&amp;P said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consolidated Edison Corp. and Long Island Lighting Co.,
both in New York, face significant exposure to soaring oil
costs. Con Ed imports nearly 50 million barrels of oil a
year, while Lilco imports just over 20 million barrels. Under
current regulatory provisions, however, the two utilities
will be allowed to recover 100% of any increased fuel costs
by boosting consumer rates.
   But it remains unclear how regulators and political
leaders will react to steep rate increases that are only
partly related to the current oil crisis, S&amp;P said. Some
utilities, including Lilco, Boston Edison Co., New England
Power Co., Central Maine Power Co. and Commonwealth Energy
System, already had requested rate increases for unrelated
reasons.
   S&amp;P also predicted that utilities relying heavily on
natural gas may have a harder time recovering costs. That
could hurt utilities such as Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.,
Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. and New Orleans Public Service
Inc., units of Entergy Corp., given the tough regulatory
environments and weak economies they operate in.

   Unions Seeking UAL Win More Time,
   But Chances of Success Still Uncertain

TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)

<LP>
   The union group trying to acquire United Airlines' parent
UAL Corp. won a 60-day extension of today's deadline to
obtain financing for its proposed $4.38 billion, $201-a-share
buy-out.
   The UAL board also approved a possible restructuring of
the union offer in order to reduce the need for bank debt, as
long as the revised terms provide "commensurate value" in the
opinion of UAL's financial and legal advisers, First Boston
Corp. and Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the extension, which was expected, may do little to
improve the unions' chances of completing the acquisition.
Takeover stock traders remain skeptical. Although UAL stock
rose $13.50 a share to $114.50 yesterday in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, it remains far below the
nominal price of the union offer because traders doubt the
proposal will be completed.
   UAL's board, in granting the union group's request for
extra time, reserved the right to terminate the April 9
acquisition agreement at any time, and said "UAL will
terminate the merger agreement" if the unions can't obtain
financing by Oct. 9.
   Putting the extension on a day-to-day basis -- an
unexpected move by the board -- may hamper the unions'
ability to nail down financing by creating additional
uncertainty, one analyst said last night.
   The three UAL unions had asked for a 90-day extension
because "the recent turmoil in world oil markets had slowed
the progress of its discussions with financing sources." But
the group's progress had faltered even before Iraq invaded
Kuwait a week ago.
   The UAL board didn't give any indication whether it would
continue to hold off on placing an aircraft order valued at
about $10 billion so that the unions can attempt to obtain
financing from manufacturers of aircraft and engines.
   The unions have been trying to use the pending aircraft
order as bait to gain junior financing for the acquisition
from the suppliers. But Stephen Wolf, UAL's chairman, who
would lose his job if the union buy-out is completed, has
attempted to foil that strategy by seeking to place the order
promptly. Last month, the UAL board blocked that effort after
the unions protested.
   Currently, the union offer gives each UAL shareholder $155
in cash, $35 in notes, and a security representing proceeds
from the share of United's interest in its computerized
reservation system. The cash part of the offer alone would
require about $3.4 billion. A restructuring that reduced the
cash portion could reduce the unions' need for new bank debt.
   One person familiar with the buy-out proposal said that
four to five additional banks have indicated interest in
participating in a loan of about $2.5 billion for the
acquisition, in addition to the core bank group of Bankers
Trust New York Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp., and
Security Pacific Corp.
   Gerald Greenwald, who would become the airline's chairman
if the unions can complete the buy-out, told the board the
unions had made progress and would have lined up bank
commitments if it hadn't been for the Mideast war, according
to people familiar with details of the meeting.
   Yesterday's rebound by the UAL stock price was the first
since July 30, when it began a 62-point decline. That
sell-off began when three other banks withdrew from the
financing; it steepened when soaring oil prices raised the
threat of higher jet fuel costs and a general economic
slowdown that would cut airline profits.
   The stock rebound occurred on news that oil prices were
falling for the first time since Iraq invaded Kuwait, and on
speculation that the buy-out group would receive an
extension.

   CLOUDS GATHER in Bush's sky-high popularity.
   A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests that he
benefits strongly from foreign policy, where 67% approve of
the job he is doing -- precisely the same figure as his
overall job-approval rating. But he slides on handling of the
economy, where voters approve by only 48% to 41%. As recently
as April, the margin was 59% to 30%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Republican operatives privately worry about what they call
the "mood gap" -- the difference between Bush's high personal
ratings and growing public concern about the country's
course. In the new poll, 40% think the nation is headed in
the right direction and 37% see it on the wrong track; last
January, the results were 49% to 29%.
   "Unlike Reagan, I don't think Bush could survive a really
deep recession," says one top GOP strategist.
                                                                                                       

   CONFLICTING SIGNS on the economy fuel voter uncertainty.
   While the Journal/NBC poll found voters holding steady in
their own spending and savings plans, it also found a sharp
jump, to 26% from 13% in May, in people who aren't sure
whether they think there will be a recession in the next
year. And pending economic indicators will do little to
reduce the confusion.
   The Commerce Department reports that consumer confidence
is slipping, and next week's industrial production figures
are likely to continue to be weak. But today's retail sales
figures, boosted by a sudden jump in auto buying, will
probably show a rise after two months of steep declines, and
inflation figures due out today and next week will offer
further evidence of a moderating trend.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. HELP FOR MOSCOW moves forward despite Bush's
professed reluctance.
   The White House is actively working on steps that would
allow Moscow to raise large sums in the U.S. through big bank
loans and major dollar-denominated bond issues. In addition,
the administration leans toward approving government
guarantees for private financing of specific exports,
especially food. It may also back "humanitarian" shipments of
food and medical aid before next winter.
   Such private funding and loan guarantees would let Bush
prop up Gorbachev without the direct government spending that
could spark a political fight. In the Journal/NBC poll, 45%
of voters say the U.S. shouldn't aid the Soviet economy,
while 38% approve of doing so.
   U.S. officials are privately pleased with German aid to
Moscow, even though they doubt it'll be used wisely; Bonn's
action helps Gorbachev at no cost to Washington.
                                                                                                       

   MANDELA MAKES a good impression on U.S. voters. He is
viewed positively by a margin of 52% to 19%, and a majority
side with him in opposing the easing of sanctions on South
Africa. But by 54% to 32%, they also still oppose aid to his
African National Congress until it changes its policy of
armed conflict.
                                                                                                       

   A "RIGHT TO DIE" is strongly endorsed in the wake of the
Supreme Court's recent ruling. The Journal/NBC poll shows
that voters by a margin of three to one support allowing a
terminally ill patient to take his or her own life. An even
wider majority favors empowering families of terminally ill
persons in a coma to end life support.
                                                                                                       

   MAGGIE AND MIKHAIL run neck and neck in the race for
Americans' esteem. In the poll, 30% say they most admire
Britain's Thatcher among a list of foreign leaders, while 29%
cite Gorbachev. Thatcher does especially well among women and
Republicans, Gorbachev among men.
                                                                                                       

   WHO PAYS for the S&amp;L bailout? Please not us, say voters in
the poll. Only 6% would favor raising personal income taxes
and only 7% support borrowing the money. Twenty-nine percent
want a tax on all S&amp;L and bank deposits, and 30% would raise
other, unspecified taxes.
                                                                                                       

   VOTERS SCATTER on their priorities, puzzling the
politicians.
   The Journal/NBC poll finds that even formerly galvanizing
issues have lost some of their resonance. Last September, 43%
named drugs the nation's No. 1 problem; now only 13% do.
"That demonstrates people's despair," says Democratic
spokesman Mike McCurry. Agrees GOP pollster Linda DiVall:
"Voters just don't believe politicians are going to do
anything about it."
   With the consensus on national issues dispersing,
political operatives say the result will likely be a greater
emphasis on local issues, the candidates themselves, and
negative ads. "It means politicians will talk about
themselves -- or go heavily after their opponents'
drawbacks," says DiVall.
   GOP House campaign committee official Glen Bolger says
he's stopped asking about national issues in his surveys
because "we got tired of finding nothing out there."
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Washington Mayor Marion Barry, on trial on
drug charges, gains little sympathy. Voters view him
negatively by an overwhelming margin of 61% to 6%; among
blacks, he is viewed unfavorably by 47% to 19%. . . . By a
margin of 49% to 14%, Americans have a negative view of
Donald Trump, and 21% say they would be glad if he went
bankrupt. But 34% would be sorry.

   Advancing the Soviet president's campaign to maintain
control of the party while restructuring its leadership,
delegates to a party congress voted by a large margin to back
his proposal for bringing the party chiefs from the 15
republics into an enlarged Politburo. The new lineup means
that more moderates will be included in the policymaking
body, and that the restive republics will be given expanded
powers. The revised membership rules also will erode the
traditional domination of the Politburo by the Russian
hard-liners.

   GORBACHEV GAVE himself two years to improve the Soviet
Union's economy.
   On the third day of a Communist Party congress, the Soviet
president and party leader told a TV reporter, "I think that
in two years, if there are no changes, this leadership must
go." It was the first time he set a deadline for turning
around the country's economic and social problems. Contrary
to some expectations, the congress hasn't turned into an
all-out attack on Gorbachev, though both he and his Politburo
colleagues have taken sharp criticism. Instead, moderates and
hard-liners are engaged in a painful search for ways to
ensure the future existence of the party.
