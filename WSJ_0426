   LONDON -- Britain's trade deficit worsened surprisingly in
March, rattling London equity markets, and stirring fears
that United Kingdom inflation is resisting the Thatcher
government's assaults.
   The British current-account gap ballooned to #2.2 billion
($3.59 billion) in March from a revised February level of
#1.4 billion. Invisible items in the trade account, which
include services and investments, were in balance. Usually,
these have been in surplus and have partly offset the
shortfall in merchandise trade.

   The pound fell sharply against the West German mark in
European trading after the announcement was made, but it held
steady against the dollar.
   In a television interview, Chancellor of the Exchequer
John Major argued that the month's dismal trade figures
shouldn't be given too much weight. He noted that a
significant portion of the increase in imports involved
one-time transactions known as "erratics," which don't carry
much economic importance. Still, he offered little hope for
companies and mortgage-holders eager for a reduction in
Britain's base interest rates, which stand at 15%. "We will
have to sit it through for a little longer," he said.
   Tim O'Dell, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the
London-based securities firm, warned that an increase in
rates could be in the offing. Specifically, if trade figures
don't improve, and the Bundesbank pushes through an expected
interest-rate increase, "sterling would be under pressure and
that would tip the balance in favor of following suit," he
said.
   Britain imported #10.5 billion worth of goods in March,
7.5% higher than import levels a month earlier. For the first
quarter the value of imports was 5% higher than the previous
quarter and 11% higher than the same period a year earlier.
   Notwithstanding the role played by the so-called erratics,
the continuing import surge is stirring worries that the
government's policy of high interest rates isn't working as
fast as hoped.
   "Is this a warning that there may be a need to clamp down
further?" asked Mr. O'Dell. "It could be hard for the
government to reverse the inflation trend this side of the
election," which must be called sometime before mid-1992.

   The beauty was only skin-deep at Wilfred American
Educational Corp.'s beauty schools in Massachusetts: On the
surface, the schools appeared to be teaching an honest trade
to people sorely in need of training. But behind the scenes,
according to federal prosecutors, the schools were conspiring
with students to defraud Uncle Sam of loan funds.
   Wilfred's Massachusetts schools have closed, though the
company continues to operate 30 schools elsewhere. Wilfred,
which denies wrongdoing, faces a 12-count mail-fraud
indictment, handed up last October by a grand jury in federal
district court in Boston. And now Wilfred may be but a
harbinger for its huge industry: The federal government and
many states are escalating efforts to crack down on the
nation's more than 6,000 trade schools. The crackdown may
hamper the schools' efforts to expand their enrollments by
exploiting recent welfare reforms sparked by Congress.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To some, the problem illustrates a pitfall of many fields
dominated by small businesses. Like many other such fields,
the trade-school industry has a low cost of entry and
comparatively few nonfinancial barriers to hanging out a
shingle. At the same time, the huge number of players makes
it hard to regulate the field.
   Still, agencies are trying. Illinois, California, Georgia
and Florida already approved sweeping legislation aimed at
curbing abuses at trade schools. And more than a dozen other
states, including New York, are working on comparable new
laws.
   Not surprisingly, many trade schools hate the changes.
"The states are overreacting," said Stephen Blair, president
of the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools
Inc., Washington, D.C., an industry-sponsored accreditation
agency that represents 1,345 trade schools. "There was a
nationwide problem," he concedes, but he insisted that "it
represented only 3% to 5% of all schools." The trade group is
spending $1 million to lobby against proposed laws affecting
trade schools. Also, it and other accreditation agencies are
increasing their monitoring and analysis of the schools.
   But critics say abuses have been rife. Many schools have
shut without fulfilling their obligations to students, who in
fact are worse off because they are stuck with repaying loans
that financed their tuition. In New York state alone, more
than 120 trade schools have closed in the past three years
without fulfilling the enrollment agreement with their
students, according to Elizabeth Imholz, an attorney
representing students with claims against schools.
   Though most of them are fairly small, for-profit
vocational training institutions receive an estimated $2
billion a year in federal funds and enroll more than 1.2
million students. Their programs purport to teach such skills
as cosmetology, computer programming and truck driving. But
some people charge many schools don't adequately provide the
skills or services advertised and are established to generate
quick profits at the expense of mostly low-income students
and taxpayers.
   Nationwide, many of these schools follow a similar
strategy: They recruit low-income individuals, especially
those on welfare and thus eligible for maximum federal and
state aid. Many welfare recipients will soon be required to
enroll in educational training or job-related activities -- a
probable boon for the schools. But before being able to cash
in on this next funding surge, schools may face new curbs.
   Although criticism of the industry has been steadily
mounting for the past five years, the real crackdown began
only about 18 months ago. For example:
   -- The U.S. Justice Department late in 1988 sued
Continental Training Services, which operates a chain of
Indiana trucking schools, in federal court in Indianapolis
for $366 million, claiming it didn't qualify for federal
grants and student loans. In Indianapolis, an attorney for
the company didn't return calls seeking comment.
   -- The New York attorney general last July obtained an
indictment against the owner of Adelphi Institute for
allegedly scheming to defraud students and falsifying
business records. The attorney for Adelphi, which isn't
related to Adelphi University, said the company is in Chapter
7 bankruptcy-law proceedings and a trustee was appointed by
the Manhattan Bankruptcy Court. The case in state criminal
court in Manhattan hasn't gone to trial yet, he said.
   -- The U.S. Education Department last year cut off aid to
six Robert Fiance Corp. trade schools in Florida and
penalized the company $1.5 million. The trustee for the
company, which is going through bankruptcy proceedings in New
York, said all its schools have closed.
   In some instances, students themselves take legal action
against trade-school operators. In August 1989, a federal
district court jury in Chicago awarded $640,000 in damages to
plaintiffs who sued D'or Beauty Schools Inc., Chicago, now
closed, under the Illinois consumer-fraud act.
   On behalf of students in New York, South Brooklyn Legal
Services, a federally funded legal-services agency, last year
brought a class-action suit against MTI Business School of
Brooklyn and its owners in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn,
charging the school made false statements to induce students
to enroll and apply for government aid. Attorneys for MTI
refused to comment. This week in federal Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan, Judge Prudence Abram ordered the appointment of a
trustee to oversee MTI's bankruptcy case, filed when the
school closed last year.
   "The industry has grown too fast," said Jeffrey Plaut,
author of a study sponsored by New York Interface Development
Project Inc., a public policy research group. "There are too
many jurisdictional bodies involved in monitoring the
business."
   Alan Alop, a lawyer with the Legal Assistance Foundation
of Chicago who is an author of the Illinois bill, and others
are hopeful that laws being enacted will bring about reform.
The Illinois law, which went into effect last year, aims to
close down schools with low graduation rates. Schools will
have to disclose all information about their graduation rates
and success at job placement. And students who withdraw from
these programs will be entitled to tuition refunds
substantially larger than those previously given, Mr. Alop
said.

   `Silent Rationing'
   Of Medical Care

   In your March 27 article "Debate Grows Over Rationing
Medical Care," the case of Tishna Rollo, an eight-year-old
girl with kidney cancer, had nothing to do with rationing. It
concerned limiting the use of a medical technology until it
has been proven safe and effective for a given medical
condition.
   The proposed treatment of kidney cancer with a bone marrow
transfusion, a very expensive procedure often associated with
harmful side effects, has no scientific basis as a treatment
in this instance. Such inappropriate use of medical
technology has been estimated to contribute as much as 50% of
the increase in our nation's annual health-care costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Implicit rationing or "silent rationing" has been with us
for many years as you indicate, but while rationing has been
advocated as a means to control health-care costs, it has not
been adopted as official national policy. As you point out,
the fact that 30 million (actually, more than 35 million)
Americans have no health insurance constitutes a form of
rationing. In my view, the large number of our citizens who
have little or no access to health care is a national
disgrace. There are many steps we could take to make our
system more efficient; one of these steps could be to reduce
the inappropriate and wasteful use of expensive medical
technologies.

   Merrill's Private
   Placement Group
   Hit by Departures

   NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s private placement group
has been racked by key departures, just as the $170 billion
market for privately placed securities is set to explode.
   Jerome P. Greene, who headed Merrill Lynch's private
placement group for nine years, and Benjamin J. Sullivan Jr.,
a director, were hired by Benedetto, Gartland &amp; Greene Inc.,
a small investment banking boutique formed by two former Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. executives. Philip B. Pool Jr., a
Merrill Lynch managing director, had informally agreed to
move to the boutique, as well, but switched gears at the last
moment and will remain at Merrill Lynch.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The moves, which follow two other departures from Merrill
Lynch's 15-member private placement group in recent months,
are a setback for the nation's biggest securities firm.
Merrill Lynch said it won't name a successor to Mr. Greene.
Just last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission
ushered in a new era of selling bonds and stocks in the U.S.
by approving a rule to make it easier to sell and trade
privately placed securities.
   Wall Street securities firms are jockeying for position to
take advantage of the new rule. They see the expected bulge
in the private market as a way to offset sagging investment
banking business. Last year, Merrill Lynch ranked No. 7 in
private placements, underwriting $9.3 billion in securities
for a 5.6% market share, according to IDD Information
Services.
   "The way of the future is the smaller boutique-type
firms," said Mr. Greene, who became a partner in Benedetto
Gartland and was added to its masthead. "The larger firms are
more like battleships and take a while to turn around," he
said. "Smaller firms get focused almost immediately on
specific opportunities or areas."
   Mr. Greene, who ran the private placement group at Salomon
Inc. before joining Merrill Lynch, said Benedetto Gartland
plans to focus on specialty areas in the private market "that
don't fit in with the mainstream on Wall Street." These
include equity-related issues, such as limited partnership
interests; special-purpose funds, including offshore
investment funds; venture capital funds; leveraged buy-out
funds, and blind pools.
   The hirings are a coup for Benedetto Gartland, which was
launched in 1988 by M. William Benedetto, a former executive
vice president and manager of Dean Witter's investment
banking division, and Arthur Gartland, a veteran of Dean
Witter and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. In its first year, the
boutique helped complete deals valued at more than $1
billion; with the new hirings, the firm has five partners.
   "What is going to drive the '90s is not how much capital
you can throw at a problem, but how much brainpower," Mr.
Benedetto said. "That's what we want to do."
   Mr. Greene, 48 years old, and Mr. Benedetto have been
friends for 20 years. They met while at Salomon Brothers in
the 1970s. Mr. Sullivan, 36, joined Merrill Lynch in 1986
after a stint as vice president in Dean Witter's investment
banking department.
   Benedetto Gartland said in a statement it had already
hired Mr. Pool, too. But Merrill Lynch yesterday managed to
persuade Mr. Pool to stay on board, according to people
familiar with the matter.
   Merrill Lynch nevertheless has lost two other members of
its private placement staff recently. Luke Bowes moved to
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and Jay Applegate departed
to Dean Witter. At the same time, Merrill Lynch has hired two
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employees, Lawrence
Alletto and David Weiss, for its private placement sales
desk.
   Merrill Lynch, for its part, said it sees financing
opportunities in the burgeoning private placement market
related to small leveraged buy-outs and private placement
funds. "We're very committed to this area and do a very
substantial business in it," a Merrill Lynch spokesman said.

   CHAMORRO ASSUMED Nicaragua's presidency, ending Sandinista
rule.
   After a decade of U.S. hostility toward the nation's
leftist leaders, the 60-year-old publisher took the oath of
office in Managua before about 20,000 people. In her
inaugural speech, Chamorro, a conservative elected in
February, declared a political amnesty and ended the military
draft. She also said that Gen. Humberto Ortega, the
ex-president's brother, would head the armed forces, but that
she would be the defense minister. In Washington, Bush made
Nicaragua eligible again for Export-Import Bank financing and
restored its full authority to export sugar to the U.S.

   Tonight ABC News will broadcast a television documentary
on U.S. policy toward Cambodia entitled "Peter Jennings
Reporting: From the Killing Fields." The film makes
astonishing charges: that the Khmer Rouge, which murdered a
million people during the 3 1/2 years it ruled Cambodia, is
poised to return to power, and that the U.S. is assisting
that return. If true, the charges would be a shocking
indictment of the morality of American foreign policy. But
they are false.
   ABC has conjured up an image of Cambodia run by a flawed
but legitimate central government, a government abandoned by
its Vietnamese allies, whose only concern is to prevent the
return of the Khmer Rouge. In this Cambodia, the Soviet Union
plays no role (the words "Soviet Union" are not uttered
throughout the broadcast) and Chinese backing for the
resistance seems dwarfed by America's.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of course, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful military force of
perhaps 40,000 armed men, and it certainly aspires to return
to power. But it is far from likely to seize it soon. What
strength the Khmer Rouge does have it receives from people
too young to remember its crimes, who are attracted by the
nationalist appeal of Khmer Rouge propaganda against the
Vietnamese.
   But ABC pays little attention to the Vietnamese role in
Cambodia. Nothing is said about the two-centuries old history
of Vietnamese expansion at Cambodia's expense or about the
thousands of Vietnamese political and military advisers
remaining in Cambodia, or about the Vietnamese troops who are
reportedly still fighting there.
   All that ABC chooses to say about the Vietnamese role in
Cambodia is that it is over. On screen, former CIA director
William Colby substantiates the program's bald assertion that
the Vietnamese have withdrawn from Cambodia. Since he left
the intelligence agency, Mr. Colby seems to have lost access
not only to classified cable traffic but even to newspapers.
How else could he have missed the report on the front page of
the Feb. 23 issue of the New York Times, in which East
European diplomats said that one month after Vietnam's much
publicized withdrawal from Cambodia, resistance successes had
compelled Hanoi to reinject thousands of elite Vietnamese
troops to save Cambodia's western provinces for Phnom Penh?
   The Vietnamese communists did not just leave behind a
government "in their own image" as ABC puts it. Hanoi retains
control over it. That is the function of some of the
thousands of Vietnamese advisers who work in government
ministries and Phnom Penh's armed forces, as well as the
Vietnamese ambassador's daily meetings with the Cambodian
cabinet.
   Nor, in a documentary concerned with exposing an American
aid program of $20 million per year, is there any discussion
of the lavish arming of Phnom Penh by the Soviet Union --
$350 million in 1987, according to the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, and probably considerably more now. These
facts make nonsense of Peter Jenning's extraordinary
statement about the Phnom Penh regime: "The Defense Minister
knows that his troops, alone, without the Vietnamese, have a
real problem fighting forces supported by two superpowers:
the United States and China."
   ABC notes that the communist leaders in Phnom Penh are
former Khmer Rouge. But it does not tell us that they are
unrepentant former Khmer Rouge, complicit in enormous
atrocities. The character of Phnom Penh leaders explains the
regime's "mistreatment of its political opponents," as ABC
delicately puts it. Amnesty International, more candidly,
reported thousands of political prisoners in Cambodia in
1987. Amnesty has also expressed concern about "systematic
torture," and executions of prisoners without trial.
   ABC suggests that the noncommunist Cambodian resistance is
engaged in military cooperation with the Khmer Rouge. After
broadcasting a denial of any cooperation by Gen. Sak
Satsuyak, military commander of the noncommunist Khmer
People's National Liberation Front, ABC attempts to discredit
the denial with a film of Khmer Rouge and noncommunist
soldiers fraternizing at the town of Thmar Puok, after its
capture by the noncommunists. This is evidence of nothing: As
one Cambodian witness, human rights activist Kassie Neou has
told me, the Khmer Rouge controlled some villages near the
town, and some of their soldiers passed through Thmar Puok
after it was taken. Khmer Rouge and noncommunist soldiers
from the same regions may spontaneously fraternize, even
though their commanders do not.
   Eager to make a case of direct American support for the
Khmer Rouge, ABC leaves its "smoking gun" for the last
segment. After continuous denials from Assistant Secretary of
State Richard Solomon that the American-run Cambodian Working
Group in Thailand, which coordinates Western support for the
noncommunists, has any involvement with the Khmer Rouge, ABC
cuts to a hidden camera film of another American, Denny
Laine, at a Bangkok cafe. Mr. Jennings says: "This man knows
the details -- Special Forces Colonel Denny Laine -- former
military attache at the Bangkok embassy. When he was still on
active duty in Thailand, he was assigned to the UN border
relief operation. Where he had good access to the Khmer
Rouge."
   But Col. Laine's secondment to the UN border relief
operation and his access to the Khmer Rouge had nothing to do
with the Cambodian working group or the American military
role in Cambodia, as Mr. Jennings insinuates. Col. Laine was
assigned to UNBRO's Displaced Persons Unit, set up by the
Thais in response to foreign concern about human rights
abuses in the refugee camps. His visits to Khmer Rouge camps,
like those of his fellow officers from Britain, Sweden and
Australia, were not connected with covert U.S. aid to the
Khmer Rouge, but with trying to protect the human rights of
civilians in Khmer Rouge camps. The deceitful insinuation
about Col. Laine's mission is a telling reflection on ABC's
program.
   America's Cambodia policy is not, as ABC suggests, the
Bush administration's alone; nor has it been dictated by the
needs of alliance with China. The policy has bipartisan
congressional support, most strikingly from Rep. Stephen
Solarz (D., N.Y.), one of the harshest critics of the Bush
administration's China policy.
   How could ABC air such a misleading account of American
policy in Cambodia? Part of the answer is the attitude of
producer Leslie Cockburn, whose track record at "CBS Reports"
and PBS's "Frontline," was that of a committed left
ideologue. But the blame here must be spread more widely, as
Mrs. Cockburn worked here in close cooperation with executive
producer Tom Yellin and anchor Peter Jennings.
   Hanoi's leaders are hoping that a propaganda campaign by
their friends in the West will pressure Western governments
to accept the Phnom Penh regime. Hanoi's hopes were realized
in Britain after the screening of John Pilger's "Year 10" on
ITV. It hopes for as much from tonight's program at ABC.

   Regarding your March 12 page-one article "Noble
Experiment: Volunteers' Distress Cripples Huge Effort to
Provide AIDS Care," AIDS volunteerism can certainly be
distressing. Some volunteers do burn out and drop out.
However, problems of overextension can be addressed with
appropriate training, close supervision, continuing support,
sabbaticals, job rotation and the setting of limits.
   The real problem with AIDS care in this country is not
"volunteer distress" or how to manage it, but the absence of
government support. As remarkable as the volunteer AIDS
effort has been all around the country, volunteerism can
never take the place of a meaningful government commitment to
addressing the epidemic, nor was it ever intended to.
Volunteers cannot build hospitals, do research or provide
medical care. Nor can they provide the political leadership
that we need at the highest levels of government.
</LP>

   Congress can demonstrate its commitment by expeditiously
passing the Americans With Disabilities Act, which will
provide equal treatment in employment and public
accommodations to all people with disabilities; and the
Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990, which
will provide emergency relief funds to the 12 urban areas
hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic.

   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- American Savings Bank reported a
first-quarter net loss of $9.4 million, or $1.78 a share, and
directors voted to suspend the quarterly 20-cent-a-share
dividend.
   Earlier this month, the company had said it would post an
unspecified loss.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The savings bank's first-quarter loss reflects factors
including an $11 million addition to reserves against
possible real estate loan losses. Those losses in turn
reflect a weak Northeast real estate market. The provision
includes a previously announced $4 million charge to
reacquire unsold shares in four residential cooperative
conversion projects.
   In the year-earlier period, the savings bank reported net
income of $6.6 million, or 88 cents a share. The dividend on
its cumulative convertible exchangeable preferred Series A
shares isn't affected by the suspension of the payout on
common.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
American's shares fell 25 cents, to close at $2.75 each.
   The bank's AmSave commercial finance subsidiary also
placed a $15 million loan to West Point-Pepperell Inc.,
controlled by the investor William Farley, on non-accrual
status. Mr. Farley has been having some problems with the
financing for his acquisition of the West Point, Ga., textile
giant.
   The first-quarter provision for possible losses on loans
jumped to $13.3 million from $2 million a year ago. Income
from interest on loans before provision for loan losses fell
24% to $19.5 million, while the net interest margin -- the
difference between what the bank pays for funds and what it
takes in on loans -- narrowed to 2.05% from 2.46% a year ago.
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, however, the margin was 1.99%.
   Nonperforming assets at March 31 grew to 4.65% of total
assets from 3.29% a year ago and 3.92% at Dec. 31. The bank's
regulatory capital was 6.81% of assets at March 31, compared
with the 6% required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Total assets dipped less than 1% to $4.41 billion from $4.43
billion at Dec. 31.
   American Savings put the AmSave unit up for sale two weeks
ago.

   Brink Lindsey's March 7 editorial-page piece "Trade
Crisis? What Trade Crisis?" argues that, contrary to the
conventional wisdom, there is a world trade boom driven by
the relaxation of import barriers and characterized by the
expansion of trade between Pacific Rim countries.
   What is happening in the Pacific Rim is not, as Mr.
Lindsey contends, an illustration of the internationalization
of world trade but a clear indication that the area is
evolving into a distinct trading bloc, with Japan accounting
for about 80% of the entire East Asian gross national
product. Much of the "import surge" in Japan is owed to
exports from Japanese subsidiaries in East Asian countries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the once "Newly Industrializing Countries" of East
Asia may be increasing their levels of imports from the U.S.,
the fact remains that Japan, South Korea and Taiwan now
account for nearly two-thirds of our trade deficit.
   Finally, Mr. Lindsey's piece is laced with all sorts of
impressive figures and percentages backing up his claim that
the world trading system is being liberalized. The emphasis,
however, should not be on the numbers, but on the composition
of trade between countries. There are those of us who believe
that there is a difference between Japan's imports of raw
materials or products manufactured by its offshore facilities
and its relative lack of imports involving value-added goods
produced by foreign firms.

   STOCKHOLM -- Financier Sven-Olof Johansson will sell his
stake in Saab-Scania AB to the Wallenberg group for 4.4
billion kronor ($717 million), according to news reports,
thus ending a power struggle that began last spring.
   The sale will result in Wallenberg controlling Saab, with
58% of the voting shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Johansson, who started to comb the market for Saab
shares last spring and early autumn, became its biggest
owner, currently holding 19% of the group's shares and 22% of
its votes.
   The deal was completed a few days before Saab's annual
meeting, to be held tomorrow, the business newspaper Dagens
Industri said yesterday.
   It said the Wallenberg group will have an option to buy
Johansson's 12.8 million shares for 350 kronor (57 cents) a
share. Mr. Johansson, who declined to comment, has previously
said he paid an average of 250 kronor a share. His gain on
the deal is estimated at 1.2 billion kronor.
   Saab-Scania's departing chairman, Sten Gustafsson,
confirmed the Johansson sale, according to the Direkt news
agency.
   Mr. Johansson criticized Saab last autumn when its shares
tumbled 34 kronor over two weeks after rumors of heavy losses
in its car division, for not informing its shareholders of
the seriousness of the crisis.
   Since General Motors Corp. acquired half of Saab's car
division last December, the Swedish auto maker's shares have
regained ground, however, and closed at 296 kronor Tuesday.

   She also said that the company is conducting an

landfill can be developed it must undergo rigorous tests for
pollutants, among other things.

   WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden said several provisions in a House bill aimed
at curbing penny-stock fraud "would have costly and
undesirable side effects."
   Speaking before the House finance subcommittee, Mr.
Breeden said the SEC doesn't support a provision that would
ban certain "blind pool" stock offerings. Blind pools are
offerings in which the business plan of the issuer is to seek
mergers or acquisitions in a specific line of business. They
have long been used by issuers in venture capital, real
estate and oil- and gas-exploration programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Thus, substantial costs and burdens could be imposed on
this kind of financing technique for which disclosure
regulation has been adequate in the past, and which has been
an important source of producing capital," the SEC chairman
said.
   Mr. Breeden also raised questions about a provision in the
bill that would require all penny stocks to be listed on an
automated quotation system. The measure might impose costs
that would discourage market-making in inactively traded
stocks of reputable companies, he said.
   Despite Mr. Breeden's opposition, the bill has strong
bipartisan support in the subcommittee. The bill was
introduced this month by Rep. Edward Markey (D, Mass.),
chairman of the subcommittee.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Film: Lumet's `Q&amp;A' Heavy on Racial Cliches
   ----
   By Julie Salamon
</HL>

</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   Sidney Lumet's new picture, "Q&amp;A," means to make a case
against racism. But this unwieldy dissertation on the subject
of ethnic hatred is far more convincing on the subject of
nepotism.
   Mr. Lumet's estimation of his daughter's talents are far
more generous than anyone else's might be. This fatherly
pride would be rather sweet and not embarrassing at all if
Mr. Lumet weren't a celebrated director and his daughter
Jenny weren't an aspiring actress. They are, however, and
there she is, playing a secondary but pivotal role that would
be beyond her range even if it were written well.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This kind of misjudgment about things Mr. Lumet cares for
runs throughout "Q&amp;A." This is yet another variation on a
subject he has revisited many times -- with some memorable
results -- over the years: the good man struggling to do
right in a world that is either corrupt or indifferent or
both. This character never succeeds completely and often is
driven mad, or to his death.
   Mr. Lumet's preoccupation with this theme has resulted in
fine movies, such as "Serpico," "Dog Day Afternoon,"
"Network," "The Verdict." But in recent years, the searching
and the anger in his films has rung hollow, as though Mr.
Lumet isn't really burning with passion at injustice anymore
but feels he should be. So even though his movies continue to
have great moments -- the man attracts top actors and he
knows how to use them -- the stories don't hold. Look, for
example, at the confusion and slackness in "Running on
Empty," "Power," "Family Business."
   The inspiration for this latest movie, according to Mr.
Lumet, were the questions that lay behind "Q&amp;A," a novel of
police corruption written by Edwin Torres, who was one of the
first Hispanic judges in the New York judicial system. Mr.
Lumet has said he wanted to know: "Are the ethnic loyalties a
positive or destructive force? Does the racism have anything
to do with the mutual protection of cops and assistant
district attorneys? Is it possible that we have lived with
racism for so long that we don't see it anymore? If so, how
do we discover our own true racial feelings?"
   These are big and important questions, which Mr. Lumet --
writing his own screenplay -- has boiled down to their
simplest form: the cliche. He confronts racial tension by
having all his characters talk about their ethnicity all the
time, in the most vulgar terms. No one says "Good morning"
without referring to race or religion. "I'll translate for
your mick ears," the philosophical Jewish lawyer says to his
young Irish protege. These two, representing the good Jew and
the good Irishman, are "balanced" by a shyster hook-nosed
Jewish lawyer and a vicious swaggering Irish cop.
   Most of the dialogue is packed with ugly ethnic slurs,
presumably meant to demonstrate how such language has become
part of everyday discourse. But the rhythms seem all wrong,
almost comical, like a Hungarian trying to talk American
jive. Mr. Lumet doesn't come off as a closet racist, exactly,
just a mixed-up liberal.
   The good man in this movie is a young district attorney,
Al Reilly (Timothy Hutton), who has been selected by his
ambitious superior, also Irish, to investigate a murder. The
victim was a hood; the killer was a legendary policeman, yet
another Irishman named Mike Brennan (Nick Nolte). Soon the
fledgling D.A. learns what the audience knows from the
outset, that the murder wasn't "justifiable homicide."
Brennan is a brutal man who knows no rules. Reilly has been
picked to handle the case because he's innocent and he's
Irish and, as he's told repeatedly throughout the film,
"There's not many of us left in this city."
   Reilly's investigation turns up many unsavory characters,
all marked by the distinctive ethnic characteristics stamped
out by Hollywood. There's the Italian mobster, the noble
black cop, the Puerto Rican drug lord. If Mr. Lumet cares so
deeply about divisive sterotypes, why has he stocked his film
with nothing but?
   Brennan, who is a superhuman baddie, manages to be
everywhere all the time in the metropolis, doing damage to
those who might rat on him. There is some enjoyment in
watching Nolte's relentlessly vicious Brennan. The actor
hulked himself up for the part and squeezed out any sign of
humanity in the process. He's scary, like a bull who's been
stuck one time too many. You don't want to be in his path.
   Mr. Lumet goes most wildly off track with the movie's only
female character, the young woman, Nancy, played by his
daughter Jenny. She once loved young Reilly, but left him
when he appeared shocked at seeing her father for the first
time and discovering he was black. Was the shock an
expression of racism, or surprise that she hadn't mentioned
this fact to the man she was going to marry, after two years
of dating?
   They meet each other again six years later, when Reilly
has called in an underworld figure for questioning who, as it
turns out, is Nancy's new boyfriend.
   He is Bobby Texador, a very successful Hispanic drug
dealer whom Mr. Lumet inexplicably has chosen to portray as
one of the few decent men in the movie. Are we to believe
that everyone in the established structure is evil or too
worn down to care, but that in the netherworld of hard-core
crime a leading figure is just a sweet guy at heart who wants
to marry his honey and get away from it all? Armand Assante's
Bobby is very good -- too good, in fact to be believed.
   Is it a sign of Mr. Lumet's own unexamined racial feelings
that Nancy's response to breaking up with her white boyfriend
was to quit school and turn first to drugs, then to a drug
kingpin? His fascination with the subject undoubtedly runs
deeper than what he's done with it here, since one of his own
four marriages -- the marriage that produced Jenny -- was to
a woman of color, Lena Horne's daughter.
   "Q&amp;A" seems breathless, as though Mr. Lumet were in such a
hurry to get it made he didn't figure out the questions, much
less the answers.
   ---
   Video Tip: Sidney Lumet has the power to make a mess like
"Q&amp;A" because he has made so many first-rate films, most of
which are available on video. However, seeing Armand Assante
reminded me of an obscure but dandy little film by Glen Pitre
called "Belizaire the Cajun." Mr. Assante is wonderful in
this offbeat period piece about life in the Louisiana bayou,
circa 1850, and so is Michael Doucet's zydeco-inspired score.

   PITTSBURGH -- Carl C. Icahn said he will purchase an
additional $800 million of USX Corp. stock if his proposed
spinoff of USX's steel business is approved by shareholders.
He said he would pay up to $48 a share.
   The New York-based investor has proposed that USX holders
approve a plan that would spin off as much as 80% of USX's
steel business as a separate company. Mr. Icahn contends that
the separation, which is to be voted on by USX holders at the
company's annual meeting May 7, would yield a combined value
of $48 a share in the two companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   USX shares closed up $1.25 yesterday to $34 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Charles A. Corry, chairman and chief executive officer of
USX, said in a statement that Mr. Icahn's announcement
"sounded like a ploy." Mr. Corry said, "It seems to me that
Icahn is simply trying to buy votes and distract stockholders
from the serious questions that we and a number of prominent
analysts have raised about his proposal to break up USX." He
said he remains opposed to the spinoff proposal.
   USX has said Mr. Icahn's proposal would cost the company
an additional $110 million to $120 million in interest and
insurance expenses, among other things. USX also has
disparaged Mr. Icahn's $48-a-share valuation as the result of
a "lightweight analytical job."
   Mr. Icahn, however, insists the company is undervalued. He
said yesterday that even if shareholders approve the spinoff
and USX does not implement it, he believes USX "would have to
take some bold actions to enhance shareholder value.
Consequently, the purchase of additional USX stock
immediately following a favorable vote on the spinoff would
be, in my opinion, an excellent investment."
   To increase his stake, Mr. Icahn said he would direct his
various affiliates to deposit $400 million with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. so that Shearson could begin a buying
program for $800 million.
   Mr. Icahn currently owns 13.3% of USX's shares
outstanding. A further $800 million investment at current
market prices would bring the value of his USX holdings to
nearly $2 billion.
   He said the purchases would be made in the open market, by
tender offer or other means.

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumption of newsprint in March
decreased 0.3% from a year earlier, according to the American
Newspaper Publishers Association.
   The industry group said preliminary estimates indicate
consumption by all users totaled 1,044,161 metric tons last
month, compared with 1,047,011 tons in March 1989. A metric
ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   U.S. daily newspapers used 782,554 metric tons last month,
down 0.7% from 787,735 tons a year earlier.
   For the first three months of this year, estimated U.S.
newsprint consumption totaled 2,945,517 metric tons, up 0.4%
from 2,932,421 tons a year earlier.
   Newsprint inventories at newspapers in the association's
statistical sample averaged a 37-day supply last month,
compared with a 41-day supply in March 1989. Newsprint stocks
in North American mills last month decreased about 5.6% from
a year earlier.
   The association said Canadian newsprint mills operated at
95% of capacity in March and at 94% in the first quarter;
U.S. mills operated at 94.6% in the month and 97.2% in the
quarter.

   NEW YORK -- Primerica Corp.'s direct marketing subsidiary,
Fingerhut Cos., began trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday after a public offering of six million shares.
   Proceeds of the offering, at $16.50 a share, will be about
$93 million, after expenses, excluding the underwriters'
overallotment option of an additional 900,000 shares. After
the offering is completed, and excluding the overallotment,
Primerica will own 72.4% of Fingerhut common outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fingerhut, based in Minneapolis, is a catalog retailer and
the U.S.'s fourth-largest direct mail marketer in sales. In
1989, Fingerhut earned $39.4 million on revenue of $1.1
billion.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Fingerhut
shares closed unchanged at $16.50. Primerica closed at
$28.625, up 62.5 cents.
   Separately, Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Primerica, an
insurance, consumer-credit and financial-services company,
said after the company's annual meeting that he plans to
expand the sales force of the Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. unit internally rather than through acquisition. The
company has said it wants to increase Smith Barney's sales
force about 50% in the next three to five years, from about
2,500 currently.
   Earlier this year, Mr. Weill was in talks with American
Express Co. about a possible merger of that company's
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. securities unit with
Smith Barney. In response to a question, Mr. Weill said,
"Shearson was a unique situation. We were approached and we
spoke to them." Mr. Weill said "we could have injected a
level of management" to help the financial situation at
Shearson, and "we felt we had an obligation to our
shareholders to look at it."
   But American Express decided to buy back the remaining
approximately 30% publicly held shares of Shearson, which
last week reported a first-quarter loss of $915 million, or
$10.54 a share.
   Mr. Weill declined to make any earnings predictions.
Primerica last week posted a 62% jump in first-quarter net
income, to $83.2 million, or 73 cents a share.
   In related news, Primerica said Joseph R. Wright Jr. was
elected to its board. Mr. Wright, vice chairman and a
director of W.R. Grace &amp; Co., succeeds William S. Woodside, a
former chairman of Primerica, who retired from the board. Mr.
Woodside was named director emeritus.

   One-Stop Shopping for Rock-and-Roll Memorabilia

   Los Angeles -- Once a leading barometer of hot Southern
California trends, the Melrose Avenue shopping strip appears
to have plummetted in recent months. Sure its sidewalks are
cleaner than in funkier days. But if one more chain clothing
store displaces a Melrose mainstay, the merchants'
association might as well enclose the walks and convert to a
shopping mall.
   A welcome exception is the recently opened Rock Store, a
purveyor of rock-and-roll memorabilia with an invitingly
pre-Reaganite management style. There are no clerks with
phony accents or custom-styled display racks here. Just two
rooms crammed with thousands of items of rock-and-roll
history.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   From posters hung so closely that they resemble a
rock-and-roll mosaic peer visages that have become symbols of
their eras, from Janis Joplin to Madonna. If an idol is
missing, you might inquire about the 20,000 additional
posters in storage -- along with at least that number of
vintage magazines and sheets of rock music. You are
encouraged to ask, for this is a highly personal place of
business, in which the proprietor is behind the counter
selling merchandise from his personal collection. In the old
days, Melrose was known for stores like this, where you could
spend half the day browsing.
   For those who want to get really close to the icons of
rock, the store carries clothing that it guarantees was worn
by performers. For $1,500, you can wrap yourself in a wildly
colored beaded jacket and slip into custom-ripped jeans worn
by Vernon Reid of the group Living Color in its recent "Cult
of Personality" video. Prices soar for outfits worn by Elton
John (green sequined suit, $8,000) or Prince (black-and-blue
jumpsuit, $10,000.) There's even an usherette's costume from
the premiere of "A Hard Day's Night" ($3,500).
   On a recent Friday evening, teen-agers crowded around
display cases containing tickets to rock concerts that
occurred before they were born. There also are about 6,000
backstage concert passes, which at the time were issued free
to employees, families and friends of band members. The most
rare pass in the collection entitled the bearer to special
entrance to a Jimi Hendrix concert at New York's Fillmore
East sometime during the mid-60s. With Mr. Hendrix and the
Fillmore having long since gone to their rewards, the pass's
value has risen to $200. Sound a bit "cher"? If a Woodstock
pass could be found, it might bring twice that amount.
   As these prices suggest, rock memorabilia isn't a bargain
-- here or at flea markets or fans' conventions such as
Beatlefest or Monkeefest. What were once cheap, or even free,
souvenirs have entered the rarefied world of "collectibles."
   As a visit to the Rock Store demonstrates, that term
comprises all manner of merchandise. A truly rabid Lou Reed
listener, for example, probably wouldn't quibble that the
singer's image on a dime postcard now fetches one dollar. But
why spend $2 on a bit of bubble gum wrapped in a miniature
Blondie album cover? Do people really go for the Duran Duran
plastic tote ($20), the Electric Light Orchestra nightlight
($25) or the jumpsuit that says Van Halen but wasn't worn by
any member of the group ($75)?
   You bet, says Paul Scharfman, the Rock Store's 40-ish
owner, who claims to have developed, through trial and error,
a keen knowledge of which rock groups' merchandise will rise
in value. As an example, he cites the Allman Brothers Band,
which despite its one-time prominence doesn't command much of
the memorabilia market. On the other hand, the Go-Gos, the
girl group whose star soared rather briefly in the early
'80s, continues to attract a strong following among what he
describes as "young, innocent, all-American males."
   Sometimes even Mr. Scharfman is surprised by the strength
of a performer's charisma. He took a gamble on several
thousand Boy George dolls that were made in Hong Kong to sell
for $10 each, but were rejected by U.S. stores. At a time
when the troubled singer has largely faded from public view,
the Rock Store recently advertised the dolls in a record
collectors' magazine. A dozen were snapped up in two weeks --
at $100 each.
   A pudgy, long-haired man with a partied-out demeanor, Mr.
Scharfman spent 15 years acquiring this collection while his
wife ran a vintage toy store on Melrose known as Chic-A-Boom.
He continues to seek out new sources, largely through making
the late-night Sunset Strip club scene and keeping up with
contacts in the record business. Often a chance meeting
yields treasure. "I once met this guy who worked for Jimi
Hendrix, so I asked, `Do you have anything from tours with
him?'" The response was a poster that is, at $1,500, the most
expensive one in the store, from a 1969 West German tour by
Mr. Hendrix.
   Mr. Scharfman's own favorite possession also is German, a
gum wrapper commemorating a 1970 concert by The Who. He
claims it could fetch $50 if he would let it go. (The gum has
long since gone.)
   Although he describes the Rock Store as "profitable beyond
our wildest dreams," the former New Yorker retains a
refreshingly laid-back attitude about the venture: He's bored
with selling and would rather spend his time acquiring.
Still, he is stuck at the Rock Store day and night, his brain
the only source of reliable inventory knowledge when a
customer asks for, say, an Ebony magazine cover story about
the Ronettes, circa 1966. (He has a copy.)
   When it is suggested that perhaps a computerized system
might give him more freedom, Mr. Scharfman looks as if he has
been insulted. "Put this," he gestures toward the cluttered
displays, "on computer?"
   Despite the long hours, he clearly is delighted that the
timing of the Rock Store's opening was, as they used to say,
right on. Mr. Scharfman decided opportunity was at hand a few
months ago, after noticing that certain groups from his era
-- especially the Beatles, Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin, the
Doors and Jimi Hendrix -- had become classics to be
continually discovered by younger audiences. Meanwhile,
groups from the '70s and '80s, such as Kiss, with its unique
sound and makeup, had developed a cult-like following.
Nostalgia for the '50s and '60s and the potential of sales to
Hollywood prop departments also played a role in the decision
to open the store.
   Now many of his customers come back several times -- as
hooked as the store's owner on collecting rock memorabilia.
Most of them began the habit by acquiring rare albums,
progressing to other items as they came to feel more and more
passionate about a favorite band. But Mr. Scharfman himself
is an exception, having switched from comic-book collecting
to buying Beatles memorabilia without ever developing a keen
interest in acquiring rock music.
   That's the primary reason why the Rock Store has no
records or tapes for sale, although browsers are treated to
background music and videos to set the appropriate musical
mood. When the store closes at 8 p.m. however, Mr. Scharfman
switches to vintage sound tracks from movies of the '30s and
'40s. Says he, "I'm not a lover of rock and roll."

   Daimler-Benz AG's
   1989 Earnings Soared
   On Accounting Shift

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Daimler-Benz AG said a change
in the way it calculates pension liabilities and inventories
added a one-time contribution of 5.1 billion marks ($3
billion) to 1989 group net income, which totaled 6.8 billion
marks with the extraordinary gain.
   Analysts said the balance-sheet adjustment was aimed at
making Daimler-Benz look more attractive to international
investors, who don't always account for conservative West
German accounting practices when assessing West German
balance sheets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When excluding the accounting adjustment, the automotive
and technology conglomerate said that the group's net income
would have been unchanged at the 1988 net income level of 1.7
billion marks, reflecting pressured earnings from automotive
operations last year. The extraordinary gain will be
allocated to equity reserves, the company said.
   The gain came on a write-back of part of Daimler-Benz's
overfunded pension provisions and undervalued inventories
accumulated over previous years. Daimler-Benz said it altered
the conservative basis on which it calculates the two
positions to better reflect international standards in time
for planned stock listings on the London and Tokyo stock
exchanges later this year.
   Stephen Reitman, an auto analyst at UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew in
London estimated that the change will boost the company's
equity as a percentage of total assets to around 30% from
22%, bringing its per-share net asset value to 400 marks from
267 marks. "Basically, it will make the company look more
solid than under its old system of overprovisioning for
pensions," Mr. Reitman said. After cumulative gain for 1989
results, the analyst judged that the change to pension
valuations in the future will reduce the company's annual
labor costs by an annual 500 million marks.

   TORONTO -- Noranda Forest Inc. said it will discontinue
the production of coated label papers at its mill in Thorold,
Ontario.
   A company spokesman said there's no indication that the
move, which includes the loss of 95 jobs representing about
16% of the plant's work force, will result in a charge
against earnings. He said the production of label papers,
used for labeling cans and other containers, isn't profitable
because of competition from imports. The company said the
future of the Thorold mill lies in de-inked recycled papers
and wallpaper.

   Stops in Launch
   Of New Escort

   DETROIT -- Even by hype-happy Detroit standards, Ford
Motor Co.'s marketing push for its first all-new Escort in 10
years seems a bit outlandish.
   John LeFere, a dealer in Jackson, Mich., plans to launch
the car this afternoon with "blast-off smoke and astronauts"
at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Michigan Space Center, where the program for the first
official day of sales includes whisking away an old Escort by
helicopter. In New Orleans, the first Escort sold today will
be delivered on the aircraft carrier Cabot, anchored in the
Mississippi River.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, for the first time, some of Ford's United Auto
Workers union employees will be fanning out nationwide to
help sell the cars that they built.
   Such hoopla may seem excessive for a simple subcompact.
But at a time when subcompact sales generally are shrinking
and the number of competitors is expanding, Ford must "make
sure we get everybody's attention," says Thomas Wagner,
general manager of the auto maker's Ford division.
   Top Ford executives, in fact, are calling Escort's launch
the most important in the auto maker's history -- strong
words considering they bet the company in the early 1980s to
develop the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable.
   But the success of the new Escort, which was engineered by
Ford's Japanese partner Mazda Motor Corp., will indirectly
shape how much Ford can spend to bring out new vehicles later
in this decade, Mr. Wagner acknowledged yesterday during the
latest of the three dozen news conferences that Ford has held
over the past three months to promote Escort.
   Under federal fuel-economy standards, Ford must sell a
large number of Escorts in order to sell more of its
gas-guzzling, but highly profitable, luxury cars. "If we
can't sell the big cars, that attacks profits," says Mr.
Wagner. "And that attack on profits attacks our ability to
fund new product programs in the middle-1990s," he says.
   As a result, Ford officials say they have little margin
for error in the 500,000 sales they have projected for Escort
and its Mercury Tracer twin next year. Reaching such lofty
targets on a single car line in today's increasingly
fragmented U.S. market will be difficult. For the decade of
the 1980s, Escort was the best-selling car in the U.S., with
deliveries peaking in 1985 at 524,488 Escorts and Mercury
Lynxes, the companion car at the time. After that, Escort
sales steadily slipped as a result of dated design and
tougher competition.
   The new Escort faces a far different U.S. market than the
one its predecessor encountered during the mid-1980s. For
starters, U.S. car buyers are far less interested in
subcompact cars now, because energy-crisis fears have
subsided. Auto makers sold nearly 1.3 million of the small
cars five years ago; subcompact sales last year totaled
926,213.
   In addition, the number of strong competitors has soared.
Honda Motor Co. sold 13% more Civics last year than in 1985,
while sales of Toyota Motor Corp.'s Corolla jumped 19%. Other
cars, such as the Hyundai Excel and Suzuki Swift, weren't
even available in the U.S. in 1985.
   Then there's Mazda's new 323 and Protege, which are based
on virtually the same platform as the Escort and share key
parts including transmissions, suspensions and, in some
cases, engines. Ford and Mazda have tried to distinguish the
cars in appearance, road-feel and features. But the base
Mazda 323 is less expensive, starting at $6,599, compared
with the Escort's base price of $7,565.
   All this causes some Ford officials to concede they have a
daunting task before them, especially because the new
Escort's outward appearance isn't much different from the old
Escort. However, Ford did change the appearance of the Escort
station wagon, giving it the look of a shrunken Taurus
station wagon.
   Still, critics say the new Escort may not turn a lot of
heads because it doesn't represent a big leap forward in
subcompact styling, though it has a much lower hoodline to
improve road visibility for drivers.
   Ford officials say the conservative styling reflects a
concern that major changes would alienate traditional Escort
buyers -- and drive up costs. As it is, Ford is spending $1.9
billion on Escort's makeover, and the car will be a money
loser for Ford because of heavy price competition in the
subcompact market and the fuel-economy pressures to sell the
car.
   To help buyers understand how Escort has changed, Ford
took the unprecedented step of putting potential customers
behind the wheel of the car long before today's introduction.
For the past five weeks, Ford has been holding ride-and-drive
programs for consumers picked by some 250 Ford dealers
nationwide. Such sneak-peeks generally are reserved only for
automotive journalists.
   "We wanted to get potential customers driving the cars as
soon as we could because a lot of the changes people will
notice are under this new car's sheet metal," says Bobbie
Koehler, the Ford division's mechandising manager. Those who
didn't get an early look at the cars weren't able to see them
until today. Ford forbade dealers from putting new Escorts
out in showrooms until the launch. Some dealers even went
back to the practice common in the 1950s of covering showroom
windows before the models appeared today.
   The ride-and-drive program, the 20 nationwide launch
ceremonies including the blast-off in Jackson and the warship
in New Orleans, and the 36 news conferences may sound like a
lot. But they're only the start of Ford's marketing blitz for
its new Escort.
   Between now and June, Ford car advertising will focus
almost exclusively on the subcompact. The ad campaigns for
Escort and Tracer will likely cost $100 million -- eclipsing
the $90 million record set with the debut of the Taurus and
Sable in late 1985.
   "The bottom line is we have to sell all of these cars in a
big way," Mr. Wagner says. "We have no choice but to make
them successful."

   Du Pont Profit Fell
   16% in Quarter;

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said first-quarter
earnings declined 16% because of softness in the U.S.
automotive and housing markets, and one-time restructuring
charges.
   Net income fell to $615 million, or 90 cents a share, from
$736 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. The latest
period included restructuring charges of seven cents a share,
while the year-earlier quarter included a gain of five cents
a share. Sales increased 8.4% to $9.40 billion from $8.67
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said Du Pont's performance was slightly better
than the 85 cents a share they had been expecting. Some
analysts raised their 1990 earnings estimates to a range of
$3.40 to $3.70 a share, from $3.30 to $3.50 a share.
   Profit declines in the quarter for polymers, fibers and
energy were less than predicted, and there were some early
benefits from cost-cutting. But higher raw material and
energy costs, and weather-related outages, caused industrial
products earnings to be worse than expected.
   Edgar S. Woolard Jr., chairman and chief executive, said
Du Pont began to see "signs of strengthening" in March as a
result of cost-cutting programs. "We believe we will extend
our four-year trend of steady earnings improvement and
achieve our stated goal of maintaining or exceeding 16%
return on equity through a business cycle," Mr. Woolard said.
   The company said combined sales for industrial products,
fibers, polymers and diversified businesses increased 3%,
reflecting a 4% increase in selling prices and a 1% decrease
in unit sales.
   Analyst Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said polymers were the main reason for Du Pont's
better-than-expected first quarter. After-tax profits for
polymers were $109 million, excluding one-time charges of $27
million for the planned closing of two automotive finish
plants, compared with $131 million a year ago.
   "Most people may have been looking for $50 million to $80
million from polymers," Mr. Bogner said. Fibers profits of
$168 million, compared with $173 million a year ago, were
helped by growth in specialty fibers, such as Kevlar, Lycra
and Nomex.
   "Du Pont will look better than other major chemical
companies this year due to cost-cutting and less reliance on
traditional plastics and commodity chemicals," Mr. Bogner
says. He said he raised his 1990 estimate to $3.70 a share,
from $3.50.
   However, Leslie Ravitz of Salomon Brothers says the first
quarter was "no great surprise" and he won't change his $3.50
estimate for 1990. Despite encouraging business trends, "we
think the economy will slow down during the second half due
to higher interest rates," Mr. Ravitz said.

   ZURICH, Switzerland -- Swiss capital exports in the first
quarter surged 68% to 15.4 billion Swiss francs ($10.34
billion) from a year earlier, the Swiss National Bank, the
central bank, said in a preliminary report.
   The bulk of the growth in capital exports was accounted
for by a big increase in the volume of straight bonds, which
more than doubled, the central bank said. Overall, exports of
capital through bonds grew 79%, while loans increased 24%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The central bank attributed the increase in straight bonds
-- as opposed to convertible bonds or those with warrants
issued in Switzerland, mostly for Japanese borrowers -- to
the sharp drop on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Straight bond
issues as a percentage of total bond issues increased to 53%
from 29%.
   Capital exports accounted for by Japanese borrowers
slipped to 40% from 50%, the central bank said.

   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden predicted in its annual budget
revision that the deficit on the 1990 current account, or
balance of payments, will widen to 50.7 billion kronor ($8.26
billion) from 32.3 billion kronor in 1989, and that the 1991
current account gap will widen further to 72.4 billion
kronor.
   It forecast a 9.8% rise in consumer prices for this year
and a 9.4% rise for 1991. And it predicted economic growth of
0.8% for 1990 and 0.5% for next year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose 6.7% in 1989, and the government in
January predicted a 7.7% rise this year. The revised spending
plan warns that recent heavy foreign investment by Swedish
companies is hampering the country's economic growth. The
revised economic growth figures are much lower than the
previous spending plan's 1.3% and 1.7% growth targets for
1990 and 1991, respectively.
   Meanwhile, the trade surplus was forecast to decline to 12
billion kronor this year and remain unchanged in 1991, down
from 18.7 billion kronor in 1989.

<LP>
   AKRON, Ohio -- Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.'s first-quarter
net income plunged 78%.
   The earnings drop stemmed from price competition, higher
costs from increased advertising and compensation, and lower
tire demand from auto manufacturers. That lower demand
resulted in temporary Goodyear plant closings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Akron, Ohio-based tire maker announced earlier this
month that it would report sharply reduced earnings; the
decline was in line with analysts' projections. Net was $20.9
million, or 36 cents a share, compared with the year-ago
$94.5 million, or $1.64 a share. Sales were $2.69 billion, up
slightly from $2.64 billion a year earlier.
   Harry W. Millis, an analyst with McDonald &amp; Co.,
Cleveland, said he expected first-quarter net to be between
25 cents and 50 cents a share. "Profit was in line with what
I expected," he said.
   Goodyear said previously that its oil pipeline would
decrease earnings by 50 cents a share, and the pipeline's
losses weren't reflected in the 1989 first-quarter report.
Profits were also squeezed by Brazilian government efforts to
brake inflation in that country, efforts which hurt the
company's large subsidiary there. Goodyear is also incurring
start-up costs on a tire plant in Canada.

   In First Quarter
   On a Special Gain

   NEW YORK -- ITT Corp. said net income rose 27% in the
first quarter, results it called "better than expected."
   Net income rose to $253 million, or $1.88 a share, from
$200 million, or $1.40 a share. The latest quarter included
the previously reported after-tax gain of $47 million, or 33
cents a share, on the sale of the company's investment in
Compagnie Generale d'Electricite. Without the gain, net
income would have risen 3%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rand V. Araskog, chairman and chief executive officer,
said operating results, or income before taxes and interest,
for all businesses except electronic parts were equal to or
better than year-earlier results.
   Sales rose 2% to $4.93 billion from $4.83 billion. The
year-earlier quarter included $139 million in sales from
businesses that have since been divested. "Despite the lower
results in some of our businesses, 1990 is off to a good
start," Mr. Araskog said.
   ITT said defense business operating income improved
because of increased contract margins and product shipments.
Automotive gains in Europe were offset by softness in North
American markets. Fluid-technology results were flat, while
pulp and timber income improved, reflecting favorable profit
margins from log sales and higher pulp volume. Income from
electronic components declined substantially, reflecting
"continuing competitive pressures within the connector and
semiconductor businesses resulting in lower sales and
margins."
   ITT said its equity from Alcatel N.V. "rose dramatically;"
Alcatel is a European telecommunications-equipment joint
venture with Compagnie Generale d'Electricite.
   Earnings from service businesses declined because of "the
difficult business climate in the U.S. during the quarter."
Operating results at the Hartford insurance business rose due
to higher investment income and improved life-insurance
operations, offset by "continued deterioration" in casualty
underwriting.
   ITT Financial had "a substantial decline" because of
increased provisions for consumer-loan losses from "portfolio
control actions and an increase in personal bankruptcies."
Results declined at the ITT Sheraton hotel operations.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
ITT closed at $52, up 62.5 cents.

   MOSCOW -- On an unusually warm April afternoon, David
Ryzhak is enjoying a swim and sunbath at the Moscow Swimming
Pool. A retired military pilot, Mr. Ryzhak, 67 years old, is
fit and suntanned; several gold teeth gleam in his smile. He
comes to this gigantic, decrepit, heated outdoor pool at the
foot of the Kremlin wall every day it is open, even in the
dead of winter.
   In summertime, the pool is closed for repairs. In
subfreezing weather, Mr. Ryzhak and some 8,000 other
Muscovites use it each day. When the temperature rises above
freezing, the number swells to 15,000.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a city where winter offers little recreation, this is a
simple pleasure, and good for you, too, Russians say. But
history has complicated it. The pool happens to occupy the
basement of what was once the magnificent Christ the Savior
Cathedral, dynamited on Joseph Stalin's orders 59 years ago.
Now, the Russian Orthodox Church and many devout private
citizens, all enjoying greater religious freedom under
Mihkail Gorbachev, want to get rid of the pool and rebuild
the cathedral.
   The reconstruction movement has created a passionate
debate, tinged with re-emergent Russian nationalism and
Dostoyevskian issues of morality and state -- or individual
-- responsibility.
   Mr. Ryzhak takes a pragmatic view. It costs only 50
kopeks, or 80 cents, to use the pool, a sauna and shower,
and, he says, "We are paupers. There are so many other things
to worry about." As to responsibility for the cathedral's
fate, he says, "It's the system, not the fault of the
people."
   Another swimmer, Ada Budkevich, a buxom, 55-year-old
building engineer, says that because the old cathedral could
never be precisely replicated, the money should be spent on
"all the things that are falling to pieces elsewhere." Still,
Ms. Budkevich confesses to "a certain guilty feeling because
everybody had a hand in what was done to the church."
   Other swimmers gather to argue. "It is extremely important
to raise the moral value of the society," says Nina Bourkina,
a cathedral partisan.
   "It's not for nothing that this place was chosen for the
cathedral," says Marina Ignatava, a slender 30-year-old in a
bikini. "I can find another place to swim."
   Articles on the cathedral have appeared regularly in
Moscow newspapers. A TV station has broadcast a 12-minute
documentary showing the church's demolition. A conservative
nationalist newspaper, Literaturnaya Rossiya, has launched a
fundraising drive for the cathedral, and cash has come from
supporters rich and poor.
   Several benefit concerts by well-known Russian singers
have been held here. Money may even come from America; Arkady
Nebolsin, of New York, president of the American Society for
the Preservation of Monuments and Culture in Russia, says the
group will begin a fund drive.
   "It is a signal of common grief and the necessity to plead
guilty to what we have done to ourselves," Bishop Vladimir of
the Orthodox Church's Moscow diocese says of the
reconstruction movement.
   Built in the late 19th century to commemorate the Russian
victory over Napoleon, the cathedral was an architectural
masterpiece of gilded cupolas, imported marbles and frescoes
that took 40 years and 15 million rubles to complete. Some
called it the eighth miracle of the world.
   Stalin, during an anti-religious campaign, decided the
site would be good for a state Palace of Soviets. At noon on
Dec. 5, 1931, shortly after the cathedral's chimes rang for
the last time, it was dynamited, and collapsed in a mushroom
cloud of dust. The Soviet government is said to have salvaged
the gold from the cupolas and appropriated some of the
frescoes, which now reside in a state museum.
   The basement was enlarged for the planned palace. When the
land proved too swampy for such a huge structure, the
basement was tiled and turned into a swimming pool -- a
sunken circle of now-cracked tiles six times the size of a
standard Olympic pool.
   The campaign to rebuild the church is based in the tiny,
cluttered office of Yuri Yushkin, the editor of Literaturnaya
Rossiya. Sitting at his desk amid piles of yellowing
newspapers, he says the pool sits at Russia's spiritual
center. The cathedral was a history text, he says, its walls
bearing the names of heroes in Russia's 1812 victory over
Napoleon. Its name evoked the belief that Christ saved Russia
from the invasion. So the pool is sacrilegious, he says --
and "a most disgraceful and dirty thing to have right there
at the Kremlin wall."
   So far, 468,000 rubles have been raised toward a goal of
200 million rubles, or $320 million. Mr. Yushkin reads some
of the messages that donors have written: "Let my drop enter
the sea," says "Slave Alexandra," of the Tambouv region, who
sends 10 rubles. "Here is my month's salary," says Julia
Manko of Donetsk, who sends 365 rubles. A Mr. Kibetz, of
Magadan, includes words of a prayer with his 50 rubles.
   Mr. Yushkin believes the cathedral could be rebuilt by
2012, bicentennial of Napoleon's retreat. Large problems
loom, however. Mr. Yushkin thinks their resolution will prove
the sincerity of Mr. Gorbachev's program for a freer society.
   The land belongs to the government. A special decree would
be required to return it to the church. The Supreme Soviet
and the Council of Ministers haven't even responded to a
church request for permission to begin rebuilding -- much
less promised money for it, as Mr. Yushkin and church
officials would like. If the government denies permission,
the church plans to appeal to Mr. Gorbachev.
   Christ the Savior must also compete for money with another
church project, already approved by the government,
commemorating the Christianization of Russia a thousand years
ago.
   And then there are the swimming pool partisans to contend
with. Nikolai Portnov, the gray-haired pool director, calls
cathedral reconstruction "a utopian idea. Of course it is sad
and bad that the cathedral was brought down, but since the
pool exists and is so popular, what is the point of bringing
it down, too?"
   Mr. Portnov has his own dream for the pool site:
rebuilding it as part of a first-class sports and recreation
area. He says the disrepair of the pool embarrasses him; the
saunas are dark and moldy and the spartan locker rooms
filthy. An architect's rendering of a proposed renovation
hangs on his office wall. The design was commissioned by the
Moscow city government in 1981 and approved in 1985. A new
city government dropped the project in 1986.
   The church was the stumbling block, says Yuri Knyazev, a
Moscow sports-facility official. The Moscow City Council, he
says, sees no point in spending money on the pool if it is to
be closed and the land given back to the church. The Soviet
government already has returned more than 3,000 cathedrals
and other properties to the church.
   Mr. Portnov says he has heard nothing from cathedral
promoters, but he did meet some recent visitors who, because
of the sanctity of the site, came to be baptized in the pool.
Mr. Portnov finds the spiritual mystique of the place a bit
strange. Gesturing toward the hundreds of swimmers bobbing in
the pool's greenish water with their brightly colored bathing
caps, he says: "This is a far cry from the Ganges River."

   TOKYO -- Japan imported agricultural, forestry and fishery
products valued at $51 billion in 1989, up 7.9% from 1988 and
exceeding $50 billion for the first time, the government
said, citing rising grain prices and the yen's strength for
most of last year that made imports easier.
   Imports from the U.S., which has been asking Japan to open
up its market for more agricultural products, rose 9.1% to
$16.3 billion.

   Overall imports of grain and other agricultural goods last
year increased 8.3% to $29.6 billion. Those of wheat from the
U.S., where the 1988 drought pushed up prices, rose 15%,
while corn showed an 8.8% rise. Imports of U.S. beef climbed
28%. The Japanese government plans to lift restrictions on
beef imports in 1991.
   Imports of forestry products, a subject of bilateral trade
talks with the U.S., jumped 21% from 1988 to $10.8 billion,
topping $10 billion for the first time.
   Despite an increase in volume, though, fishery product
imports, at $10.5 billion, registered a 3.5% drop because of
falling prices of some fish.

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Health and Human Services Department
submitted to Congress a bill aimed at cracking down on fraud
by drug companies.
   The bill is the administration's response to an
investigation of the generic drug industry by a congressional
subcommittee headed by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.). The
investigation revealed alleged industry fraud against the
Food and Drug Administration and bribery of FDA officials,
and resulted in several criminal convictions of drug-company
executives and FDA officials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), who heads a House
subcommittee that will consider the bill, said it "appears to
offer a constructive approach in giving the FDA new and much
needed enforcement tools." William Haddad, chairman of the
Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association, a trade group,
said he took a "generally favorable" view of the proposed
legislation.
   Under the administration plan, which would apply to both
generic and brand-name drug companies, individuals who
defraud the FDA would be subject to fines of as much as
$100,000 for each incident. They also would be barred from
applying for approval on new drug products for at least three
years. Currently, the FDA lacks the legal authority to bar
such individuals from the drug-approval process.
   Drug companies that have been found guilty of defrauding
the FDA could be fined as much as $5 million for each
incident. The companies would be barred from marketing in the
U.S. for a period of two years any drugs approved while the
criminal activity occurred. This provision could be overruled
by HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Rep. Dingell also plans to introduce a bill that would
include more mandatory penalties and would apply only to
generic drug companies, according to a congressional source.
The bill also would propose that the FDA inspector general's
office investigate wrongdoing in the generic drug industry.
Currently, the inspector general is permitted to investigate
corruption only in the government.
   Rep. Dingell said the administration proposal was
"well-intentioned, but we're going to continue working on our
own legislation."

   MOUNTAINVIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc. said it made
major performance enhancements to SparcStation 1, its
flagship desktop computer.
   The maker of computer workstations said the new
SparcStation 1-Plus, with no change in price for an
entry-level system, delivers more than 20% more processing
power and 25% faster graphics than the SparcStation 1. In
addition, Sun said it reduced prices of mass storage and
memory options for its entire product line by 30% to 50%.

   Headin' for the First Roundup,
   They'll Be Singing Yuppie-Yi-O

   Cattle drives at the Y.O. Ranch are usually models of
efficiency, requiring but nine cowboys to handle 70 or 80
longhorn steers.
   This weekend, however, the central Texas ranch will be
saddled with 150 new cowhands trying to do the same job. The
steers may never stop laughing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The weekend wranglers, you see, are the tenderest of
tenderfeet, recipients of a "Christmas in April"
cowboy-fantasy package from Neiman Marcus's most recent
Christmas catalog. For a mere $627 a person, would-be cowboys
and cowgirls get two nights at the Y.O. Hilton in nearby
Kerrville, a cocktail party, a Saturday night dinner-dance
and the rare privilege of driving a herd of longhorns across
15 miles of the ranch's mesquite-strewn, 45,000-acre range.
Within two hours after the phone lines opened for
reservations last fall, all 150 spots were filled.
   Among those horsing around this weekend will be lawyers,
doctors and real-estate investors from New York and Beverly
Hills and dozens of spots in between, and the ranch isn't
expecting to saddle up a lot of experienced cowhands. "It's
going to be a hoot," confides one of the organizers.
   The Y.O. has hired 100 real cowboys to protect the
longhorns from the greenhorns. But the cattle probably won't
be cowed; they're veteran performers. Docile despite their
menacing-looking three-foot horns, the steers are part of the
ranch's so-called "Hollywood" herd, which has performed in
cigarette commercials and at the 1984 Republican convention
in Dallas. Their regular gig is posing for the ranch's
photo-taking safaris. "They're well-traveled and used to fame
and fortune," says a spokeswoman for the ranch.
   There will be dangers, though. Ranch officials have warned
against the wearing of halter tops and shorts, since a nearly
nude dude could ride home with a bad sunburn and nasty saddle
sores. "A full day in the saddle when you aren't used to it
can have rewards of its own," says Walter Schreiner, trail
boss and ranch owner.
   The Y.O., a real working ranch credited with preventing
the vanishing of the longhorn breed from the West, wants
these greenhorns to have a very good time. After all, the
ranch just happens to have about 4,000 acres for sale to
those who find they want to trade in their city duds for
good. "Some of these wives who thought they were just buying
their husbands a weekend on a ranch might end up there
forever," the spokeswoman says.

   P&amp;G Net Rises
   30% While Sales
   Increase by 13%

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. reported fiscal third-quarter net
income soared a higher-than-expected 30% as sales rose 13%.
   For the third quarter, ended March 31, net income climbed
to $404 million, or $1.14 a share, from $310 million, or 92
cents a share, a year earlier. The company had more shares
outstanding this year because of an acquisition, and the
year-earlier per-share figure is adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock
split last November.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales rose to $6.12 billion from $5.43 billion.
   Analysts had predicted a strong quarter, but the results
beat even the rosiest forecasts. "It's like a broken record,"
said Joseph Kozloff, analyst with Smith Barney in New York,
pinning the higher results on a variety of P&amp;G's operations,
especially overseas.
   Based on the higher earnings report, some analysts boosted
their forecasts for P&amp;G's fiscal 1990 and 1991 results. Mr.
Kozloff, for instance, raised his 1990 estimate to $4.50 a
share, up from his earlier estimate of $4.40. For 1991, he
expects P&amp;G to earn $5.20 a share, up from his earlier $5.10
forecast.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, P&amp;G shares
rose $1.125, to $69.50.
   One factor that helped the Cincinnati-based maker of
consumer products was a lower tax rate of 32.1%, compared
with 38.5% the year before.
   More important, though, was P&amp;G's continued growth in
Japan and other international markets, analysts said. In the
U.S., P&amp;G's market shares in laundry and cleaning products
improved.
   Cost-cutting measures continue to be a priority at the
company. For instance, P&amp;G is expected to announce some plant
closings, because in the second quarter the company took a
one-time charge of $174 million to cover the consolidation.
   For the fiscal first nine months, P&amp;G posted net income of
$1.32 billion, or $3.71 a share, up 27% from $1.04 billion,
or an adjusted $3.06 a share. Sales rose 12% to $17.87
billion from $15.97 billion.
   The year-earlier figures included a gain from P&amp;G's switch
to a hyperinflationary accounting system for certain
operations in Latin America. P&amp;G didn't quantify the gain at
the time, but analysts say it was worth about seven cents to
nine cents a share.

   Foreigners Keep Gobbling Up U.S. Firms
   As Americans Have Financing Troubles

<LP>
   With many U.S. buyers hobbled by problems getting bank
debt or junk-bond financing, a steady parade of foreign
buyers continues to gobble up U.S. corporations.
   Ever since Japanese purchases of Rockefeller Center and
Columbia Pictures jolted Americans last year, foreign buyers
have kept up their acquisitions even as many U.S. concerns
have held back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest examples came within hours of each other
yesterday morning when Norton Co. agreed to be sold for $1.9
billion to Cie. de Saint-Gobain of France, and a Mideast
investment concern won an auction for Saks Fifth Avenue with
a $1.5 billion bid. Both bids were blowouts that far exceeded
expectations.
   Mike Overlock, head of mergers and acquisitions at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said he believes foreign buyers are
gaining a greater share of the $1 billion-plus acquisitions
of U.S. concerns than in the past several years. He said
that's partly because U.S. leveraged buy-out firms have faded
from the scene.
   Stephen Waters, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., which advised the winning bidder for
Saks, agreed. "The collapse of the junk-bond market and the
strictures that the Federal Reserve is putting on U.S. banks
have allowed foreign buyers who aren't operating under the
same strictures to be more aggressive on pricing," Mr. Waters
said.
   Felix Rohatyn, senior partner at Lazard Freres &amp; Co.,
which advised Saint-Gobain, said foreign purchases of U.S.
concerns have risen "dramatically," reflecting both the
growth of foreign economies and the fact that many U.S.
companies have taken on too much debt to make purchases.
   "It may be that foreign companies leveraged themselves
less over the last 10 years than American companies, and are
in a stronger position now to make acquisitions," said Mr.
Rohatyn. "The Europeans and Japanese have invested heavily in
their own businesses, and have grown to have the critical
mass to do these sort of things."
   According to Securities Data Corp., five of the 10 biggest
announced bids for U.S. concerns this year have come from
foreign bidders. And foreign companies accounted for 31% of
the dollar value of all announced bids for U.S. targets.
   Without a healthy market for junk bonds, U.S. leveraged
buy-out firms haven't been able to compete for many of the
companies that came up for grabs. This year's only big
announced LBO, a $780 million purchase of Chrysler's
Gulfstream business aircraft unit, is being done by
Forstmann, Little &amp; Co., which has its own subordinated debt
fund and so doesn't need to sell junk bonds.
   In the Saks auction, Bahrain-based Investcorp
International Inc. was helped by its ability to tap its own
big pools of both equity and subordinated debt, which
eliminated any need for selling junk bonds. According to
people familiar with the Saks auction, Investcorp plans to
put up about $600 million in equity and $300 million from its
own debt fund.
   The hefty equity and debt contributions reduced the need
for bank debt to less than half of the purchase price, making
it easier for Investcorp to line up $700 million in bank debt
from a group led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Only one
buy-out fund, Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, bid for Saks,
in a joint venture with another retailer. Another,
Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co., expressed interest, but didn't
make a formal bid.
   The runners-up in both contests also were foreign. The No.
2 bidder for Saks was a team of management and a Japanese
concern, which is said to have bid $1.3 billion -- itself at
the top of the range of expected bids. And the company
Saint-Gobain outbid for Norton was a British conglomerate,
BTR PLC.
   J. Tomilson Hill, co-head of investment banking at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which conducted the Saks
auction, said that foreign acquirers such as Hanson PLC and
Grand Metropolitan PLC have generally made the kind of
drastic operating changes that eventually justified what at
first appeared to be high prices for their U.S. purchases. He
called both the Saks and Norton price tags "very full."
Saint-Gobain, however, has promised to avoid certain drastic
cost-cutting and plant-closing measures.
   William Strong, co-head of world-wide mergers and
acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc., noted that foreign
companies continue to be helped in buying U.S. assets by the
weak dollar. Although the dollar has rebounded recently, it
remains nearly 40% below its 1985 peak against the yen, for
example.
   To be sure, many takeover experts believe the appetite of
Japanese concerns for foreign acquisitions will inevitably be
curbed by this year's big 30% sell-off in the Japanese stock
market. Also, Saks was already owned by a British concern,
B.A.T Industries PLC.
   And takeover experts said U.S. corporations that have big
cash hoards or don't already have big debt loads will
continue to be able to bid for other U.S. companies, as
Georgia-Pacific Corp. did successfully in winning its $3
billion battle for Great Northern Nekoosa earlier this year.
This past week, Dayton-Hudson Corp. won Marshall Field for
$1.04 billion.
   One symbolic test of U.S. buyers' ability to complete
acquisitions will come when a group of unions attempts to
raise financing this summer for a $4.38 billion leveraged
buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. With UAL stock
trading far below the $201-a-share price tag, traders aren't
betting on the group's success.
   Although foreign acquisitions sometimes ignite political
outcries in the U.S., there isn't any consensus among
economists or others on Wall Street that the purchases harm
the U.S. economy or damage the national interest. "Capital
comes into the U.S. and the jobs stay here," said one
takeover lawyer.
   But at the moment, the same lawyer noted, "what you're
seeing now is an almost exclusively foreign market."

   Money Funds Yields
   Were Flat Again
   In the Latest Week

   Yields on money-market mutual funds remained flat in the
week ended Tuesday, despite recent increases in short-term
interest rates.
   The average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds
stayed at 7.99% for the third consecutive week, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Compound yields assume
reinvestment of dividends.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the 428 taxable funds tracked by Donoghue's fell
for the fourth consecutive week, to $381.7 billion from
$382.1 billion. Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of the
newsletter, which is based in Holliston, Mass., attributed
the latest decline to withdrawals for tax purposes.
   Meanwhile yields on many other short-term investments
rose. The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's
auction, for instance, shot up to 8.35% from 8.18% the week
before, while three-month bills rose to 8.05% from 7.97%.
Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service,
reported earlier this week that yields on certificates of
deposit at major banks rose across the board in the week
ended Tuesday.
   Average maturity of the funds' investments remained at a
relatively long 44 days for the second consecutive week,
following several weeks of 45 days; maturities have ranged
from 29 to 53 days in recent years. Funds invest in such
things as commercial paper, short-term Treasury securities
and certificates of deposit.
   "We may see average maturities shorten if {portfolio}
managers are taking this talk of an inflation threat
seriously," said Ms. Negus of Donoghue's. Shorter maturities
typically are considered a sign that money managers think
interest rates are rising, because they can then latch onto
higher yields sooner. Conversely, longer maturities usually
are thought to indicate declining rates.
   The average seven-day simple yield remained at 7.69% in
the week ended Tuesday, while the 30-day simple yield inched
up to 7.69% from 7.68%. The average 30-day compound yield
moved to 7.99% from 7.98%.
   Yields on tax-free money funds rose by about 0.10
percentage point in the week ended Tuesday, although assets
fell. The average seven-day compound yield on tax-exempt
funds, for example, jumped to 5.74% from 5.63%. The latest
week's yield is equivalent to 7.97% for investors in the 28%
tax bracket and 8.57% for those paying 33%.
   Assets of the 220 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's
fell by about $916 million, to $76.6 billion. Average
maturity shortened to 43 days from 45.

   Stock prices rebounded in light trading, snapping a
five-session losing streak. But bond prices continued to
erode modestly and the dollar weakened.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.94 to 2666.44 in
thin trading. Long-term Treasury bonds lost about an eighth
of a point, or about $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said apparent firming in the bond market early in
the day got stock prices off to a good start. Later, news
that Norton had accepted a $90-a-share takeover offer from
Saint-Gobain of France provided enough confidence to keep
stock prices up after bonds began slipping.
   The modest stock market rally was welcome relief from the
drumbeat of slumping prices that carried the Dow Jones
Industrial Average down 4% in the past five sessions. But
many analysts dismissed yesterday's gains as a mere technical
rally that won't endure. They argue that investors remain
worried about the course of interest rates and inflation and
aren't likely to see stocks as the best place to put money
until it is clear that interest rates have stabilized.
   Bond traders share the pessimistic interest-rate outlook.
Although bond prices rose briefly yesterday, traders remained
worried about inflation and economic growth. They're bracing
for the initial report Friday on first-quarter gross national
product, which is expected to be at least double the 1.1%
growth posted in the fourth-quarter of 1989 and perhaps as
much as 3%. They also expect inflation data that are part of
the GNP report to show inflation rising.
   Longer term, traders are concerned that the Treasury's
quarterly refunding auction next month will put further
pressure on bond prices. And they're debating the likelihood
the Federal Reserve will push short-term interest rates
higher before the May auction. As the economy picks up steam
and inflation rises, the odds increase that the Fed will
raise rates in a bid to slow the economy and bring inflation
back under control.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices climbed in light trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 133.5 million shares. Advancing
issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 774 to 664.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were off. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year issue rose to 8.97%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was lower. In late New York trading, the U.S.
currency was quoted at 1.6785 marks and 158.75 yen compared
with 1.6980 marks and 158.93 yen Tuesday.

   Friday, April 27, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Czeslaw Milosz:
The Poet Remembers." Take "The Captive Mind," a famously
trenchant critique of totalitarianism, add a lifetime of
poems, fiction and essays written under the Nazis, under the
Soviets and in exile, and you have the remarkable career in
letters sketched in this film.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, April 29, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "The Story of the
Beach Boys: Summer Dreams." It seems devilishly hard for TV
to re-create the mood of the 1960s, so it's all the more
striking when this nicely acted saga of one of the decade's
best-known bands actually succeeds.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, April 29, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Caroline?" A
beautiful woman (Stephanie Zimbalist) shows up on the
doorstep of a rich family, claiming to be their long-lost
daughter. Is she real, or is she a gold digger? Pamela Reed,
George Grizzard, Patricia Neal and Dorothy McGuire co-star in

   Mondays, April 30-May 21, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Inside
Gorbachev's U.S.S.R." Hedrick Smith is the host of this
four-part series looking at the hopes and fears stirred up by
glasnost and perestroika -- to say nothing of burgeoning
nationalism (more in Monday's column).
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, May 1, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Other People's
Money." Public TV's "Frontline" already was following the
story of Charles Keating Jr. last October, when the House
Banking Committee began holding hearings on his crumbling
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. Naturally, the producer, Marion
Goldin (formerly of "60 Minutes"), persisted. This film
presents all the muck she managed to rake.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, May 2, 9-10:45 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Eat a Bowl of
Tea." This 1989 feature film -- produced and directed by
Wayne Wang, and based on a 1961 novel by Louis Chu -- is one
of the best entries in this year's "American Playhouse." It
is set in New York's Chinatown in 1949, shortly after the
repeal of the "exclusion laws" prohibiting the entry of
Chinese women into the U.S. When a young Chinese-American
introduces a Chinese wife into the aging, depressed "bachelor
society" of the older generation, the results are as poignant
as they are hilarious.
                                                                                                       

   Thursdays, May 3-June 7, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Inspector
Morse." In three new two-part mysteries, John Thaw returns as
the Oxford police inspector who (to paraphrase James Joyce)
is a poet among policemen and a policeman among poets. The
bad news is that the first film contains a lot of contrived
camera work that adds nothing but a distracting artiness. The
good news is that the second two films were made by steadier
hands.
                                                                                                       

   Friday, May 4, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Richard Nixon
Reflects: An American Interests Special." In conjunction with
the recent publication of his new book, "In the Arena: A
Memoir of Victory, Defeat and Renewal," and the imminent
opening of the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda,
Calif., former President Richard M. Nixon appears in an
extended interview with Morton Kondracke, host of Blackwell
Corp.'s regular series, "American Interests."
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, May 6, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "Burning Bridges."
"Emotional honesty" was the slogan back in the liberated
1960s. But is it really wise to reveal one's true feelings to
everyone in one's life? To judge from this TV movie starring
Meredith Baxter-Birney and Nick Mancuso, the answer is an
emphatic "no."
                                                                                                       

   Mondays, May 7-June 4, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Skyscraper."
First, consider that some architects are now dreaming of
500-story-high buildings. Then relax and enjoy this series
about the design, politics and construction of the downright
puny (47-story) Worldwide Plaza in midtown Manhattan.

   S&amp;P Puts Sotheby's
   On Its CreditWatch
   On Spending Plan

   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed the commercial
paper of Sotheby's Inc. on its CreditWatch with negative
implications, after the giant auction house announced plans
for a joint venture to purchase the Pierre Matisse Gallery's
extensive art inventory for $142.8 million.
   Sotheby's is a unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., New York.
The unit's commercial paper carries a top single-A-1 rating
from S&amp;P and is guaranteed by Sotheby's Holdings. Moody's
Investors Service Inc., the other major rating agency, hasn't
rated the company's commercial paper.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sotheby's didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the
S&amp;P move.
   Carla Kennedy Newman, an S&amp;P analyst, said that Sotheby's
is taking on "a new risk, inventory risk, that wasn't there
before" by purchasing the gallery inventory. "The company
hasn't played as a principal in the art market before, except
in very limited ways, but it's doing it in a big way this
time," she said.
   With the purchase, Ms. Newman said, Sotheby's is
essentially "working as a merchant banker, a broker," in the
art market.
   Sotheby's said it had arranged to purchase the Matisse
Gallery's 2,300-painting inventory, in a joint venture with
Acquavella Contemporary Art Inc., owned by New York art
dealer William Acquavella. Mr. Acquavella will serve as the
venture's managing director, with profits from the sale of
paintings to be split equally between himself and Sotheby's.
   The auction house will raise the purchase price for the
inventory through the commercial paper sale, then lend the
money to the joint venture, which will pay an undisclosed
rate of interest.
   Mr. Acquavella said that "the financing could have been
obtained by other sources" but that he was seeking "a partner
who could help me market this is in best fashion possible."
Mr. Acquavella will decide which works will be sold privately
or at auction.
   The works owned by the New York-based Matisse Gallery
include works by Joan Miro, Jean Dubuffet and Marc Chagall,
almost all acquired directly from the artists themselves.
Several of the works have been off the market and in
warehouses for years, Mr. Acquavella said. Pierre Matisse,
who died in August 1989, was the son of painter Henri Matisse
and represented many of those artists.
   "Wall Street just picks on the negatives," Mr. Acquavella
said of the S&amp;P move. "Here's a deal where Sotheby's has
something -- not just air and a franchise -- with tremendous
upside potential."
   Separately, Sotheby's held a meeting of Wall Street
analysts who follow the company. The auction house's stock
recently has fallen sharply in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. Yesterday it closed up 75 cents a share to
$18.50.
   Salomon Brothers analyst Harvey Katz said he views the
venture with Mr. Acquavella as "a positive" for the company.
"Sotheby's, because of its flexibility and liquidity, was
able to step up to the plate and gain a substantial
consignment on favorable terms," he said.

   Michael Milken's plea bargain puts a punctuation mark at
the end of the era he had come to symbolize. There will be
further details to come, and a lingering impact in the new
era, not least in arguments over who was to blame for the
Savings and Loan debacle. But with the Milken case settled,
the final act has come to its end -- perhaps suitably, an
ambiguous one.
   The felonies Mr. Milken has confessed are a far cry from a
sinister conspiracy at the heart of the junk-bond market, as
overheated imaginations once had it. Nor are Mr. Milken's
crimes the suitcases-of-cash bribes of the Boesky case. But
they are not nothing. The confession included counts that,
unlike the technicalities in the Princeton/Newport and
Freeman cases, both clearly were premeditated and clearly
wrong.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In any text on how to cheat in securities, for example,
Case 1 would be systematic shaving of points within the
bid-asked spread. Mr. Milken confessed to doing this --
though to be sure for a purpose that seemingly would have
been legitimate if handled openly. The shaving was intended
to recoup Drexel's expenses in selling a mutual fund and was
done with the agreement of the fund's manager, though not
disclosed to shareholders or properly recorded in the books.
Whatever else, the choice of this method of moving funds from
one pocket to another certainly does show a moral obtuseness.
So does the trading of favors with Mr. Boesky confessed in
other counts.
   In many ways the intriguing question is why? After you've
made your first billion or so, you really don't have to shave
the spreads or get in bed with Ivan. How does the biggest
financier since J.P. Morgan end up confessing to shoplifting?
   Mr. Milken's critics allege, of course, that his
confession is but the tip of the iceberg. Our own view is
that his admissions are entitled to what might be called the
presumption of RICO. In a normal plea bargain, everyone
assumes the criminal was guilty of more than he confessed.
But our experience with the current spate of racketeering
charges has been rather the opposite. The combination of
draconian penalties and an ill-defined crime have tilted the
bargaining advantage vastly in favor of the prosecution.
   The original charges against Mr. Milken, remember, were
levied by a prosecutor running for mayor of New York. The
final plea does not look much like the original charges.
Pressures for settlement included, for example, an FBI visit
to Mr. Milken's 92-year-old grandfather. The dropping of
charges against Lowell Milken suggests they were filed
chiefly to coerce his brother. The unambiguous case against
Mr. Boesky was resolved with a three-year sentence on his
promise to serve up a bigger fish, Michael Milken. And to get
Mr. Milken, the government was quite willing to put Drexel
Burnham Lambert on the road to bankruptcy.
   So the government had Mr. Boesky as an informer. It had
the cooperation of Mr. Milken's brokerage firm. It had
various immunized witnesses. It had access to warehouses of
records. Instead of finding crimes and seeking the
perpetrator, as the ethical canons of prosecution require, it
set its target and searched for crimes it might charge. It
found some real crimes. But the world should note that after
investigating the man who handled more inside information
than anyone in history, prosecutors did not end up feeling
they could prove a count of the much-ballyhooed insider
trading. The shoplifting charge reflects almost as badly on
the cops as the criminal.
   In any event, those who contend that corner-cutting always
was the essence of Mr. Milken's operation face an enormous
hurdle. He leaves behind so many still-enthusiastic clients
that this scarcely seems a serious possibility. Most
junk-bond revenue went not to the takeover wars but to
finance some of the most entrepreneurial companies in
America. Some of these companies are of course troubled, as
some risk-taking companies always will be. Yet risk taking
also is the spark plug of economic progress.
   We now are in our eighth year of economic expansion, a
peacetime record. Over this time, the large established
companies have been paring back jobs, in part because of the
need for efficiency spurred by the threat of both foreign
competition and takeovers. But at the same time, the American
economy has enjoyed a net job creation that is the envy of
other nations. The expansion we have enjoyed was due in part
to the opening of new financing mechanisms for smaller and
riskier companies.
   Many good things, of course, get carried too far. Mr.
Milken's original insight was that the premium on
noninvestment-grade bonds more than compensated for the risk.
Over time markets would close this anomaly, and inevitably
bad risks were underwritten. Mr. Milken's $500 million in
compensation, as well as $1 million incomes for 29-year-old
investment bankers, invited envy, suspicion and in general
signaled something amiss. The use of junk bonds to finance
takeover attempts made enemies of corporate chieftains. And
while the advent of takeovers put sleepy managements on their
toes, at the end of the wave came ego trips like RJR-Nabisco
and losers-from-the-start like Campeau.
   Big waves often crest thunderously. Just as the junk-bond
market topped out, Congress moved to legislate a fire sale of
Savings and Loan holdings, plunging the junk-bond market to
unfathomed depths. Probably politicians now will blame Mr.
Milken for this debacle, indeed for the whole S&amp;L problem.
(Laying aside the contributions of Jim Wright and the Keating
Five, it actually was started by Fernand St Germain's
midnight expansion of deposit insurance, which proved to be a
formula for matching marginal lenders with marginal
borrowers.) The corporate chieftains cheered the collapse of
junk bonds and have largely succeeded in erecting nearly
impenetrable legal bastions against takeovers. Wall Street is
in depression and Drexel in bankruptcy. Clearly the era was
over, and the Milken plea only the final period.
   The new era, still defining itself, will be quite
different. Mr. Milken will have a long vacation at Lompoc.
The Justice Department has thrown a lasso around RICO
charges. Rudy Giuliani's successor as U.S. attorney, he
explictly promises, will not run for mayor. Hollywood
novelist Ben Stein, whose "Ludes" neatly recorded the end of
an earlier era, will make a movie of the Milken potboiler
he's been serializing in public prints. Wall Street gradually
will recover, but the million-dollar youths will not return.
After the S&amp;L washout, junk bonds will prove permanent though
chastened. Takeovers will nearly vanish. High leverage will
be unfashionable; the new danger is more likely to be overly
tight credit standards.
   Envy and suspicion of unchecked power will have to find
new targets. Our guess is that the corporate chieftains had
better stop to think. Now even more insulated from
shareholders, they had better be prepared to explain to whom
they're accountable. Otherwise they may end up accountable to
John Dingell. The first warning sign: General Motors received
(though politely rebuffed) letters from California and New
York state pension funds inquiring about its procedures for
selecting a successor to Roger Smith.
   That is for another day, we suppose. Today we mark the
passing of the 1980s. It was a heady time; Michael Milken
undone by Rudy Giuliani, recorded by Tom Wolfe. For a
blinding moment Mr. Milken was Master of the Universe, able
to create companies, move markets, guide the republic and
indeed the world into a bright entrepreneurial future. And
why, he apparently felt, should the Master worry about a few
eighths of a point, or about keeping the books honest, or
about the manners or ethics of a near-Master?
   By now, both the good and the bad of this time have
passed. So perhaps it's well that Mike Milken decided to cop
a plea and put it all behind him, and behind the rest of us.

   Three GM Plants
   In Canada Idled

   OSHAWA, Ontario -- A walkout by Canadian Auto Workers
union members forced General Motors Corp. to shut down three
assembly plants here Tuesday afternoon and most of yesterday.
   But late yesterday, GM said local union leaders were
asking members to return to their jobs in time for the
evening shift. GM and the union were scheduled to begin talks
to resolve the dispute, which flared after a local union
leader was suspended from his job.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As of yesterday afternoon, GM said it had lost two shifts'
worth of production Tuesday night and Wednesday morning at
its Oshawa No. 1 car plant and its Oshawa truck assembly
factory. The evening shift was canceled at the Oshawa No. 2
car plant, but work resumed there yesterday morning, a
company spokesman said. Some 10,000 workers either walked off
the job or were sent home, he said.
   The local union moved to halt the walkout late yesterday
after a strong rebuke from CAW president Bob White. Mr.
White, in a statement, called the shutdown "absolutely
ludicrous" and a violation of union policy. GM had earlier
said the strike was illegal, and threatened to seek
government sanctions against the CAW.
   The strike began about midday Tuesday when managers
suspended a CAW local official for two weeks. A GM spokesman
wouldn't elaborate on the reasons, but the union said the
official was disciplined for remarks made to a GM manager.
   Shortly after the suspension, a small group of workers in
a key area of the Oshawa No. 1 car plant walked off the job,
halting production of midsized Chevrolet Lumina and Buick
Regal models. The CAW local then called its shop stewards off
the floor at all three Oshawa assembly facilities. That
precipitated a broader work stoppage that finally forced GM
to cancel the evening shift Tuesday, the company said. The
work stoppages continued yesterday morning at two of the
three assembly plants at GM's Oshawa complex.
   GM didn't say how many vehicles it lost because of the
strike. The two Oshawa car plants build about 400 vehicles a
day, while the truck plant builds 480 vehicles a day.
   Separately, GM confirmed that it will move production of
its Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird models to its Ste.
Therese, Quebec, plant. The move is expected sometime before
1993, but GM didn't set a date. The company also didn't
elaborate on the fate of the Van Nuys, Calif., plant that
currently builds the cars. But GM officials have said they
are "optimistic" that the Van Nuys plant will keep operating
producing other models.
   Still, Stephen P. Yokich, head of the United Auto Workers
union's GM department, denounced the move, saying such
announcements "are doing nothing to create a favorable
environment for the difficult negotiating task we face" when
the UAW-GM contract expires this fall.

   FORT WORTH, Texas -- American Airlines, looking beyond
U.S. borders for growth, unveiled its latest weapons for
doing battle in the international skies: service, seats and
food.
   With where to fly, the ordering of aircraft and the
planning of expanded airport space taken care of long ago,
the AMR Corp. unit is focusing on hardware and amenities as
it continues an ambitious $11 billion international expansion
effort inaugurated in 1983.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In presentations here and in Chicago, its two main
international hubs, American trotted out for reporters and
travel agents some of the plush features reserved for
overseas customers -- many already in use.
   Included are wider first class and business class seats
swathed in sheepskin and capable of reclining nearly all the
way to horizontal for sleeping. The seats use foam rubber
softer than that in domestic coach seats with an especially
soft headrest that acts like a pillow. The airline also
ordered up larger blankets and plumper standard pillows. By
summer, first class seats will also get individual video
cassette recorders and electrically driven foot rests.
   The new seats are already installed in all but three of
the carrier's 36 international aircraft -- the rest will be
finished within two months.
   American also served up samples of its luxury food service
started earlier this year: shrimp cocktail followed by
lobster fajita (for first class) or Chateaubriand (for
business class). Dessert was a chocolate Marquis mousse
topped with shaved chocolate. The airline has hired a wine
consultant to plan menus and has bought a year's worth of
some wines.
   By moving into international markets, American is taking
on Swissair, British Airways and Cathay Pacific, carriers
known for their luxurious service.
   "Our ambition is to become known as the U.S. flag carrier.
We intend to compete with the best international carriers in
the world," said George Mueller, vice president of customer
service.
   As part of its growth plan, American has ordered $7.7
billion in international jets and committed to spend as much
as $655 million to expand some of its terminals. It is
spending an additional $3.4 billion developing special
international services, hiring multilingual flight attendants
and extra airport staffs.
   The airline last year began flights to Belgium,
Switzerland, Spain and France and stepped up its expansion
this year, buying Eastern Airlines' Latin American route

   Tokyo Exchange Pushes to Halt
   U.S. Sales of Nikkei Warrants

   NEW YORK -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange is applying pressure
to halt, at least for now, the further sale of warrants
allowing investors to bet on the direction of the Japanese
stock market.
   Reacting to these concerns from the Tokyo exchange, U.S.
underwriters and the American Stock Exchange, where
previously issued warrants are being traded, are expected to
voluntarily refrain from offering more of these instruments
to the public. The warrants have been blamed for adding to
the volatility in the Japanese stock markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Any pullback of this kind requested by Japanese financial
officials could exacerbate the debate in the U.S. and Europe
about how much Japan is willing to let market forces dictate
price movements in the Tokyo securities market.
   An exchange official in Tokyo said the exchange has had
discussions about the warrants with the Amex. The official,
who asked not to be identified, said that the decision to
withhold future issues includes warrants that profit from
either a rise or fall in the Nikkei index of 225 leading
stocks that trade in Tokyo.
   While the Tokyo exchange hasn't any regulatory authority
over securities issued in the U.S., it maintains an
information-sharing agreement with the Amex, through which
matters relating to the two markets are discussed.
   Ivers Riley, Amex senior executive vice president, says
his exchange "would proceed cautiously" when and if another
application for a Nikkei warrant comes before the exchange.
"We value our relationship with the Japanese markets and want
to maintain a liaison with them, and would want to be
sensitive to their marketplace."
   Currently, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. is planning to underwrite
an issue of 7.5 million Nikkei put warrants -- which rise in
value with a fall in the Nikkei index -- to be sold by
Norway's export-finance agency.
   Goldman Sachs said it couldn't comment because the
offering was in registration, but Amex officials said there
wasn't any reason to think the issue wouldn't come to market.
However, it might be the last for a while, according to
people in the U.S. underwriting community.
   The New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange
have applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to
trade Nikkei warrants. A spokeswoman for the New York
exchange said she was unable to determine late yesterday the
status of the application. The Pacific exchange said it is
awaiting SEC action.
   The Tokyo exchange has also asked individual U.S.
investment banks in the U.S. to refrain from underwriting
more warrant issues for the time being.
   "At this point in time we are complying with the TSE
request not to issue any more Nikkei warrants," said a
spokesman at Salomon Inc., which has issued two Nikkei
put-warrant issues and one call warrant issue. Call warrants
increase in value with a rise in the Nikkei stock index. The
Salomon spokesman said the subject "will be revisited" with
the Japanese soon.
   Like an option, a warrant gives the holder the right, but
not the obligation, to sell or purchase a security, currency
or, in this case, the cash equivalent of the Nikkei index at
a specific price on or before a specific date.
   There is a heated debate in financial and academic circles
over the effect of the Nikkei warrants on the prices of
securities traded on the Tokyo stock market. The first
warrants to be issued were puts, which rose sharply in value
as the Japanese stock market tumbled more than 25% this past
winter. It has since recovered a bit.
   There is a feeling among some U.S. securities firms that
the Nikkei warrants are being fingered as a scapegoat for the
volatility in Japan. One U.S. investment banker said that
stocks are sold in the Tokyo market to hedge Nikkei put
warrants when they are first created, but that Japanese
stocks are bought as a hedge when the warrants are exercised.
   "Lately, there have been a lot more warrants exercised
than have been created, so the net effect of the warrants
over the last couple of months has been to stabilize a weak
market," the investment banker contended.
   The Tokyo exchange official said, "We are in the middle of
investigating whether or not {Nikkei warrants} have had an
influence" on Tokyo stock prices. Japan's Ministry of Finance
is also studying the matter.
   While only about a half-dozen Nikkei warrant issues have
been sold to American investors, as many as 25 issues have
been sold during the past two years in Europe, where they
trade on an over-the-counter basis.
   Underwriters in London say the question of a "Nikkei
warrant moratorium" hasn't been raised there because there is
not much demand at present for the warrants in the
Euromarket. But an official at one of the leading securities
houses in Europe said each warrant issue is discussed with
the Japanese Ministry of Finance before being brought to
market.
   "If it's felt that such an issue wouldn't be looked
favorably upon by the Japanese parties concerned, we would
hold back," the official said.
   In addition, many Nikkei put warrants have been sold
privately to institutional investors in the U.S. and abroad.

   National Intergroup to Reduce Holding
   In Steel Firm With Sale to Nippon Kokan

   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. agreed to sell all
but 10% of its interest in National Steel Corp. to its
Japanese partner, Nippon Kokan K.K., for $147 million up
front and a like amount of deferred payments.
   The agreement ends a nearly two-year quest by National
Intergroup to sell its 50% holding in National Steel, which
it owns jointly with Nippon Kokan, and could provide the
company's embattled management with ammunition in a bitter
fight against dissident shareholders. The leading dissident,
Centaur Partners, owns 16.5% of NII common and is seeking to
elect its own slate of eight directors to the board in July.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, National Intergroup will sell the
interest in National Steel to Nippon Kokan in two equal
stages. For the initial 20%, NII will receive about $147
million, or the approximate book value of the holding at
year-end 1989. That $147 million will in turn be paid to
National Steel to cover NII's continuing liabilities from the
1983 sale of its Weirton Steel division to employees in
Weirton, W.Va.
   The second 20% holding calls for a deferred payment
through preferred stock. The preferred issue will have a face
value of about $147 million and a minimum redemption value of
$122 million. NII will receive dividend payments from Nippon
Kokan of roughly $16 million a year on the preferred. Under
the agreement, half of the preferred must be redeemed by the
fifth anniversary of issuance, with the balance redeemable by
the 10th anniversary.
   "This represents the final leg in our exit from the steel
business," said Stan Ellspermann, National Intergroup's chief
financial officer. He said he expects the transaction to
close by the end of June and to result in an approximate $13
million nonrecurring charge.
   Still, Mr. Ellspermann asserted that the transaction is
favorable to NII because it provides for a $30 million
improvement in the company's cash flow annually and also
lessens its liabilities outstanding to the former Weirton
Steel division.
   NII took its first major step out of the steel business in
1983, when it sold the Weirton Steel division. A second step
came a year later, when it sold for $292 million 50% of its
remaining basic steel business to Nippon Kokan, Japan's
second-largest and the world's sixth-biggest steelmaker.
   Since then, though, both National Intergroup's and
National Steel's fortunes have soured. NII has recorded net
losses in six of the last seven years, a record that has been
attacked by Centaur in its advertising. Diversification
forays into the oil and drug distribution businesses have run
into difficulties. NII said the latest sale would permit it
to concentrate more fully on its drug distribution business,
which accounts for about 80% of its $3.1 billion in fiscal
1989 sales.
   National Steel has had its troubles. Though it had net
income of $83.2 million on sales of $2.6 billion last year,
its earnings badly trail others in the industry. Productivity
gains haven't been fully achieved, partly because of a
culture clash between the Japanese and U.S. owners.
   NII and its investment bankers are known to have
aggressively sought buyers other than Nippon Kokan but found
no takers. Many weren't interested partly because of the
lifetime employment guarantees that National Steel gave
workers in recent contracts.
   Nevertheless, despite its recent troubles, analysts said
NII appeared to be getting a decent price for its National
Steel holding. In composite trading yesterday on the New York
Stock Exchange, NII shares closed at $15.375, up 25 cents.

   Milken Faces Myriad Civil Suits

   To hear some shareholder attorneys talk, Michael Milken's
next appearance should be in federal bankruptcy court.
   Shareholders and other investors have filed so many suits
against him, seeking billions of dollars, that even a fortune
as big as Mr. Milken's may be vulnerable, the attorneys say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Mr. Milken dismiss the suggestion as absurd
and say Mr. Milken's potential liability won't be nearly so
extensive. While some shareholder attorneys routinely file
multimillion-dollar suits whenever a takeover is announced or
the market drops, the suits against Mr. Milken seem to be
much more likely to succeed than most.
   Consider:
   -- Mr. Milken's guilty plea to six felony counts Tuesday
makes it impossible for him to claim in civil cases that he
was guilty of no market fraud. In each case, the former junk
bond impresario will be viewed as a convicted felon.
   -- So much evidence against him has already been gathered
by federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, much of which will eventually become available to
shareholder lawyers, that plaintiffs' attorneys will have to
do relatively little sleuthing of their own.
   -- While Mr. Milken didn't plead guilty to any
racketeering counts, recent court cases have made it
increasingly easy to show a so-called pattern of racketeering
in civil cases. Shareholders have sued Mr. Milken under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, and RICO
damages are automatically tripled.
   -- The SEC's funds to compensate victims of market
wrongdoing by Mr. Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
convicted abritrager Ivan F. Boesky, while stocked with more
than $600 million, cannot be used to pay tripled damages or
punitive damages. Thus, any judgment against Mr. Milken above
mere compensatory damages would have to come out of his own
pocket. Drexel was Mr. Milken's former employer. The
securities firm has filed for bankruptcy-court protection.
   All of this sounds like good news to Richard Greenfield,
one of the nation's top shareholder lawyers. As he eagerly
scanned the early wire reports of the plea Tuesday, Mr.
Greenfield said Mr. Milken should seriously contemplate
filing for bankruptcy-court protection. "It's a very real
possibility," said Mr. Greenfield, who has filed several
cases against Mr. Milken. "If I were in his shoes, I'd want
to start over on Day One. By the time he's out of jail, it's
all over."
   Steven Rosenfeld, an attorney for Mr. Milken, says there
are "no plans whatsoever" for his client to seek
bankruptcy-court protection. The partner in the New York law
firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind Wharton &amp; Garrison says there is
"nothing particularly remarkable" about the allegations in
the lawsuits. "There is a word processor somewhere that spews
out the same . . . allegations," Mr. Rosenfeld says. "I view
that as a plaintiff tactic."
   As his partner Arthur Liman said the day before, Mr.
Rosenfeld said the Milken camp believes the $400 million Mr.
Milken is required to provide the SEC for civil restitution
will more than cover any legitimate claims.
   Still, the Milken team faces a morass of suits. One of the
most sweeping, filed last month in Los Angeles by
shareholders of Unocal Corp., accuses Mr. Milken, Drexel and
many major takeover artists of the 1980s of a massive
conspiracy that defrauded shareholders in takeover targets.
   Mr. Greenfield's firm filed the suit along with plaintiff
lawyer William S. Lerach of the shareholder law firm of
Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie and Lerach. It alleges a
back-scratching arrangement by which Mr. Milken teamed up
with high-profile corporate raiders to manipulate stock
prices in huge acquisitions. The suit, which seeks $2.3
billion in trebled damages, claims that more than 70
defendants violated the RICO law.
   Under the alleged arrangement, Mr. Milken shared "secret
information with market operatives" and backed the takeover
attempts of such raiders as Carl Icahn, Ronald Perelman, T.
Boone Pickens and others. According to the allegations, a
raider would typically tell Mr. Milken he wanted to take over
a particular company, and Mr. Milken would then issue junk
bonds for the raider's companies and arrange for other
raiders to buy the bonds. The raiders felt obligated to buy
the bonds because they wanted Mr. Milken to fund their future
takeover attempts, the suit says. Meanwhile, at Mr. Milken's
direction, arbitragers would purchase big blocks of stock in
the target company with guarantees against loss provided by
Mr. Milken, the suit claims.
   While the Unocal suit claims enormous damages to
shareholders, a suit filed by Mr. Greenfield's firm in
February may be even broader. The firm sued on behalf of at
least 10,000 class members who purchased high-yield,
high-risk bonds underwritten by and sold through Drexel. They
charged that the junk bond market was rigged, that prices
were artificially determined and that without Mr. Milken to
act as "puppeteer," the market fell apart. Action in this
case is stalled for procedural reasons.
   Also pending are a multitude of civil cases lodged in the
past three years against Mr. Boesky, Drexel, Mr. Milken and
others that accuse the defendants of insider trading, stock
manipulation and other securities law violations. Many of
these cases are pending in federal court in New York, where
pretrial fact-finding has been slowed because of the
unavailability of Mr. Boesky, Mr. Milken and others to
testify at depositions. Thus far, federal prosecutors have
gotten the judge to deny the plaintiffs' lawyers access to
these witnesses while criminal investigations are being
pursued. But at some point, such a partial stay will
presumably be lifted.
   Finally, a sprinkling of cases across the country target
Mr. Milken among many other defendants in cases alleging that
savings and loans associations and other companies suffered
losses because they purchased large portfolios of Drexel's
junk bonds as part of back-scratching arrangements with Mr.
Milken.
   The strength of the plaintiffs' various charges are
difficult to gauge. Mr. Greenfield likens them to the
asbestos cases that led to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court
filing of Manville Corp., the giant asbestos manufacturer. He
says he believes that once one case "breaks through" to
trial, Mr. Milken will have no choice but to start settling
the rest of the cases.
   But a spokesman for Mr. Pickens's Mesa Petroleum Co., a
defendant in the Unocal case, calls the allegations "silly
stuff. They've taken any name that's appeared next to
Boesky's or {Boyd} Jefferies's. . . . They're throwing names
in the soup and alleging a scheme that is pure nonsense." Mr.
Jefferies, a former brokerage firm chief in Los Angles
pleaded guilty to two felony counts of breaking securities
laws in April 1987.
   Says attorney James Conroy, commenting on behalf of Revlon
Group Inc. Chairman Mr. Perelman and his MacAndrews &amp; Forbes
Holdings Inc., "The suit casts a net very broadly and names a
lot of people in the process. We don't belong there because
there is no basis in fact for the allegations."
   A civil case is always easier to prove than a criminal
case because the civil plaintiff doesn't have to prove his
charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead he must show only
that the accusations are more likely than not to be correct.
Nonetheless, the plaintiff's lawyers agree that winning a
trial against Mr. Milken wouldn't be easy.
   "It can't be proven by a handful of witnesses and a
handful of documents," says Mr. Greenfield. Instead, the
lawyers must attempt to show juries patterns of trades in
which prices appear to be rigged and raise the issue of how
the securities were priced. The defendants, says R. Bruce
McNew, a partner in Mr. Greenfield's firm, "have to have an
innocent explanation for what they've done. In the process of
proving your case, you then take apart their explanation."
   Alan Bromberg, a law professor at Southern Methodist
University, says showing a chain of bond purchases doesn't
necessarily prove that Mr. Milken was in control of the
sellers and buyers, "but it does permit that inference." The
outcome of the case will depend on whether the jury believes
there was a conspiracy or the sellers and purchasers of bonds
made independent judgments.
   Mr. Bromberg and others assert that Mr. Liman, Mr.
Milken's principal lawyer, negotiated to make the plea
agreement narrow enough so that little of what Mr. Milken
admitted to can be used against him in the civil suits. "I
suspect they fought hard on that, and my guess is they were
pretty successful at it," Mr. Bromberg says.
   However, a little-noticed provision in the plea agreement
could prove to be invaluable to civil plaintiffs. Prosecutors
extracted a promise from Mr. Milken that he wouldn't attempt
to block them from including in their sentencing memo many
additional charges of wrongdoing to which he didn't plead
guilty.
   Recently Robert Freeman, former Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. head
of arbitrage, successfully blocked inclusion of such broader
allegations in the government's sentencing memo. Thus, the
government's full case against Mr. Freeman, who had pleaded
guilty to just one insider trading charge, was kept from
public view.
   In the Milken case, however, prosecutors are expected to
outline a broad scheme of alleged wrongdoing, involving a
wide range of companies and securities. Those charges could
be exceedingly helpful to plainitffs lawyers building civil
cases against him.
   Realistically, it's highly unlikely that the civil cases
against Mr. Milken will ever go to trial. Most shareholder
cases are settled, and Mr. Greenfield says he has had only
two jury trials in the past six years, while handling scores
of suits.
   One reason for this is that plaintiffs' lawyers typically
don't charge hourly rates. Instead they charge their clients
for a percentage of the settlement or jury award, generally
20% to 30%. Therefore, it is often to their benefit to
dispose of cases as quickly as possible.
   But settlements work only if both sides believe they are
making a fair compromise, considering what the damages might
be if the case went to trial. And, in the Milken litigation,
settling so many high-stakes cases could be a long and tricky
process in itself.

   CLEVELAND -- Ameritrust Corp. had a loss of $51.6 million
in the first quarter, as the bank holding company took a huge
provision to comply with tougher regulatory standards. In the
year-ago first quarter, Ameritrust earned $27.8 million, or
76 cents a share.
   In the quarter just ended, Ameritrust increased its
loan-loss provision by $120 million after federal examiners
reviewed the company's loan portfolio. Ameritrust said
examiners expressed concern over the company's commercial
real-estate loans and highly leveraged transactions. The
bank's nonperforming assets increased to $240.8 million from
$214.3 million at the end of 1989.

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Ameritrust

   The Japanese --
   Not So Inscrutable
   To Adam Smith

   Under the terms of the Super 301 provision of the 1988
Trade Act, President Bush must decide by Monday which
countries to target as unfair traders. A word of advice:
unfair trading practices are an unfair condemnation of a
friendly ally.
   The Japan-bashers' arguments against Japan's supposed
trade perfidy have undergone a series of self-interested
metamorphoses. The original complaint was that Japan's
visible trade barriers were much higher than ours. When it
became apparent that this was not so, the criticism shifted
to the charge that the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry somehow was managing to prevent the lower trade
barriers from increasing imports. Empirical scrutiny failed
to sustain this charge too.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now the argument has shifted again. The current charge is
that the problem is not the efficacy of MITI's visible
(import-restraining) hand but the inefficacy of Adam Smith's
invisible (import-enhancing) hand. In short, Japan is too
bizarre and exotic, in its culture and in its economic
organization, for markets (and therefore GATT-style market
access) to work as they do in the West.
   The culturalists have had a field day with this view. But
their assertions of Japan's cultural uniqueness and how
normal "rules-based" trade with Japan is impossible, don't
hold up under economic scrutiny. As is often the case,
economics can explain differences glibly attributed to
culture. A few examples should suffice:
   Take the popular view that Japan's familial culture leads
to the "permanent-employment" system. Few know that this
system came to Japan only after the Second World War. Indeed,
as argued recently by Columbia Prof. Jacob Mincer, the labor
turnover rates in Japanese manufacturing before the war and
in American manufacturing since the war are broadly similar.
It wasn't until after the war that the decline in employee
turnover in Japan occurred. The explanation seems to be that
the rapid economic growth in post-war Japan was based on
rapid technical change that called for intensive formation of
human capital specific to an enterprise. This encouraged
lower turnover.
   Or take the frequent complaint that the Japanese are
wedded to their own for supplies of intermediates. Evidence?
In the U.S., Japanese companies' ratio of imported
intermediates to value added is twice as high as that of
other foreign investors. But think again. If protection, or
the threat of it, induces foreign firms to enter a market,
they will typically import as many components as they can
from their home base, where production is cheaper. Who can
deny that our actual and threatened trade restraints against
Japan have been substantially greater than those against
other nations? The astonishing thing may well be that
Japanese investors have not wound up showing a yet higher
ratio of imports to value added.
   James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly writes about Japan's
inability to play by "rules," and its preference for
"quantities." These cultural abnormalities make it impossible
for Japan to have rules-based, GATT-type trade and makes
"managed trade" (with specified quantities traded) the best
solution. Japanese trade negotiators presumably ask the U.S.:
How much do you want us to import? Mr. Fallows attributes
this query to "Japanese discomfort with the very prospect of
abiding by abstract principles." This is nonsense. Is it not
more likely that, faced with Americans' repeated complaints,
the Japanese ask: "How much do you want us to import," wisely
muting the rest of the sentence: "to get you off our backs?"
Since the 1930s, the U.S. has imposed quantitative limits on
Japan's successful exports, starting with "voluntary" export
restraints on electric lamps and textiles. Could not the
Japanese have learned, thanks to us, the wisdom of asking
about quantities?
   Clyde Prestowitz, former U.S. trade negotiator and an ally
of Mr. Fallows in the angst over Japan, is doubly wrong when
he asserts that Japan "plays a different game" and that
therefore the U.S. cannot have beneficial trade with it under
a rules-based multilateral trading regime. For one thing, the
sports analogy is inappropriate: In games, one party loses
and the other wins; in trade, both often win. His second
error, shared by other culturalists, is to exaggerate the
exotic nature of the Japanese game. In his incomprehension,
he's like the Indian maharajah who, taken to a polo match,
turned to his English host in puzzled consternation to say:
"It is so sad to see them fighting over that ball. Why don't
you give each their own?"
   What then about the view, often ascribed to Chalmers
Johnson, professor at the University of California at San
Diego, that Japanese companies believe in "predatory"
competition?
   The notion that American companies, by contrast, compete
in a benign fashion is faintly romantic and fully foolish.
What the Cambridge economist Joan Robinson used to call the
"animal spirits" of capitalist entrepreneurs surely are
manifest in both countries. The successful always appear more
predatory. This was exactly the stereotype of British
entrepreneurs during the 19th century and of the "ugly"
American in the '50s and '60s. With success, one gets one's
share of envy and resentment.
   The hawks in Congress would like to hit Japan again this
year with Super 301, seeing Japan's latest concessions at the
Structural Impediments Initiative talks as a defendant's
admission of guilt. But these concessions are nothing of the
kind. Most, such as the promise of more infrastructure
spending, have little relationship to trade; none can be a
substitute for our own actions in improving our trade
deficit.
   Rather, the concessions are designed to cap the
increasingly strident Japan-bashing from getting altogether
out of hand. They give the administration a sporting chance
to face down a bellicose Congress by citing Japan's agreeable
accommodation of our needs. The president should seize that
chance.

   Salvage Strategy for Units Helps Bombardier Sell Jets

   Pending Learjet Acqisition Accord
   Shows How Firm Favors Castoffs

   MONTREAL -- Bombardier Inc. is carving out a niche in the
aerospace market by buying castoff companies dirt cheap and
reviving them.
   If its pending $75 million acquisition of Learjet Corp.
goes ahead, Bombardier will have spent less than $250 million
since 1986 to buy three aerospace concerns with combined 1990
sales of about $1.4 billion. It will offer a complete line of
small jets from a tiny $3.8 million Learjet to a 50-passenger
commercial airliner.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bombardier's acquisition of Learjet from Integrated
Resources Inc. must be approved by U.S. bankruptcy court,
which is scheduled to consider the sale today in New York.
Integrated Resources, a New York insurance and investment
concern, has protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Bombardier's push into aerospace is a repeat of its
successful expansion into mass transit and passenger rail
cars, where it has become North America's dominant
manufacturer and a big player in Europe.
   "Bombardier is an extraordinarily astute buyer. And so far
they seem to have had the management depth to get their hands
around the acquired assets," says Wolfgang Demisch, director
of research at UBS Securities Inc. in New York.
   Known until 1974 only for its snowmobiles -- a product
invented by the late Joseph-Armand Bombardier and a market it
still dominates -- Montreal-based Bombardier now makes a wide
array of transportation equipment. New York, Boston,
Philadelphia and Vienna commuters ride on its transit and
rail cars. When the Chunnel opens, Bombardier trains will
roar under the English Channel.
   Corporate and government chieftains fly its Canadair
Challenger business jets. In two years airline passengers
will board Bombardier's 50-seat Regional Jet. Deliveries are
scheduled to begin in 1992 to customers that include British
Airways and feeder airlines serving Lufthansa, Air Canada and
Delta.
   Bombardier's transformation began when Laurent Beaudoin,
chairman, chief executive officer and son-in-law of the late
Mr. Bombardier, decided to go after a Montreal subway
contract in 1974 and won. He hired Raymond Royer, now
president and chief operating officer, to run the new transit
operation. Over the years the two men made mistakes,
including acquiring a locomotive company they finally sold
last year after persistent losses. But most of their moves
paid off handsomely, analysts say.
   Among Bombardier's secrets is a disdain for pricey
research and development; it saves money by buying much of
its technology instead of creating it.
   Bombardier made its first aerospace acquisition when it
bought money-losing Canadair Ltd. in 1986 from the Canadian
government for 120 million Canadian dollars (US$103.5 million
at current exchange rates). Before the sale the government
wrote off Canadair's debt, which included over C$1 billion of
development costs for the Challenger jet.
   Last year Bombardier made its second major aerospace
acquisition, buying Short Brothers PLC from the British
government for about C$60 million. The sale cost the British
government C$1.56 billion in loan write-offs, grants and new
capital investment in the Northern Ireland concern.
   Bombardier won't get that kind of bonus from Learjet's
current owner, Integrated Resources. But Bombardier would get
the Lear name, synonymous with business jets since founder
William Lear created the market nearly 30 years ago. And it
would get a company eager to say goodbye to its current
owner. "Our competitors have made hay out of the fact that
our parent is bankrupt," says Brian E. Barents, Learjet's
chairman, president and chief executive. Analysts and
industry executives say Learjet's uncertain fate has cost the
company sales and may have been one reason the U.S. Air Force
recently picked competitor Beech Aircraft Corp., a Raytheon
Co. unit, to supply training jets.
   Bombardier officials won't discuss their specific plans
for Learjet while approval of the sale is pending. But Mr.
Royer says that Bombardier "always wants to be in the
leadership position" in each of its specialized markets. "If
we can't have that, we aren't interested."
   Adding Learjet would more than double Bombardier's share
of a world market of 250 new business jets a year. According
to Aviation Data Services Inc., a Witchita, Kan., research
concern, in 1989 Learjet had an 11.1% share of the world
market and Bombardier an 8.3% share.
   With Learjet, Bombardier would also become the only
manufacturer with products in all three segments -- light,
medium and heavy -- of the business jet market. "I think
they'll be the envy of the {business} aircraft manufacturing
and marketing industry. It's a natural fit," says David
Hurley, president and chief executive of Flight Services
Group Inc., a Fairfield, Conn., concern that operates a fleet
of 30 corporate airplanes, including two Challengers and four
Learjets.
   Bombardier is much admired for its manufacturing and
marketing skills and recent turnarounds at Canadair and its
Belgian mass transit unit, BN Constructions Ferroviaires &amp;
Metalliques S.A. Bombardier was "the savior" of Canadair's
Challenger jet, Mr. Hurley says. At Short Brothers, it's
still too early to tell how things will turn out. Mr. Royer
says he's "very pleased" with progress there. The same goes
for ANF-Industrie S.A., the second largest transit and
passenger rail manufacturing concern in France. Bombardier
acquired ANF-Industrie late last year.
   Among the challenges for a new owner at Learjet will be
product development. Learjet's Mr. Barents says the company
has some new planes derived from existing models under
development. But some observers say Learjet's designs are
stale and it has fallen behind its competitors. "I find the
Lear the least attractive of the small jets," says Al
Conklin, a consultant in Orleans, Mass. "Their technology is
pretty far back." But Mr. Conklin says Bombardier's deal
still "sounds like a bargain," in part because there is
"definitely a value" in the Lear name.
   To make a profit on these castoff companies Bombardier
relies on its readiness to walk away if the price isn't
right. Bombardier did just that in 1987, when Learjet's
then-owner put the company up for sale.
   "When we do an acquisition we are always on the
conservative side," Mr. Royer explains. "The price we put on
the table is the price we can live with."
   Bombardier's earnings were hurt by the strong Canadian
dollar in its latest fiscal year. For the year ended Jan. 31,
Bombardier reported net income of C$91.5 million, or C$1.36 a
share, on revenue of C$2.09 billion, up from the year-earlier
C$68.3 million, or C$1.03 a share, on C$1.4 billion revenue.
But operating profit was virtually flat compared with last
year's C$88.9 million, or C$1.36 a share, before a loss from
discontinued operations. On the Montreal Exchange yesterday
Bombardier Class A stock closed down 12.5 Canadian cents at
C$14.125 a share, and Class B stock closed up 37.5 cents at
C$15.125.
   While most analysts expect modest earnings growth this
fiscal year, they are enthusiastic about the future, largely
due to the prospects for Bombardier's 50-seat Regional Jet,
or RJ. Bombardier has 126 options and orders for the plane
and thinks it can sell 400 RJs over the next 10 years.
   Demand for this type of aircraft "will grow very rapidly
over the next decade," says Michael J. Boyd, president of
Aviation Systems Research Corp., Golden, Colo. The consulting
concern predicts a market of 1,200 RJ-class jets in North
America over the next two decades. The European market could
total 600 aircraft, Mr. Boyd says.
   As their hub airports reach maximum capacity, airlines
will be forced to add direct flights that bypass hubs,
so-called long thin routes, Mr. Boyd says. The RJ "fits a
market that didn't exist five years ago." Bombardier's RJ is
the first jet in this class. Brazil's Embraer has announced
plans for a similar jet.
   Despite the rapid expansion into aerospace, mass transit
and passenger rail remain a key Bombardier business. With
plants in Canada, the U.S., Austria, Belgium and France,
Bombardier is scouting acquisitions in "other key" Western
European countries and "doing our own thinking" about Eastern
Europe, Mr. Royer says.
   Bombardier holds the North American rights to the French
TGV high-speed train technology. It's actively promoting a
proposed Quebec City-Toronto TGV rail line that would serve
as a showcase for the technology on this continent.
   "Very few companies operate with a real strategy," says
Richard Stoneman, an analyst with Capital Group Securities
Ltd. "Bombardier has a clear idea of what they want to do and
they execute."

   As of yesterday, Nicaragua has a president deserving of
the title. A president should be freely determined by a
nation's voters, and that is precisely how Violetta Chamorro
came to be inaugurated yesterday as president of Nicaragua.
Now, after years of the Somoza and Sandinista dictatorships,
Nicaraguans have a chance to shape their own affairs. But it
won't be easy.
   President Chamorro takes office under circumstances that
are politically bizarre. She has agreed to let Humberto
Ortega run the army, while she holds the title of Defense
Minister. Clearly, she is not yet fully in control of the
country's substantial arsenal of military power. Sandinista
"unions" already are hammering with strikes what little is
left of the economy. At her inauguration yesterday,
Sandinistas threw water balloons at Mrs. Chamorro and rocks
at Vice President Dan Quayle. Against this backdrop, the U.S.
Congress, controlled by Democrats who bellowed for years
about how much they cared for Nicaragua, is dragging its feet
on voting $300 million in much-needed aid for the
Nicaraguans. The Democrats' silence is obvious and deafening
at the moment that the new Nicaraguan democracy most needs
their support.

   HOME BUYERS find mortgages tougher to get in some markets.
   Southern California lenders are cracking down as their
super-hot real estate market cools off. Lenders won't give
90% financing any more on condominiums costing up to
$225,000, says Lou Piatt of realty firm Jon Douglas Co.,
Beverly Hills. And the loan application process has gotten
"more painful," he says. One benefit of tougher lending
standards, says Scott McAfee of Security Pacific National
Bank, is the elimination of "speculative buyers."

   Higher interest rates and concern over loan quality are
leading to "an environment where it is a bit more difficult
to qualify for a loan," says Lyle Gramley of the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America. Mortgage Access Corp., Morris
Plains, N.J., is "taking a harder look at documentation, at
credit-card debt and at home appraisals," but says that
doesn't necessarily mean higher turndown rates.
   Chase Home Mortgage, Tampa, Fla., says approvals are up
20% while the dollar amount of new loans is up 50%.
                                                                                                       

   NINJA TURTLES invade the stores with products from candy
to surfboards.
   Cowabunga] The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have arrived
-- on underwear, silver coins, talking toothbrushes, watches
and bubble bath. With more than 600 turtle products, retail
sales have already hit $650 million, says Cheryl Prindle of
Mirage Studios, Northampton, Mass. That doesn't include
unlicensed gear, such as the recently spotted Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle yarmulke. "It is as hot as can be," says Michael
Goldstein of Toys "R" Us Inc. Action figures sell out there
almost as soon as they arrive.
   Who's buying? Kids mostly, says Mr. Goldstein. But already
some appear to be eyeing the products as collectibles. As
children growing up now start looking back, "they might
indeed push demand quite high," says Eric Alberta of
Christie's, New York. Ninja Turtle paraphernalia could
appreciate, says antique-guide author Terry Kovel, but only
if the phenomenon lasts. "There has to be enough so that you
can collect them, but not so much that you find them every
time you turn around."
                                                                                                       

   STATES' FISCAL WOES grow as the economy slows.
   "State revenues are slowing down dramatically," says
Marcia Howard of the National Association of State Budget
Officers, leaving many struggling with commitments made in
more prosperous times. Some 37 states expect to outspend
revenue in their fiscal 1990 general funds -- more than
double those reporting a shortfall a year earlier, says City
&amp; State magazine. Compounding the problem: 1990 is an
election year, making politicians loathe to raise taxes.
   The Northeast is feeling the pinch most. In the nine-state
region, only Maine, Connecticut and New Jersey will end
fiscal 1990 with a general-fund balance exceeding 1% of their
fund budgets. Five states will have no balance, the magazine
says. Not all states are hurting. Several states in the West
and Northwest "are absolutely booming," says Ms. Howard,
naming Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Nevada as examples.
   Having opted for short-term solutions this year, states
will find it even tougher to make ends meet in 1991, says
Michael Vlaisavljevich of Price Waterhouse.
                                                                                                       

   DIRTY CAR BLUES: Most motorists surveyed by the
International Carwash Association say it depresses them to
drive a dirty car. The psychologist who conducted the study
says one reason may be that car dust, recirculated by heaters
or air conditioners, creates an imbalance of positive ions.
                                                                                                       

   COMPACT DISK PACKAGING comes under fire for creating too
much waste. An organization called Ban the Box, New York,
wants the recording industry to formulate a plan for
replacing the current 6-by-12 inch "long box," perhaps by
actually buying reusable display frames for retailers.
                                                                                                       

   A WORLD WAR II card trick is honored at this weekend's
45th reunion of POWs from Stalag Luft III, site of the Great
Escape. Playing cards with escape maps glued inside,
patterned after those used during the war, will be presented
to a former POW officer by U.S. Playing Card Co.
                                                                                                       

   THE MILITARY CONSUMER attracts more marketing dollars.
   "We have become a hot market," says Nat Kornfeld of the
Army Times Publishing Co., New York. Why? "It is the only
market without recession or unemployment." Consumer companies
began recognizing that fact in the mid-80s and set up special
military sales departments. Now, in the face of the current
military downsizing, some are stepping up, rather than
cutting back, their marketing efforts.
   Calling military personnel one of its largest
consumer-spending groups, AT&amp;T plans to sponsor more special
events and concerts. It also takes aim at the retiree and
reserve market. "With the cutbacks we are trying to basically
maintain our market share and, if anything, grow it," says
Deanna Kenny, AT&amp;T's military market manager. Traditionally
viewed as a male market, the military is likely to get more
play from companies making household products, says Carol
Karasick of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising.
   Calling the military "a good market," she says it gives
advertisers access to young families just forming their

   Cutbacks Leave Gaps in Stock Research
   ---
   Layoffs of Analysts, Though
   Relatively Few, Can Be
   Significant for Investors

   NEW YORK -- Gaps are opening in Wall Street's stock
research, as more securities analysts fall casualty to the
latest round of cutbacks.
   While the number of laid-off analysts is relatively small,
compared with the thousands of clerks and others who have
been put out of work since Wall Street's recession began
after the 1987 stock market crash, the effect can be
significant for customers.

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., for example, no longer has analysts
covering the biotechnology or defense industries. And the
firm has reduced the number of analysts following savings and
loan, steel, auto parts, paper and forest products, and
emerging growth stocks. In all, Merrill Lynch has laid off
seven analysts in New York, bringing its total of domestic
stock analysts down to 85, though still the largest of any
Wall Street firm.
   American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit,
the second-largest firm, has laid off seven analysts. But no
industries are going uncovered, said Jack Rivkin, Shearson's
co-director of world-wide equities and until recently its
director of research. "In all cases, we reassigned the
coverage," Mr. Rivkin said.
   But Shearson's staff-trimming has created gaps and
apparently left some clients feeling abandoned. Last July,
Shearson awarded special bonuses to two thrift analysts,
Allan Bortel and Gareth Plank, for their recommendation of
HomeFed Corp.; the company's stock zoomed up 47% in a year
and became one of the best performers on Shearson's annual
list of 10 "uncommon values in common stocks."
   But within nine months, Shearson abruptly laid off the two
California-based analysts in a cost-cutting drive. Shearson
brokers whose clients still owned HomeFed shares began
calling Mr. Bortel at his home to seek advice. "I had several
calls from people who felt very much at loose ends, because
there was nobody to follow that stock," said Mr. Bortel, who
has been a thrift analyst for nearly 20 years and was named
to the all-American research team compiled by Institutional
Investor magazine for 13 years in a row.
   Research directors at other firms said they frequently get
complaints from investors whose stocks aren't covered any
more. "You always get those complaints when you lose an
analyst who follows stocks," Alan Benasuli, director of
research at Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said. "It's difficult to switch coverage of those stocks
to another analyst, so you have to wait until you get a new
analyst."
   Mr. Rivkin of Shearson argues that, in some cases, the
quality of coverage improves with consolidation. As an
example, he cited the thrift and regional bank sectors, where
regulatory differences between banks and thrifts are
diminishing.
   After Shearson laid off Messrs. Bortel and Plank, it
reassigned the coverage to a regional bank analyst. But then
the firm suspended publication of research on big West Coast
thrifts and hasn't resumed coverage. The bank analyst, James
Rosenberg, has followed West Coast banks for eight years but
never followed thrifts.
   Mr. Rivkin admits that cost-cutting, not improved research
quality, was the main reason that analysts were let go. After
its cutbacks, which also included a California-based
semiconductor industry analyst, Shearson still fields a team
of 75 stock analysts, second only to Merrill Lynch. And
Shearson continues to dangle analysts' research as a lure for
new customers. Shearson recently ran newspaper
advertisements, offering a research report that recommended
three stocks in the entertainment industry.
   Some money managers are upset that Wall Street firms
encourage analysts to produce revenue by soliciting
investment banking business from the companies they cover.
This practice, they argue, makes it tougher for analysts to
make objective, critical evaluations of a company's
prospects. Others contend that layoffs since the 1987 stock
market crash have hurt the quality of Wall Street research.
"We think that the depth of coverage we're getting isn't what
it once was," a mutual fund manager in the Midwest said.
   Despite Wall Street's research claims, no firm believes it
is obligated to cover every stock in every industry. "We're
committed to really have opinions on everything that matters
a lot in life," Michael Culp, managing director of research
at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said. "We have opinions
on 600 stocks, but we can't have an opinion on everything."
Prudential-Bache is a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America.
   But institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension
funds and insurance companies, aren't affected as much as
individual investors if a securities firm stops following a
particular stock or industry. Institutions generally use
several different brokers to trade stocks and can pick up
research elsewhere.
   What can an individual investor do if his brokerage firm
stops following certain stocks? He could consider switching
firms, particularly if the departed analyst went to another
firm with eager retail brokers, who sell investments to
individuals. Mr. Plank, the thrift analyst let go by
Shearson, landed at Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. unit, for example.
   Or an investor could consider switching to a
discount-commission broker and buying research from a firm
such as Value Line Inc., a unit of Arnold Bernhard &amp; Co. This
won't necessarily save money. A one-year subscription to
Value Line, which follows 1,700 stocks and publishes about
four reports on each stock during the year, is priced at
$495.
   For discount brokers, research cutbacks at the
full-commission firms could present an opportunity. "It's a
question, going into the '90s, whether the full-service
houses are really going to be able to sell that research
factor to the retail customer," Leslie Quick III, president
of Quick &amp; Reilly Group Inc., a major discount broker, said.
"They're going to have to do something different than what
they're doing now."
   Among other major firms with a significant presence in the
retail end of the securities business, General Electric Co.'s
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. unit has made the biggest cuts, laying
off four analysts and hiring one. Kidder also cut back on
analyst outposts, dispensing with technology analysts in
Boston and San Francisco. In New York, Kidder laid off a
publishing analyst and a junior retail analyst.
   R. Joseph Fuchs, Kidder's director of equity research,
described the process as "reassignment and consolidation" and
said "the word cutback, at least as far as the monetary
environment is concerned, just isn't appropriate." Mr. Fuchs
hopes to increase the number of analysts by year end, to
equal last year's total. For now, though, Kidder has 48
equity analysts, down from 51 in April 1989.
   But two major Wall Street firms, Smith Barney and Dean
Witter, have beefed up their analyst ranks in the past few
months, and several regional securities firms are hiring
modestly.
   At Smith Barney, Mr. Benasuli has hired 11 analysts in
recent months and laid off only three, increasing the firm's
total to 49. Most of the hiring, Mr. Benasuli said, was to
rebuild a decimated staff. "We were very lean, and we needed
to replace some of the very good people who left," he said.
   Dean Witter has hired nine analysts and lost four for a
variety of reasons, bringing its total to 47. But Dean
Witter, like Merrill Lynch, has dropped coverage of certain
defense and aerospace companies. Dean Witter's defense
analyst has moved over to cover telecommunications services,
because investor interest in aerospace stocks is declining,
said Manny Korman, director of research.
   Among firms outside New York, Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.,
Baltimore, has hired five senior analysts since last
September and lost only one, increasing its total to 37.
Brown, which specializes in growth stocks, has added analysts
in technology, media and communications services, retailing
and banking.

   Disney Profit
   Was Up 20%
   In 2nd Quarter

   Walt Disney Co.'s motion picture business surged in the
second quarter, ended March 31, pacing a 20% rise in net
income on a 26% gain in revenue.
   The entertainment company earned $178.5 million, or $1.29
a share, in the period, compared with $149 million, or $1.08
a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed to $1.3 billion from
$1.04 billion.

   Disney said in Burbank, Calif., that its second-quarter
results continued its string of more than 20 consecutive
record periods.
   Led by the strong home video showing of "Honey, I Shrunk
the Kids," "Dead Poets Society" and "Turner and Hooch," and
the performance in theaters of "The Little Mermaid" and
"Pretty Woman," Disney's filmed entertainment segment posted
a 40% rise in operating earnings to $57.8 million on a 30%
revenue rise to $469 million.
   But its huge theme park operation and consumer products
also scored major gains, Disney said. Consumer-products
operating earnings rose 24% to $59.2 million on a 29% rise in
revenue to $124.5 million. And theme parks and resorts
recorded operating earnings of $194.5 million, up 14% from
last year, on a 22% increase in revenue to $710.3 million.
   Disney, which for competitive reasons doesn't divulge the
number of visitors to its California Disneyland, Florida
Disney World and other theme parks, said record attendance,
higher per-capita guest spending and resort expansions all
contributed to higher operating results for that segment.
   Further, the latest quarter lacked the benefit of the
strong Easter holiday season, which occurred in the fiscal
1989 second quarter but will bolster third-quarter figures
this year. Disney also cited the opening last May of the
Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park, near Disney World in Orlando
as a "major contributor" to this year's rise.
   The Orlando business will begin getting its first major
test in a few weeks, however, as MCA Inc.'s Universal Studio
Tour attraction opens a few miles away. "Until now, Disney
has had a lot of studio tour (in Orlando) vs. nothing," said
Harold Vogel, who follows the entertainment industry for New
York-based Merrill Lynch Research.
   Mr. Vogel, however, expects Disney to continue doing well
in the third quarter, as "The Little Mermaid" animated hit is
released for home video and the longawaited Warren
Beatty-Madonna film "Dick Tracy" is released in theaters.
"That's their big hope," Mr. Vogel said, adding that because
it is an expensive film, "it has to do well."
   Earnings were announced after the stock market's close
yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange Disney shares closed at $111.25, up $1.
   For the six months, net income rose 19% to $352.9 million,
or $2.55 a share, from $297.3 million, or $2.16 a share.
Revenue spurted 25% to $2.59 billion from $2.08 billion.

   Bush Offers Steps
   To Expand Trade
   With Nicaragua

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush, in an effort to bolster the
new government of Violeta Chamorro, made Nicaragua eligible
again for Export-Import Bank financing and restored its full
authority to export sugar to the U.S.
   But the steps will be of only minimal help to Nicaragua's
new president, who was inaugurated yesterday to succeed
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega. The biggest and most useful
chunk of likely U.S. assistance, a $300 million dose of
foreign aid Mr. Bush requested last month, remains bogged
down in wrangling between the White House and Congress.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bush tried to offer at least a token of direct aid to
Nicaragua yesterday by authorizing up to $2.5 million in
emergency medical assistance. The U.S. moves were timed to
coincide with Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration, at which Vice
President Dan Quayle represented the Bush administration. But
White House officials couldn't predict when the larger aid
package might be sent.
   To make Nicaragua eligible for Export-Import Bank credits
and loan guarantees, the president signed a proclamation that
Nicaragua isn't ruled any longer by a Marxist-Leninist
government. The proclamation removes Nicaragua from a list of
nations barred from financing under a law blocking such aid
to countries with Marxist-Leninist governments.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, however, that
any financing for exports to Nicaragua still is contingent on
a ruling by the Export-Import Bank that the Central American
nation is creditworthy.
   Mr. Bush's decision to restore Nicaragua's full sugar
import quota reverses decisions the Reagan administration
took in its efforts to turn up economic pressure on
Nicaragua's former Sandinista rulers. Mr. Reagan signed an
order in 1983 reducing Nicaragua's quota of sugar exports to
the U.S. to just 6,000 tons. Then, in 1985, Mr. Reagan
imposed an embargo on virtually all trade with Nicaragua.
   Mr. Bush ended the broad trade embargo last month, but he
didn't move to restore Nicaragua's full sugar import quota.
The quota represents Nicaragua's share of the total amount of
sugar imports the U.S. allows. Mr. Bush's move yesterday
means that Nicaragua now will be able to export about 54,000
tons of sugar to the U.S., officials said.

   PROTECTING THE MARK

   West Germany's Bundesbank is considering the means and
timing for tightening monetary policy if the July 2 monetary
union of the two Germanys threatens to weaken the mark.
   "One can be assured that we are already thinking
intensively of what we might do, and when," said Wilhelm
Noelling, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-setting Central
Bank Council. He asserted that the Bundesbank wouldn't
hesitate to hike official interest rates if necessary, even
though such a move would be unpopular in Bonn with national
elections looming on Dec. 2.
   "We probably won't have any reliable indications of new
price developments until autumn," Mr. Noelling said. "I am
sure that if this shows cause for concern, we will act
immediately."
   Bonn's offer would convert East German wages, pensions and
up to 4,000 East marks of savings per person at a 1-to-1
rate. By contrast, the Bundesbank had proposed a more
cautious formula under which East Germans would receive a
1-to-1 rate for savings of up to 2,000 East marks; everything
else would be converted at a 2-to-1 rate.
                                                                                                       

   CHANGING A NATIONAL ANTHEM
                                                                                                       

   A Church of England proposal to scrap the pugnacious
second verse of "God Save the Queen" and replace it with
rhymes about brotherly love has created a storm of
controversy. Currently, the second verse begins: "O Lord our
God arise, Scatter her enemies, And make them fall." The
church's proposal of softer language brought this suggested
substitution from Ian Hislop, editor of the satirical
magazine Private Eye: "O Lord our God arise, And report our
enemies, To the United Nations. Make them observe treaties,
So hostilities may cease, And we all then live in peace, With
normal diplomatic relations."
                                                                                                       

   KOITO'S INCREASED DIVIDEND
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Koito Manufacturing Co. said it will add an extra
two yen (1.3 cents) to its regular dividend of eight yen a
share for the fiscal year ended March 31, bowing to a demand
from T. Boone Pickens. The Texas oilman became the largest
stockholder in the auto-parts company last year after buying
a holding from Japanese investor Kitaro Watanabe. Separately,
Koito announced it had increased the number of its
shareholders sufficiently to stay in the Tokyo stock
exchange's primary sector; its placement there had been
endangered by Mr. Pickens's purchases of its shares.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH TRANSPORT TIE-UPS
                                                                                                       

   A national strike by France's public-service employees
prompted Air France to cancel half its medium-range flights
from Paris airports today. The one-day strike called by
unions representing France's five million public workers will
also affect the national railway system and the capital's
suburban rail networks, officials said, but most
international trains will be unaffected. A spokesman for the
Paris Metro said the capital's subway system would be
unaffected.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREAN STRIKES
                                                                                                       

   About 20,000 workers at South Korea's largest shipyard, a
Hyundai Group facility in Ulsan, walked off their jobs
yesterday, demanding the release of four jailed union
leaders. Elsewhere, Kia Motors Co., the nation's
third-largest car maker, was crippled yesterday when 7,000
workers staged a one-day walkout, and a protest against the
Korean Broadcasting System went into its second week.

   Britain's Office of Fair Trading asked the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to investigate competition in the U.K.
carbonated soft-drinks industry. Major suppliers who will be
scrutinized are Coca-Cola Co.; Britvic Soft Drinks Ltd., 51%
owned by Bass PLC; and Schweppes Beverages Ltd., a division
of Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the OFT said. Sir Gordon Borrie,
director general of fair trading, said, "There are
indications that smaller suppliers, at local and regional
levels, are being squeezed out."
                                                                                                       

   MORE BAD NEWS FOR BHOPAL
                                                                                                       

   Medical facilities for victims of the 1984 gas disaster in
Bhopal, India, are running out of money and may have to shut
down, a senior state official warned.
   Adding to problems faced by survivors of the Union Carbide
Corp. plant gas leak that killed more than 3,700 people,
Bhopal banks said they didn't have enough staff to handle
monthly relief payments ordered by Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   "We will be impelled to close down the hospitals and other
health-care facilities if financial assistance does not come
through soon," said S.R. Sathyam, gas-relief commissioner in
Madhya Pradesh state. He said the state government had sent
an appeal for help to the central government in New Delhi.
   Mr. Sathyam concluded: "There is now no money to pay

   WASHINGTON -- The White House is betting that trade
problems with Japan have slipped off the political front
burner.
   This morning, the president's top economic advisers are
scheduled to meet to discuss whether the U.S. should formally
designate Japan or any other nations as unfair trading
partners. According to administration officials, the outcome
of this morning's meeting has been set in advance: Japan
won't be on the list.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   White House Trade Representative Carla Hills yesterday
said that the administration shouldn't single out Japan. When
it comes to lowering trade barriers, "I think Japan has moved
further this year than any other country," she told
lawmakers.
   The administration's soft-glove approach represents a
shift from the iron fist it swung only a year ago. Under
provisions of the 1988 Trade Act, the U.S. last year branded
Japan for blocking U.S. sales of supercomputers, satellites
and wood products in that country. Officially designating
such practices under the so-called Super 301 provisions of
the Trade Act triggered a process that can lead to
retaliatory measures.
   Since then, the administration has won new concessions on
satellites and supercomputers -- and only yesterday announced
an agreement on wood products that could add as much as $1
billion a year in U.S. lumber exports. President Bush,
meanwhile, is eager to show appreciation for the steps that
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has taken to address U.S. trade
concerns.
   But still, the trade deficit with Japan, while shrinking,
remains large. So why now, when the law requires the
administration to make its annual identification of unfair
trading partners, is the White House going easy on Japan?
Partly because the administration -- which is predisposed
toward free-trade policies to begin with -- thinks the
protectionist fires are burning out on Capitol Hill.
   The White House may be right. "The emotion has gone out of
the trade issue," says Douglas Lamont, senior lecturer in
international business at the Kellogg Graduate School of
Management of Northwestern University. Developments in
Eastern Europe and elsewhere demand cooperation instead of
confrontation with Japan, he says. In addition, even if the
numbers remain high, "the trend line of the trade deficit is
good," he says.
   The issue is far from cut-and-dried in the polls. Voters
ranked the trade deficit well behind the federal budget
deficit -- and behind unemployment as well -- as the most
important economic issue facing the country, according to a
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in March.
   But a Journal/NBC poll conducted this month showed that
only 34% said they believed that Japan was sincere about
removing trade barriers, while 52% believed it was insincere.
   At today's meeting of the Economic Policy Council, only
two of the 10 members likely to attend are expected to
dissent from the view that Japan shouldn't be cited under
Super 301 this year, a senior administration official says.
They are Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who both apparently advocate citing
Japan as an unfair trader, while expressing appreciation for
the market-opening moves Japan has made so far.
   In the debate over whether to cite Japan, administration
officials took account of election-year pressure -- and
determined that there wasn't all that much of it. Sen. John
Rockefeller of economically depressed West Virginia has long
promoted his tough stance on protecting U.S. patents and
other intellectual property -- but now is shifting his focus
to health issues. He hasn't even bothered to reappoint to his
staff a full-time trade official to fill the vacancy caused
by the departure of Ira Wolf, a noted trade specialist.
   Others on Capitol Hill have been co-opted on the trade
issue. Two Senate trade hawks, Robert Packwood (R., Ore.) and
Max Baucus (D., Mont.), have become much quieter on trade
problems with Japan since the admininstration began pressing
for concessions on wood-products exports -- from which their
states draw big revenues.
   When Ms. Hills yesterday traveled to Capitol Hill to say
that Japan shouldn't be named an unfair trading partner, Sen.
Packwood supported her -- and Sen. Baucus hestitated to be
critical. In fact, he used the occasion of yesterday's
announcement of a lumber agreement with Japan to estimate
that the extra wood sales would create 15,000 to 20,000 jobs.
   No matter how the administration handicaps the political
odds, there's bound to be some moaning on Capitol Hill when
the Super 301 decision is announced -- either tomorrow or
Monday. Failing to name Japan, says Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), "would be a serious
mistake" and "a complete abandonment" of the intention of the
1988 Trade Act.
   Worse still for the White House, Sen. Bentsen adds, the
decision may throw the administration's entire trade agenda
into gridlock. It "may poison the well for {congressional}
consideration" of administration proposals for trade
legislation relating to Czechoslovakia, China, the Soviet
Union -- and even the round of talks to overhaul the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which governs most of the
non-Communist world's trade.
   But Sen. Bentsen and others on the Finance Committee are
pleased with the way that Ambassador Hills has carried out
provisions of the 1988 Trade Act. There is a strong feeling
in the committee that the panel's influence -- through the
1988 act -- has led to the market-opening successes of the
past 15 months in negotiations with Japan and South Korea.
   But, reflecting a widely held view in Congress, one Senate
staffer says now isn't the time to let up; she feels that
Japan will become less cooperative on trade issues if its
feet aren't held to the fire through continued use of the
Super 301 provisions.
   The U.S.-Japan wood products agreement announced yesterday
is the most recent result of last year's Super 301 process.
The agreement is designed to improve U.S. access to the
Japanese market through changes in tariff classification and
product certification.
   Beginning June 1, most structural laminated wood products
shipped to Japan will carry a tariff of 3.9%, down from as
much as 20% currently. The certification of U.S. lumber
products entering Japan also will be streamlined to save time
and cost to the supplier.
   Japan also agreed to accept U.S. grading organizations'
testing methodologies for wood products provided they offer
equivalent guarantees of quality and safety. In addition,
Japanese building codes will be revised to facilitate the
introduction of new products.
   A representative of the U.S. wood industry who monitored
the talks in Tokyo said his group was generally pleased with
the agreement, but failed to get many of its demands. He said
the pact would, over the next 10 years, increase sales about
$750 million a year, well below the $2 billion gain the
industry estimated had it received everything it sought.

   Aimed at Stopping
   Money Laundering

   WASHINGTON -- The House overwhelmingly passed a bill that
would give federal regulators the power to revoke a bank's
charter or withdraw its deposit insurance if the bank and its
directors or officers are convicted of money laundering.
   The bill, which also applies to savings and loan
associations and credit unions, passed by a vote of 406-0.
The legislation is aimed at battling what law enforcement
officials say is vastly increased money laundering from the
illegal drug trade.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In plain language, the provisions hold out the death
penalty for the management and for any financial institution
itself convicted of money laundering," said Rep. Frank
Annunzio (D., Ill.), chairman of the House Banking
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision,
Regulation and Insurance.
   Under the legislation, regulators also could take control
of an institution if it alone -- not its management -- is
convicted of money laundering. Regulators would be required
to hold a hearing and consider how involved the bank's senior
management was in money laundering before taking the action.
This procedure would enable regulators to replace management
and make other changes without eliminating stockholders'
ownership of the institution.
   The bill is likely to become law by the end of the year. A
similar measure has bipartisan support in the Senate Banking
Committee. The banking industry favors the legislation and a
spokesman for the Treasury Department said the department
"strongly supports" the bill.
   Treasury and the banking industry joined in opposition to
a proposed amendment from Rep. Esteban Torres (D., Calif.)
that would have required banks to maintain records on
international wire transfers if the Treasury certifies the
records are useful. Law enforcement authorities have pointed
to wire transfers as a key tool that illegal drug businesses
use to move money out of the country. Opponents argued the
provision would be burdensome to banks and noted the Treasury
is currently working on new regulations for wire transfers.
The amendment was rejected 283-127.
   However, the House approved on a voice vote an amendment
offered by Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.) directing the
Treasury to consider whether removing $50 and $100 bills from
circulation would hurt the illegal drug trade.
   One member of the House, Rep. Jim Cooper (D., Tenn.) voted
"present" on the legislation. Mr. Cooper said he "owns a lot
of bank stock" from a family inheritance and chooses not to
vote on banking legislation.

   Bill Seeks to End
   Count of RTC Fund
   Under Deficit Law

   WASHINGTON -- A little-noticed provision in a fiscal 1990
spending bill before Congress serves to paper over the
short-term deficit impact of billions of dollars in working
capital needed by the Resolution Trust Corp.
   Budget analysts have estimated that as much as $28 billion
in capital could be needed by the RTC in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, and the Congressional Budget Office has
counted this borrowing as part of its projections for the
fiscal 1991 deficit under the Gramm-Rudman law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed amendment, which was approved by the Senate
Appropriations Committee without public discussion Tuesday
night, would sidestep the problem by changing Gramm-Rudman's
score-keeping conventions to exclude the ebb and flow of RTC
working capital from calculations of the budget shortage. The
RTC, created by last year's big thrift-industry law, needs
working capital to manage the assets of failed savings and
loans before they are sold or merged.
   Politically, the change would help the White House and
Congress past an election-year headache. But the change is
defended too as a serious attempt to avoid what could be a
scoring nightmare beyond fiscal 1991, when revenues will
presumably begin returning to the government as assets are
sold and the White House Office of Management and Budget
would have immense leverage in saying how much the deficit
could be reduced.
   As attached to the spending bill, the measure is subject
to parliamentary challenge on the floor, but the Bush
administration and the Congressional Budget Office apparently
have joined with the bipartisan Senate budget leadership in
backing the move.
   Within the current fiscal year, the underlying bill
provides for nearly $3.3 billion in new spending, which would
be largely offset by $2.86 billion in reductions or transfers
from various defense accounts.
   The administration's top priority has been securing
increased aid for Central America, but as the bill has moved
through Congress, the measure has grown to where nearly
three-quarters of the new spending would go to a variety of
domestic accounts. Among these is $185 million for a new
fingerprint-identification facility for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, expected now to be located in West Virginia,
the home state of Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert
Byrd.

   Clears Measure
   On Food Labels

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee brushed aside the objections of the food industry
and approved a sweeping consumer-protection bill that
requires nutrition labeling on all packaged foods.
   The measure also would require supermarkets and other
retail outlets to post nutrition information regarding 30
fruits and vegetables as well as raw fish and shellfish. In
addition, the bill, which passed in a 10-5 vote yesterday,
would empower the Food and Drug Administration to regulate
health claims and would authorize state agencies to enforce
federal labeling requirements.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Consumers are fed up with confusing, misleading food
labels," said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), chief
sponsor of the legislation. But lobbyists for the nation's
major food processors complained that the bill doesn't go far
enough in preempting state food-labeling laws.
   "This is a recipe for consumer confusion and distribution
chaos," said C. Manly Molpus, president of the Grocery
Manufacturers of America.
   John Cady, president of the National Food Processors
Association, said the bill is likely to provoke a floor fight
in the Senate and, if it clears Congress, to become "veto
bait" at the White House. Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter and other administration officials advocate food
labeling uniformity throughout the U.S. and federal
preemption of state laws if necessary.
   "This bill could truly result in a Tower of Babel, with
food manufacturers required to label products differently
depending on the state to which they were shipped," Mr. Cady
said.
   The food processors "want to stop the states from doing
things on their own where federal law falls short," said Joel
Johnson, Mr. Metzenbaum's legislative director. He said they
fear a proliferation of state laws patterned after
California's Proposition 65. Passed in November 1986,
Proposition 65 requires processors to put health warnings on
any food containing a chemical believed to pose a risk of
cancer or birth defects.
   While the Metzenbaum bill would regulate nutrition
labeling and health claims on packaged foods, it wouldn't
cover health warnings or preempt state health-warning laws.
"It doesn't overrule Proposition 65," said Jeffrey Nedelman,
a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
   Food processors also complain that the bill's
health-claims provision would be so stringent that claims
could be made for "only a handful" of food products, Mr.
Nedelman said.
   The bill, among other things, would require disclosure of
serving size, the number of servings per container, the
number of calories per serving and the number of calories
derived from total fat and saturated fat in a serving. It
also would require processors to list the total amount of
fat, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, cholesterol, sodium,
sugar, fiber, protein and carbohydrates as well as the total
amount of important vitamins and minerals.
   In addition, the percentage of fruit or vegetable juice in
beverages would have to be listed. Currently, nutrition
information is required only on products for which health
claims are made.
   The bill wouldn't cover meat and poultry, which are
regulated by the Agriculture Department. It would exempt
restaurant foods, prepared foods sold in supermarkets and
delicatessens, food sold in bulk, medical foods, infant
formula, and food with insignificant nutrient content. Small
packages of food would have a partial exemption, while food
sold by specialty-food processors with less than $1 million
in sales would be exempted.
   A similar bill, written by Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.),
is pending in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Some critics see no need for the legislative initiatives.
Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan pledged swift action on a comprehensive
food-labeling package. New health-message regulations have
been proposed by the FDA for public comment, and a broad
nutrition labeling package is expected by early 1991.

   Arab Group to Buy Saks for $1.5 Billion
   In Gamble on the U.S. Retailing Industry

   NEW YORK -- With a surprise winning bid for Saks Fifth
Avenue, Investcorp International Inc., a low-profile
partnership of Arabian investors, is taking a big gamble on
an industry that has bankrupted other foreign investors.
   Investcorp, beating out bids from other retailers and the
store's own management, agreed to buy Saks from B.A.T
Industries PLC for about $1.5 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though little-known outside investment banking circles,
Investcorp, whose key partners constitute a Who's Who of the
Arabian Gulf's business world, has so far succeeded where
others such as Campeau Corp. have failed. Investcorp made a
huge profit buying and selling Tiffany &amp; Co., and it also
profited handsomely from a leveraged buy-out of Peebles Inc.,
a Southeastern department-store chain.
   In total, the Bahrain financial company has completed 42
separate transactions valued at a total of more than $5
billion since it was formed in 1982 by an Iraqi banker who
quit Chase Manhattan Bank to solicit wealthy Middle Eastern
investors.
   Investcorp's success with retailing acquisitions is based
on a common-sense strategy. To avoid the crushing debt levels
typical of many buy-outs, Investcorp takes a 20% to 40%
equity stake in its deals. It buys brand names such as
Tiffany and Gucci, in which it recently took a 50% position.
And it attracts talented managers by giving them equity
stakes while maintaining a hands-off attitude.
   "We don't have the skills in-house to operate the
businesses in which we invest," says Robert Glaser, an
Investcorp partner. "We believe the right way is to be a
financial owner in partnership with management. We also
believe in providing enough equity to allow our companies to
withstand competition or any shocks to the economy."
   Investcorp's purposely low profile will be difficult to
maintain as the owner of Saks. The 46-store specialty chain
reaches from Fifth Avenue in New York to Wilshire Boulevard
in Beverly Hills and dots such Midwestern cities as
Cincinnati and Kansas City, Mo. For the year ended Dec. 31,
1989, Saks had sales of $1.3 billion and earned $111 million
before interest and taxes.
   According to people familiar with Investcorp, the company
is investing a shade more than $500 million in equity capital
and issuing another $250 million to $300 million in
subordinated debt. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. is leading
the senior financing, which is estimated at $700 million.
   Investcorp's board members play influential roles
throughout the Arabian Gulf world. Among them are Chairman
Abdul-Rahman Salim Al-Ateeqi, who has served as Kuwait's
Minister of Finance; Ahmed Ali Kanoo, chairman of the
National Bank of Bahrain; and Omar Aggad, a director of the
Saudi British Bank.
   Investcorp was started by Nemir Kirdar, an Iraqi national
who now lives in London. "Mr. Kirdar is very bright with a
strong financial background," says William Chaney, chairman
and chief executive of Tiffany &amp; Co., whose friendship with
Mr. Kirdar led to Investcorp's 1984 purchase of Tiffany for
$135 million.
   When Investcorp acquired Tiffany from Avon Products Inc.,
the venerable jeweler was losing money after a disastrous
attempt to boost sales by trying to appeal to a broader
audience. After Investcorp took over, Tiffany played down its
$10 wine glasses to concentrate on the high-priced diamonds
and gold jewelry that had made it famous. Investcorp took the
company public in 1987, earning over $100 million on its
investment.
   Mr. Kirdar was initially hired by Chase in the early 1970s
to develop business in the Middle East. Realizing that many
Middle Eastern investors were tiring of Swiss savings
accounts or U.S. Treasury notes, he opened shop in a Holiday
Inn in Bahrain, working with a list of 1,000 extremely
wealthy Middle Eastern investors. Most of his important
American associates were former Chase executives.
   Today, Investcorp is 31%-owned by management; 20 major
investors from the Middle East own another 20%; and 10,000
smaller investors in the Middle East own the remainder. The
investors generally don't play an active role in the company.
"We asked investors to put up cash, and we said we wanted to
be partners, not employees," says Mr. Glaser. "We also told
them there will be a board but that we wanted to have
operating control."
   Although Investcorp's total capitalization is $200
million, its actual buying power is much greater. Investcorp
not only has client funds under management in excess of $500
million but those clients also participate in specific deals
through private placement offerings.
   Among the competing bidders for Saks were Dillard
Department Stores Inc.; retailer Joseph Brooks and Merrill
Lynch & Co.; and General Cinema Corp. Saks Chairman and Chief
Executive Melvin Jacobs together with Tobu Department Store
Co., a large Tokyo retailer, is said to have bid $1.3
billion, the second-highest offer. Mr. Jacobs declined to
comment yesterday, but Mr. Brooks, chairman and chief
executive of Ann Taylor Inc., said: "I'm bitterly
disappointed."
   A senior Saks executive, who declined to be identified,
said: "Some people here are stunned. They wanted it very
badly. On the other hand, I'd rather have Investcorp than
another retailer who would have brought in their own team."
Investcorp, which usually holds a property for three to seven
years before reselling it, is known to be interested in
retaining Mr. Jacobs and his management group.
   Saks is strongest in the New York metropolitan area, where
it operates seven stores. However, the retailer has also
succeeded in developing strong followings in Chicago, Beverly
Hills, San Francisco and in Florida, where it operates five
units.
   "They've made all the right moves," says Howard
Davidowitz, a retail consultant. "America is getting older
and wealthier, and the Saks strategy appeals to that
customer. Saks has also built one of the best men's apparel
businesses in the country. Their biggest problem will be
going forward. There will be pressure to expand, and the
corporate culture at Saks may change."
   Some of those who have done business with Investcorp in
the past have fewer reservations.
   Mike Moorman, chairman and chief executive of Peebles,
said that nobody inside the retail chain knew what to expect
when Investcorp bought the business in October 1986 for about
$75 million. Peebles had been family-owned since 1891, and
there were concerns that the new owners would insist on major
changes and perhaps limit expansion.
   "Everybody had a certain amount of anxiety, but Investcorp
turned out to be aboveboard," says Mr. Moorman. "We went from
$88 million in sales in 1986 to about $149 million in 1989.
They put certain controls in place, but they let us grow."
Mr. Moorman, who joined the company after graduating from
college, said that Investcorp offered key managers an equity
stake in the company. Last year, when Investcorp sold the
company for $160 million, he made a handsome profit.
   Despite Investcorp's past retail successes, many in the
industry expressed shock at the $1.5 billion price Investcorp
is paying for Saks. But Mr. Glaser, the Investcorp partner,
noted that Saks owns most of the real estate on which its
stores sit, including its prestigious Fifth Avenue location.
He declined to comment on the possibility of Investcorp
selling off some of those assets, much as it sold the Tiffany
building on Fifth Avenue for about $60 million.
   "The real estate enabled a buyer to pay more than for a
Marshall Field's or a Bloomingdale's, which had similar
numbers," said Peter J. Solomon, who heads his own investment
banking firm in New York. "Still, it's a full price."
   Mr. Solomon also suggested that the Saks transaction,
coupled with Dayton Hudson Corp.'s $1 billion purchase of
Marshall Field's, another B.A.T property, significantly
raises the value of several retail chains owned by the
Federated and Allied units of Campeau Corp. "I think it's
possible that Bloomingdale's is now worth more than $1
billion," he said.

   Argentina's Economy Is Caught in Downward Spiral

   ROSARIO, Argentina -- At lunch time at El Mayoral, a cafe
next to this city's town hall, it's hard to believe that this
is the heart of the fertile pampas that provide Argentina
with much of its food.
   "I'm hungry. I need 1,000 australs," (22 cents) reads the
note that a small girl takes from table to table. No sooner
has she left than another, about six years old, asks if she
can take the sugar that came with the coffee. In one hour, as
many beggars enter the cafe as customers.

   "The pampa humeda {humid pampa} is the best land in the
world, and here there's hunger," says businessman Jose Andres
Lopez, a look of disbelief crossing his face. "We're close to
the biggest milk-producing lands in the world, and people
here loot supermarkets to take milk. It's incredible."
   And yet, it's the harsh reality, not only in Rosario, but
all over Argentina as the country's slide accelerates.
Argentina has long lived under the illusion that it was a
European country somehow transplanted to the Western
hemisphere. Today, it's awakening to the fact that it faces
the same grim unemployment, hyperinflation, poverty and
looting that its South American neighbors face.
   "We're a country on the way to underdevelopment," says
Moises Ikonicoff, Argentina's economic planning secretary.
"We're in the midst of a recession, we have an exponential
growth of poverty, we have health problems because people
don't eat enough. Our whole infrastructure is collapsing:
Half the railroad tracks are unusable, and there are no
trains or locomotives for the usable half. Schools are
falling apart, the medical system is too, and the only reason
we don't have electricity shortages is because the crisis has
made consumption fall."
   Seeking to break the country's chronic inflation, which in
March alone reached 95.5%, President Carlos Saul Menem
recently imposed his fifth economic plan in 10 months in
office. Inflation is beginning to ebb, but the plan's results
so far amount to what economists call "stag-hyperinflation,"
a punishing combination of recession and inflation. It has
caused a drop in living standards and consumption, and a rise
in social unrest.
   As Mr. Menem grows more and more isolated within his own
Peronist party, unions with traditional ties to the Peronists
are pressuring him to abandon his free-market policies and
return to Peronist dogma of economic nationalism.
Public-sector strikes occur almost daily, prompting Mr. Menem
this week to seek to curtail walkouts in "essential
services." Last month rioting and looting swept Rosario, 190
miles northwest of Buenos Aires, and Salta, near the Bolivian
border.
   More ominously, the Caripintadas, a nationalistic faction
of the armed forces, are capitalizing on the discontent and
disillusionment to enter the political landscape. Members of
the group say they don't want to stage a coup, but many
Argentines think they are fanning discontent to exert
military control over the government.
   Rosario has become the epicenter of Argentina's social
violence: Last May, 15 people were killed and scores wounded
in a week of looting, and last month, supermarkets were
ransacked and trucks carrying food were stopped and emptied
by hungry residents. The city has seen worse violence than
other Argentine cities, but the root causes are typical of
the country's impoverishment. Rosario is a microcosm of
Argentina, a country of downward mobility and deep
frustrations staring a potentially explosive social situation
in the face.
   With its towering commodities exchange, its shopping
district and Art Deco buildings, Rosario, a city of one
million, still looks like the bustling industrial and
commercial center it once was. Situated along the Parana
River, the city was a natural outlet for the export of
Argentina's bountiful crops and meat, and by the second-half
of the past century was Argentina's second-biggest city, a
distinction it now shares with Cordoba.
   But Rosario's growth petered out as Argentina's troubles
set in. The country's decline was hastened by the closing-off
of the Argentinian economy, beginning in the 1930s, that made
it uncompetitive internationally, economists believe. That
led to reduced domestic demand that the government tried to
cure by printing more money or borrowing abroad.
   For Rosario, the problems started in the beginning of the
1970s, when many enterprises started being affected, says
Hugo Pasqualis, former president of the Economic Federation
of Santa Fe province. "About 800 small and medium-size
companies closed down in the 1980s, representing about
200,000 jobs," he says.
   Today, Rosario is Argentina's capital of unemployment,
with close to 25% of the work force jobless or underemployed.
The port is almost idle as agro-industrial groups switch to
private ports elsewhere. The meat-packing and car and tractor
industries are laying off workers.
   Whole industrial neighborhoods are eerily deserted. Slums,
known here by the poetic name of villas miserias, house 15%
of the city's population.
   At Sipar Laminacion de Aceros, one of the city's biggest
local companies, "deliveries to the domestic market this
month didn't reach 20% of normal," says director Jose
Censabella. The company is digging into its capital to keep
its 450 employees in their jobs at 60% to 75% of their normal
pay. "But if this goes on for more than two or three months,
we'll have to reduce working hours and the work force," Mr.
Censabella says.
   This has touched off a chain reaction in the city, leading
to impoverishment of its middle and working classes and
degradation of public services. Of the 40 or so movie houses
of a few years ago, there are now fewer than 10. Beautician
Tiziana Blati Ambrosini says she now practices for free
because nobody can pay. She lives in a small building, one
floor above her parents, who survive on a meager pension. Her
parents feed the owner of the art gallery on the ground floor
because he can't afford food.
   Rogelio Genoglio, who runs a supermarket and butcher shop
in a blue-collar neighborhood, says meat consumption has
fallen about 30% this month. Adds Ruben Varela, president of
the supermarket and shopowners federation here: "People have
adopted a Latin American diet in the hardest-hit
neighborhoods. They eat rice, beans, lentils and corn."
   In the villa miseria of Las Flores, the scene of the worst
looting, the Cruzero General Belgrano School, named for the
warship destroyed in the Falklands war, was supposed to
reopen last month after the Southern Hemisphere summer break.
But teachers are on strike for more pay.
   "I earned 181,890 australs ($40) last month," says Lidia
Zamorano. "With this, we can't even pay the transport to come
here, let alone live," she says. In many schools, teachers
take turns teaching to save on transportation costs.
   "My kids don't have shoes" to go to school, says Las
Flores resident Mirta Brenta, a 38-year-old mother of four.
"For food, I go fishing in the nearby river. Sometimes, when
I need money, I sell some fish." Mrs. Brenta doesn't have a
job. Her husband has left. Her eldest son has tried to find
work, "But all we have to say is we're from Las Flores and we
don't get jobs," she says.
   Sometimes, she wonders if things would be better with a
military government like Argentina had from 1976 to 1983.
"Under the military a lot of people were killed, but things
were better with them," she says. "We ate, we had jobs." But,
after a pause, she adds: "Now things are so bad I'm not sure
anyone could improve them."

   Citicorp -- $250 million of certificates backed by
credit-card loans with a coupon rate of 9.15% at 99.676
through an underwriting group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. The yield on the securities, calculated on a monthly
basis, is 9.231%. But the bond-equivalent yield on the
securities is 9.41%. The issue pays interest monthly. The
Citicorp credit-card securities, sold through a special
trust, Standard Credit-Card Trust 1990-4, were priced at a
yield spread of 0.45 percentage point above the five-year
Treasury note, based on the bond-equivalent yield. The issue
has been structured so investors get all their principal
returned on May 10, 1995. The securities are being targeted
to retail investors, not institutional buyers, who are the
standard purchasers of credit-card securities. There is no
guarantee from Citicorp on the offering. The issue is rated
triple-A by Moody's and S&amp;P based on the quality of the
underlying Visa and MasterCard credit-card loans and a
subordinated class of securities that totals $31 million. The
size of the subordinated securities represents 12.4% of the
senior securities. The subordinated securities, which absorb
losses on the senior issue, were placed privately with a rate
of 10.10% at 99.971 to yield 10.11%.

   Exxon Corp. Employee Stock Ownership Plan -- $220 million
of Exxon-guaranteed debt securities previously issued by
Exxon's ESOP was remarketed by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
The notes were remarketed for a seven-year, fixed-rate period
with a coupon set at 7.589%, which resulted in a taxable
equivalent cost of about 0.98 percentage point over the
seven-year Treasury note yield on the day the rates were set.
J.P. Morgan Securities, adviser to the ESOP, used a
proprietary structure developed with NCNB Corp. in arranging
the remarketing of the securities to an investor. The
remarketed notes, which are part of a $1 billion series of
notes originally issued by the ESOP in 1989, have been held
until now by investors on a short-term floating-rate basis.
   Province of New Brunswick -- $200 million of 9 3/4%
debentures, due May 15, 2020, was priced at 98.85 to yield
9.87%. The noncallable debentures were priced at a spread of
0.90 percentage point above the Treasury's bellwether 30-year
bond. Rated single-A-1 by Moody's and single-A-plus by S&amp;P,
the issue will be sold through underwriters led by Salomon
Brothers Inc.

   World Bank (agency) -- 750 million marks ($441.5 million)

   NEWARK, N.J. -- Four men related to a defunct
Florida-based, penny-stock brokerage firm pleaded guilty to
federal charges here, the U.S. attorney said.
   Before U.S. District Court John W. Bissell, Ronald A.
Martini, who held a secret one-third share in Sheffield
Securities, and John LaSala, another one-third owner of the
Fort Lauderdale firm, which closed in April 1989, pleaded
guilty to federal informations in connection with a
stock-manipulation scheme. Ronald Spencer, a former
securities trader at Sheffield, pleaded guilty to conspiracy
charges in connection with the same scheme.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A third principal of Sheffield, Allen Weinstein, 53 years
old, pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy charges related to
a scheme to conceal Mr. Martini's ownership in Sheffield from
regulators and the public.
   Messrs. Martini and LaSala admitted they helped two New
Jersey men to fraudulently raise, maintain and control
securities prices of Vista Capital Corp., Castleton Investors
Corp. and Bellatrix Corp. The scheme resulted in a loss of
more than $5 million, officials said.
   The two New Jersey men weren't charged in this case, in
which investigations are continuing.
   Mr. LaSala's attorney hadn't any comment on the case. An
attorney for Mr. Weinstein stressed that his client wasn't
charged in the stock-manipulation scheme. Lawyers for Mr.
Spencer and Mr. Martini couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Martini, 52, of Lighthouse Point, Fla., faces a
maximum of 15 years in jail and a $750,000 fine. Mr. LaSala,
43, of Pompano Beach, Fla., faces 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine. Mr. Spencer, 34, of Tampa, Fla., and Mr.
Weinstein, of Hollywood, Fla., each face five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
   Sentencing hasn't been set for the four men, who have all
agreed to cooperate with the government's probe of the
penny-stock industry.

   Who's News:
   IBM Asks Schwartz
   To Take New Post
   As Trouble-Shooter

   International Business Machines Corp. appointed a senior
executive to a sort of trouble-shooter position in which
he'll try to cut through IBM's formidable bureaucracy.
   The computer giant didn't announce the move, but a
spokesman in Armonk, N.Y., confirmed that Stephen B.
Schwartz, a vice president, will be put in charge of a
companywide attempt to cut across organizational lines to
improve customer satisfaction and reduce product defects.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Schwartz has a reputation as an effective no-nonsense
manager. The 55-year-old Mr. Schwartz is also one of the 15
or so most senior executives at IBM and has worked closely
over the years with Chairman John F. Akers, to whom he will
report directly. While IBM has had lower-level executives
take cracks over the years at cutting bureaucracy, Mr.
Schwartz's appointment seems to indicate a plan to escalate
that effort.
   "I look upon Schwartz as a sort of shadow government,"
said Sam Albert, a former IBM executive who is now a
consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. "You have to have somebody who
can cut through things, who knows fact from fiction. I think
he's an ideal candidate for that."
   Most recently, Mr. Schwartz ran IBM's AS/400 minicomputer
line, which was perhaps the brightest spot in IBM's product
lineup last year. He also has extensive marketing experience,
having moved up that side of IBM's operations, and spent a
few years overseas, in Japan.
   IBM has already won credit from many customers for
improving communications with them. Yet many customers and
companies that work with IBM still complain that it's hard to
get a decision made quickly. In addition, IBM still can be
much slower on the uptake than competitors when it comes to
new technologies -- such as those that let others dominate
the laptop computer market. IBM also has had some troubling
product defects lately, such as those that limited mainframe
shipments early last year and that delayed by months the
introduction of IBM's high-end disk drives in the 1989 second
half.
   Succeeding Mr. Schwartz as general manager of the AS/400
business is Robert J. LaBant, 45, a vice president who had
been responsible for IBM's direct sales force in the U.S.
   Mr. LaBant will face the difficult job of maintaining the
line's momentum. The 1 1/2-year-old system has already
collected most of the easy sales, from customers who ran out
of power in a predecessor line, the System 38. Now, IBM must
win more difficult business, from users of the other
predecessor, the System 36. Many System 36 users have found
it painfully hard to move their existing software to the
AS/400.
   IBM also named to its corporate management board Ned
Lautenbach, which may mark the first time that two brothers
have been on the 20-or-so-member board at the same time. Mr.
Lautenbach, who runs IBM's application solutions division, is
the younger brother of Terry Lautenbach, who is on the board
because he is responsible for all of IBM's U.S. operations.

   Keep `Em in Iowa After They've Seen Moscow

   Dr. Louis Sullivan
   Secretary of Health and Human Services
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Washington, D.C.
                                                                                                       

   Dear Dr. Sullivan:
   I'm sorry I can't be in the audience next month when you
give the commencement speech at Simpson College in Indianola,
Iowa. Indianola is just down the road from my home, and I've
had a long association with the college.
   It's a fine little school, Dr. Sullivan, marked by
handsome old buildings and even handsomer young Iowans. It
has been around for more than 125 years, and it takes pride
in the fact that 100 years ago this spring George Washington
Carver arrived on campus to seek his education. He spent a
couple of years there as a student before going up the road
to Iowa State.
   But it really isn't a noteworthy place. It has a thousand
or so students. (To put it in terms you deal with, Dr.
Sullivan: Its student body is about the same as the number of
Americans who die every day from smoking cigarettes.) It has
no huge endowment, like neighboring Grinnell College. It has
no great athletic prowess, like the state university in Iowa
City. It has no famous names on its faculty, no Rhodes
Scholars in its student body, not even a chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa. Rather, it's just a place where hard-working Iowans
send their sons and daughters to get a sound schooling, one
of a couple of dozen good but ordinary liberal-arts colleges
sprinkled across Iowa, a state that values education and
values its young people.
   And that's why I'm writing you, Dr. Sullivan. I don't know
what you plan to tell the 250 young men and women who will be
graduating, but I want to tell you a bit about the class.
About 92%, 232 members of the class, are from Iowa, and most
of those are from our farms and small towns. Their parents
are the backbone of the state, and if these young people
leave Iowa this state will be in trouble.
   So, Dr. Sullivan, please urge these youths to stay in
Iowa. Tell them the world is an exciting place, and urge them
to see it, as you have. But tell them, please, that they are
Iowans, that they are needed in the hometown, or at least the
home state, that there are opportunities here and that they
can make others of their own, and that, in fact, this is the
place many in the rest of the world are looking for -- a
pretty place with clean air and clear values, with natural
resources and unnatural harmony.
   Iowa will not prosper if its youths leave, and its youths
are leaving. We have more Iowans over 55 than under 15, more
over 75 than under five. Iowa gives the world Maytag washing
machines and John Deere tractors and Winnebago vehicles --
and hard-working, well-educated, ambitious young college
graduates. Educated young people are a major export of the
state. In the 1980s, some 200,000 more people left Iowa than
moved to it.
   If these smart young people would stay here -- or settle
here after seeing the bright lights elsewhere -- this state
would grow and prosper as never before. For Iowans have a lot
to offer. Just ask Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Mr. Gorbachev has asked my friend John Chrystal, a farmer
and banker and economist (and, now, gubernatorial candidate)
from Coon Rapids, to send him some Iowans to do no less than
transform the Soviet agricultural economy. Mr. Gorbachev
wants Mr. Chrystal to find 2,000 Iowans -- 1,000 two-person
teams -- willing to spend two years in the Soviet Union
teaching the Russians about agriculture and what Iowans now
call agri-industry. That's right. Mr. Gorbachev is a longtime
friend of the Iowa farmer, and now the Soviet leader has
turned to Iowans to help him reform and revitalize his
nation.
   That's a wonderful thing, for lots of reasons, and I hope
Mr. Chrystal will take on the task. It could help bring
stability to Russia and prosperity to Iowa -- the Russians
would buy all kinds of Iowa-made equipment as part of the
deal, Mr. Chrystal says.
   But it's the message that's most important: If the Soviet
Union thinks 2,000 Iowans can change a nation, think what
this year's 250 graduates of Simpson -- and the thousands of
other young Iowans who will be getting diplomas this spring
-- can do for this state. With brains and brawn, they can
transform a state that already has an abundance of natural
resources -- clear water and clean air and rich soil -- and
good roads and rivers and parks and schools into a thriving
land.
   So that's my request, Dr. Sullivan. Tell these young
Iowans to take pride in their state and their heritage. Ask
them to give back to the state and the communities that have
given them so much -- given them strong values and a sturdy
education. Tell them the world is a wonderful place and urge
them to see it. But tell them that when it comes time to
settle down, to settle down in Iowa.
   One other suggestion, Dr. Sullivan: Keep it short.
   Best wishes,
   Michael Gartner

   Foundation Mulls
   Selling 10% Stake
   In Gannett Co.
   ----

   Gannett Foundation, the largest shareholder by far in the
related Gannett Co. newspaper chain, said it may sell its 10%
stake in the company.
   The foundation, which was created in 1935 by Gannett
founder Frank Gannett, said it wants to diversify its assets
and seek a source of higher return than provided by common
stock dividends. The foundation's 15,940,185 Gannett shares
comprise substantially all of its assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Within the limits of our fiduciary responsibility, we
would prefer a transaction that puts the block in the hands
of the Gannett Co. or an employee stock-ownership plan," the
foundation's officers said in a statement. "But our financial
advisers will explore all alternatives."
   As the foundation noted, Internal Revenue Service
regulations require foundations to pay out annually an amount
equal to 5% of their assets. The foundation cited this as a
reason for contemplating the stock sale. A spokesman for the
foundation declined to comment on whether the foundation may
end up selling just part of its stake.
   William H. Strong, a managing director of Salomon Bros.,
one of several investment banks discussing the possible
divestiture with the foundation, said the Gannett foundation
"feels compelled to maximize value." As far as price, Mr.
Strong said, that means the foundation wants to receive
"meaningfully in excess of current market." In composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Gannett closed at
$36.75 a share, up $1.25, giving the 10% block a value of
$585.8 million.
   Gannett issued a statement saying that the company "hasn't
yet decided whether it will be in a position to be a
purchaser of the stock that may be sold by the foundation."
The company said its directors previously approved a stock
repurchase program to acquire as many as 7.5 million shares
of Gannett common stock but added that nearly three million
shares have already been acquired under that repurchase
program.
   Gannett executives couldn't be reached for comment as to
whether they're concerned about the possible effects of the
sale of such a large stake.
   The company's earnings in the first quarter were flat at
about $75 million, or 47 cents a share, but Gannett hasn't
been hurt as badly as many other newspaper chains by the
current advertising slump. USA Today is expected to begin
making a profit this year. Gannett also publishes 83 daily
newspapers and 52 nondaily publications, as well as operating
10 television stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett News
Services and a large outdoor-advertising company.
   The foundation, which along with the company is based in
Arlington, Va., funds programs in education, literacy and
First Amendment freedoms, but it is best known for the
Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia University in
New York. The foundation also runs the Paul Miller Washington
Reporting Fellowships in Washington. In 1989, the foundation
said, it spent about $30 million on grants, programs and
operations.
   Mr. Strong of Salomon said that to avoid any conflicts of
interest, no current officers of the company will serve as
trustees of the foundation from now on. But Allen Neuharth,
who ran the newspaper company until he retired last year,
will continue as chairman of the foundation. Mr. Neuharth
wouldn't elaborate on the foundation's statement. He said
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. and First Boston Corp. had
been discussing the potential sale, along with Salomon, but
"we haven't selected which will do the negotiating for us."

   Chrysler `Takes a Beating' by Dropping
   Unprofitable Business, Iacocca Says

   CHICAGO -- Chrysler Corp.'s dismal spring sales
performance, says Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, reflects a
strategic retreat, at least in part.
   "Rightly or wrongly, we chose not to take unprofitable
business," Mr. Iacocca said. "It's that simple."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Iacocca came to Chicago in the latest stop in his
"Chrysler in the '90s" sales-promotion tour, and he tapped a
local sports metaphor to describe his company's recent woes.
   "We're taking a beating," he said. "We're like the Cubs.
We haven't had a good spring."
   Indeed not. Chrysler's car and truck sales dropped more
than 7% in the first quarter, while industrywide sales were
virtually flat. This month is even worse: Chrysler's domestic
sales have plunged 32% so far in April, more than twice the
decline for the overall market. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Chrysler's stock closed at
$15.375, down 37.5 cents and a new 52-week low.
   What's happening? In recent months Chrysler has backed
away from many fleet sales, and also stopped building its
13-year-old Omni/Horizon models. Both moves are costing
Chrysler dearly in terms of sales, but may be starting to add
to the bottom line.
   Chrysler says it was profitable -- albeit barely -- in the
first quarter, in contrast to last year's fourth quarter,
when the company lost money. But Chrysler shipped fewer
vehicles to dealers in the first quarter than in the fourth
quarter. "So despite lower shipments, we made money instead
of lost money," says R.S. Miller Jr., executive vice
president and chief financial officer.
   Chrysler's retreat from the fleet business is ironic. Last
year the company bought Thrifty Rent-a-Car System Inc. to
guarantee a captive, high-volume fleet buyer for Chrysler
cars.
   Recently, however, Chrysler gave Thrifty approval to buy
about 4,000 cars from Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Chrysler wanted
to sell its own cars to Thrifty but couldn't match
Mitsubishi's price. Because Thrifty has to keep its rental
rates competitive, Chrysler officials decided they couldn't
order Thrifty to buy higher priced Chrysler cars.
   Chrysler's "fleet retreat" is especially hurting sales of
the Dodge Dynasty, Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance. So far
this year, sales of those three models are running 20,000
cars behind a year ago.
   As for the Omni and Horizon, Chrysler stopped building
them in February when it closed the Detroit plant where the
cars were assembled. Before closing, the factory was running
on just one shift, making the cars money losers. Sales were
slow because Chrysler hadn't redesigned the vehicles in the
13 years since their introduction.
   Chrysler will continue to sell Omni and Horizon until
supplies run out. After that, its only "entry-level" cars
will be models that it imports from Mitsubishi, such as the
Dodge Colt. But even there Chrysler is backing away from
sales.
   "Because of price levels and not enough incentives from
Mitsubishi," says Mr. Iacocca, "we chose to take 50,000 cars
out of our Japanese buy."
   Chrysler sales problems don't all stem from a strategic
retreat from money-losing business. The company's luxury car
sales are running more than 30% behind a year ago, because
many buyers are flocking to competing products.
   What's more, the company is getting clobbered in the
pickup truck market, largely at the hands of General Motors
Corp. GM has begun a slugfest to gain ground from Ford Motor
Co., and so far Chrysler seems to be the biggest casualty. So
far this year Chrysler has sold just 92,700 Dodge trucks
(excluding minivans), down 15% from a year earlier.
   How does Chrysler get out of its pickle? This fall the
company will introduce a bargain-priced version of its
Shadow/Sundance compacts, hoping to make up part of the
volume it lost by killing Omni and Horizon.
   It's a stopgap move until Chrysler can get an entirely new
subcompact. The company will develop the model itself instead
of relying on foreign partners, says Chrysler Motors
President Robert Lutz. The company hopes to be selling the
car by 1993 or 1994.
   In addition, Chrysler hopes that its $1.5 billion
cost-cutting program will allow it to make money on sales
that now aren't profitable. As the year goes on, say company
officials, the savings should mount.
   For now, though, it's clear that Chrysler's strategy means
an unwelcome drop in market share. "I guess in the end we
might be trading a point of share, but we'll make more
money," says Mr. Iacocca, who winds up the "Chrysler in the
'90s" tour in Los Angeles next month. "You're torn. People
say that if you take the long view, you'll take even
loss-leader business. But how much for how long."

   Cie. Generale des Etablissements Michelin said its
consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests
climbed 3.4% to 2.45 billion francs ($430.1 million) in 1989
from 2.37 billion francs a year earlier.
   The French tire and rubber group also said it plans to
boost the net annual dividend for its publicly traded Class B
stock to 2.40 francs a share from 2.25 francs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The group's 3% earnings gain in 1989 was roughly in line
with previous forecasts by analysts, who had worried that
weakening tire demand and the firm tone of the franc against
other currencies could limit earnings growth.
   Michelin said consolidated revenue rose 7% to 55.26
billion francs. Operating profit eased 3% to 4.7 billion
francs.

   Merger interest among financial and insurance stocks
helped fuel gains in those issues and staunch a six-day
losing streak in the over-the-counter market.
   The Nasdaq composite index closed up 1.37 at 420.56, a
0.3% gain. Trading remained light at 121.7 million shares,
down from 16.7 million Tuesday. Reversing a six-day trend,
advancing issues edged out declining stocks, 995 to 829.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   First Bancorp of Troy, N.C., rose 3 to 18 on heavy volume
after announcing late Tuesday that it received a merger
proposal from CCB Financial, based in Durham, N.C. CCB closed
up 1/2 at 35. CCB plans to exchange $20 in value of CCB
shares for each share of First Bancorp.
   Among thrifts, shares of First Federal Savings &amp; Loan rose
1 1/8 to 6 1/2 after its shareholders voted to seek a buyer
for the East Hartford, Conn., concern. And DS Bancor issues
gained 7/8 to 11 1/8 after the board of the Derby, Conn.,
thrift approved a buy-back of up to 10% of its common shares,
according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. The
Nasdaq financial index, which tracks thrifts, rose 1.01 to
447.34.
   The Nasdaq insurance index rose 2.05 to 478.25, a 0.4%
gain. The Wall Street Journal had reported that a large
French insurance company, in the wake of its failed bid for
Farmers Group, said six U.S. insurance companies were
attractive merger candidates. The company, Axa-Midi
Assurances, didn't name the candidates.
   Shares of a few computer companies rose in advance of one
of the technology industry's largest gatherings of investors,
the Hambrecht &amp; Quist conference beginning Monday in San
Francisco, traders said. Legent climbed 1 1/4 to 20 1/2 and
Evans &amp; Sutherland Computer rose 3/4 to 28 1/2. Both
companies are scheduled to make presentations on Monday.
Cadence Design Systems, scheduled to appear Tuesday, gained 1
to 22 1/8.
   OTC investors remained cautious, according to traders.
"The big thing these days is to try and avoid any of the
disasters we've had recently," said Ralph Costanza, head of
OTC trading for Smith Barney. Referring to sharp drops in
stocks with disappointing earnings or earnings outlooks, Mr.
Costanza said, "Everybody wants to avoid being caught in a
trap. Conservatism is in the fore right now."
   As expected, shares of Chips &amp; Technologies were among the
day's most active, falling 3/4 to 16 on 1.4 million shares.
The San Jose, Calif., maker of microcomputer chips reported
late Tuesday that net income plunged in its fiscal third
quarter ended March 31.
   Also off following an earnings report was Applied
Bioscience, down 1 1/8 to 27 1/8. The East Millstone, N.J.,
maker of biochemical research instruments reported net income
for the third quarter ended March 31 of 41 cents a share
versus 34 cents a year earlier.
   Shares of MIPS Computer fell 3/4 to 19 3/4 after the
company reported first-quarter earnings from continuing
operations of 14 cents a share versus seven cents a year
earlier. Traders said several analysts told their clients
this morning they were disappointed with the numbers.
   Piper Jaffray fell 2 1/2 to 19 after the Minneapolis-based
brokerage firm reported that earnings for the second quarter
were 52 cents a share, down from 65 cents a year earlier.
   On the upside, shares of Margo Nursery Farms gained 3/8 to
2 3/4 after the Miami concern reported first-quarter net
income of 26 cents a share, more than three times the
year-earlier net income of eight cents a share.

   Just a week after the Food and Drug Administration forced
the bottlers of Perrier water to drop the words "naturally
sparkling" from its labels, the French company is coming
under fire from New York state health officials over its use
of the term "sodium-free."
   New York state health officials said a sample of Perrier
water provided by the company contained too much sodium for
the company to use the term "sodium-free" under FDA
regulations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Their complaint throws a wrench into the planned relaunch
of the product. Late yesterday, worried Perrier officials
were in Albany in an effort to persuade health officials to
let Perrier return to store shelves today, as the company had
promised.
   Source Perrier S.A. has been scrambling to get its product
back on the market and restore consumer confidence following
the global recall in February of the popular French mineral
water. The recall occurred after tiny amounts of benzene, a
known carcinogen, were found in small samples of the trendy
drink.
   The FDA, which had signed off on Perrier's U.S. relaunch,
said it intends to examine the data that Perrier supplied to
New York officials.
   FDA regulations allow water marketers to use the term
"sodium-free" if there are five milligrams or less of sodium
per eight-ounce serving, or 21.2 milligrams per liter. One
test of a sample that Perrier Group of America Inc. provided
to New York state revealed a sodium level of 21.6 milligrams.
   The state officials also expressed anger over reports that
bottles of Perrier have already returned to the market in New
York, even though the state hasn't given a go-ahead on the
reintroduction. "We have not returned their certification at
this point," said William Stasiuk, director of the state's
Center for Environmental Health, indicating that the return
in New York is still up in the air. New York would be the
first state to see Perrier back on the shelves.
   Mr. Stasiuk said the sodium levels, like the previous
traces of benzene, don't pose any significant health risk.
But, he said, "people who are on severely sodium-restricted
diets should be cautioned" about the amount of sodium in
Perrier.
   Kim Jeffrey, Perrier's senior vice president of marketing,
said Perrier conducted many tests of its new water through
five independent laboratories. Two of those samples,
including the sample that registered 21.6 milligrams of
sodium, were sent to New York state. When New York officials
asked about the sodium levels, Perrier sent 79 additional
samples. Of those, one additional sample had a sodium level
that exceeded federal standards, the rest were all
satisfactory, Mr. Jeffrey said.
   "We conform to the guidelines for the sodium-free
designation," he added. He said the average sodium level for
all the samples was 17.1 milligrams per liter.
   New York state officials also asserted yesterday that some
samples of old Perrier water have turned up in stores on New
York's Long Island. Mr. Stasiuk said that although officials
haven't conducted a "scientific health department search,"
the codes on the bottles and the absence of a special label
indicated the bottles predated the world-wide recall of
Perrier. The reintroduced Perrier would carry a label saying
"nouvelle production."
   In a letter to the health officials, Mr. Jeffrey said
Perrier Group, the French company's U.S. arm, based in
Greenwich, Conn., plans to run a special ad in Long Island's
Newsday newspaper warning consumers to buy only Perrier that
has the "nouvelle production" labels.
   Mr. Jeffrey acknowledged that Perrier is having difficulty
getting into the New York market, but he said the problems
generally involve "administrative issues relative to issues
surrounding the entire bottled-water category." He declined
to elaborate.
   Mr. Jeffrey said he didn't know that Perrier was already
being sold in some delicatessens and supermarkets in New York
state. He said that the company's distributors cover the
tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and
added that the problem was probably in the distribution
chain, adding: "I have not authorized the product to be sold
in New York . . . period."
   After it announced its recall, Perrier attributed the
benzene contamination to improper filtration of its carbon
dioxide gas. The gas, Perrier says, naturally contains small
amounts of benzene. The filters apparently became overloaded
after Perrier switched to a new gas source. Perrier says it
has improved its filtration process, and the FDA says tests
indicate the water is no longer contaminated.
   That done, Perrier ran into a whole different problem last
week, when the FDA told the company it couldn't put
"naturally sparkling" on labels. The agency based its ruling
on the fact that Perrier takes the water and the carbon
dioxide separately out of its spring. The carbonation
therefore is artificial, the FDA said.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Media Sector in Recession; Few Admit It

   In media circles, everyone's thinking about it, but almost
no one wants to say it: The business is in a recession.
   Newspaper advertising is in the deepest slump in recent
memory. Magazine advertising is faring no better. The outlook
for broadcast advertising is unclear. Yet no one dares use
the dreaded "R" word.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's like the old saying: If it walks like a duck, talks
like a duck and looks like a duck, maybe we should start
calling it a duck," says Spencer Plavoukos, chairman and
chief executive officer of the New York office of Interpublic
Group's Lintas ad agency. "We may not have reached the
criteria for what an official recession is, but everyone has
hit the bunkers. I don't see a major trending away from where
we ended up in 1989. I don't see {a turnaround} in 1990."
   According to the indicators filtering out from Washington,
the economy as a whole isn't in a recession -- usually
considered two consecutive quarters of declining inflation --
adjusted gross national product. But media advertising, which
closely mirrors the economy, suggests that the indicators
aren't telling the full story. "The question is, have we,
despite what all the indicators say, already slipped into a
recession?" asks John Morton, a media analyst with Lynch,
Jones &amp; Ryan. "Certainly the media business is having one."
   Clearly, the outlook for most major media is bleak.
Newspaper publishers, after a dismal 1989, have been caught
by surprise by an even worse 1990 so far. In March, many were
alarmed by a falloff in advertising even steeper than the
previous two months. Publishers now are expecting at best
flat ad revenue for 1990, and perhaps a small uptick in 1991
-- although some are skeptical even of that.
   At the just-concluded meeting of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association in Los Angeles, the mood was downbeat.
Newspaper advertising has been battered primarily by a
drop-off in retail advertising, which typically accounts for
half of all newspaper ads. Many publishers at the meeting
questioned whether retail advertising will ever return to
former levels, to the heady days before the bankruptcy-law
filings of L.J. Hooker Corp., Campeau Corp.'s U.S. unit and
other retailers.
   Classified advertising, meanwhile, accounting for about
40% of most newspaper advertising, has shown virtually no
growth in most major markets. That weakness is particularly
troubling to publishers, because classified ads are the most
profitable type of newspaper advertising. "We are in a
recession," says Valerie Salembier, president of the New York
Post. "But no one wants to use that word."
   The situation is similar in the magazine business, where
first-quarter ad pages dropped an average 3.5%, according to
the Magazine Publishers of America. Individual declines were
staggering, ranging from a 24.3% drop at Family Media's Savvy
Woman to an 18.4% plunge at Time Warner's People. Ad revenue
at Time Warner's magazine group, which also includes Sports
Illustrated, Time and Fortune magazines, was off about 6% to
7% in the first quarter, the company says. Magazines' major
problem: weak automotive and tobacco advertising.
   Reginald K. Brack, who heads up Time Warner's magazine
company, concedes that the first quarter was "terrible," and
says that while the second and third quarters look "a little
stronger, I'm still not looking at a big turn upward in ad
spending." But he contends that the word recession "is
probably too strong," since previous quarters had shown
increases. "If you went two or three quarters like the first
quarter, that would be a recession," he says.
   Still, Mr. Brack says, "it's going to be a real tough year
no matter where you are in advertising, whether it's an ad
agency or newspapers or TV."
   The broadcast business currently is something of a wild
card. Robert Coen, director of forecasting for Interpublic's
McCann-Erickson ad agency, believes that network TV, and in
fact all mass media, have "been in a recession since 1985."
In inflation-adjusted dollars, network TV ad revenue actually
declined by 5% to 6% in 1989, he says. The networks have been
battered by an explosion of other options, like cable TV and
videocassettes, as well as by a decline in audience levels.
   The big question now is what will happen to demand and
prices in the 1990 fall season; the "upfront" buying season
for fall begins around June. Advertising executives are
reluctant to speculate about where network advertising will
head in a year already notable for its miserable ad
environment.
   The networks "are in a critical situation. It all depends
on how the business climate and economy is by midyear when
the upfront is negotiated," says Mr. Coen. "I think they'll
probably just about hold their head above water."
   Mr. Coen believes the problem with the networks, along
with other mass media, is that in previous years, they
responded to strong demand by overinflating their prices, and
now are suffering through an inevitable correction. So why
won't anyone come out and call a spade a spade, if this is
indeed a recession? Says Mr. Coen, "I guess it's kindness."

   ST. LOUIS -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. reported record sales and
earnings for the first quarter but said price discounting by
competitors was resulting in company belt-tightening.
   The nation's largest brewer said net income totaled $182.5
million, or 64 cents a share, a 9.2% increase from last
year's $167.1 million, or 58 cents a share. Sales rose 8.1%,
to $2.59 billion, from $2.39 billion.

   While beer sales to wholesalers hit a record 20.1 billion
barrels, a 2.9% increase, and rose 4% at retail during the
quarter, the company said discount pricing that began last
summer requires heavy marketing expenditures.
   To offset those costs, Chairman and President August A.
Busch III said Anheuser has implemented a hiring freeze for
the year, reduced health insurance costs and cut bonuses for
management.
   "We believe these steps will allow us to reach reasonable
earnings growth in 1990 despite our higher level of price
promotion activity," he told shareholders at the company's
annual meeting yesterday. He termed the increased promotional
activity a short-term strategy, but added that while Anheuser
has no intention of starting a price war, it would meet
competitive pricing levels in most markets.
   To capture sales, Miller Brewing Co., a unit of Philip
Morris Cos., Coors Brewing Co. and other competitors last
summer cut prices on premium beers. Eventually, Anheuser was
forced to meet that competition, as what Mr. Busch termed
"aggressive price promotion tactics and emphasis on low-price
beer began to hamper our ability to get retailer ad and
display space."
   Despite those pressures, Anheuser implemented a price
increase this past February, which the competition followed.
   Company officials also confirmed they intend to spend
about $30 million on a media campaign to stimulate sales of
its Budweiser premium beers.

   Technology:
   Market Test Set
   For ICI Plastic
   That Degrades

   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said a biodegradable
plastic it makes through sugar fermentation will get its
first market test in shampoo bottles to be sold in West
Germany.
   The plastic, a polymer called PHBV, has long attracted
researchers' attention but has been kept off the market by
prohibitively high production costs. The marketing test is
intended partly to learn whether demand will support the
additional production capacity that would help to bring costs
down.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wella AG, based in Darmstadt, will use bottles made of
PHBV to package one of its Sanara shampoos, starting next
month. Wella says Sanara is a minor line, but it uses natural
ingredients.
   "It's a very good material," said Anthony Andrady, a
materials scientist at Research Triangle Institute who
studies PHBV and other biodegradable plastics under
government contracts. He said research indicates PHBV
degrades completely in soil and sea water, and its
performance characteristics appear promising. "But we need to
find a price range the market considers reasonable," he said.
   In addition, PHBV -- like many other biodegradable
materials -- won't degrade quickly in the dry, oxygen-poor
environment of the modern landfill. Thomas Galvin, a chemist
who manages ICI's biopolymers work, said ICI believes PHBV in
a landfill will degrade faster than commodity plastics but no
faster than paper, which can require decades.
   Noting recent outcries about overstated claims for
biodegradable materials, plus the capital required to scale
up production, Mr. Galvin said ICI intends to proceed
cautiously. "We're playing it cozy, because it's a big
investment and because there is a lot of controversy out
there already."
   Hans Karras, an executive at Wella's U.S. operations, said
Wella is "interested in evaluating all the possibilities in
the waste cycle." But for now, the company considers its use
of PHBV a "pilot project" to accompany its efforts to favor
materials that can be recycled.
   At ICI's pilot plant in Billingham, Britain, production
costs run about $15 a pound. That compares with 30 cents or
less a pound for such commodity plastics as polyethylene or
polypropylene. Mr. Galvin said ICI expects to cut production
costs again, to about $7.50 a pound, when it expands the
Billingham plant this year to an annual capacity of 300 tons
from 25 tons currently.
   He said the next step is uncertain, but if ICI later
decides to build a 10,000-ton plant, it may then be able to
slash costs to the point that selling prices for PHBV would
range from $2 to $3 a pound. At that price, he surmised, PHBV
might be competitive for use in products where the plastic
content represents a small part of the total production cost.
   According to Mr. Galvin, ICI, a diversified chemicals
concern based in London, has developed prototype equipment to
make items including bottles and table utensils. The toughest
technique to perfect has been the making of plastic film,
such as that used in disposable diapers.
   The PHBV itself is made by gorging bacteria called
Alcaligenes eutrophus with glucose. After the bacteria
convert the glucose to PHBV, which they store as an energy
reserve, the bacterial cells are broken open and the PHBV is
harvested. ICI says PHBV breaks down into water, carbon
dioxide and humus.
   Mr. Galvin cautioned that even a 10,000-ton plant would be
small, producing by his estimate one-tenth the plastic needed
to make a year's supply of disposable diapers in the U.S.

   AB Volvo shareholders approved the Swedish auto maker's
proposed alliance with the French auto maker Regie Nationale

   Volvo will sell 25% of its car unit and 45% of its truck
unit to Renault, and buy commensurate holdings in Renault's
car and truck units. Also, Renault Chairman Raymond Levy was
elected to the Volvo board. And Volvo holders increased the
maximum foreign ownership to 30% of voting stock from 24%, a
prelude to Renault's buying a 10% voting interest in Volvo.

   Last December, Volvo agreed to combine its food and drug
operations with the state-controlled Swedish holding company
Procordia AB; this and the Volvo-Renault pacts call for Volvo
to make net payments of 12 billion Swedish kronor ($1.95
billion). Volvo estimated joint purchasing and development
with Renault will yield annual savings of 800 million kronor
within two years, and two billion kronor after 1995.
Meanwhile, Volvo's car unit, hurt by slipping sales, said it
plans to cut 1,500 white-collar jobs over the next three
years.

   Economic Good Times Ahead

   Far from the feverish salons of Manhattan and the
Washington Beltway, the air in western Michigan clears the
mind.
   The phenomenon is much in evidence in "A Gale of Creative
Destruction: The Coming Economic Boom, 1992-2020" (Praeger,
176 pages, $39.95), by Myron H. Ross. He's a little-known
economist devoted to exposing the fallacious notions about
the U.S. economy peddled incessantly these days -- in the
peevish pages of Harper's, the laconic lamentations of Irving
R. Levine, and the hysterical hearing rooms of the Capitol.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Ross is swimming upstream from his base camp at
Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo -- and loving it. In
the opening section, he takes apart the various popular
accounts of "America's decline." Paul Kennedy's "imperial
overstretch" mode is prima facie contradictory: America ought
to be getting stronger, not weaker, since federal outlays for
defense as a percentage of GNP have fallen from 9% in 1970 to
6% in 1986. Ben Wattenberg's prediction that a "birth dearth"
in the industrialized West will lead to shrinking markets
confuses population size with aggregate demand. As for Ravi
(the-depression-is-coming) Batra's stock market theory of the
business cycle, Mr. Ross finds that between 1946 and 1986
stock market turns bore a relation to turns in the business
cycle only 55% of the time.
   In the author's iconoclastic view, the years 1992-2020
will see per capita real income in the U.S. grow at an annual
average rate of at least 2.5%, but probably closer to 3%, up
from an average of 2% between 1950 and 1986. An enormous
leap, this. Practically, it means that today's kids will have
at least twice the current income of their parents. (Lest you
think Mr. Ross is out on this limb alone, another excellent
book, "Rust to Riches: The Coming of the Second Industrial
Revolution," by John Rutledge and Deborah Allen, recently
predicted "decades of productivity growth and expansion
without inflation" on the strength of rising rates of savings
and pools of capital.)
   Mr. Ross would bristle at terming his forecast
"optimistic," for he grounds it in the empiricism of Russian
economist N.D. Kondratieff's long-wave cycle of economic
growth and the works of Joseph Schumpeter. But neither
Kondratieff nor Schumpeter have been much studied in the
academy ever since the neoclassical and Keynesian models came
into vogue. These models assume that technological change
takes place at a constant rate, while Kondratieff and
Schumpeter thought that innovations in technology tend to
cluster in time.
   Testing this hypothesis from 1790 on, the author discovers
that cycles of rise and relative decline in the growth rate
of per capita real income occur in roughly 30-year intervals.
The 1938 to 1968 rise coincided with innovations in
electronics, the computer, air transport, and the material
and green revolutions. Decline set in for 1968 to 1992, with
innovation and production dipping, along with savings,
investment and research-and-development expenditures. The
Reagan recovery of the past seven years merely is a harbinger
of the coming upswing, Mr. Ross argues.
   That period will see world-wide deregulation,
privatization and democratization. Market competitiveness at
home and abroad will spur the rate of product innovation and
diffusion, especially in fields such as superconductivity and
biotechnology. Global firms will face less risk and
uncertainty in the internationalized market. As a
consequence, the minimum required rate of return on
investment, and interest rates, will be reduced. This should
increase the rate of innovation and productivity and minimize
inflation and unemployment.
   The productivity lag associated with a young labor force,
and the flow of women and the ill-educated '60s generation
into it, will be reversed. Women's earnings and productivity
already are rising rapidly, and the same should hold true of
blacks. As older, less-educated blacks leave the work force,
the ratio of black to white income will rise. In the event,
the tax base and the savings rate will climb.
   Overlapping markets will render meaningless national
growth rates. But since the learning process benefits
countries that start late on the growth path (witness Japan),
the developing world should reap high-tech economies of
scale, given a commitment to economic growth, foreign trade
and low tariffs. "If markets are kept competitive," the
author writes, "there is no conflict between the pursuit of
profits by multinational corporations and economic welfare."
This caveat applies equally to the U.S., where Mr. Ross's
truism -- free trade is a "free lunch, not a zero sum game"
-- seems lost on economic sophisticates like Dick Gephardt.
   In the realm of U.S. policy, Mr. Ross thinks the president
should have discretionary power to vary taxes and spending by
5% of authorized levels, to check the congressional bias in
favor of running deficits. He also favors more flexible
nominal wage rates, more profit-sharing plans, lower
corporate tax rates, and a less progressive personal income
tax.
   Being out of fashion is a funny thing. Allan Bloom and
Robert Bork found eager audiences when they delivered
themselves of intellectual tonics that were, as Mr. Ross's
is, so right for the moment. In the meantime, one can imagine
the professor sitting quietly in his office at Western
Michigan, marking off the days until 1991, when Dr. Batra
will be obliged to eat his silly words.

   Gains at Exxon Meeting

   HOUSTON -- Activists kicking off their campaign to force
corporate America to safeguard the environment won a symbolic
victory at Exxon Corp.'s annual meeting.
   Six environmental proposals offered by Exxon shareholders
-- and opposed by management -- failed to pass, winning far
less than a majority of the nonbinding vote. But the measures
garnered a larger share of votes than expected, and more than
first-time proposals usually receive. They included
initiatives to have Exxon make public an "environmental
audit," press on with its cleanup in Alaska and reduce
ozone-damaging carbon-dioxide emissions at all of its
facilities.

   "This is just the beginning," said Brent Blackwelder, vice
president of Friends of the Earth. "It signals the first
serious attempt to put strong environmental pressures on a
big oil company."
   With yesterday's results as a springboard, environmental
groups hope to carry their demands for support beyond the
municipal and state pension funds that helped them at Exxon
to other institutional investors, such as banks and insurers.
"We're going to keep the heat on Exxon and other companies,"
said Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation,
the nation's largest conservation organization.
   The 4 1/2-hour meeting, which the environmental community
had been anticipating and Exxon fearing for weeks, proved to
be subdued and orderly, with few of the promised pickets
outside the big convention center here. Unlike last year's
raucous gathering, in which shareholders queued up to gain
control of microphones, yesterday many microphones sat unused
by the crowd of more than 1,800.
   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl tempered his typically
feisty repartee and struck a conciliatory tone with most who
challenged him. In fact, he agreed to try to grant a request
by Mr. Hair, one of his most vocal critics. "I would be
pleased if we could arrange" a joint trip to Alaska with the
environmentalist to examine Exxon's progress in the second
year of its oil-spill cleanup effort, Mr. Rawl said.
   When one shareholder demanded his resignation, Mr. Rawl
said simply, "Thank you. I appreciate it. Next."
   One notable disruption to Mr. Rawl's calm came when
questioned about Exxon's resistance to double-hulled oil
tankers, which are supposed to be spill-resistant. "What are
you telling me to do? Spend $125 million?" Mr. Rawl demanded,
referring to the projected cost of building just one such
tanker for use in Alaska. "Your time is up," he said and
called on another shareholder, only to discover a former
employee proposing to give up part of his dividends to
finance such vessels. Mr. Rawl told the shareholder he
doubted many others in the room felt that way.
   Before the meeting, Mr. Blackwelder said environmental
groups believed a tally of 5% to 7% of the votes cast would
be a dynamic showing. All six shareholder proposals picked up
5.7% or better, with two exceeding 9%.
   Though these numbers may sound small, they are actually
substantial for first-time proposals -- especially in light
of management's opposition. Shareholder initiatives rarely
exceed 5% when first proposed, according to Peg O'Hara,
director of corporate governance at the Investor
Responsibility Research Center in Washington, D.C.
   Even if the proposals presented to Exxon had won a
majority, the company wouldn't have been forced to take any
action since the vote was nonbinding. But in view of the
showing, Exxon's board may review its opposition to some of
the proposals. "These {votes} are not cavalier," says William
Howell, chairman of J.C. Penney &amp; Co. and an Exxon director
since 1982. "We listen. I don't look and say, `Gosh, it's
only 3%.' "
   Some of the proposals probably will show up in Exxon's
proxy next year because all attained the 3% threshold
necessary to be included again, according to Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations.
   Several Exxon officials were surprised at the showing,
though they suggested that in spirit they weren't opposed to
some of the ideas. At board meetings, there was "full
discussion" of these issues, one director said.
   Exxon fully supports a list of principles recently adopted
by the American Petroleum Institute, some of which are very
similar to the shareholder proposals, one senior Exxon
executive added.
   But fear of pending litigation was a major factor in the
board's refusal to endorse any of the proposals, Mr. Rawl and
some other directors said. The oil giant faces more than 150
civil suits as well as a criminal action by the state of
Alaska over the oil spill in Prince William Sound. That has
made the company's senior managers leery of taking any stand
that could be used against them.
   Significantly, Exxon's 15 directors won re-election with
more than 98% of the votes cast, an extremely strong showing
given that so many votes were cast against management on the
environmental proposals. "I'm surprised {Mr.} Rawl garnered
that much support," said Doug Cogan, another official at the
Washington-based investor center. "But many of the holders
who were most upset with management have already sold their
stock."
   Receiving the highest votes were the proposals calling for
a renewed cleanup effort in Alaska and for a report on the
company's progress in achieving the so-called Valdez
Principles, a 10-point environmental agenda for corporations.
Many companies already have agreed to provide such reports,
or so-called environmental audits. The cleanup proposal won
9.4% of the vote; the request for an audit, 9.5%
   The proposal calling for reduced emissions of carbon
dioxide, which are said to contribute to global warming, got
6.2% of the vote. Other environmental proposals called for a
supplement to the annual report disclosing hazardous
emissions (5.7%); reduction of toxic chemicals emitted from
Exxon facilities (6.5%) and the establishment of a
board-level environmental affairs committee (5.7%).
   For some time now, Exxon's outside directors have been
conducting their own investigation into who bears
responsibility for the Alaskan spill, but in an interview at
the meeting, Jess Hay, the director leading the probe, said
completion was still four or five months away. The
investigation could find fault with the actions of senior
management as well as Exxon employees directly involved, such
as Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood. Mr. Hay declined to
characterize the findings thus far.
   Initially, directors had expected to complete the study
last fall. "But it became much more involved," Mr. Hay said.
"There were more rabbits to chase down trails than we
thought."
   Other outside directors showed no sign of wavering in
their support for senior management. Asked whether Mr. Rawl
was doing a good job, Mr. Howell, the J.C. Penney executive,
responded, "Absolutely. The tough have to get tougher in
these times."
   The environmental focus of the meeting allowed some
holders with homes near Exxon facilities to complain to
management about toxic emissions and waste disposal that they
claim is ruining their health.
   One woman who lives two blocks from the company's Baytown,
Texas, refinery said she was concerned over the high levels
of cancer among children there and that queries over plant
emissions had gone unanswered. Another woman complained of
toxic materials dumped dangerously close to her home. Mr.
Rawl said he would direct Exxon officials to look into both
cases.

   CHICAGO -- Dayton Hudson Corp. told employees of Marshall
Field's that it plans to consolidate "the majority" of the
chain's central office operations into its own
department-store operation in Minneapolis.
   Dayton Hudson, which last week agreed to buy Field's from
B.A.T Industries PLC for $1.04 billion, had been expected to
combine some operations once the acquisition is completed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In meetings with Field's employees yesterday and in
letters distributed to the staff, Dayton Hudson executives
said they would maintain a regional office in Chicago to
focus on "customer service and community involvement." The
company said other central office functions, such as
merchandise buying, would be handled through its department
store unit in Minneapolis.
   "We know the merchandising functions will get consolidated
right away -- after closing," a spokeswoman said. "The rest
of it will take place over a period going into fall, probably
October."
   The spokeswoman said she didn't know how many of Field's
1,700 central office staffers will lose their jobs, although
some will be offered positions in Minneapolis. Field's
employees at its warehouses and its 24 stores aren't affected
by the consolidation.
   Still uncertain is the fate of Philip B. Miller, the chief
executive officer of Field's who led an unsuccessful bid for
the chain. Mr. Miller, who is widely credited with turning
around the chain, isn't expected to stay, because he would
likely lose his autonomy. Spokeswomen for Dayton Hudson and
Field's would say only that discussions are continuing
between Mr. Miller and the new owner.

   Times Mirror, Knight-Ridder to Combine
   National Ad Sales Arms Into New Firm

   Two of the nation's biggest newspaper chains plan to
combine their national advertising sales arms into a single
jointly owned company in the wake of slumping ad revenues.
   Times Mirror Co. and Knight-Ridder Inc. said their new
company, to be called Newspapers First, will enable national
advertisers to buy space in about 40 newspapers from a single
source. The newspapers reach about 20% of all adult newspaper
readers in the U.S., the companies said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The merger is also a way to make the newspaper companies'
advertising-sales functions more efficient in response to the
decline in recent years in the number of national accounts.
"There's a smaller pool of customers because so many
companies have merged, or been bought out," said a
Knight-Ridder spokeswoman.
   Some analysts predicted that the merger will result in the
loss of jobs of some sales people in the companies' existing
organizations. "Instead of having two salesmen call on every
national account they'll have one," predicted John Morton, a
Washington-based media analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan.
   Mr. Morton said that many national advertisers "are
attracted to deals where they can cover a lot of markets with
one buy and one bill." While it wasn't clear how the
combination would affect advertising rates, Mr. Morton said
he expected that "costs per thousand" readers would be lower.
   Company officials, who were attending an industry
conference yesterday, couldn't be reached for comment.
Spokeswomen for both companies said they weren't aware of any
layoff plans.
   In a joint statement, the companies stressed the
advantages of the merger to advertisers. "We have an
opportunity and a determination to package and position
newspapers in a context that makes sense to advertisers,"
said G. Kingsley Anthony, president and chief executive
officer of Newpapers First, which will be formally launched
on June 4.
   Mr. Anthony currently holds those titles at Times Mirror's
national sales affiliate, Million Market Newspapers/Times
Mirror National Marketing. John Kosanke, president and chief
executive officer of Knight-Ridder Newspaper Sales Inc., will
become executive vice president of the joint venture, which
will have headquarters in New York.
   For its part, Times Mirror said the joint venture extends
an arrangement begun in July 1986 when its Times Mirror
National Marketing unit merged with Million Market Newspapers
Inc., a group of independent newspapers including the Boston
Globe, the Denver Post, the Indianapolis Star and News, the
Milwaukee Journal and Sentinel, the Arizona Republic and
Phoenix Gazette, the Seattle Times and the Seattle Post
Intelligencer.
   Miami-based Knight-Ridder publishes 29 newspapers in 26
cities, including the Miami Herald, the Philadelphia Inquirer
and Philadelphia Daily News, the San Jose Mercury News, the
Detroit Free Press and the Charlotte Observer.
   Los Angeles-based Times Mirror publishes the Los Angeles
Times, Newsday and New York Newsday, the Baltimore Sun
newspapers, the Hartford Courant, the Morning Call, the
(Stamford) Advocate and Greenwich Time. Times Mirror and
Knight-Ridder also have interests in cable television and
other businesses.

   Laura Ashley Holdings PLC, a British retailing company,
posted a pretax loss of #4.6 million ($7.5 million) for the
year ended Jan. 27, citing declining fabric and wallpaper
sales in Britain and disappointing garment sales in the U.S.
   The deficit, compared with year-earlier profit of #20.3
million, came despite an 18% rise in sales to #296.6 million
from #252.4 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After taxes but before extraordinary items, the company
reported a loss of #6.7 million, compared with year-earlier
profit of #13.1 million. Laura Ashley had a loss of 3.38
pence a share, compared with earnings of 6.57 pence a share
in fiscal 1988.
   With the disappointing results and #100 million in debt,
directors decided not to recommend a final dividend and said
they are "unlikely to declare an interim dividend during the
current year." Last year, Laura Ashley issued a final
dividend of 1.50 pence. The company said it is starting a
cost-cutting and streamlining program that "might include the
disposal of certain businesses or assets, the reduction of
stock and the restriction of new shop openings."

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., still struggling under a
mountain of debt incurred in a 1987 recapitalization, may
sell some of its publishing operations to Thomson Corp.
   Eugene McCarthy, a Harcourt director, said yesterday that
Harcourt's board met Monday to discuss the possible sale of
some of its assets to Thomson, the Toronto-based publishing
and travel concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Thomson hasn't asked to buy the whole company," Mr.
McCarthy said. "{It} has only been offered part of the
company."
   Mr. McCarthy, the former U.S. senator, said the two
companies have been in talks for the past month, although he
said he didn't know who initiated the discussions. Harcourt
late yesterday evening confirmed that it has "had discussion
with certain parties with respect to possible transactions."
Peter Jovanovich, Harcourt's president and chief executive
officer, said the possible transactions involve, among other
things, offers for some or all of the publishing and
insurance company's existing public debt at a discount from
its aggregate book value, as well as the acquisition of
certain assets of Harcourt by a third party.
   But Mr. Jovanovich declined to identify any third party or
what assets might be sold. He said that the discussions have
been preliminary and that no agreements have been reached. He
added that there is no assurance that negotiations will
progress or that a transaction will be completed.
   He also said in a prepared statement that Orlando,
Fla.-based Harcourt isn't for sale. Meanwhile, executives at
Thomson couldn't be reached for comment.
   For Harcourt, the sale of one of its publishing units
would mark another step in the unraveling of the company that
began in 1987. That was the year William Jovanovich,
Harcourt's chairman, engineered a $2.9 billion
recapitalization to evade a takeover by British publishing
mogul Robert Maxwell, plunging Harcourt into more than $2
billion of debt. The interest costs proved so onerous that
last summer -- despite previous denials that it would need to
shed assets -- the company sold its prized Sea World theme
parks for a $1.1 billion, a price below what analysts had
thought the parks were worth.
   In the past several months, as Harcourt's stock has
languished, many publishing-industry executives and analysts
have expected the company to sell more assets to help pay
down debt. But the company's apparent talks with Thomson
baffled some observers, who had identified Harcourt's
insurance units as the most likely candidates for
divestiture.
   "They have no business being in insurance," said one
publishing executive close to the company, "because nobody on
the board knows {anything} about it."
   Charles Elbaum, president of Publishing Economics Inc., a
consulting firm in New York, said Thomson is probably after
one or both of Harcourt's medical and scientific publishing
companies, Academic Press and W.B. Saunders. Both units
garner about $140 million in revenue per year and are
Harcourt's "crown jewels," Mr. Elbaum said, earning "very
significant" pre-tax profit margins.
   Another possible target is Harcourt's legal publishing
unit, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal &amp; Professional
Publishers Inc. While the unit is small, Thomson has a
demonstrated interest in acquiring similar specialty
publications. Last May it paid $810 million to buy Lawyers
Co-operative Publishing Co. in Rochester, N.Y., making
Thomson one of the top three legal publishers in the U.S.
   Harcourt's other major publishing arm, its elementary and
high school textbook division, has done poorly in the past 18
months after failing to meet changing demands by educators.
The unit became saddled with so many unwanted books that
Harcourt had to take an $88 million writeoff last year to
cover obsolete inventory.
   The apparent interest by Thomson in Harcourt's assets also
puzzled analysts, since Thomson has repeatedly said it wants
time to digest its 1989 acquisitions. In its annual report,
the company said that only outstanding opportunities will be
pursued.
   The Canadian concern would be able to finance such a
transaction with considerable ease, however. It is on record
as saying it doesn't want to move beyond a debt-to-equity
ratio of 1-to-1, which would still leave the company with
resources of about $1 billion to draw upon if acquisition
opportunities presented themselves.
   "I don't think Thomson would be interested in . . . all of
Harcourt," said Ella Brown, an analyst with Richardson
Greenshields in Toronto. "But they're likely to take a
serious look at some of the parts."

   THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES could manage only a break-even
season in 1974, but off the gridiron they made history when
they helped to create the first Ronald McDonald House. Today,
129 of these offer shelter and solace each year to half a
million people with seriously ill children.
   Twenty years ago, Eagle tight end Fred Hill's 3-year-old
daughter Kim was stricken with lymphatic leukemia. He decided
to make fighting the disease his cause and asked the club to
help. Owner Leonard Tose responded by pledging "the team, the
stadium, whatever we have."
   Eagle general manager Jim Murray started a fund-raising
campaign and soon could present a $125,000 check to Audrey
Evans, head of pediatric oncology at Philadelphia's
Children's Hospital, as down payment for a new wing. Dr.
Evans responded with a new request -- could she get a place
where families could afford to stay while their children were
being treated?
   Mr. Murray found ready support from Edward Renzi, then
McDonald's Corp.'s regional manager, who suggested calling
the planned hostel the Ronald McDonald House, after the food
chain's clown mascot. Mr. Renzi's local franchisers began
special promotions to raise money for the project.
   By Christmas 1974, the first house was open and operating,
with seven families. Today, the "Ronald houses," as the
families  call them, are in the U.S., Canada, England,
Holland, Germany and Australia.
   The pattern is the same everywhere. Each house is operated
by a nonprofit corporation and staffed by volunteers, except
for a paid manager. Each is near a hospital treating
children, and families are charged $5 to $15 a day if they
can afford it, nothing if they can't. They remain for as long
as their child is undergoing treatment. The children stay
with their mothers and fathers between treatments (many are
outpatients) and the families help with as much housekeeping
as they choose.
   Mr. Renzi, now president of McDonald's U.S.A., and Mr.
Murray, who left the Eagles to set up his own sports
marketing business, are still mainsprings. Mr. Murray is the
unpaid volunteer president of McDonald's advisory committee
for the houses and does missionary work for them.
   Mr. Renzi wears three hats -- president of McDonald's,
chairman of the advisory committee ("I'm a cheerleader") and
head of Ronald McDonald Children's Charities, set up in 1983
to honor Ray Kroc, the chain's founder. The houses got a
third of the $22 million in grants the charities have made.
   The smallest Ronald McDonald House is a modest
four-bedroom one in Marshfield, Wis.; the largest will be a
90-room center planned in New York City on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan. (The latter will also be the most
expensive, running between $15 million and $20 million.) They
average 15 bedrooms; the total for all 129 is 1,700.
   An estimated one million people have volunteered to help,
many of them professional athletes; some 24 of the National
Football League's 28 clubs are involved, baseball's Minnesota
Twins help with a house in Minneapolis, and basketball
superstar Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls gives both time
and money.
   Generosity, Mr. Renzi says, is the secret. "You can find
money anywhere," he says, "this is people helping people. It
isn't  about egos, it's about angels."
   Kim Hill, whose critical illness in 1969 started it all,
is now a healthy California mother who helps her father run a
McDonald's restaurant in San Juan Capistrano.

   Tucson Electric Power Co. said it agreed in principle to
pay $25 million to Southwest Gas Corp. to settle a 1983
lawsuit.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Tucson Electric, a troubled utility, said the settlement
calls for the company to pay the money to Southwest Gas in
four installments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first payment of $10 million is due before July 1.
Tucson Electric said it agreed to make three other payments
of $5 million each, plus 10% simple annual interest, on July
1 for the next three years.
   A Tucson Electric spokesman said the company set aside $25
million in reserves late last year in anticipation of the
settlement. He added that it may seek to recover the money
from its insurance carriers.
   The settlement stems from a 1983 suit in which Southwest
Gas, based in Las Vegas, Nev., claimed that Tucson Electric
breached certain representations or warranties in connection
with gas-distribution facilities it sold Southwest Gas in
1979 for $39 million.

   Norton Agrees
   To Be Acquired
   By Saint-Gobain

   Rescue Offer of $1.9 Billion
   By French Glassmaker
   Ends BTR Proxy Fight

   BOSTON -- Norton Co. agreed to be acquired for $90 a
share, or about $1.9 billion, by French glassmaker Cie. de
Saint-Gobain SA in a surprising rescue of Norton from hostile
bidder BTR PLC.
   BTR, a London-based international conglomerate, last month
launched a $75-a-share, or $1.64 billion, bid for Norton,
based in Worcester, Mass. Yesterday, BTR said it looks
forward "to realizing the benefit" of Saint-Gobain's offer.
BTR, which owns 325,500, or 1.7%, of Norton shares, added
that it was withdrawing its nominees for Norton's board. BTR
had launched a proxy fight to replace some Norton directors
at Norton's annual meeting today and had been widely expected
to succeed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In ruling out a higher bid for Norton, John C. Cahill,
BTR's chief executive, said, "our price was rich. I simply
can't imagine how that price {$90 a share} can be justified."
He added that BTR won't officially end its bid for Norton
until Monday, when Saint-Gobain and Norton are expected to
file their offering papers with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. (In the event the agreement with Saint-Gobain is
terminated, Norton has agreed to pay Saint-Gobain $70 million
plus $5 million to cover various expenses stemming from the
offer, according to documents filed with the SEC.)
   Last week Norton said it knew of a third party that might
top BTR's bid. But Wall Street observers hadn't expected a
friendly suitor to offer so much cash so quickly.
Saint-Gobain's offer "is extremely high and very surprising,"
said one Wall Street stock trader. "Everything Norton's
management said {after BTR's bid} indicated it wanted to
remain independent. We would own 10 times as much {of
Norton's stock} right now if we had thought the company was
for sale."
   Norton's stock, which had drifted down $1.375 a share
Tuesday to close at $75.25, surged $13.50 yesterday to close
at $88.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. BTR
purchased its Norton stake for between $49.54 and $53 a
share.
   Norton's definitive agreement with Saint-Gobain also
surprised Massachusetts officials who had backed Norton's
resistance to BTR. The agreement "is extremely surprising,"
said state Sen. Thomas White, who helped rush into law a
Massachusetts anti-takeover statute aimed at aiding Norton's
defense. "I don't know what to make of it."
   Norton's agreement with Saint-Gobain was ironic because
Norton's congressional supporters in its fight against BTR
had raised national security issues about its acquisition by
a foreign company. Yesterday, John M. Nelson, Norton's
chairman, president and chief executive officer, sidestepped
the question of whether Saint-Gobain's purchase of Norton
also raises such issues. "We don't believe they're relevant,"
he said. "The questions were raised about BTR's bid because
of its lack of commitment to continue research and
development in areas we felt are important."
   Saint-Gobain's offer for Norton reflects potential
synergies between the two concerns' businesses, officials
with both companies said. Norton, which had 1989 sales of
about $1.5 billion, makes abrasives, ceramics, plastics and
other products. Saint-Gobain, France's seventh-biggest
industrial concern with 1989 revenue of $11.59 billion, makes
glass, packaging and building materials.
   Norton's ceramics business "is fully complementary" with
Saint-Gobain's, said Jean-Louis Beffa, Saint-Gobain's
chairman. "Only about 14% of our sales are in the U.S. Norton
will bring to Saint-Gobain a very important American
presence. Norton also has a very good Japanese experience."
He added that Saint-Gobain and Norton don't directly compete
in Europe and thus don't have overlapping operations there
that would have to be consolidated.
   Saint-Gobain's last major foray in the U.S. was the
purchase of the 43% of Valley Forge, Pa.-based CertainTeed
Corp. it didn't previously own for $387 million in 1988.
Later that year the company bought Wolverine Technologies
Inc. of Dearborn, Mich., which makes vinyl products, for
$75.9 million. Saint-Gobain also has been actively acquiring
companies in Europe.
   One of Norton's attractions to Saint-Gobain is its
research on thin films made of synthetic diamond, which show
promise for use in electronics and other applications, said
Aldon Donius, an analyst with Altman, Brenner, Wasserman, a
New York research firm. "Norton didn't have the cash to play"
with larger concerns developing the technology but should be
a strong competitor with Saint-Gobain's help, he added.
Saint-Gobain's deep pockets also should aid Norton in
developing advanced ceramics for use in automobile engines
and other applications, Mr. Donius said.
   In announcing their agreement, the companies stressed that
Norton's current policies on employment and community
relations, and its headquarters and top management, won't be
changed-opposition to BTR's bid had been fueled by fears that
the British concern would close or move Norton plants and lay
off some of its workers. "There will be no changes in
employment in any Norton location as a direct result of this
merger," Mr. Nelson said in an interview yesterday. However,
he didn't rule out layoffs at Norton after its acquisition,
saying that its employment levels will depend on economic
factors unrelated to its purchase by Saint-Gobain.
   Mr. Nelson said Saint-Gobain contacted Norton about a
possible acquisition shortly after BTR's bid was announced
last month. Norton initially suggested that Saint-Gobain take
a minority stake, but Saint-Gobain wasn't interested, Mr.
Beffa said. Late Tuesday Norton's board decided to negotiate
an agreement with Saint-Gobain, which was hammered out
through the night.
   "Given the increasing risk of . . . fighting a war of
attrition only to be bought in the end by BTR for an
inadequate price with no protection for employees and the
Worcester community, we concluded {the acquisition by
Saint-Gobain} is the best alternative," Mr. Nelson said.
   Saint-Gobain's offer for Norton is the latest in a stream
of French bids for U.S. companies, including most recently
Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s friendly bid for Rorer Group Inc.,
Michelin's agreement to buy Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. and
Pechiney S.A.'s acquisition of Triangle Industries Inc., the
parent of American National Can Corp.
   Many large French companies believe that, to withstand
foreign competition and prepare for the lifting of internal
European Community trade barriers in 1992, they must
establish themselves as global forces in their core
businesses. That has provoked a rash of government-encouraged
foreign acquisitions by French companies over the past
several years.

   Thai Airline Gives
   Orders to United
   Technologies, GE

   General Electric Co. and United Technologies Corp. said
they received major aircraft engine orders from Thai Airways
International.
   GE said its Aircraft Engines division received a new order
from the state-owned airline valued at $300 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, Thai Airways said it had placed an order
with United Technologies' Pratt &amp; Whitney division, which
could total $240 million if options for $80 million in extra
engines are executed.
   The order to Pratt &amp; Whitney is significant because it
increases the company's penetration at an airline that until
last July bought GE engines exclusively for 14 years. The
order comes in the wake of a $500,000 gift by United
Technologies to a charity run by the Thai royal family.
   In East Hartford, Conn., a Pratt &amp; Whitney spokesman
reiterated the company's position that the donation to a
typhoon-relief fund, which was reported last December, wasn't
conditioned on receiving new engine orders.
   It's natural for the company to engage in philanthropy
"where we want to establish business relationships and become
involved," the spokesman said, adding: "That money was used
to help people {and} it may have been a factor or may not
have" in the engine order decision. "If that helped us in our
business that's fine."
   United Technologies is based in Hartford, Conn., and is
also involved in building systems and automotive products.
GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., has interests in broadcasting,
financial services, and industrial products.
   The competition between the two companies to supply Thai
Airways has intensified during the past year. Last summer,
officials at the airline said the Thai government asked the
carrier to order Pratt &amp; Whitney engines instead of some GE
equipment on order because the government believed Pratt &amp;
Whitney had closer ties to the Bush administration and could
improve Thailand's relations with the U.S. Meanwhile, both
engine makers were said to be offering significant
concessions to the carrier in return for business.
   These latest orders have importance beyond the issue of
which company gets to call Thai Airways its customer.
Thailand is just one prize in a larger sweepstakes for
aerospace concerns as they fight for pieces of Asian
business, the world's fastest-growing commercial aircraft
market.
   According to industry estimates, air passenger traffic to,
from and within Asia will grow an average 9% annually during
the next 10 years, almost twice the projected growth for the
U.S.
   The significance of the Thai Airways business was
underscored yesterday as John F. Welch Jr., GE chairman,
announced at the company's annual meeting in Erie, Pa., the
latest award to GE. The order covers the company's highest
thrust engines, the CF6-80C2 and 80E1, to power five Boeing
Co. 747-400s and four A330s built by Airbus Industrie, the
European aircraft consortium. Both planes are widebody
aircraft.
   The Thai airline will take initial delivery of the
747-400s in late 1991; the A330s are scheduled for delivery
in 1993.
   The order to Pratt &amp; Whitney is for PW4000 engines to
power Airbus A300s, A310s and A330s.
   The order includes the conversion of existing options for
five PW4000-powered A300-600R twinjets into firm orders, and
two PW4000s to power a new Airbus A310 for the Royal Thai Air
Force. Deliveries will begin in 1991. The rest of the order
covers engines for four A330s and spares.

   LOS ANGELES -- After only a month at the helm of ABC's
prime-time programming division, Robert Iger claims he was
too new to know better when he chose to go ahead with the
unlikely new series "Twin Peaks."
   The menacingly creepy murder mystery, set in a small
Northwestern town, breaks most of television's rules. It
shuns a simple plot. It has no major stars. Its characters
are beyond bizarre. Its pacing, in an era of jumpy attention
spans, is eerily languid, typical of its originator,
off-kilter film director David Lynch, a TV novice who made
the frightfully twisted cult films "Blue Velvet" and
"Eraserhead."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The early indicators on the show weren't promising,
either. ABC's own research showed an alarming 25% of viewers
gave up on "Twin Peaks" in test runs. Most of the New
York-based network brass deemed the macabre series just too
weird. But the 39-year-old Mr. Iger liked it. A Hollywood
newcomer who was thought to be a bean-counter from Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., he also saw a chance to prove his creative
reputation. So he mounted a battle to get the trial series on
the air.
   At the moment, it appears to be the best gamble of the
season. "Twin Peaks" premiered this month as the most
talked-about, most-watched TV movie of the year, seen by
almost 35 million viewers. The media waxed rhapsodic. "Like
nothing you've seen in prime time -- or on God's earth,"
raved Newsweek. Television "has rarely seen anything as
strange -- or as superb," concurred Time.
   With its third weekly episode airing tonight, the show has
lured the biggest audience of any ABC series in its time slot
in four years. If it can sustain its strong start -- far from
assured -- it could be a pivotal hit for the once-ailing
network, which is already gaining momentum in its effort to
close the gap with first-place NBC, leaving CBS even further
behind.
   Even if "Twin Peaks" caves in, it has already won ABC new
cache in Hollywood as the hands-off network, eager for ideas
that are daring and different. And it has emboldened Mr. Iger
and his team to raise the bar for how strange a show can get.
   It's as if America's embrace of the oddballs in "Twin
Peaks" has turned on a giant light bulb over the dream
factories of Hollywood. Last week, for example, Mr. Iger and
his team screened the rough cut for "CopRock," the next
series for ABC by Steven Bochco, the successful creator of
Hill Street Blues and L.A. Law. It is the first cop show done
as a musical: In the pilot a jury sings the verdict in an
original song by the sardonic Randy Newman.
   Mr. Bochco praises Mr. Iger for taking the creative risks
openly: "He always gives you a straight answer," says the
producer. "He never hides behind the corporate `we.'"
   Another unusual ABC pilot, "My Life and Times," has an
88-year-old man in the year 2035 looking back on our present.
   Such experiments are critical not just to the network, but
also to Mr. Iger's attempt to fill the job previously held by
such Hollywood luminaries as Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael
Eisner, Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, and producer Fred
Silverman, known in the '70s as the guy with the "golden
gut."
   Beaming from his sun-drenched Century City office, Mr.
Iger is obviously enjoying the first blush of success. "I
feel giddy," he says.
   In many ways he is an unlikely candidate for one of the
most powerful jobs in television. In an industry of
wide-screen egos and technicolor personalities, the onetime
TV weatherman is admittedly kind of gray. "You don't have in
me this distinctive personality," he says. In fact, the man
who shepherded the most provocative hit on the air
acknowledges, "a blandness of sorts."
   He didn't even show any excessive interest in watching
television as a boy in Oceanside, N.Y. Instead his father, an
ad man, pushed him to read -- which he still does, most
recently wading through a two-volume biography of Churchill.
   When he graduated from high school in 1969 he was voted
most enthusiastic, "which in 1969, when America was inflamed,
is probably something to be embarrassed about," he admits.
   Tall, dark and camera-handsome, he attended Ithaca College
in Ithaca, N.Y., and then spent a year as a TV weatherman at
a local station. But he says he was too stiff to ad-lib on
camera. In 1974 he joined ABC, supervising studios for soap
operas and game shows. One day, he was told his boss's boss
had taken a disliking to him, and that maybe he should look
for another job. Offended, he interviewed later the same day
at ABC Sports.
   "It drove me not to remorse, but to aggressiveness. It
was, `I've got to take care of myself,'" Mr. Iger says now.
   And so he did. He won six promotions in 11 years at ABC
Sports and grew into a shrewd negotiator, which would come in
handy in Hollywood. From the longtime ABC Sports head Roone
Arledge, Mr. Iger learned the axiom "Never accept no for an
answer." Mr. Iger never puts a price on the table first. "I
like to be told what it takes."
   Mr. Iger bid for the biggest events and dickered over
dozens of fight deals with the likes of Don King, the
wild-haired boxing promoter. By flattering first and
admonishing later, he learned to handle such challenges as
trouble on the set of "Roseanne." Mr. Iger describes several
"frank and fruitful" talks with the temperamental star of
ABC's No. 1 series.
   In the summer of 1988 he moved up to a job in the
corporate group that oversees ABC. Seven months later he was
named to head ABC Entertainment, succeeding tinsel town's
beloved Brandon Stoddard, a filmmaker at heart who stepped
aside suddenly last spring to run ABC's in-house production
company.
   In Hollywood, a change at the top means bulldozing dozens
of projects and ousting key players. Mr. Iger was happy to
inherit both kinds of assets. He has hardcore business skills
that aren't the forte of his deputies, Ted Harbert and Stuart
Bloomberg, both 12-year veterans at ABC Entertainment. They,
in turn, have creative and programming experience Mr. Iger
lacks. Mr. Bloomberg, a bespectacled, curly haired
40-year-old, oversees all new-series development. Mr.
Harbert, 34, handles current shows and scheduling. He watches
six TV sets scattered through his three-bedroom home; as a
child, he memorized the TV Guide listings every week.
   Mr. Iger needed all the help he could get when he
parachuted into the job. He had only six weeks left to pick
new fall shows from Mr. Stoddard's pilots. One was for "Twin
Peaks."
   The show's creators, David Lynch and TV producer Mark
Frost, had first pitched the artsy soap opera months earlier
in a 10-minute meeting with Mr. Stoddard's drama head, Chad
Hoffman. The concept: A small town is rocked by the murder of
a good girl with sordid secrets.
   Mr. Lynch in "Blue Velvet" had given the film world the
creeps with vivid images that may never be ready for prime
time. That movie served up a severed ear and sadomasochistic
sex. In "Eraserhead" a misfit nurtures a monstrously deformed
newborn.
   As it happened, Mr. Iger loved the director's movies.
"Blue Velvet," he explains with admiration, "slapped you in
the face. It did things to me." As for its kinkier aspects,
Mr. Iger notes, "I don't take part in such rituals, nor do I
advocate that anyone else should -- nor would I put it on the
air." But he does believe that in an era of jaded viewers
distracted by a dizzying array of entertainment
possibilities, the traditional network diet of whitebread TV
series, "may not be enough today."
   Convincing the network brass was a bit harder. They just
didn't get Mr. Lynch's style. "I was baffled by it," admits
ABC President Mark Mandala, "but we were all 50-plus white
males." Mr. Iger suggested showing it to a more diverse,
younger group. "Unanimously, they loved it," Mr. Mandala
says. (The show continues to do well with precious
18-to-49-year-olds, as well as hooking a number of people who
rarely watch TV, and women over 50.)
   Mr. Iger persuaded the brass to buy seven episodes at $1
million a piece -- a standard cost. Some executives took
comfort in thinking it would never get on the air. Then Mr.
Iger sought to schedule it for the spring. The final debate
came down to a bi-coastal conference call between Mr. Iger
and a room full of New York executives. Mr. Iger won, but
many of the others were still queasy.
   "I wasn't a big fan. Bob was the one that persevered,"
says his boss, John Sias, No. 3 at Capital Cities/ABC. Mr.
Iger argued that putting the risk-taking show on the air was
critical to the image ABC was cultivating in Hollywood. "When
he says that to me, he'll get what he wants," says Chairman
Thomas Murphy. "We're only as good as the {producers} we work
with."
   Particularly heartening to Hollywood was the fact that Mr.
Iger gave David Lynch and Mark Frost free rein. Soon they had
created a roster of odd characters -- the Log Lady clutches a
small log and may know about the girl's murder. FBI agent
Dale Cooper babbles compulsively, even about the office
doughnuts. Nadine wears a black eye patch and is obsessed
with hanging drapes.
   Things got especially strange in last Thursday's episode:
A dream sequence had the FBI man chatting with the murder
victim -- and with a well-dressed midget who talks backward
and boogies to sleepy jazz. "Now that," says Mr. Iger's boss,
Mr. Sias, "was bizarre. Even by David Lynch standards, that
was weird."
   Depending on whether tonight's ratings match the strong
start, Mr. Iger may decide as early as this week whether
"Twin Peaks" is a glorified fluke, or whether it can join the
ABC lineup for the new TV season that starts next fall. He
faces a bigger test in mid-May, when he must choose about six
new series from 30 pilots vying for the new fall schedule.
Unlike this year's lineup which was largely inherited from
his predecessor, next year's will have all been ordered on
his watch.
   Some producers, their interest piqued by the creative
liberty Mr. Iger gave the creators of "Twin Peaks," are
coming to ABC. James L. Brooks, the successful filmmaker who
also co-produces "The Simpsons" and "The Tracy Ullman Show,"
on Fox Broadcasting Co., was courted by all three networks.
But he recently signed an exclusive new-series deal with Mr.
Iger, who invoked the freedom accorded "Twin Peaks" and
"CopRock."
   Mr. Iger fashioned an unusually loose deal for the
producer. Mr. Brooks gets cash up front and doesn't have to
deliver any series by any deadline. Mr. Iger offered it
without a price, which came later. Smart ploy: "It wasn't a
matter of money at all," says producer Mr. Brooks. "It was
the atmosphere for doing the work, and how committed they
seemed to the shows that we might come up with."
   Many of the building blocks for a turnaround are already
in place at ABC. The network has already gained ground on
Sundays with the hit "America's Funniest Home Videos,"
developed under the TV-loving Mr. Harbert. But the network
has been unable to find a follow-on show that can hold the
audience. "Elvis" flopped despite critical raves. ABC also
needs to fix a hobbling Saturday lineup and fill other gaps.
As Mr. Iger &amp; Co. search for new shows, the question since
the "Twin Peaks" success is how far they can go.
   An ABC pilot called "The Danger Team," for example, has a
lady private eye aided by three tiny, clay-animation guys.
They include Nitt, "a Harpo Marx type who doesn't speak but
makes noises," says Leslie Moonves of Lorimar Television,
which produced the pilot. "I can't believe I'm a grown man
having this conversation."
   Mr. Iger, however, seems ready to err on the side of risk.
Inevitably, he will brook some failures too. Earlier this
week for example, he abruptly canceled "Capital News," a new,
though hardly daring series about a Washington newspaper,
after only a pilot and two episodes had aired. He had already
paid for a full 13 episodes and now concedes, "as a
businessman, it was a bad decision."
   If anything, the demise of the more traditional series may
embolden Mr. Iger further on his course of provocative shows.
He professes that the only rules come down to "No rules."
"We're explorers hoping to discover something," he proclaims.
"There's always that possibility that we're going to step
beyond what the viewer wants."

   Stanley Stahl, an investor controlling 30.6% of Apple
Bancorp Inc. extended his $38-a-share tender offer for the
rest of the bank to May 25 from April 25.
   As of March 20, Apple had 4.6 million shares outstanding.
As of 10 a.m. EDT April 25, holders had tendered 1,157 shares
under the offer, which is valued at $121.6 million. When the
offer was announced March 28, Apple shares leaped past the
offer price, suggesting that investors expect a higher offer
for the bank.

   A spokesman for Mr. Stahl declined to comment on whether
the investor might boost his bid. Apple, based in New York,
has rejected Mr. Stahl's offer as not in the best interests
of the bank or its shareholders. The bank declined on Mr.
Stahl's extension of his offer.

   West Point-Pepperell Inc., West Point, Ga., said it has
pulled its apparel fabrics division off the auction block
because of low preliminary bids.
   In its annual report filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the textile concern said it had
solicited offers for the division -- its most profitable
behind household fabrics -- but stopped pending an
improvement in the financial markets and its parent company's
financial position.

   West Point Acquisition Corp., the company set up by
William F. Farley to purchase West Point-Pepperell last year
for about $1.56 billion, is in dire straits. Earlier this
month, West Point Acquisition defaulted on $796 million in
bank debt and on interest payments on $705 million in
subordinated debt.
   The company reiterated in the filing that it is
negotiating with its bankers, led by Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and
Bankers Trust Co., and has made an exchange offer to its
bondholders in an effort to restructure debt incurred in the
acquisition.
   Last month, the company got only $410 million in cash and
notes for its Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co. unit, after projecting it
would fetch more than $600 million.

   Cyprus Minerals Co. reported net income fell 63%, on a
1.4% decline in revenue, due to lower copper and molybdenum
prices and higher costs at some of its mines.
   For the first quarter, net income declined to $30.1
million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $80 million, or
$1.96 a share, in the year-earlier period. Year-ago earnings
included a $5 million gain from the sale of clay operations.
Revenue declined to $429.5 million, from $435.8 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Denver-based Cyprus said it is seeing improvement in
copper production costs, but the mining company doesn't
expect 1990 earnings to be higher than 1989 earnings. For all
of 1989, Cyprus earned $250.1 million on revenue of $1.79
billion.
   The large earnings drop indicates how vulnerable the
company's earnings still are to fluctuations in copper
prices, despite efforts to diversify into other kinds of
mining ventures over the past five years. Each one cent
increase in copper production costs, or one cent decrease in
the price of copper, results in a 10-cent a share decline in
annual earnings for Cyprus, said R. Wayne Atwell, analyst at
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.

   Commodities:
   Platinum Futures Tumble to a Two-Year Low,
   Pulling Down Contracts for Silver and Bullion

   NEW YORK -- Platinum prices fell to a two-year low,
pulling down silver and gold as increased selling of bullion
triggered heavy liquidation in precious metals futures.
   July delivery platinum ended with a loss of $15.60 an
ounce at $472.20. At one point, July traded at a new
life-of-contract low of $465, for a decline of $22.80. That
was the lowest price since the April 1988 contract traded at
$462.00 on March 3, 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Silver was also weak, with the May contract settling at
$4.9220 an ounce, for a loss of 7.8 cents. The May contract
traded at a new low of $4.89 before recovering slightly. June
gold was down $5.40 an ounce at $373.60.
   "Producers so far have been very disciplined in their
selling, but some 10 days ago it became evident that the
Soviet Union was beginning to sell gold and platinum more
aggressively to earn foreign exchange," said William O'Neill,
research director for Elders Futures in New York.
   Yesterday, the Soviet Union increased its selling of gold
and platinum, and South Africa also may have been a seller of
both metals, Mr. O'Neill said. South Africa is the world's
leading gold and platinum producer; the Soviet Union is
second.
   The chain of events that took place, he said, started with
the producer selling. "Dealers then joined in and when the
futures markets opened, commodity funds heavily liquidated
futures contracts," he said. "When July platinum broke below
$475, the price quickly dropped to its low of $465 as
stop-loss selling orders were touched off," he said.
   "The impact of the Soviet sales was more pronounced on
platinum than on gold because platinum is a very thin market
that is susceptible to wide price swings on major
developments," Mr. O'Neill said. Yesterday, gold also had
some support that minimized declines because the dollar was
down against a very strong Swiss franc and West German mark,
he said.
   The Soviet Union sold gold and platinum because its
economy is "disastrous and starved for foreign exchange, in
part due to the recent drop in oil prices, which reduced
export income," according to Mr. O'Neill. "The only economic
weapon they have is the sale of precious metals. Precious
metals prices have been weak, but their need to sell may have
been so strong that they have decided to sell now before
prices fell further," he said.
   A lack of demand for gold and platinum from all areas of
the world, particularly the Middle East and the Far East,
caused the market to be particularly vulnerable to the
selling, also, Mr. O'Neill said.
   An added weight on precious metals has been created by the
sharp drop in bond prices and the consequent rise in interest
rates to almost 9%, according to Mr. O'Neill.
   He explained that "if a trader bought gold at $400 an
ounce while interest rates were at 9%, gold would have to
rise to $436 to equal what he would have made with a bond.
There's little chance gold will do that now. This tends to
scare traders away from precious metals."
   Vahid Fathi, analyst for Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben in
Cleveland, said Lithuania might have been a factor in the
market.
   "Rumors of Soviet selling depressed the market," Mr. Fathi
said, "and I'm not surprised if they've stepped up their
selling of gold and platinum lately. Lithuania recently said
that it might have to sell gold to get foreign exchange to
pay for energy that it was going to get from other countries
after the Soviet Union shut down supplies. However, all these
developments remain just rumors because everything is so hard
to confirm."
   J. Clarence Morrison, analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities, commented: "There may have been Soviet selling of
gold and platinum but I would say it wasn't exclusively so.
During the fourth quarter of 1989 and the first quarter of
this year, gold was under the pressure of central bank
selling from around the world and there was the possibility
there would be further selling in the second quarter."
   London dealers said that an announcement by Rustenburg
Platinum Holdings Ltd. of South Africa that it would increase
its production of platinum may have been a price-depressing
factor. The company didn't say how much extra production
there would be but dealers estimated that it would amount to
an additional 150,000 ounces, which would bring the company's
annual output to 1.4 million ounces. South Africa produces
about 2.5 million ounces annually. The report didn't have
much impact in London, but apparently it did in New York, the
dealers said.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: The April futures contract, which will cease
trading today, soared 10 cents a pound to $1.3400 on concern
that Commodity Exchange supplies might not be adequate to
satisfy outstanding April contracts. However, while there
recently was a wide disparity between the number of
outstanding April contracts and exchange inventories, the gap
narrowed significantly yesterday, though it didn't disappear.
The number of April contracts declined to 836, or the
equivalent of 10,450 tons, from 913, or 11,412 tons, on
Tuesday, while exchange supplies rose 1,975 tons from the day
before to 6,004 tons. Robert McGrath, Comex spokesman, said:
"We're keeping an eye on the situation and expect an orderly
liquidation of the April contract." Late Tuesday, the
exchange increased the requirement to purchase an April
copper contract to 100% of its price. Even so, the April
contract's sharp rise widened its premium over the May
delivery by 5.50 cents to 14.00 cents, as the May contract
closed at $1.20 a pound for a gain of 4.50 cents. Separately,
it was reported that the strike at Southern Peru Copper Co.
might be nearing an end, analysts said. Workers may be back
by early May, according to one analyst. A ship carrying 5,000
tons to 10,000 tons of refined copper was having trouble in
the Panama Canal and may not be able to meet its scheduled
arrival in mid-May in Rotterdam, one analyst said. A Chilean
official said nothing has happened to disrupt Codelco's
shipping operations and keep it from fulfilling its May
delivery commitments, the analyst said. Codelco is the
state-owned mining company. The analyst quoted an official as
saying existing production problems have already been
incorporated in its annual production estimate, which was
lowered Tuesday.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices rose following an increase in the
U.S. sugar import quota. The May contract advanced 0.37 cent
a pound to 15.77 cents. The U.S. Agriculture Department
yesterday raised the domestic quota by 250,000 tons to
2,830,000 tons for the period that began Jan. 1, 1989, and
extends to Sept. 30. The surprise wasn't that the quota was
raised, but that the action was taken so soon, said Judith
Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch, New York. "Only a couple of
weeks ago the department denied a request from the Sweetener
Users Association, an industry group, for an increase in the
quota," Ms. Ganes said. At that time it was expected that the
quota might not be increased for another month or two, she
said. The government's action boosted world market prices
because it came at a time when global sugar supplies are
tight, Ms. Ganes said.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Petroleum prices declined in futures trading as
some bearish fundamental factors took attention off next
week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, if only briefly. One negative factor was the
American Petroleum Institute's latest weekly report on U.S.
oil statistics. Released late Tuesday after trading had
closed, it showed an increase in crude oil inventories. That
added to worries about the world oil glut and helped drive
down futures prices of crude. West Texas Intermediate for
June delivery fell 34 cents a barrel to settle at $18.66.
July crude was down 30 cents to $19.17. Also unsettling to
oil markets yesterday was a sharp fall in gasoline futures
prices. The May contract for unleaded gasoline was down 1.79
cents a gallon to 62.6 cents. Traders were surprised at the
drop in view of gasoline's recent strength. Some called the
gasoline declines a technical correction.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures contracts
soared late in the trading session at the Chicago Board of
Trade. The Soviet Union was rumored to be interested in
buying as much as 400,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal
but the strong price rise surprised some analysts. Soybean
prices had dropped Tuesday amid profit-taking after rising
for a few weeks. One factor in the price rebound yesterday
were forecasts for good planting weather. For most crops,
such forecasts increase the prospects for strong harvests and
thus tend to weigh down prices. But warm weather and normal
rainfall this time of year in the Midwest sometimes reduces
the amount of land planted to soybeans. If rain and cold
weather delay the planting of corn until May, which is what
happened last year, many farmers are forced to plant soybeans
instead, said Richard A. Loewy, president of AgResource Co.,
Chicago. Soybean prices have been supported in recent weeks
by strong domestic demand for the oil and meal that is
derived by crushing soybeans. Soybean meal is primarily used
as an ingredient in livestock rations. Demand for soybean
oil, which is used in cooking, has been strong in part
because consumers are growing more concerned about using
imported tropical oils.

   A Blood-Sugar Test
   Without Drawing Blood

   FIBER OPTICS could provide a means to measure a person's
blood-sugar level without drawing blood, University of
Connecticut scientists say.
   Such a non-invasive method would simplify the lives of the
nation's 10 million diabetics who must routinely check their
blood sugar, or glucose, by pricking a finger in order to
determine the doses for their insulin injections. The system
would also improve the performance of small pumps worn by
some diabetics that automatically inject insulin.
   The Storrs, Conn., scientists are basing their study on
the way glucose rotates the polarization of light waves. With
optical fibers, they beam light at blood and then read the
resulting shift in the light's polarization. "The theory
definitely works," says Martin Fox, an electrical and systems
engineering professor who is co-developing the sensor.
   The team is considering a system that would beam light
into the eye, where there is fluid containing glucose at
about the same levels present in the bloodstream, Prof. Fox
says. Patients using automatic insulin injection devices
might wear special glasses equipped with tiny optical fibers
aiming an invisible light into an eyeball. The optical fibers
could connect to a small sensor located in the glasses or
elsewhere.
   "The thing we like about {the eye} is that it's a window
into the body," Prof. Fox says.
                                                                                                       

   Fish `Hearing' Opens
   Military, Medical World
                                                                                                       

   RESEARCH into how fish hear may improve submarines'
ability to listen quietly for enemies and may help doctors
diagnose disease.
   As part of a Navy-backed study, engineers at Georgia
Institute of Technology in Atlanta are measuring
sound-induced vibrations produced by various parts of
goldfish, including the inner ear and swim bladder, a
gas-filled sac that regulates buoyancy.
   To monitor a fish's physical responses to sound, the
scientists developed and patented a non-invasive
vibration-measuring device they believe could be adapted to
check people for diseased tissue, kidney stones or glaucoma.
   Fish use a passive listening system that doesn't alert
predators or prey to their presence. This interests the Navy,
because submarines often rely on sonar to locate enemies, and
adversaries can hear those sound pulses as they bounce
through the sea.
   To observe a fish's internal responses to sound, the
researchers suspend an anesthetized goldfish in a 50 gallon
water tank. On one side of the fish, a projector broadcasts a
continuous sound wave. On the other side, a transducer aims
an ultrasonic beam into the fish, and a second transducer
receives a beam that has been modified by the sound-induced
vibrations occurring inside the fish. This system enables the
researchers to measure atomic-scale vibrations inside the
fish.
   A fish is primarily fluid, and its body may rock gently as
sound waves pass through it. Scientists suspect fish may
sense sound when the otolith, a stone-like anchor in the
inner ear, interacts with the fish's swaying body,
stimulating hair cells that send electrical signals to the
brain. The swim bladder is also believed to be involved in
creating vibrations in a fish's inner ear.
                                                                                                       

   Shielding Hospital Staff
   From Dangerous Cuts
                                                                                                       

   BECAUSE OF concern about the spread of infectious diseases
to health-care workers, new devices are being developed to
help protect them from accidental needle pricks and scalpel
cuts. Such accidents bring medical personnel in contact with
patients' blood and can expose them to infections, including
hepatitis and AIDS.
   Syringe Scabbard Systems of Lyndhurst, Ohio, is marketing
a table-mounted device resembling a fountain-pen holder in
which needles can be recapped using only one hand. It was
invented by a dentist.
   Another device, called the Recapper, is also meant to help
workers safely recap hypodermic needles. Made by On-Gard
Systems Inc. of Denver, the Recapper resembles the handle of
a sword with a shield to protect the hand grip. A hole in the
center of the shield grips a needle that is sheathed but that
is otherwise ordinary and retains the sheath as the syringe
is pulled away, exposing the needle.
   To recap the needle, the hypodermic is reinserted into its
sheath, still held by the plastic device as the hand guard
protects against pricks. The syringe and recovered needle are
removed from the Recapper, for disposal, while squeezing its
grip.
   On-Gard says more than 600 of the nation's 6,000 hospitals
have ordered Recappers for trial and that 1,000 of the
100,000 dental offices in the U.S. have done so, too. The
devices can be used over and over.
   Allied-Signal Inc., Morris Township, N.J., has designed a
cut-resistant glove liner to be worn under surgical gloves.
The liners are made of Allied's Spectra polyethylene fiber,
which is also used in bullet-proof vests. At $40 a pair, the
liners offer 17 times more protection than heavy leather
gloves and yet allow the wearer to take a pulse or pick up a
dime.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   WHITE BREAD packaged in carbon dioxide-filled plastic bags
keeps its fresh texture for at least a week, while loaves in
air-filled bags lose their fresh feel after a day or two,
says a report in the Journal of Food Science. . . . A tick
decoy, patented by an Old Dominion University professor,
lures males with a female's sexual odors, then kills with
poison as the male tries to mate with the bait. The inventor
plans to sell the traps for use on livestock.

   Ingersoll Closes Down St. Louis Sun After Seven Months
   ----

   ST. LOUIS -- Ralph Ingersoll II's bold dream of launching
a daily newspaper here has met a quick death.
   Yesterday, the self-styled maverick of the newspaper
industry closed down the St. Louis Sun, a colorful and
combative tabloid newspaper that was launched Sept. 25 with
great fanfare.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unable to meet the circulation goals of the paper, which
was losing millions on home delivery, Mr. Ingersoll wasted
little time to stop the bleeding. Yesterday was the paper's
last issue. The final copy of the Sun carried the headline
"Deathly Quiet," about a local shooting.
   Mr. Ingersoll's Sun was ambitious in its very concept,
attempting to launch a new newspaper in a major city, going
head-to-head with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, owned by
Pulitzer Publishing Co.
   Chairman of the Princeton, N.J.-based Ingersoll
Publications Co., Mr. Ingersoll had appointed himself editor
in chief of the Sun in October. He recently bought a home in
St. Louis, wrote spirited editorials, made decisions on
front-page stories and even personally interviewed local
bigwigs such as Carl Icahn, whose Trans World Airlines Inc.
has its hub in St. Louis.
   If the paper had worked, it would have been the first
successful launch of an independent city newspaper since
World War II. In a statement, Mr. Ingersoll said the Sun had
a budget of between $20 million and $25 million, but he had
been forced to invest even more than that.
   Industry people close to the Sun say Mr. Ingersoll's
venture cost him much more -- as much as $40 million in its
seven months of life.
   The closing of the Sun didn't affect Ingersoll
Publications' Suburban Journals, a highly profitable chain of
weekly newspapers that ring St. Louis.
   As recently as two weeks ago, Mr. Ingersoll denied
published reports that he would close down the Sun, though he
did admit the paper's home delivery was costing $5 million a
year more than expected. The Sun's daily paid circulation
never went higher than 105,000; the Post-Dispatch actually
gained circulation during the Sun's tenure, reaching 420,000
daily.
   "If the Sun had been tried by someone with deeper pockets
and without his company's debt problem, the Sun would still
be operating," said Tom Adams, media analyst for Paul Kagan
Associates. "Considering his financial situation, it's not
surprising Ralph wants to stop the bleeding."
   It's been a bad week for Mr. Ingersoll, who didn't return
phone calls for an interview. Community Newspapers Inc., one
of the newspaper holding companies jointly owned by Ingersoll
Publications and E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co., is struggling to
avoid default on its heavy debt load. Another of Mr.
Ingersoll's holding companies, Ingersoll Newspapers Inc.,
made an offer last month to buy back about $240 million of
Community's junk bonds at a deep discount to their face
value. But by Monday, not a single bondholder had tendered
bonds, and Mr. Ingersoll was forced to extend the cash tender
offer to midnight May 4. Mr. Ingersoll was offering
disgruntled bondholders as little as 28 cents on the dollar
to buy back the debt.
   The St. Louis Sun is part of Mr. Ingersoll's Ingersoll
Newspapers Inc., one of his two holding companies. Mr.
Ingersoll controls a total of 18 daily newspapers and 140
nondaily newspapers.
   Industry observers are now wondering which other Ingersoll
owned or controlled newspaper properties may be sold or in
some other way affected by Mr. Ingersoll's financial crunch.
Ingersoll Publications already put up for sale Chanry
Communications, a chain of 76 free weekly newspapers on Long
Island in New York. In January, Mr. Ingersoll's two newspaper
holding companies sold 10 newspapers to raise more than $320
million, which the company said would be used to pay off
debt.
   While Mr. Ingersoll claims the closing of the Sun wasn't
based on lack of advertising support, the Sun's advertising
linage was usually never more than 20% of the paper; most
profitable newspapers run close to 60% ad linage.
   The Sun's 194 full-time employees will get full pay for 12
weeks.
   Mr. Ingersoll had thought that the Sun was a sure thing.
The Post-Dispatch, he was fond of saying, had become
complacent and lazy in its news coverage and people wanted an
alternative to its liberal editorial page. The Sun in Mr.
Ingersoll's hands was a strong civic booster, a friend of the
powers-that-be and largely conservative in its editorial
outlook.
   But it was the job of editor that Mr. Ingersoll relished
most. He had hoped the Sun would play a large part in
bringing a new professional sports arena to downtown St.
Louis and in keeping TWA in the city. He recently told a
reporter that the "Sun is not only going to report the news,
it's going to make the news." Yesterday, Mr. Ingersoll did
just that.

   Ruling May Blunt
   New Regulation
   On S&amp;L Lending

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- A federal judge in Tucson, Ariz., issued a
ruling that could blunt a savings-and-loan regulation that
limits how much a thrift may lend to any one borrower.
   U.S. district Judge William Browning ruled that
Mississippi Savings Bank, Batesville, Miss., must return
$749,775 to a borrower that had put up that amount as
security in a line-of-credit contract. The $1.7 million line
of credit exceeds the amount Mississippi Savings may lend to
a single borrower under the new regulation, which stems from
last year's S&amp;L restructuring law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judge Browning issued a preliminary injunction against
Mississippi Savings, ordering the return of funds to the
borrower, All American Finance Co., Tucson.
   The judge, however, stopped short of ordering Mississippi
Savings to fund the full $1.7 million contract. But he said
that on the strength of its contract, All American is likely
to prevail on the merits in a trial. The judge further
blocked federal regulators from taking action against the
thrift's officers for seeking to honor the lending agreement.
   Although Judge Browning didn't deal directly with the
so-called loan-to-one-borrower regulation, this was the
second time a federal judge has undercut strict new
provisions of the S&amp;L bailout law. An earlier ruling held up
the industry restructuring when it was determined that the
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision wasn't
constitutionally appointed. That ruling was rendered moot
when the Senate confirmed a new OTS director early this
month.
   Yesterday's ruling could lead to further litigation, or
even a change in the regulation, which was issued on an
interim basis one month ago. The loan-to-one-borrower
regulation limits the amount a thrift may lend to any
borrower to 15% of its capital, or $500,000, whichever is
greater. A final regulation is expected next month.
   An attorney for the thrift office said he didn't believe
this decision will affect the loan-to-one-borrower
regulation, because it simply returns the security to the
borrower that the thrift held under the contract. "The
decision doesn't say whether the judge intends to abrogate
the contract or not," the thrift office attorney said.
   A spokesman for Mississippi Savings declined to comment
immediately after the ruling.
   The case illustrates how the regulation places many
thrifts in a legal bind. When Mississippi Savings tried to
fund its line-of-credit contract to All American, the Office
of Thrift Supervision blocked it by issuing a
cease-and-desist order. And the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. said that because Mississippi Savings was violating the
new regulation, it could no longer raise funds through
brokered deposits, a volatile source of funding that requires
regulatory approval.
   All American, which services and sells auto and consumer
loans, felt it had a simple contract case. "We are an
innocent third party being damaged by an action taken by the
Office of Thrift Supervision," said Helen Davis Chaitman, an
attorney for All American.
   The judge agreed. "To unilaterally destroy otherwise
solvent enterprises who deal with government-regulated
businesses with impunity and without judicial scrutiny
seriously undermines public confidence," his ruling said.

   Canadian banks have complained that the planned bank would

   Total-Cie. Francaise des Petroles, Paris, said its 1989
net consolidated profit jumped 49.2% to 2.2 billion francs
($386 million) from 1.48 billion francs in 1988.
   Consolidated revenue rose 15.6% to 107.9 billion francs

</LP>
<TEXT>
   The French state-controlled oil group noted that the steep
rise in profit occurred despite 1.14 billion francs in
extraordinary items. In 1988, the company had extraordinary
gains of 242 million francs.
   About one-half of the 1989 extraordinary charges was
attributable to various provisions linked to restructuring
within the group. The other half was because of the
acceleration of depreciation and provisions affecting the
group's oil and gas assets, mainly in North America.
   Total-CFP said the sharp increase in revenue reflected
strong sales growth both in terms of value and volume. The
group sold 62.1 million tons of crude oil in 1989, up 14.2%
from a year earlier.

   NEW YORK -- The stock market ended its losing streak in

   Advancing issues led decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange for only the third time this month as the market,
buoyed by news that Norton had accepted a higher takeover
offer, rebounded in spite of another rise in interest rates.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which went down a total
of 111.27 points during the market's string of losses,
rebounded 11.94 to 2,666.44.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
added 1.67 to 332.03, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index rose 0.79 to 182.30 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index gained 1.57 to 309.52.
   Big Board gainers topped losers 774 to 664. The last time
the measure of the market's overall performance closed higher
was April 12, when 908 stocks rose and 573 fell on the Big
Board; on April 3, 1,071 issues scored gains and 431 posted
losses.
   Advancers surged to a lead of more than 2-to-1 as the
latest session got under way as early gains in the
Treasury-bond market, along with talk that the sell-off in
stocks had been overdone, sent prices higher.
   Buyers continued to focus on blue-chip stocks and steered
away from those issues tied to first-quarter earnings
disappointments, said James C. Andrews, first vice president
in charge of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc., Philadelphia.
   For example, Du Pont added 7/8 to 35 7/8 after reporting
that first-quarter net income dropped 16% from a year
earlier, in line with analysts' forecasts. Similarly,
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber rose 1/2 to 35 1/2 although its
earnings for the period fell about 78%.
   But the rise in prices didn't bring with it an improvement
in the level of trading activity, as Big Board volume fell to
133,480,000 shares from 137,360,000 Tuesday.
   Gail M. Dudack, a technical analyst at S.G. Warburg, cited
the continued light volume as an indication that further
weakness lies ahead for the market. "I don't think the
rebound's very strong or telling us anything wonderful," she
said.
   From a technical standpoint, Ms. Dudack said, the market
could recoup as much as half of its latest losses without
breaking out of its recent pattern of declining prices. "The
general tone of the market, to me, is negative," she says.
   Stocks rose although Treasury notes and bonds declined 1/8
point, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount. Treasury issues had
risen about 1/4 point early in the session.
   Panhandle Eastern closed unchanged at 26 7/8 on 1.4
million shares after issuing its first-quarter report, which
showed that net from continuing operations went up about 37%
from a year ago.
   Chrysler fell 3/8 to 15 1/2, a 52-week low. Chairman Lee
Iacocca said he hopes the company will report a profit for
the first and second quarters, but he didn't provide any
specific forecasts.
   Tambrands jumped 2 7/8 to 79 in the wake of a strong
first-quarter earnings report and news of an agreement to
sell its diagnostic unit. Terms of the sale weren't
disclosed.
   Georgia-Pacific gained 1 3/8 to 40 7/8. First Boston
upgraded the stock, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report; analyst William Wigder declined comment.
   Sotheby's Holdings rose 3/4 to 18 1/2. The company's joint
venture with William Acquavella, a New York art dealer,
reached an agreement in principle to purchase the art of the
Pierre Matisse Gallery for $142.8 million.
   Trinity Industries fell 1 to 23 3/4. The company said it
may have to take a charge in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended
last month, because of a $2.9 million inventory shortage
discovered at one of its divisions.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index barely
avoided closing at a 1990 low for the third consecutive
session by rising 0.63 to 344.52. Volume totaled 16,060,000
shares compared with 12,460,000 Tuesday. There were 270
issues advancing 238 declining and 272 unchanged.
   B.A.T Industries, which agreed to sell its Saks Fifth
Avenue unit to Investcorp for about $1.5 billion, gained 3/16
to 11 3/4 in composite trading of 1.6 million shares. As
reported, the sale is part of a restructuring plan.
   Energy Service added 1/4 to 4 5/8 on 1.2 million shares.
The company and R.D. Smith &amp; Co., a New York investment firm,
boosted their combined stake in the senior debt and equity of
Penrod Drilling to 68.8% and said they would cooperate in
efforts to restructure the company, formerly owned by the
Hunt brothers.

   Bond Corp. Holdings is in talks to sell its 66% stake in
Bond Corp. International to Tompson Pacific Ltd. and a group
of unrelated parties, according to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange.
   The announcement about the Australian company, the
flagship of Alan Bond's troubled corporate empire, comes
after speculation over the fate of the investment holding
subsidiary. BCIL has sold off nearly all of its assets in the
past 18 months, keeping only its 50% stake in a Rome property
development site and a brewery in China.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The statement didn't disclose the price being discussed,
indicating only that Tompson Pacific, a property investment
and investment holding company, is in talks to buy 34.5% of
BCIL. The report also said Bond Corp. is in discussions to
place the remaining 31.5% with unrelated parties.
   Trading in shares of BCIL and Tompson Pacific was stopped
before the start of yesterday's session and will remain
halted until further details are disclosed, the companies
said.

   NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
that Richard Bangham, former chairman of Viking Freight Inc.,
settled a civil suit involving alleged insider trading.
   In the settlement, Mr. Bangham agreed to pay a penalty of
$117,625. In agreeing to the settlement, he neither admitted
nor denied the allegations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SEC suit, filed in November, alleged that Mr. Bangham,
as Viking chairman, learned on July 1, 1988, that Roadway
Services Inc. was interested in acquiring the company. The
suit alleged that Mr. Bangham passed that information to
Kenneth Liroff, a friend and business associate. The SEC
charged Mr. Liroff, of Livingston, N.J., with using that
information to purchase Viking common shares.
   Mr. Liroff has denied the allegations. The SEC's civil
charges against him are pending in federal court in
Manhattan.
   Viking and Roadway announced Roadway's tender offer for
the company on July 18, 1988. After the announcement,
Viking's stock price climbed 60% above the previous day's
closing price. The penalty to be paid by Mr. Bangham, of the
British West Indies, equals the profit that the SEC alleges
Mr. Liroff made on the transactions.

   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- Genentech Inc. reported an
80% surge in first-quarter net income, but the biotechnology
company said it expects a loss for the year because of
expenses related to the sale of a controlling interest in the
firm to Roche Holding Ltd.
   Profit in the quarter rose to $13.3 million, or 15 cents a
share, from $7.4 million, or nine cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue jumped 32% to $120.2 million from $91.1 million.

   The latest quarter was aided by a 14% increase in sales of
Activase, the company's heart-attack drug. Sales rose to
$54.9 million from $48.1 million.
   Genentech said it incurred $11.7 million, or about 12
cents a share, in expenses during the latest quarter related
to its previously announced $2.1 billion sale of 60% of the
company to Roche Holding, Basil, Switzerland. Overall,
merger-related expenses are expected to total about $150
million when the transaction is completed, resulting in a
loss for the year, Genentech said.
   For 1989, the company had net income of $44 million, or 51
cents a share, on revenue of $400.4 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Genentech closed at $26, up 12.5 cents.

   NEW YORK -- The Treasury's auction of two-year notes drew
strong demand from individual investors, but their appetite
wasn't enough to offset the lack of interest among big
investors.
   As a result, the Treasury's $10.5 billion sale of two-year
notes went poorly, causing bond prices to slide. The average
yield on the notes was 8.90%, up from 8.59% at the previous
two-year note auction on March 27 and the highest average
yield at an auction since 9.34% on April 26, 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The yield attracted near-record participation by
individual investors, who tend to buy at auctions through
so-called "non-competitive" bids. These buyers agree to
accept securities at the average yield. At yesterday's
auction, non-competitive bids totaled $1.91 billion, a little
below the $1.99 billion record non-competitive bids received
at the January 1989 auction.
   But institutional investors shied away from the auction
for fear that interest rates in the U.S. and abroad are
heading higher and that U.S. bonds will continue to erode.
   "The fact that there was no follow-through buying {after
the auction} has market participants a little nervous," said
James Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc. "Some people are saying `if there
is a problem with the two-year auction, heaven forbid what
could happen next month,'" when the Treasury is scheduled to
sell $30 billion of notes and bonds in the quarterly
refunding of the federal debt.
   Details of the refunding will be announced May 2, but
analysts expect the refunding package to resemble the
previous auction in February when the government sold $10
billion each of three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities.
   Shortly after yesterday's auction results were released,
dealers began marking down prices. Late in the day, the yield
on the new two-year notes was quoted in when-issued trading
activity at 8.94%, well above the auction average of 8.90%.
The fact that the yield moved higher after the auction is
widely viewed as an indication that dealers had trouble
selling the notes and were forced to cut prices, which raises
the yield, to attract buyers.
   Moreover, traders said some speculators purchased two-year
notes early in the day on expectations that prices would
trade higher once the auction results were released. But when
the opposite occurred, they unloaded those securities, which
exerted downward pressure on prices.
   The benchmark Treasury bond also tumbled, but made a
partial comeback just before the market closed. The 30-year
bond ended 1/8 point lower, a loss of $1.25 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, rose slightly to 8.97%.
   Dealers said investors worried that upcoming economic
reports, especially tomorrow's first-quarter gross national
numbers, will show sufficient strength and prompt the Federal
Reserve to tighten credit policy within the next month.
   "The fear of the GNP number on Friday and the implication
it might have for the Fed kept some institutional investors
away from the auction," said David Green, manager of the
government bond trading department at Chemical Bank.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. sprinted
higher on news that part of the giant publisher might be
sold.
   Eugene J. McCarthy, an HBJ outside director, told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report that Harcourt and Thomson
Corp. of Canada have held discussions regarding the sale of
part of the firm. Mr. McCarthy declined to elaborate.
   HBJ's 13 3/4% senior subordinated debentures finished 2
1/4 points higher at 79 1/2 after initially rising four
points on the news. The 13% senior notes also gained, ending
2 1/4 points higher at 94 1/2.
   Anne Lorsung, a high-yield analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp;
Maffei Inc., said prices rose on the perception that if
Thomson acquires part of Harcourt Brace, it will retire some
of the debt at a premium.
   "The initial reaction is that a well-capitalized company
takes over a poorly-capitalized company and that could mean
the well-capitalized company will end up guaranteeing the
debt or paying it off at par or some premium," said Ms.
Lorsung. Although she said this would be the "best-case
scenario," even in the "worst-case scenario," where Thomson
would launch an exchange offer for the bonds, holder of debt
are likely to fare well.
   Also higher were junk bonds of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.
which continued to advance on Tuesday's news that the U.S.
will allow Michelin Group to proceed with its $1.5 billion
acquisition of the tire maker.
   Uniroyal's 14 1/2% subordinated debentures, maturing in
2000, ended at about 113, an increase of about seven points
in the last two sessions.
   Most other junk bonds, speculative-grade securities with
low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, prices ended
unchanged.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, actively
traded issues closed between 1/8 point to 1/4 point lower.
   About $400 million in new corporate debt was priced
yesterday, including a $200 million issue of five-year notes
by Morgan Stanley Group Inc. The noncallable notes were
priced to yield 9.907%. The size of the issue was increased
from an originally planned $150 million.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Long-term British government bonds plunged on news that
the nation's current account and merchandise trade deficits
in March both came in at #2.18 billion ($3.56 billion), up
from #1.39 billion in February. Market expectations had been
for deficits of #1.3 billion.
   British bonds fell more than a point just minutes after
the reports were released. The pound also fell, prompting the
Bank of England to intervene in the foreign exchange markets
in an effort to boost the currency's value.
   "This market has had nothing but bad news for weeks," said
one trader. "Then along come these awful trade numbers and a
lot of investors just figured enough is enough. So they
dumped."
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major attempted to calm
the markets with a series of radio and television interviews.
He blamed the deficits on erratic items and noted that
exports are growing four times as fast as imports.
   He reiterated his belief that the trade data don't warrant
a change in economic policy. Some market participants
interpreted Mr. Major's remarks to suggest that the
government will keep base lending rates at their current
level of 15%.
   Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003/2007
fell 1 13/32 points to 94 27/32 to yield 12.48%. Shorter-term
securities posted more modest losses. Futures prices also
slid.
   Elsewhere, West German government bonds ended 1/4 point
higher despite a bearish report from the Bundesbank.
   The central bank warned of rising inflationary risks as
income tax cuts, increased government spending and the
planned monetary union with East Germany boost demand for
goods and services. Monetary union is expected to take effect
July 2.
   West Germany's benchmark 7 3/4% bond due 2000 rose 0.25
point to 93.40 to yield 8.77%.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond was 32 to yield 8.96% on
Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at 96 25/32 to yield
8.98% compared with 96 27/32 to yield 8.97%.
   Short-term rates were a little higher. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.78% for a bond
equivalent yield of 8.025% while the rate on six-month bills
rose to 7.96% to yield 8.387%.
   Here are details of yesterday's two-year note auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   The notes are dated April 30 and mature April 30, 1992.

   Mortgage securities came under pressure after an
institution sold several hundred million dollars of
Government National Mortgage Association's 9% securities and
buyers remained scarce. Active mortgage issues fell 3/32 to
7/32.
   Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for May delivery ended at 93 20/32,
down 7/32; its 9 1/2% issue at 96 7/32, down 6/32, and its
10% issue at 98 26/32, down 5/32.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National
Mortgage Association issues continued to hold up better than
Ginnie Maes because the conventional issues are favored in
derivative transactions. Also, they have shorter average
lives and durations than the Ginnie Maes.
   Freddie Mac's 9 1/2% issue fell 3/32 to 96 3/32 while
Fannie Mae's 9 1/2% securities dropped 3/32 to 96 5/8.
   Fannie Mae announced two real estate mortgage investment
conduit, or Remic, issues totaling $550 million. That
followed $850 million in Remics issued Tuesday by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac.
   In the asset-backed securities market, Citicorp continued
its heavy sales of credit-card certificates, offering a $250
million issue to retail investors through an underwriting
group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   The five-year issue was priced with a bond equivalent
yield of 9.41%, 45 basis points above the Treasury five-year
note. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues slipped as much as 5/8 point in
moderately active dealings.
   "There were a few bid lists and some stuff came back at
new levels," one municipal trader said. "Maybe we'll shake
some people out at these levels," he added.
   Several traders have reported light activity this week, as
investors seem to be biding their time anticipating further
municipal price declines.
   In negotiated action, a Bear Stearns &amp; Co. group set the
preliminary pricing for a $55.1 million issue of New Jersey
Health Care Facilities Finance Authority hospital revenue
bonds. The issue was priced to yield from 8% in 2000 to 8.47%
in 2013.
   Among dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
bonds were 1/2 point lower at 95 1/2 to yield 7.57%. The
bonds have fallen 1 1/2 points in the past week.

   Tokyo stocks ended higher in steady volume Wednesday
despite the yen's further declines against the dollar.
   Stocks were down at London and most other major markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up
62.98 points at 29564.36. The index retreated 177.69 points
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index was off 38.79 points
to 29525.57 at the close of the morning session.
   Wednesday's volume on the First Section was estimated at
700 million shares, up from 508 million Tuesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 492 to 441, while
177 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which fell 8.11 points Tuesday, took
back 7.42 points, or 0.34%, to 2200.51.
   The Second Section index, a 23.59-point loser Tuesday,
fell 17.43 points, or 0.49%, to close at 3508.83.
   Volume in the Second Section was estimated at nine million
shares, down from 10 million Tuesday.
   Some observers termed trading activity this week as a
short-term "dealers' market," with most private investors
taking a defensive stance before next week, when the market
will be closed for holidays Monday, Thursday and Friday.
   But Wednesday's market was characterized more by
rumor-backed buying in certain stocks, whose price advances
triggered small rallies within their corresponding sectors,
traders said.
   "It's a favorable sign," said one Japanese securities
trader at a U.S. investment banking concern. The fact that
investors are willing to put money into the market, despite
uncertainty about economic fundamentals, "shows that they're
trying to punt," he said.
   This "punter's market" indicates that "people are willing
to chase stocks for the time being and make some very quick
money before Golden Week," he said.
   The return of buyers into the marketplace was reflected in
Wednesday's much-healthier volume, seen as an attractive
technical factor for the market, the trader added.
   But weaker currency and bond markets are still putting a
damper on buying overall, traders agreed. As a result, the
market is expected to be sluggish and flat until the holidays
are over, according to Mahmoud Ghaemmaghami, manager and
portfolio adviser in the research department at WestLB
Securities Pacific Ltd.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo trading at 159.25 yen
Wednesday, up from 158.95 yen in New York late Tuesday and
well above its finish of 158.15 Tuesday in Tokyo.
   Traders said that the market was focused Wednesday on
three types of rumors: new products, mergers and acquisitions
and stock splits. Stocks of construction and nonferrous metal
companies were the main sectors involved, they said.
   Corporate news stories Tuesday on new products by Suzuki
Motors and Dainippon Pharmaceutical, and by Ricoh spurred
buying of these shares Tuesday. But Dainippon Pharmaceutical
lost 60 yen (38 cents) to 2,790 yen and Ricoh fell 80 yen to
1,220 Wednesday on profit-taking.
   Shares of Suzuki Motors, in which trading was suspended
Tuesday to allow for fair trading, soared 110 Wednesday to
close at 910.
   Moreover, local news reports that Nippon Mining may have
discovered a new vein and unconfirmed rumors that the company
may be planning a project involving its 47%-owned subsidiary,
Kyodo Oil Co., boosted Nippon Mining's shares by 71 yen to
997.
   Nonferrous metal companies Sumitomo Metal Mining and
Mitsubishi Mining benefited from the interest in the sector,
traders said. Sumitomo added 60 to 1,370, while Mitsubishi
advanced 61 to 745.
   London share prices finished a touch above their intraday
lows, as sharply disappointing U.K. merchandise trade data
and extremely lackluster activity sent the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index through a major
technical support level, dealers said.
   "It doesn't look good for the market at the moment," one
trader said. "There doesn't seem to be a light at the end of
the tunnel."
   The broad-based FT-SE 100-share index closed down 16.8
points at 2143.1, breaking below the chart support of 2150.
At its lowest point, reached just minutes before the session
ended, the index was down 17 points at 2142.9. The intraday
high of 2167.6 came near midday.
   At its final tally, the narrower FT 30 share index was
down 13.7 points at 1683.5. Volume was 392.8 million shares,
compared with the 372.9 million Tuesday.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2158.0, down from its close of 2187.0 Tuesday.
   Most traders were markedly bearish about the prospects for
share prices in the short term as domestic concerns mount,
highlighted by Wednesday's second worst set of trade figures.
   Britain's current account deficit widened sharply in March
to #2.18 billion ($3.56 billion) from #1.39 billion in
February, amid market expectations of a number around the
#1.3 billion-#1.4 billion range.
   With no good news in sight, traders forecast a downward
drift to the next support level, reckoned to lie between 2100
and 2110 on the FT-SE 100.
   As well as economic concerns, dealers said the market
suffered from a stock shortage, which led to extreme price
fluctuations amid low volume.
   And with Friday's end to the three-week account in sight,
investors aren't willing to commit new capital to fresh
positions, traders added.
   A dose of bearish corporate news depressed prices of
several major blue chips. Industrial conglomerate BTR was a
big loser, diving 15 pence (24 cents) to 407 pence after
Norton Co., which BTR has been pursuing with a hostile bid,
signed a merger accord with France's Compagnie de
Saint-Gobain.
   Elsewhere, Cadbury Schweppes skidded 9 1/2 to 309 on news
that the U.K.'s Monopolies and Mergers Commission would begin
an inquiry into Britain's carbonated soft-drinks industry.
   Tobacco and financial services company B.A.T, having
successfully fended off a hostile bid from Hoylake earlier
this week, added 4 to 705 after reaching agreement to sell
its U.S.-based Saks Fifth Avenue department store chain to
Investcorp, an international investment firm, for about $1.5
billion.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt, lower
in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam and Stockholm, and mixed in
Brussels. Milan was closed for a local holiday. South African
gold stocks closed sharply lower.
   Share prices were mixed in Hong Kong and lower in Seoul,
Singapore, Taipei and Manila. Sydney and Wellington were
closed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,

Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   OAK BROOK, Ill. -- Spiegel Inc. said first-quarter profit
rose 23% on sales that increased 20%.
   The catalog company, which is outpacing some of its rivals
in a difficult retailing environment, said net income for the
quarter was $7.8 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with
$6.3 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $389.9 million from $325.2 million.

   John J. Shea, Spiegel's president and chief executive
officer, said the company is gaining market share by adding
new customers in all of its units. "We believe the remainder
of 1990 holds great potential," he said.
   Spiegel, whose majority shareholder is the Otto family of
West Germany, sells apparel and household furnishings through
its Spiegel catalogs. It also operates Eddie Bauer and
Honeybee stores and catalogs.

   Heard on the Street:
   Torchmark's Proxy Fight Against American
   General Hinges on the Concerns' Performance

   NEW YORK -- How's this for a simple choice: You can cast
your lot with a company whose stock price more than tripled
in the past five years. Or you can side with a company in the
same industry whose stock price gained a paltry 20% in the
same period.
   That's the essence of the choice facing shareholders of
American General -- the laggard mentioned above -- which is
the object of a takeover bid and proxy fight by Torchmark,
whose stock price has been soaring.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The performance records of the two companies make a
powerful argument for Torchmark, according to several
insurance analysts and takeover-stock speculators. But a
variety of other factors, including the unusual takeover
tactics that Torchmark has employed, have raised doubts about
whether Torchmark will win the vote at American General's
annual meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
   Those doubts, combined with the long regulatory delays
that usually accompany a hostile bid for an insurance
company, have kept American General's stock price well below
the $50 a share in cash and stock that Torchmark offered but
quickly withdrew last month.
   Yesterday, however, American General shares jumped 1 1/8
to close at 37 7/8, helped by renewed enthusiasm for takeover
stocks. Sparking that enthusiasm was Norton's agreement to
sell itself to Saint-Gobain for $90 a share, $15 a share more
than BTR PLC's hostile $75 bid.
   Meanwhile Torchmark shares sagged 1/8 to close at 45 1/8.
Since Torchmark announced its bid, its shares have fallen
because of fears about the dilution and increased debt load
that an acquisition of American General would cause.
   The case for Torchmark is that it's a lean, well-managed
company whose rising earnings and heavy stock buy-backs have
boosted its share price. "Torchmark has done a good job of
maximizing value to shareholders," says Carol Manning, a
Smith Barney insurance analyst who has neutral ratings on
both stocks. She adds: "American General shares have been
trading at a greater than average relative discount to the
market because the return to shareholders has been below
average for the life insurance industry."
   In the 1980s, American General did a lot of buying and
selling. It added more life insurance companies, shed
property-casualty units and expanded its consumer finance
business by acquiring a Manufacturers Hanover subsidiary for
$685 million in 1988. It has been slow to cut costs but
recently became more aggressive, promising annual savings of
$40 million by putting together certain Florida and Tennessee
operations. American General has also been buying back stock,
but less aggressively than Torchmark.
   Torchmark is nominating five directors of the six up for
election at American General's annual meeting. The board has
a total of 15 members who serve staggered terms. Torchmark
has said that if it wins, it will make a new acquisition
proposal.
   "We think the American General shareholders have nothing
to lose by supporting the Torchmark proxy fight," Ms. Manning
says.
   Analyst Ronald P. McIntosh at Fox-Pitt Kelton is
recommending both stocks. He believes American General will
restructure even if it remains independent, and Torchmark
will be able to cut costs and sell assets at American General
if it wins the company.
   "We have called Torchmark's the best management in the
life insurance industry," Mr. McIntosh says.
   Torchmark's administrative expenses are about 16% of
premiums in home-service life insurance compared with 24% at
American General, Mr. McIntosh says. American General argues
that commission expenses should also be included and that on
this basis its costs are only five percentage points higher
than its rival's. American General says its expenses are
higher because it operates in 25 states compared with
Torchmark's five.
   Harold S. Hook, American General's chairman, argues that
Torchmark won't be able to repeat its success with his
company. "I don't think you can draw a straight line from any
of the specifics and make a case against AG," says Mr. Hook,
adding that he expects to win the proxy vote.
   Mr. McIntosh of Fox-Pitt predicts victory for Torchmark,
although he says some institutions have been puzzled by
Torchmark's quick withdrawal of its takeover bid. By
retreating, however, Torchmark may have made it easier to
press its proxy fight without getting approval in advance
from state insurance regulators.
   The regulators, however, could still force Torchmark to
withdraw its slate before the meeting or before the results
of the vote are announced. The major hurdles are hearings in
Tennessee today and tomorrowand in Hawaii tomorrow. There's
also a federal appeals court hearing in New Orleans on
Monday. Takeover-stock speculators rate the chances of a vote
taking place on Wednesday as a little better than a tossup.

   Bristol-Myers Squibb
   Sees Per-Share Profit
   Surpassing $3.25 in '90

   NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it agrees with
analysts' estimates that per-share 1990 profit will be
between $3.25 and $3.30, adding that earnings dilution from
its merger last year should end by late 1991 or 1992.
   In 1989, the company earned $747 million, or $1.43 a share
-- including a $693 million charge related to the merger last
October of Bristol-Myers and Squibb -- on sales of $9.2
billion. Last week, the giant pharmaceutical and health
care-products company posted a 19% rise in first-quarter
earnings, to $409.1 million, or 78 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Richard L. Gelb, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that although there are many areas where the two
companies have been able to combine operations,
"Bristol-Myers and Squibb didn't merge in order to save
money. Nevertheless, by the end of next year, we expect to
have achieved savings sufficient to make up in full for the
dilution. From that point on, former Bristol-Myers shares
will have the same earning power as before the merger, with
the incremental earning power of Squibb added."
   The company's statement was apparently issued because of
investment community interest about how the merger is
proceeding.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Bristol-Myers closed at $52.875 a share, up 25 cents.

   NORTON AGREED to be acquired for $90 a share, or about
$1.9 billion, by French glassmaker Saint-Gobain, a surprising
rescue of the Massachusetts abrasives maker from hostile
suitor BTR of Britain. BTR, which offered $75 a share, ended
its proxy fight against Norton and said it wouldn't top
Saint-Gobain's bid. Norton's stock surged $13.50, to $88.75.

   Mesa L.P. Plans
   To Omit Payout
   On Preferred Units

   DALLAS -- Mesa Limited Partnership, citing continued
disappointing prices for natural gas and cash-flow problems,
said it will omit its preferred distribution payment of $1.50
a unit starting in the second quarter.
   The natural gas producer, led by partner T. Boone Pickens
Jr., said it will suspend payment on its preferred units
after its May 15 distribution until "natural gas prices go
up." The company has promised the payment of five more
quarterly distributions and said those will accumulate until
it has the cash flow to reinstate the distribution, a Mesa
spokesman said. Mesa, which eliminated its common
distribution last quarter, said the latest move will save it
about $33 million a quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mesa has been burdened for some time by a heavy debt load,
which stood at $1.52 billion at Dec. 31, and disappointing
prices for its natural gas. But because its common and
preferred units' prices tend to trade based on their
distributions, Mr. Pickens has been insistent about retaining
the payouts even when the company's cash flow didn't justify
it. In recent years, he has taken on additional debt, sold
assets and relied on gains on securities transactions to make
more than $1 billion in distributions.
   After trading as high as $12.125 last year, Mesa's
preferred closed at $5.875, down 12.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Its common units,
which had traded as high as $12, closed at $5.25, down 12.5
cents.
   Earlier this month, Mesa dropped its effort to sell
interests in its prime Hugoton Field properties for as much
as $400 million, citing poor market conditions. Those
proceeds were to be used to reduce its debt.
   In the first quarter, the company's interest costs were
$46.4 million, or nearly half of Mesa's $96.5 million in
first-quarter revenue. Meanwhile, its cash from operations
for the quarter was about $31 million, down 27% from $42.7
million in the yearearlier period. Mesa reported a net loss
for the quarter of $18.2 million, or 30 cents a common unit,
and said it will continue to report losses until gas prices
rise.
   In the comparable 1989 period, Mesa had net income of
$14.6 million, or 15 cents a unit, on revenue of $105
million. The year-ago quarter included $43.9 million in
interest expense and $41.9 million in gains from securities
transactions, most from profits on takeover trading.
Securities gains during the latest quarter were only $3.8
million.
   Mr. Pickens said that the company decided to suspend the
preferred distribution because "the warmest weather in 30
years" offered "no significant improvement in prices this
past winter."

   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Measurex Corp., citing a decline in
sales, said fiscal second-quarter earnings will be about 60%
lower than a year ago; the company said it is trimming
expenses to bolster earnings.
   The maker of computer-integrated manufacturing systems had
net income of $10.2 million, or 54 cents a share, on revenue
of $72 million, in the 1989 second quarter. The current
second quarter ends June 3.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,
Measurex closed at $20.50, down $1.625.
   Measurex said last month that it expected results to be
down in the quarter, but in a statement yesterday, the
company indicated that the results would be "lower than
anticipated."
   The anticipated drop in revenue and earnings is due to
lower system sales and reduced gross margin percentages
related to lower volume and one-time costs for consolidating
certain operations, the company said. Even though
first-quarter European orders were at a record level, the
company said its delivery lead times were longer than
expected for many of its large, integrated measurement and
control systems.

   ERIE, Pa. -- General Electric Co. expects "another good

meeting. But he added that "the first year of the decade will
be the toughest one in the past eight, as several of our
businesses contend with a softening U.S. economy."
   He said results this year will be aided by "especially
powerful performances from aircraft engines, power

   Although most of the meeting was dominated by discussion
of a resolution asking the company to justify to shareholders
its continued production of nuclear materials for the defense
industry, the resolution was opposed by almost 94% of votes
cast. GE operates facilities for the Energy Department that
make nuclear material for weapons systems.
   Mr. Welch said the nuclear material business meets the
nation's defense requirements. A strong defense policy has
brought about the recent changes, and business opportunities,
in Eastern Europe, he said.
   GE also announced major contracts.
   Arrendadora International of Mexico, a leasing company,
ordered 100 GE locomotives, which will be leased to Mexico's
national railroad. Mr. Welch called the $168 million order
GE's largest export locomotive order in recent years. Fifty
units will be delivered late this year and the balance in
early 1991.
   GE's environmental systems business received a $60 million
contract to supply emission-control systems for Texas
Utilities Electric Co. The units are scheduled for commercial
operation in 1995 and 1996.

   Network Equipment Technologies Sees
   Tough Time Ahead After Sales Snafus

   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Network Equipment Technologies
Inc., troubled by a breakdown in documenting orders and
shipments, said it expects to operate at a loss or break-even
point for the near term.
   The communications network designer said an internal
investigation showed that its policies on orders and
shipments were not being followed. A spokesman said that
controls broke down in its eastern region, one of the
company's four, and that the problems were limited to that
region.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Network said $519,000 in invalid orders occurred in the
fiscal second quarter and that an additional $5.4 million of
invalid orders occurred in the third quarter, although a
subsequent audit confirmed $2.4 million of the third-quarter
orders.
   The news sent Network's stock reeling. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, its shares closed down $6.875, or
nearly 50%, to $9.25, on heavy volume of 1.5 million shares.
Network's stock had been moving steadily higher over the past
year, rising from $18 a share in 1988 to a recent high of
$34.375 shortly before its reverses.
   "Procedures and the system were in place. They just
weren't followed," the company spokesman said. In a
statement, Network said a committee of outside directors was
now studying the problem, and that the company also was
attempting to confirm orders in the pipeline and backlogs.
The invalid shipments, the company added, prompted a
restatement of its fiscal second and third quarters ended
Oct. 1 and Dec. 31.
   Analysts weren't entirely surprised by the news. Earlier
this month, the company hinted that it was investigating
invalid shipments. But with the company's full disclosure
yesterday, analysts said a host of nettlesome questions have
been raised.
   "The concerns are backlog and how much of it is going to
be missing when their review is complete," said Cecilia
Brancato, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Ms. Brancato also
said questions involve internal controls at the company and
underlying demand for its products.
   As a result of the sales irregularities, Network said it
restated its results for the fiscal second and third
quarters. A $519,000 reversal in revenue because of an
invalid order depressed second-quarter net to $4.9 million,
or 34 cents a share, on revenue of $47.2 million, compared
with the previously reported $5.1 million, or 36 cents a
share, on revenue of $47.5 million.
   In the third quarter, invalid orders resulted in restated
results of $3.1 million, or 21 cents a share, on revenue of
$46.7 million, down from the previously reported $5.6
million, or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $52 million.
   This represents the latest setback for the company. Until
recently, Network was touted as one of the hottest players in
a burgeoning industry that produces affordable networks of
computers and phones. But last week, in an embarrassing
retreat, the company said results for the fiscal fourth
quarter ended March 31 would be worse than a pessimistic
projection it made just two weeks ago.
   For the quarter, net plunged nearly 87% to $611,000, or
four cents a share, from $4.6 million, or 33 cents a share.
Revenue in the quarter increased almost 18% to $45.7 million
from $38.8 million.
   Separately, Network said it was sued in federal court in
San Francisco by a group of shareholders who bought the
company's stock between November 1988 and this month. The
suit alleges securities law violations, among other things.
The company said it intends to contest the charges.

   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said that Craig Fields, who was
ousted recently as head of the Defense Advanced Projects
Agency (Darpa) in a battle over industrial policy, has
decided to accept a transfer to another Pentagon job.
   But a colleague said that the Pentagon technologist
planned to take the new job only temporarily while lining up
work in private industry. Mr. Fields declined to comment.

   A Pentagon spokesman said that Mr. Fields would start May
7 as deputy director of defense research and engineering,
with responsibility for streamlining the Pentagon's
laboratories. Victor Reis, Darpa's deputy director, will
succeed Mr. Fields as acting administrator.
   Mr. Fields was pressured into accepting the transfer,
widely viewed as a demotion, Pentagon and congressional
officials said, because he had pushed the government to
aggressively invest in companies pursuing commercial
technology.
   On Tuesday, a group of 11 lawmakers, including House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, called for Mr. Fields's
reinstatement, arguing that he is one of the government's
most successful technology leaders. But a colleague of Mr.
Fields said that the Pentagon technologist doubted the
Defense Department would reverse its decision.
   Last Friday, the Pentagon delivered an ultimatum to Mr.
Fields to resign, accept the transfer or be fired.

   The company said the fuel should be available in more than

   Exxon is following major rival Shell Oil Co., which

several smaller refiners.
   While Exxon said it will sell its new gasoline in both
premium and midgrade unleaded, it shunned the "cleaner"
formulation for the most popular and least costly grade,
regular unleaded. Shell's new fuel is available only in its
most expensive and most profitable octane grade, its premium
unleaded.
   The new gasolines are lower in volatility and specifically
targeted to reduce hydrocarbon emissions in the summer when
ozone problems are most severe.

   LOS ANGELES -- Teledyne Inc.'s board elected William P.
Rutledge president and a director of the newly streamlined
aerospace and manufacturing company. He succeeds George A.
Roberts, 71 years old, who was elected vice chairman and
remains chief executive officer.
   Mr. Rutledge, 48, had served as executive vice president
and his appointment to Teledyne's board expands it to seven
members. Mr. Rutledge and Hudson B. Drake, 55, senior vice
president overseeing Teledyne's aviation, electronics and
international operations, had been considered prime
contenders for the president's post.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also, Douglas Grant, controller, was named treasurer and
chief financial officer. Mr. Grant, 39, succeeds Gordon Bean,
who was named vice president in charge of the company's
metals operations. Gary Riley, a group executive, 53, was
named vice president in charge of manufacturing.
   Henry Singleton, Teledyne's chairman, announced at last
year's annual meeting his decision to step down from
day-to-day management of the multi-industry company he
founded three decades ago.
   Teledyne recently completed the spinoff of its insurance
and finance subsidiaries into a new publicly traded company,
Unitrin Inc. Teledyne also declared a 5-for-1 stock split,
boosting the number of common shares outstanding to 55.4
million.
   Those moves have prompted speculation by analysts and
investors that Mr. Singleton, 73, may have plans to sell his
13.1% stake in the company, sell major portions of the
company or take other major steps. In an interview, Mr.
Singleton and Mr. Roberts said they don't have any plans to
sell major assets, or cash in on Teledyne's substantial real
estate holdings.
   Nor do they plan a big stock buy-back, another scenario
envisioned by analysts. Mr. Singleton said the company wants
to let the stock adjust to the spinoff and stock split before
evaluating any such move. Teledyne's stock closed yesterday
at $28 a share, down 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
   Mr. Singleton and Mr. Roberts don't usually discuss plans,
but the company was careful to introduce several senior
executives at the annual meeting. Lawrence M. Harris, an
aerospace analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, said
it was meant to show Teledyne has managers capable of running
the company when the chairman and vice chairman step aside.
   The board also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 20
cents a share, payable May 22 to stock of record May 7. The
dividend reflects the 5-for-1 stock split.

   The test kits will be used by blood banks. Because only 17

they are required to do for the more common AIDS strain,
HIV-1.

   Safeway Underwriters Slash Price
   Of 10% Stake Being Sold to Public

   NEW YORK -- Underwriters for Safeway Inc., one of the
crown jewels in the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. empire,
slashed the price of a 10% stake that the supermarket giant
is offering to the public.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., the
underwriters, late yesterday priced the offering at $11.25 a
share, 22% below the midpoint of the recently estimated price
range.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The underwriters previously were forecasting that the
Safeway shares would fetch $13 to $16 apiece. The offering
totals 10 million shares.
   Trading in the shares is expected to begin today on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SWY. A spokesman for
one of the underwriters wouldn't comment on the price
reduction.
   Safeway, an Oakland, Calif., supermarket chain, was taken
private by a KKR-sponsored corporation in 1986. Since then,
Safeway has reduced debt and considerably improved its
operating profit margins.
   Underwriters had pitched Safeway on the basis of its
rising cash flow. But potential investors apparently have
balked at valuing Safeway only on the basis of cash flow, as
distinct from earnings.
   Several said the initial price range was steep, given that
Safeway's 1990 net income has been forecast at 40 cents a
share. For 1991, net has been forecast at 85 cents a share.
(As of February, Safeway's holdings included 13.6 million
shares of Vons Cos. common stock.)
   Investors also cited the fact that, over the next five
years, cash from operations will be plowed into building
stores and remodeling old ones -- and not into reducing
Safeway's $3.1 billion in debt.
   This past summer, Safeway had envisioned a bigger offering
priced at perhaps $20 a share. However, the crash in
junk-bond prices in September and investors' disenchantment
with leveraged stocks reduced the market's appetite.
   Neither KKR nor any members of Safeway's management are
selling stock in the offering. KKR is an investment firm with
offices in New York and San Francisco.
   Since the buy-out, Safeway has sold inefficient operations
and remodeled or built from scratch more than 100 stores.
Labor costs have been cut, and warehouse and buying practices
have been computerized.
   Almost half of Safeway's 1,100 stores are so-called
superstores, with 45,000 items ranging from frozen yogurt to
pizza. Profit margins on specialty items such as Chinese
foods -- an increasingly important part of the business --
are especially high.
   Safeway's operating profit as a percentage of sales
climbed to 3.2% in 1989 from 2.3% in 1986. Sales last year
were $14.32 billion.
   Analysts generally think that more stock in Safeway may be
offered in future years, perhaps to finance acquisitions, and
to enable KKR and affiliated investors to reduce their stake.
   KKR was thought to be eager to have the current offering
come to market in order to establish a track record in the
public market for Safeway shares.

   LOS ANGELES -- A new study estimates the total market
value of bankrupt and distressed securities was about $200
billion at the end of January.
   Of that amount, about $13 billion was publicly traded,
according to a survey of 56 mostly private vulture funds by
Edward I. Altman, finance professor at New York University's
Stern School of Business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results of the survey, sponsored by Foothill Group, a
Los Angeles financial-services firm, were released at an
investment conference here. Foothill manages about $130
million of distressed securities in two private limited
partnerships.
   All together, the investment firms included in the survey
manage about $5 billion of distressed securities. They target
about a 30% total return, Prof. Altman said in an interview.
   Whereas junk-bond buyers primarily look for high yields,
"the distressed-securities investor is primarily interested
in the upside price potential," he said.
   Although the distressed securities in the survey had a
market value of $200 billion, Prof. Altman put their par
value at about $300 billion.

   NEW YORK -- Less than a year after resuming operations in
the municipal bond business, L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. has halted
trading in the market and may consider leaving the tax-exempt
sector altogether.
   Joel Miller, the firm's chief executive officer, said
Rothschild has reduced its trading positions "to the bare
bone" and will decide within two weeks whether to exit the
business permanently.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The markets have been sloppy. It has not been
profitable," said Mr. Miller. He said the firm's decision to
leave the municipal bond market is unrelated to the financial
woes of holding company L.F. Rothschild Holdings or of its
owner, Franklin Savings Association.
   Last November, the broker-dealer re-established its
presence in the securities industry, resuming municipal
operations and dealings in investment banking, mergers and
acquisition and retail brokerage.
   The firm had halted those operations in late 1987 after
Rothschild Holdings fell victim to huge losses as a result of
the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Last July, Rothschild Holdings filed for bankruptcy-court
protection. Since then, Franklin Savings has been seized by
the federal government. The unit L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. wasn't
included in the holding company's Chapter 11 filing.

   America's Own Fixed-Exchange Model

   When the major industrialized countries ended the fixed
exchange-rate system 16 years ago, they saw their decision as
a triumph for the free market: No longer would exchange rates
be set by governments and be subject to the vagaries of
political developments. No longer could speculators get rich
by anticipating, or even precipitating, exchange-rate
adjustments. No longer could fiscally irresponsible economies
export their inflation.
   But the costs of floating exchange rates have been far
greater than expected. Trade imbalances have generally
widened since 1974. The advantage of independent monetary
policy to countries has been small; there is a growing
consensus that stable and predictable policy rules are best.
For example, the G-7, the group of the West's and Asia's
seven most industrialized countries, has met several times
over the past five years to coordinate policy. Exchange-rate
volatility has been large and costly to international trade.
It is time to consider the return to a fixed-exchange rate
system. There is even a model for such a system -- the
monetary coordination of the various districts of the Federal
Reserve in the U.S. today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Those who argue that fixed exchange rates cannot work
assume, at least implicitly, that currency is essentially no
different from other goods. Since exchange rates are the
relative prices of currencies and since standard price theory
demonstrates that it is impossible to fix the relative prices
of goods in the long run, skeptics argue that a fixed
exchange rate system is not feasible.
   But the conventional argument does not apply to exchange
rates because today's currencies are fiat currencies: They
are intrinsically worthless pieces of paper that are
virtually costless to produce. This means that a government
can always avoid depleting the buffer stock of its currency
simply by printing more. Therefore, fixing exchange rates is
feasible, and any rate will work. That fixed exchange rates
are theoretically feasible, however, does not mean they are
politically acceptable. Under fixed rates, the country with
the fastest growing money supply gets the most seigniorage
(revenue) from money creation. More important, some of this
seigniorage is collected from residents of other countries
because, with fixed exchange rates, the inflation caused by
one country's money growth is experienced by all countries.
This outcome is bound to be politically unacceptable to other
countries. A country can prevent another from exporting
inflation by letting its own exchange rate appreciate. As a
result, countries will not adhere to fixed rates unless they
are willing to coordinate their monetary policies.
   The policy coordination necessary for fixed exchange
rates, however, is not that all countries agree to have their
money supplies grow at roughly the same rate. Even if these
money growth rates were the same and other economic
fundamentals unchanged, recent research shows that exchange
rates can fluctuate simply because people think they will.
   The policy coordination required to fix exchange rates has
two components:
   -- Each country must agree to swap its currency for
another's at the fixed rate in any amount and at any time.
   -- Countries must agree on the total growth of money and
how the resulting seigniorage will be distributed among them.
   Central banks would have no problem meeting the first
component. If a central bank temporarily ran out of a foreign
currency, it could always swap its own currency for the other
with the appropriate foreign central bank. This arrangement
prevents exchange rates from fluctuating because of
speculation, since it guarantees that any amount of a
currency demanded will always be supplied at the fixed price.
And if countries meet the second component, they will have no
incentive to overissue their moneys.
   The Bretton Woods system is usually cited as evidence of
the fragility of fixed exchange-rate systems. But Bretton
Woods is not really a test of whether a fixed exchange-rate
system will work. A fixed-rate system requires that policy
coordination include an agreement among countries about the
amount of seigniorage and its distribution. This component of
policy coordination was missing from the Bretton Woods
system, which attempted to fix exchange rates while allowing
each country some control of its own seigniorage.
   A proper test of whether fixed exchange rates are feasible
needs evidence from a system with the two required components
of policy coordination in place. Such a system exists, and it
is running smoothly -- the monetary system of the U.S.
   To many, the notion that the U.S. has a fixed
exchange-rate system may come as a surprise. The notes issued
by the Federal Reserve System look like and are used as a
single currency. Each note is printed in black and green ink,
each has "The United States of America" inscribed on front
and back, and each says it is a "Federal Reserve Note" and
"legal tender for all debts, public and private."
Furthermore, the notes exchange at par: a $20 bill swaps
one-for-one with any other $20 bill, one-for-two with any $10
bills, and so forth.
   In what sense, then, does the U.S. have something other
than a single currency? A closer look reveals that, in fact,
each of the 12 district banks in the Federal Reserve System
issues its own notes. Each note is identified by its district
bank in four ways: First, on the front left is a circle with
the district bank's name written around the inside. Second,
in the middle of that circle is a bold, black letter
representing the Federal Reserve district of origin -- A for
the first district, B for the second and so forth. Third, the
letter symbol is the first character of the serial number.
Fourth, the district's number is printed on the front four
times.
   Granted, these differences among Federal Reserve notes are
much less distinct than those between, say, U.S. and Italian
currencies. Nevertheless, in a physical sense, U.S. currency
is not strictly uniform. The importance of these physical
differences is that they represent the possibility that the
U.S. could choose to have a floating exchange rate system
among the currencies of the 12 Federal Reserve districts.
Instead, the U.S. has chosen a system of fixed exchange
rates.
   That the U.S. has had no trouble maintaining its fixed
exchange rate system demonstrates that such a system is
feasible. Despite changes in economic fundamentals among
Federal Reserve districts, the U.S. has not been forced to
adjust the exchange rates between district currencies. This
is not what the skeptics of fixed rates claim would happen.
What if the Ninth District economy were declining while the
other district economies were expanding? Or what if the Ninth
District were running a trade deficit with the rest of the
country? Then, skeptics claim, there should be some downward
pressure on Ninth District currency. This, of course has
never happened, nor is it likely.
   The reason the U.S. system of fixed exchange rates works
is that it has the two required components of monetary policy
coordination: First, the district Federal Reserve banks have
an agreement to swap their currencies for any other
district's at the fixed rate in any amount and at any time.
Because of this agreement, it's unlikely that many people
have ever lost sleep over the exchange value of their
district's notes relative to another's.
   Second, district Fed banks also have an agreement on how
to set the rate of money growth and how to distribute the
resulting seigniorage. Each district bank participates in the
policy process (at Federal Open Market Committee meetings),
and a unified policy action is carried out for all 12
districts. No individual district bank can pursue its own
monetary policy. Furthermore, all seigniorage is pooled and
disbursed by the U.S. Treasury. By design, no district bank
can gain by issuing more of its notes than another. Even if
all notes were issued by, say, the Ninth District, the
revenue would still be pooled and disbursed by the Treasury.
   This example of the U.S. monetary system shows that when
the two required components of policy coordination are met, a
fixed exchange rate system is feasible.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Helmsley Appeal Says She Overpaid Taxes

   Attorneys for Leona Helmsley said the hotel queen should
have been acquitted of tax-evasion charges last year because
she actually overpaid her taxes.
   In December, Mrs. Helmsley was sentenced to four years in
prison and fined $7.2 million after being convicted of
evading $1.2 million in taxes in 1983-85. Currently free on
bail pending her appeal, Mrs. Helmsley also is on trial in
New York state court for alleged state tax violations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The appellate brief maintains that before Mrs. Helmsley
could be convicted of evading taxes, prosecutors had to prove
that she actually owed taxes for those three years. The brief
was filed with a federal appeals court in New York by a team
of defense attorneys led by Harvard Law School Professor Alan
Dershowitz.
   "The defense introduced unrebutted testimony clearly
establishing that the Helmsleys' joint federal income tax
returns for each of those years overstated their joint
taxable income and tax," the brief said. Mrs. Helmsley's
husband, real-estate magnate Harry Helmsley, was initially
charged in the case but later was dropped as a defendant
after the trial judge found him mentally unfit to stand
trial.
   The brief accuses the government of being overzealous in
its pursuit of the case. "The government should not have been
`surprised' by the fact that a re-examination and
recalculation resulted in the Helmsleys having actually
overpaid their taxes during these years," the brief said.
   The attorneys said Mrs. Helmsley was charged with evading
only 3% of the total taxes that the U.S. said she owed for
those three years. Prosecutors should have expected that a
review of the tax returns could have turned up enough new
information to offset the relatively small amount that
allegedly was evaded, the brief said.
   The recalculation involves mistakes that Mrs. Helmsley's
attorneys say were made regarding the depreciation of certain
property.
   Mrs. Helmsley's attorneys claim she overpaid taxes by
$21,000 to $477,000 annually during the three years. Similar
claims were made during the trial but were rejected by Judge
John Walker.

   TEXAS JUDGE sets aside $39.4 million verdict against
nursing home.
   State District Judge Scott A. Brister said plaintiffs'
attorneys violated Texas procedures and his instructions in
winning the jury verdict, believed to be one of the largest
ever in a nursing home case. Concluding that the attorneys'
actions prevented the defendant from getting a fair hearing,
Judge Brister declared a mistrial and ordered a new trial.
   The verdict, issued March 22, awarded damages to the
family of an 84-year-old woman strangled by a restraining
device in the nursing home, Seven Acres Jewish Geriatric
Center. The woman, Jennie Zetterbaum, died in 1984 after
being placed in a vest-like apparatus used to keep patients
in their beds. She was found suspended on the side of her bed
with the restraint wrapped under her arms and neck.
   The lawsuit, tried on the plaintiffs' side by Houston
attorneys Anthony Montgomery and Tom Hornbuckle, alleged
Seven Acres negligently violated state and federal nursing
home regulations, and tried to conceal evidence.
   In overturning the verdict, Judge Brister said he wasn't
expressing any opinion on the jury's verdict, adding that he
had "no reason to doubt" it was carefully considered. But
overlooking the misconduct of plaintiffs' attorneys would
"invite attorneys in other cases to ignore the court's rules
and rulings whenever it might benefit their case," he said.
   Judge Brister didn't specify what the plaintiffs'
attorneys had done wrong. But counsel for the nursing home,
Richard L. Reedy of Kain &amp; Reedy in Houston, asserted they
had made misstatements of fact and had ignored the judge's
pre-trial order not to introduce certain evidence -- aimed at
supporting allegations of a coverup, for example. "We hope
when the case is retried, the plaintiffs' lawyers will behave
themselves," he said.
   Messrs. Montgomery and Hornbuckle didn't return telephone
calls.

   FALSE-AD CLAIMS about home ice-cream maker melt in court.
   A federal judge in Manhattan dismissed a false-advertising
lawsuit brought by home ice-cream maker giant Nikkal
Industries Inc. against Salton Inc., one of its newer
competitors. The judge said that even though some of Salton's
marketing could be potentially misleading, the company didn't
use deceptive advertising to promote its product.
   A main issue in the case was the ice cream's
"scoopability," referring to whether dessert made in the
non-electric ice-cream makers is firm enough to be scooped
onto a cone. But after hearing from two professors who served
as expert witnesses -- including one who had developed a
"scoopability" standard -- Judge Charles Tenney said the
disputed characteristic is too subjective to measure.
   Judge Tenney also said it is unlikely customers were
misled by pictures of sculptured mashed potatoes made to look
like scoops of ice cream in Salton's advertisements. The ads
-- which were directed at buyers for retail stores, rather
the general public -- used mashed potatoes in the pictures
because ice cream would melt under the lights.
   Judge Tenney rejected Nikkal's claims that the Salton ads
caused the company to lose millions of dollars in sales.
Instead, Nikkal itself was partly to blame, the judge said.
   "Nikkal's own marketing strategy played the predominant
role in the decline of sales. . . . Despite the increased
competition from companies such as Salton, Nikkal pursued a
strategy that didn't adequately meet the challenge of the
increasingly crowded market," Judge Tenney said in his
opinion. For instance, the judge said, Nikkal ignored its
sales staff's recommendations that it lower prices.
   Officials of Nikkal, based in Virginia Beach, Va., and
company attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.
   Until 1986, when Salton introduced its Big Chill line,
Nikkal was virtually the only distributor of this type of
compact ice-cream maker. The judge said the main purpose of
Nikkal's lawsuit was to prevent Salton from being able to
compete.
   Salton's ice-cream-maker business is now owned by closely
held Sevco Inc. of Deerfield, Ill.

   EX-XEROX COUNSEL leaves post at Latham &amp; Watkins.
   After just 14 months, Robert S. Banks has left his job as
counsel at the New York office of Latham &amp; Watkins, a Los
Angeles law firm with more than 500 lawyers. He has agreed to
serve as outside general counsel of Keystone Holdings Inc., a
company controlled by Texas financier Robert M. Bass.
Keystone's principal asset is American Savings Bank of
Stockton, Calif., a Latham client.
   Mr. Banks, long regarded in legal circles as the chief
architect of the modern corporate law department, surprised
many when he left his post as general counsel of Xerox Corp.
to join Latham. There, he worked primarily as a consultant
for in-house general counsel seeking ways to cut costs and
deal more effectively with outside law firms.
   The unusual arrangement resulted in some
conflict-of-interest problems with other clients at the firm
and difficulties in promoting the new service, said Clinton
R. Stevenson, the former managing partner of Latham who
worked with Mr. Banks on the project.
   "If we had been separate from the law firm it would not
have been as difficult to solve the problems. But I had no
desire to be separate from the law firm," said Mr. Stevenson.
   Mr. Banks said there was also some tension about his
message that companies can sharply cut their outside legal
bills. "It's very difficult to provide the kinds of services
that I want to provide within the framework of a law firm.
I'm still not looked on warmly by partners at law firms," Mr.
Banks said.
   Mr. Banks said he will divide his time between California
and New Canaan, Conn., where he has set up an office. He said
he hopes to help cut American Savings's litigation and
outside legal costs.

   Wang Labs Electronic-Image Aide Quits
   In Blow to Fast-Growing Sector of Firm

   The head of marketing for Wang Laboratories Inc.'s
electronic image business left for a smaller firm, in a blow
to Wang's efforts to find renewed growth in its technology
for the paperless office.
   Analysts estimate that the image business probably
contributes less than 5% of Wang's revenue, which amounted to
$2.87 billion last year, but it has been growing rapidly and
Wang's technology is widely praised. The image business, a
step toward the paperless office, involves scanning and
electronically storing business documents so they can be
recalled, copied and passed around without struggling with
file drawers and paper copies.

   David McWhorter, director of world-wide imaging for Wang,
left to become vice president sales and marketing for Image
Business Systems Corp., a small New York-based imaging
company.
   The defection, which follows the departure of several
other executives in the department, comes at a bad time for
Wang, which expects to announce its fifth consecutive
quarterly loss tomorrow.
   A spokesman for Wang, based in Lowell, Mass., said that
Mr. McWhorter's departure won't affect the company's
marketing, because image-product marketing has been turned
over to Wang marketing groups that sell all types of
equipment to certain customer segments.
   Nevertheless, consultants who follow the industry were
surprised. "It's a loss for Wang," said Scott McCready, who
follows the industry for International Data Corp., a market
researcher in Framingham, Mass. "Very few people in the
industry know anything about image. McWhorter could get
customers and sales people excited."
   Mr. McCready estimated that the U.S. electronic image
industry grew 68% last year to $525 million from $312
million, and he said he expects to see 50% annual growth "for
the foreseeable future."
   At a time when Wang's traditional word processor and
minicomputer businesses are collapsing because of competition
from personal computers, executives have counted on the image
business to spur new-equipment sales.
   Late last year, Wang lost another leader of its imaging
effort with the resignation of Roger Sullivan, program
manager for Wang Integrated Image Systems. He became a
consultant with industry researcher BIS CAP International
Inc., Norwell, Mass., and recently was named president of the
Association for Information and Image Management, the
industry's major trade group, as well.
   Mr. Sullivan said that Mr. McWhorter's departure shows
"the technoids are winning," at Wang. He said that the image
group "is concentrating more and more on the technical side
of the house," while ignoring the "people who have gotten out
on the street and talked to {customers} about their strategic
business needs."
   The Wang spokesman said that salespeople who consistently
deal with the same sets of customers, in market segments like
banking and government, now sell the image products.
   Mr. McWhorter said that his move to Image Business
Systems, which expects $12 million in sales this year, is "an
opportunity to work at the grass-roots level, which I enjoy."
He added that "Wang's infrastructure should allow them to do
well."
   Wang is one of the leaders in the image industry. BIS CAP
International said that it has counted 570 image
installations in the U.S. Of the total, Wang supplied 220;
FileNet Corp., San Diego, supplied 180; and International
Business Machines Corp. supplied 25. Since IBM's systems tend
to be larger and more expensive, its revenue share may be
close to the other two leaders, a spokeswoman said.
   Despite its early lead in the market, Wang is having
trouble because customers worry about its financial outlook
and ability to survive.
   Wang has been cutting costs and selling off some assets to
reduce debt, but weak sales have made a turnaround slower
than expected.
   Wang Class B stock closed yesterday at $4.875, unchanged,
in American Stock Exchange composite trading.

   STOCKHOLM -- Svenska Cellulosa AB called off its pursuit
of West Germany's Feldmuehle Nobel AG -- but another big
Swedish pulp and paper maker, Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB,
quickly took up the chase.
   Separately, Veba AG said it's in negotiations with Stora
and other parties to break the deadlock over control of
Feldmuehle, and hinted that it may sell its 50.01% stake if
it can't consolidate its control at a price it considers
reasonable. Veba is "open to . . . solutions," a company
spokesman said, "as long as they are in the interest of
{Feldmuehle}."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   SCA yesterday said it sold its 5% Feldmuehle stake,
acquired last month, for 500 million Swedish kronor ($81.5
million) to 600 million kronor. The Swedish forestry giant
bought the stake to increase its bargaining power with the
West German paper, chemicals and engineering group, and
claimed its proposals for cooperation -- and perhaps even a
merger or acquisition -- had the support of shareholders
owning another 20% of Feldmuehle.
   But the Swedish concern said yesterday that its proposals
were rebuffed.
   Stora, Sweden's biggest pulp and paper group, disclosed a
few hours later that it is in talks with Feldmuehle. The
company declined further comment, but it and Feldmuehle have
a track record of cooperation, and currently operate joint
newsprint and pulp-making ventures.
   Veba's comments indicate the West German chemicals and
energy concern may be willing to abandon its quest for
Feldmuehle, ending a two-year board-room drama that marked
West Germany's first big hostile takeover bid.
   Despite its majority stake, Veba hasn't been able to gain
control of Feldmuehle because of that company's 5% voting
restriction on shareholders, regardless of the size of their
stake. This has led to a deadlock over control between Veba
and Feldmuehle's second-biggest shareholder, an investment
group led by U.S. brokerage firm Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which
is thought to hold more than a fifth of Feldmuehle's shares.
   The Merrill Lynch group repeatedly has offered to sell its
shares to Veba for around 600 West German marks apiece
($353.22), a price Veba has rebuffed as too expensive. Veba
acquired its Feldmuehle shares for around 400 marks apiece.
   If Veba does abandon its quest, it could open the way for
Stora, which, like SCA, is scrambling to expand in the
European Community ahead of the EC's 1992 single-market plan.
Both companies have snapped up European acquisitions to
bolster market shares and strengthen distribution networks.

   Your March 26 article on Marvin B. Roffman, the former
Janney Montgomery Scott analyst who, as you reported, was
fired because of his refusal to apologize for his negative
comments on the Taj Mahal casino project, should send a real
chill throughout the investment community.
   An analyst's role is to develop and provide an informed,
objective opinion regarding the future of a company or an
industry and make some determination about the value of the
securities of those entities. The analyst is an arbiter of
values between the issuers and the investors. He is required
to gather and sift through all types of information from
sources each with their own biases. Out of that mosaic,
looking into the future, the analyst then must put forth
predictions. Ultimately, job security, or at least
compensation, is determined by the accuracy of those
predictions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Apparently, Mr. Roffman sustained what can be a rather
demanding career for 16 years, only to be ousted for doing
his job -- offering an opinion. I could understand firing Mr.
Roffman next February, after the cold winds had blown and he
proved to be wrong. That is a risk all analysts run. But if,
as you reported, he was fired for putting forth an opinion,
that decision brings into question the opinions of any
analyst at Janney Montgomery and, unfortunately, the opinions
of all analysts. If an analyst's job is at risk for something
other than fraud, faulty analysis or uninformed opinion then
there is limited credibility and value to the role. Once the
partisans can influence the process because of their own
fears and greed, investors -- big and small -- will suffer.

   Mr. Roffman's statement about Donald Trump's Taj Mahal
casino won't make or break that casino. I imagine Mr. Trump
has heard negative remarks worse than this before and
laughed. It now appears he can't take the heat. Does one man,
because of his money, have the right to dictate what should
be said about him?
   Mr. Trump should believe in what he is creating and not
let Mr. Roffman's statement bother him. Or does Mr. Roffman's
statement make sense? Does he know the market better than Mr.
Trump?
   It was a low cut on Mr. Trump's part, to have this man
fired. Come on, Mr. Trump, grow up.

   Janney Montgomery Scott did not hire Mr. Roffman as a
public servant, to act as an outspoken watchdog of (in this
case) the casino industry, but rather to provide objective
analysis, positive and negative, solely for the firm and its
clients. Nor did it hire Mr. Roffman in order to provide an
independent public forum for his views. He was fired for
writing a direct, unauthorized letter to Mr. Trump, for
publicly denigrating a potential client's business, and for
disregarding the explicit obligations to his employer. Janney
Montgomery asked for and received this analyst's views, and
paid for these opinions. As such, Mr. Roffman's analyses were
proprietary, and his employer was under no obligation to
release them publicly.
   Mr. Roffman may believe that he can find a similar job in
Philadelphia or elsewhere and use that position to air his
views publicly and at will, but any brokerage or research
firm would be hard pressed to share that belief at the
expense of its reputation and its clients.

   I congratulate securities analyst Roffman for refusing to
compromise his professional ethics at the demand of Donald
Trump.
   Janney Montgomery certainly won't be staggered by my
personal censure for its firing of Mr. Roffman. It might,
however, become concerned if a few thousand other investors
boycotted the firm in protest. It might wish it had stood
firm in the face of the mighty wrath of Mr. Trump.

   The morality play of Janney Montgomery vs. Donald Trump
offers, in addition to the usual lessons of the arrogance of
power on one side and moral cowardice on the other, two
prosaic ones. One is that any analyst considering issuing a
negative report on a company also had better update his
resume. The other is that investors can expect stock analyses
to be worth even less than they are now.

   Regarding the actions of Janney Montgomery Scott's
chairman, Edgar Scott, I can only question the value of a
firm's investment recommendations when those recommendations
are based on fiat and political expediency rather than
competently performed research and competently reached
opinions.
   I thank Mr. Roffman for standing behind his words and wish
him the best of luck in his work ahead.

   TORONTO -- The Canadian subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group reported a 46% drop in net income for the first quarter
from a year earlier.
   Shell Canada Ltd. reported net of 63 million Canadian
dollars (US$54.3 million) or 56 Canadian cents a share on
revenue of C$1.24 billion. In the first quarter of 1989, the
oil, gas and chemicals concern reported net of C$117 million
or C$1.04 a share, on revenue of C$1.22 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bulk of the decline came from substantially reduced
earnings in Calgary-based Shell's chemical and downstream, or
refined, oil retailing divisions, the company said. Although
the company reported slightly increased earnings from its oil
and gas production division, it wasn't enough to offset the
declines in other sectors.
   John MacLeod, president and chief executive of Shell
Canada, said the company expects lower earnings throughout
1990 compared with last year. But he said, "we don't expect
to see the same degree of decline as we saw in the first
quarter of 1990."
   He declined to give a specific earnings estimate for the
year.
   Mr. MacLeod said Shell is taking steps to improve earnings
at the downstream oil products and retailing division. Among
the options the company is considering as part of a
restructuring are sales of some of the company's downstream
assets, including retail gas stations and outlets and assets.
   Donald Taylor, executive vice-president of Shell, declined
to elaborate on the planned restructuring, saying that a
company review of the assets is scheduled to be completed
next month.
   Mr. Taylor said that the downstream assets are generating
a return of only 4%, which he hopes a restructuring would
raise to about 8%.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Shell's Class A
shares closed at C$38 a share, unchanged.

   EC Proposes Rules
   On Brokerage,
   Investment Firms

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission unveiled a
major proposal aimed at establishing a single market for
brokerage and investment services.
   The proposal, which would set minimum capital-adequacy
rules for securities firms to apply across the EC, is
considered a major step in the EC's plan to create a single
market by the end of 1992. In combination with other pending
legislation, it will allow any investment-services firm
established anywhere in the EC to do business throughout the
trading bloc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plan still has to be approved by the member states and
could face amendments and tough bargaining. But the proposal
is likely to form the basis of a final agreement.
   Early drafts of the proposal drew complaints from firms in
the U.K., including U.S. firms established there, because the
rules would force them to substantially boost capital. The
revised plan seeks to answer this complaint by allowing more
flexibilty in covering investment risk.
   German banks, meanwhile, had protested that securities
firms would have an unfair advantage because the banks would
remain subject to more rigid -- and potentially more costly
-- minimum solvency requirements the EC is imposing on banks.
West German markets are dominated by so-called universal
banks, which offer a full range of financial services from
commercial banking to insurance and brokering.
   The compromise proposal unveiled yesterday allows EC
states to make an exception for universal banks, whose
securities operations may be covered by the capital-adequacy
rules rather than by the banking solvency rules. It also
allows the banks more flexibility in raising capital to cover
securities operations.

   Dollar Slumps 2 Pfennig on Confidence
   In Bundesbank to Fight German Inflation

   NEW YORK -- Strong buying of marks on renewed confidence
in the Bundesbank's ability to control West German inflation
sent the dollar two pfennig lower against the mark.
   The U.S. unit also ended moderately lower against the yen
amid broad dollar weakness inspired by the market's bullish
stance on the mark and participants' continuing focus on
non-dollar dealings, traders said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The mark began its surge at the beginning of the European
day after the Bundesbank's 1989 annual report was released,
in which the German central bank pledged to maintain a strong
mark as a means to help contain inflation.
   The annual report, which suggested that the Bundesbank was
prepared to defend the mark either through intervention or by
raising interest rates, relaxed market anxiety about the
ramifications of monetary integration that had damped
interest in the West German currency recently, participants
said.
   Typical of the market's reaction to the annual report was
a comment by Carl Amendola, a vice president at Bayerische
Hypotheken-&amp; Wechsel-Bank AG in New York, who expressed
confidence that "any inflationary outburst will be handled in
the most efficient manner by the Bundesbank."
   The report was also seen as reassurance that the central
bank will have the last word on how the consequences of
monetary union are managed, following the West German
government's decision to apply more widely than the
Bundesbank had recommended the exchange ratio of one Deutsche
mark to one Ostmark.
   Reports shortly before the close of New York trading that
West German opposition leader Oskar Lafontaine had been
attacked and seriously wounded at a political rally had
little immediate effect on trading. Hypo-Bank's Mr. Amendola
said market participants would wait to see how West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl responds to the attack before taking
positions. Mr. Lafontaine was stabbed in the neck by a
middle-aged woman; his condition was later reported as
serious.
   Mr. Kohl's reaction is important, Mr. Amendola noted,
because Mr. Lafontaine, a leader of the West German Social
Democratic Party, had been chosen by his party to oppose Mr.
Kohl in December's election for chancellor.
   The Bundesbank news also served to fuel another day of
strong mark gains against the yen, lending added impetus to a
shift toward long mark positions in mark-yen dealings that
began Tuesday. The West German currency rose to around 94.578
yen late Wednesday in New York from 93.99 yen in late Tokyo
dealings and from 93.61 yen late Tuesday in New York.
   The perception that the Japanese currency went too far,
too fast in its recovery against the mark this past week
underlies the mark's recent gains against the yen, said
Abigail Cook, a vice president at Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corp. in New York.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6785 marks, down sharply from 1.6980 marks late Tuesday,
and at 158.75 yen, down from 158.93 yen late Tuesday.
Sterling was quoted at $1.6403, up from $1.6343 Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 158.73 yen, off from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 159.25
yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6783 marks.
   Following Wednesday's Tokyo close, the dollar slid in
European and New York dealings before finding a comfortable
trading level just above support at 158.50 yen, participants
said.
   With market attention focused elsewhere and lacking fresh
news, the dollar spent the day trading near 158.60 yen,
except for a late attempt at 159 yen that fizzled on a lack
of follow-through buying, the traders said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery fell $5.20 to $370.70 an ounce in moderate trading.
The close was the lowest since April 2. Estimated volume was
4.3 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $371.85 an
ounce.

   Appears to Win

   An investment group including Fort Worth, Texas, investor
Richard Rainwater apparently won the bidding war for control
of Penrod Drilling Co., owner and operator of one of the
world's largest and most modern fleets of offshore drilling
rigs.
   Mr. Rainwater, former investment adviser to the Bass
family of Texas, owns a 24% interest in Houston-based Energy
Service Co., which said it had joined forces with R.D. Smith
&amp; Co. to buy an additional 17.3% of Penrod's senior debt and
equity from two banking concerns for $82.7 million. The move
boosts the groups' total stake to about 68.8% of Penrod's
senior debt and equity.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ensco, a drilling and energy services concern, and R.D.
Smith, a New York brokerage and investment concern, also said
they planned to cooperate in efforts to restructure the huge
drilling company once owned by the Hunt brothers of Dallas.
   Ensco finance manager Earl McNiel said the Ensco-R.D.
Smith group planned to continue operating Penrod as an
"ongoing franchise" and that any restructuring probably
wouldn't involve substantial changes in Penrod management.
"Penrod has a very fine operating management," Mr. McNiel
said. "They're well-respected in the industry, and that's
probably one of their strongest assets."
   Mr. McNiel also said the Ensco-R.D. Smith group planned to
continue negotiations toward the purchase of 31.2% of Penrod
debt and equity still owned by a group of Hunt creditors led
by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., a unit of Manufacturers
Hanover Corp.
   The debt and equity interests involved in the most recent
transaction included a 6.9% stake formerly held by Bankers
Trust Co., a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp., which an
Ensco-affiliated limited partnership purchased for $33.1
million. Other Ensco partnerships and an R.D.
Smith-affiliated trust jointly acquired the 10.4% debt and
equity interest of Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, for $49.6
million.
   "It just seemed to make a lot of sense to join forces and
pick up these two pieces that were available," Mr. McNiel
said of the move.
   Previously, Ensco and R.D. Smith had separately been among
a large group of bidders eager to buy Penrod from the Hunt
creditors. Among the other bidders were Houston-based Rowan
Cos., an oil services concern said to have made a $325
million offer, and New York's Tisch family, reported to have
made a $450 million bid through its Loews Corp.
   According to persons close to the Penrod talks, most of
those other parties have now dropped out of the bidding. "We
sort of left it in the dust long ago," said a person involved
with one of the bids. "These prices are much too high for
us."
   But with offshore rig counts up sharply in recent months,
industry analysts seemed to agree that the additional
investment was a good move for the Ensco-R.D. Smith group.
   "This is one of the true quality fleets in the offshore
industry," said Sam Albright, an analyst with Howard Weil.
"If this cycle continues to gain momentum, the fact that they
may have paid full price won't make any difference two years
from now."
   Penrod's 89-rig fleet includes 39 offshore rigs, many of
them relatively new. During the 1980s, the Hunt brothers
borrowed heavily to modernize and enlarge the Penrod fleet,
amassing more than $760 million in debt. Coupled with other
losses, those debts forced the family trusts owning Penrod to
seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection.
   The Hunts lost operating control of Penrod in a 1988
settlement with creditors and turned their remaining 50%
interest in Penrod over to creditors last month.

   SEC Is Warning
   Index Traders
   On Uptick Rule

   Big Brokerage Firms Told
   To Stop Misinterpreting
   Exemption They Enjoy

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
</GV>
<LP>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is cracking down on
program traders who have exploited a regulatory loophole for
as long as four years.
   This week, the SEC warned big brokerage firms that engage
in computer-assisted program trading not to misinterpret the
limited exemption they enjoy to the stock market's
50-year-old "uptick rule." The 1986 exemption has been a sore
point among critics who say that program trading is hurting
the market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling may curtail index arbitrage, a type of program
trading in which institutions buy or sell long lists of
stocks with offsetting trades in futures or options. Programs
involving New York stocks and Chicago futures seem likely to
be largely unaffected. The ruling's main impact will fall on
programs that involve foreign markets and are completed in
the U.S.
   The uptick rule prohibits short-selling -- a bet that a
stock will decline -- any time a stock is on a "downtick,"
meaning that its most recent price change was downward. But
the rule -- meant to keep manipulators from ganging up on an
already falling stock -- was never designed with program
traders and multiple-stock strategies in mind.
   It is understood that a major concern for the SEC is a
recently popular form of index arbitrage that starts with a
bearish investor selling a portfolio of stocks in London, and
ends with the brokerage firm who bought the stocks unloading,
or "unwinding," the batch of stocks in New York. Under the
new rule, the New York selling won't any longer enjoy the
uptick exemption.
   Blair Corkran, senior special counsel at the SEC, said the
agency acted in part because of confusion about the scope of
the 1986 uptick exemption. But the only significant change
now, he said, is that "the position is tightened in respect
to the unwinding of positions established overseas."
   The ruling is causing a stir at major program-trading
firms, which have been worried about the SEC's increased
focus on program trading in recent months. At Morgan Stanley
Group Inc., the biggest program trader on Wall Street, a
spokesman declined to comment yesterday.
   One vocal critic of program trading, the money management
firm of Neuberger &amp; Berman, says the exemption allows index
arbitragers to do "the equivalent of pressing the accelerator
of a runaway truck to the floor."
   Index arbs dispute that characterization; but the
exemption they have enjoyed is nonetheless important.
   The 1986 exemption was given to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. by the
SEC but applied to other firms. It was made because program
trading involves the simultaneous buying and selling of so
many stocks, such as all 500 issues in Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index. Strictly enforced, the uptick rule, designed
to protect individual stocks, might hamper legitimate
multistock trading by forcing brokerage firms to make sure
they aren't technically short-selling on a downtick any of
the hundreds of stocks involved in a program.
   In its new ruling, the SEC says "certain recurring issues
have arisen" that indicate that some index arbitragers aren't
following the letter of the law. "Since the time that the
1986 Letter was issued, the {SEC} has become aware that
market participants may be interpreting" the agency's
position "in contexts that were not contemplated by" the
SEC's market regulation division, the ruling states.
   W. James Tozer Jr., president and chief operating officer
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., told Congress recently
"there is concern on the Street" that much program trading
"is often technically in violation" of the uptick rule. "By
strictly enforcing the uptick rule, the SEC could slow the
downward spiraling process created by index arbitrage," he
said.
   The SEC emphasized that its uptick exemption was never
meant to apply to the creation of new index arbitrage
positions, but only to the unwinding of old ones. Also, it
applies only when both sides of an arbitage position are
being unwound simultaneously.
   The extra proviso about overseas-related positions was
needed, SEC staffers said, because such transactions weren't
commonplace when the original 1986 letter was written. But
these days, they are, and some traders are apparently making
an end-run around the uptick rule.
   One method of program trading, in particular, is targeted.
If for example, the Tokyo stock market fell heavily
overnight, a U.S. securities firm might expect the New York
Stock Exchange shares to react by dropping at the opening.
   So, the firm might suggest to a client that the market was
likely to fall and induce the client to sell it the 500
stocks in the S&amp;P 500 on the London market before the U.S.
opening. The Wall Street firm would hedge itself by selling
the S&amp;P 500 futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, a bet that the index is also going to fall.
   At the opening bell in New York, the firm would sell the
stocks on the Big Board, which would push stock prices down
and in turn nudge the futures lower as well. The firm would
likely make an easy profit by earning more money on selling
the futures than it might lose selling the stocks. Moreover,
the client would avoid a loss.
   "They help drive the market down, help push the market
over the cliff," said one SEC staffer.
   Under the uptick-rule exemption, the brokerage firm
selling the 500 stocks in New York supposedly must be
involved in unwinding an index arbitrage position. But the
brokerage firm that was selling the basket of stocks in the
above scenario wasn't actually unwinding a position; it was
simply selling stocks.
   "The point is: If the market were open in New York, you
couldn't do this. It's not bona fide arbitrage," said the SEC
staffer.
