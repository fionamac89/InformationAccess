   Tim W. Ferguson's March 6 Business World, "Prop. 65
Populism Is on the Prowl, but Don't Cry Wolf," gives
excellent insight into the elements of cancer causation and
thence the prevention desired so ardently by the proponents
of Proposition 65 in California and elsewhere. It turns out
that the goals of Prop. 65 to control cancer will not be met
at all through the expensive actions required by law in
California. Excellent, reliable and validated international
research on cancer causation provides the evidence for this
erroneous approach through Prop. 65.
   In the U.S. and the Western world generally, about 30% of
cancer deaths, specifically cancer in the lung, pancreas,
kidney, bladder and to some extent in the cervix, are
definitely associated with and caused by smoking of
cigarettes. About 5% of cancer deaths in the oral cavity and
esophagus are due to smoking and alcohol consumption or
chewing of tobacco. The traditional Western nutrition, high
in fat, low in fiber, and high in salt accounts for more than
50% of cancer deaths at important sites, such as the colon,
postmenopausal breast, pancreas (with smoking), ovary, uterus
and prostate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Clearly, the agents regulated by Prop. 65 are not on this
list. People believe they are protected by such legislation
and tragically they are not. What is needed is a change in
life style, which is slowly taking place. There are fewer men
smokers. As a result, the rate of fatal heart attacks (also
caused by smoking) has begun to drop, as has lung cancer in
men but not women. People have started to switch to lower-fat
foods but not to a sufficient degree to make a difference.
Existing data clearly show that a fat intake for cancer
prevention needs to be about 20% of calories rather than the
current 38%.
   Federal and state agencies find it easy to ban basically
innocuous and actually useful chemicals such as saccharin.
What is needed is for legislators and all concerned in the
consumer and environmental movements to be better informed
about causes of cancer, heart disease and stroke -- the major
killers in America -- so that appropriate effective actions
can be instituted to avoid the major part of the 500,000
annual cancer deaths.
   John H. Weisburger
   White Plains, N.Y.
   ---
   Mr. Ferguson asks if a regulation focused on identifying
trace levels of industrial chemicals that may cause cancer in
animals is "the best use of social capital." Clearly, if
one's goal is the reduction of human cancer mortality,
trace-chemical witch hunts are totally cost-ineffective.
   The premise of Prop. 65 in California -- that chemicals
that cause cancer in high doses in laboratory experiments
must be assumed to cause cancer in humans -- is antithetical
to the science of cancer epidemiology, which focuses on the
established causes of human cancer (among them, tobacco use;
alcohol abuse; overexposure to sunlight; radiation; certain
occupational and pharmaceutical chemicals; and specific
sexual and reproductive patterns, including multiple sexual
partners, which increase a woman's risk of cervical cancer;
and delayed age at first birth, which in some way augments
the chances of breast cancer).
   In judging cost-effectiveness of labeling foods, cosmetics
and other consumer products that may contain trace amounts of
a chemical that in high doses is an animal carcinogen, one
must ask how many cases of cancer are attributable to these
exposures? The actual answer here is unknown -- but the best
guess is zero.
   Clearly, tobacco products account for one-third of cancer
mortality in the U.S. and a label on these products is
appropriate. But are other labels really needed and
effective? For those who are "warning-philic" one might argue
that labeling beach chairs and swimsuits as to the dangers of
ultraviolet rays would be far more effective in reducing
cancer incidence than sounding an alarm about the latest
animal carcinogen of the week.

   Frederick F. Reichheld addressed the issue of loss of
customers by a company due to dissatisfaction with a product
or service (Manager's Journal, March 12). He says, "Few
companies make customer retention part of their business
objectives." Very true. Responsible executives wax eloquent
about quality and customer service in staff meetings and
memos. Management consultants exhort their clients to make
"customer service" their top priority. But nobody, in my
opinion, seems to address the fundamentals behind quality and
customer service.
   While organizational experts cry their hearts out
emphasizing that the most important asset of a company is its
human resources (i.e., its employees), the decimation and
demoralization of the American work force during the 1980s by
a spectrum of companies have made their (surviving) employees
very bitter. Employees try to do everything to retain their
jobs, but they do not have single-minded commitment to
enhance quality or serve the customer better since they
constantly live with the fear of losing their jobs regardless
of how well they perform their tasks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Quality of product or service is the result of actions of
motivated employees. If fear and authority, rather than
respect and reward, rule over the employees in an
organization, then quality and service are bound to become
casualties. Where are the management consultants? Are the
consultants advising their clients about this serious issue?
If so, what is the response? If not, why not?

   Inco Unit Has Weathered Hard Times

   Nickel-Producing Firm Can
   Finally Spare a Dime

STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)
</IN>
<LP>
   SOROAKO, Indonesia -- It takes a lot of heat to smelt
nickel, as the world's largest miner of the metal knows. But
Inco Ltd. of Toronto didn't know how badly it would get
burned before its Indonesian unit began to turn around.
   The company overcame much, however -- a decade of
technical problems, daunting costs and weak nickel prices --
and now is offering shares in a smelter that is producing
solid profits. The prospects for that offering, and for the
Indonesian operation's future as it expands, seem bright
enough to suggest that Inco will see some reward for its
years of struggle.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On paper in the late 1960s, Inco's plan to mine and refine
huge deposits of nickel-laterite ore beneath a hilly forest
tract in remote Sulawesi appeared to be a winner. After
nearly $1 billion was spent and production began in the late
1970s, however, the plan proved to be a big loser. Sagging
nickel prices, high energy costs and other problems forced
the Soroako unit to borrow nearly $440 million from the
parent company.
   Typical of the troubles encountered, the smelter itself
didn't work properly at first. The required heat -- as much
as 1,600 degrees Celsius -- was eating up the linings of the
giant furnaces.
   The overall situation, recalls processing manager Andre
Daenuwy, "became desperate. You had to wonder: Are we ever
going to run this place? There were so many problems."
   Today, P.T. International Nickel Indonesia is running
well. Nickel prices are comfortable and production has risen
while costs have been slashed. Furnace linings are no longer
suffering, nor is the Canadian parent. Inco Indonesia, as the
unit is known, has repaid all but $95 million of its debt to
the home office.
   This month, Inco Indonesia faces a new test in convincing
investors that the Soroako operation is a good bet in spite
of nickel's historical price volatility. The company is
making the second-biggest offering to date on the Jakarta
Stock Exchange, as the parent sells 20% of its stake,
reducing its holding to 58%. (Inco originally held 98% of
Inco Indonesia, but sold 20% to Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. of
Japan in 1988.)
   Having proved that its perseverance is paying off, Inco
Indonesia should find the offering oversubscribed. The
company that faced bad luck in the early years came into some
good luck before the share offer.
   A year ago, when the issue was first planned, it seemed
certain that Inco Indonesia's offer wouldn't be open to
international investors because of a ceiling on foreign
ownership. However, a change made in Indonesian stock
regulations last August allows foreigners to take up 49% of
public share issues, except those by banks. Moreover,
Indonesians have wanted to buy shares attractive to foreign
funds; most foreign funds appear keen on Inco Indonesia.
   Inco Indonesia executives expect the foreign portion to be
about three times oversubscribed. It's hard to project the
domestic demand, but it may be reasonably strong.
   There's irony in the offering for the parent company.
Under Inco's 1968 contract with Jakarta, the company has
offered 20% equity to the Indonesian government -- 2% a year
during each year of the 1980s. But the cash-strapped
government wasn't interested.
   Last year, authorities told Inco that rather than buy the
20%, they wanted it to put the same-size stake on the
emerging Jakarta Stock Exchange. So the company is having to
reduce its holding just when the operation is showing a
profit.
   James Guiry, Inco Indonesia's president and managing
director, says given the early difficulties, Soroako would so
far be judged a "poor investment" for the parent concern. But
from here forward, he says, the smelter is a "cash
generator." Inco isn't happy to be giving up 20% now, but the
divestment discharges its contractual commitment with the
Indonesian government, Mr. Guiry adds.
   During the offering, open from last Tuesday through April
20, Inco Indonesia is floating 49.7 million shares at 9,800
rupiah ($5.37) each, to raise a total of 487 billion rupiah.
In Toronto, the parent company said the net proceeds of $250
million will be used for repaying debt and general corporate
purposes.
   Analysts say the issue was priced at the upper end of
price-earning ratios for mining stocks in the U.S. and
Australia, but still on the lower end of P-Es for initial
offerings in the pricey Jakarta market. (The P-E ratio, the
price of a share divided by earnings per share for a 12-month
period, is a common way of assessing a stock's underlying
value.)
   Despite the expected appetite for the offering, analysts
note that Inco Indonesia is selling a pure play on nickel,
its only product -- which could damp some potential interest.
   "Inco has done a great job resurrecting that project," one
foreign banker in Jakarta says, "but a commodity like this is
a gamble. Do you really want to take chances on a
single-product company where the price can nose dive?"

   Apparel Firms to Post Depressed Profits,
   As Cautious Mood Permeates Retailing

   Apparel companies will be reporting depressed
first-quarter results in the next weeks, reflecting a
cautious climate in which wary retailers are ordering later
and more conservatively.
   Analysts say first-quarter results will vary widely across
the apparel sector, with "some companies benefiting from
retail sales that were better-than-expected, partly due to
warm weather," and fewer markdowns, said Elizabeth Armstrong,
an analyst at Prescott Ball &amp; Turben Inc. But the combined
effects of more retailers placing their orders later,
less-than-buoyant retail sales and other factors have hurt
earnings at many companies. Ms. Armstrong predicts
first-quarter net income at the 16 apparel companies she
follows will be down about 17% from a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In the first quarter, sluggishness was apparent in most
areas of textiles and apparel fabrics, which we think will
have a domino effect on the apparel companies," said Josie
Esquivel, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The strongest first-quarter gains are coming from the
usual solid performers. Analysts estimate Liz Claiborne will
post a profit gain of at least 15%, while Nike Corp. will see
an increase of about 50%.
   Reebok International, analysts say, should report about a
10% rise in profit. Analysts point out that, unlike some
apparel makers, all three of those companies already have
strong fall order backlogs. Analysts also expect
first-quarter gains from Russell Corp. and Crystal Brands
Inc.
   But there are a number of apparel companies that are
"struggling to stay even -- at best -- with last year," says
Deborah Bronston, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.
Analysts expect first-quarter losses at Phillips Van Heusen
Corp. and Bernard Chaus Inc., and they project flat quarterly
results at Leslie Fay Co. and Oskosh B'Gosh Inc.
   Most apparel companies are seeing increasingly fragmented
ordering patterns from retailers, which are worried about
getting stuck with too much inventory. Too much inventory
could force them into heavy markdowns and lower profits. As a
result, retailers have been ordering very conservatively. In
the first quarter, "advance orders are way down," from a year
earlier, Ms. Esquivel said.
   Hartmarx Corp., suffering from the slump in the sales of
retail and wholesale menswear, already reported a 75% plunge
in first-quarter earnings. And VF Corp. disclosed that it
expects first-quarter profit to drop about 35% from a year
earlier. VF's results will include a pretax charge of more
than $3 million from closing two plants at its Lee Co.
jeanswear division.
   The troubled retail operations of Campeau Corp., operating
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since January,
continue to depress business for apparel makers. "Campeau as
a negative has lessened to a degree," Ms. Armstrong says, but
there are some apparel companies that are shipping Campeau
stores "less than they normally would."

both offensive and questionable. To analyze economic data and

   Labor Market in Britain Is Expected
   To Remain Tight for Foreseeable Future

   LONDON -- Hoping to pare staff turnover, a British
supermarket chain recently gave some 70,000 check-out clerks
a 16.5%, one-year pay increase.
   More highly skilled workers, such as elevator technicians,
also are in strong demand. Rail unions have rejected an 8.5%
contract offer, raising concerns that London commuters face a
second summer in a row of occasional transport strikes.

<TEXT>
   Britain's labor market is undeniably tight, and it's
likely to remain that way for some time, analysts say.
   A doubling in key interest rates since mid-1988 hasn't
slowed the economy enough to halt job market growth. Now,
with another general election looming by 1992 and the ruling
Conservative Party trailing badly in polls, a further
tightening of monetary policy seems unlikely.
   Because monetary policy is relatively tight, the labor
market's expansion is slowing. But analysts don't anticipate
a sharp rise in unemployment or much moderation in labor
costs.
   "Labor-market pressures are easing, but not enough to push
down wage settlements or earnings," says Don Smith, an
economist at Greenwell Montagu.
   Underlying the strong labor market is a resilient economy.
Britain isn't in danger of recession, even with bank base
rates at a nine-year high of 15%, economists say. As
elsewhere, demographics also affect the job-market outlook.
Because fewer young people will be entering the market,
growth in Britain's work force may decline to just 0.2% in
1992, down from 0.8% last year, according to Greenwell
Montagu.
   Employment growth is slowing, though. Monthly declines in
the jobless total averaged 23,000 a month during the past six
months, about half the average monthly drop in the same
period a year earlier.
   During February, the jobless total fell a mere 1,700, its
smallest monthly decline in four years; in March it dropped
by 6,000. "We probably are some months away from an increase
in unemployment," says John Shepperd, a director of S.G.
Warburg Securities Ltd. "In the near term, it will fall
further."
   Ultimately, sharply rising labor costs will prompt
employers to trim work rolls, economists say. That may be the
case especially in non-manufacturing businesses, which
account for nearly three-fourths of total employment.
   But net job losses this business cycle will be
significantly less than in the last, says Mr. Smith of
Greenwell Montagu.
   He projects the unemployment rate will edge up to only
6.1% next year, compared with February's and March's 5.6%
level, and then begin to fall again. British unemployment
reached a recent peak of 11.3% in 1986.

   THE HAGUE, the Netherlands -- The unification of the two
Germanys will help the Dutch economy continue to grow through
1991 with a subsequent reduction in unemployment, but the
government deficit will continue to widen, according to the
official economic forecast for 1991 issued by the Dutch
Central Planning Bureau.
   "For this year and the next, the economic prospects for
the Netherlands are fair. Economic growth is steady,
employment continues to increase, unemployment is on the wane
and inflation remains within limits. One note out of tune
seems to be the high real interest rate, associated in
particular with the happenings in Germany," the CPB wrote in
its annual spring forecast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Not only does it have negative consequences for
residential construction, it also combines with the effects
of the tax setback of 1989 to aggravate the financial
problems facing the government in 1991," the CPB said.
   The country's total output of goods and services will
expand 3.25% in 1990 and will subsequently slow slightly in
1991 to a rate of growth of 3.0%, according to the CPB
projections. Employment, which is expected to increase by
100,000 jobs in 1990, is expected to grow by a further 75,000
jobs in the following year.
   However, the CPB projected that the Dutch government will
fail in its efforts to reduce the government deficit.
   In fact, because of shortfalls in taxes, a higher
interest-rate burden and no further income for the sales of
governmental stakes in businesses currently planned, the
public financing deficit is likely to expand as a percentage
of net national income, the CPB said.
   Even though the overall Dutch economy will show healthy
growth through 1991, not all sectors of the economy will
benefit.
   In particular, construction, agriculture and food
industries all are expected to show below-average expansion
through 1991, although for different reasons.

   Morton Results
   Aided by Airbag,
   Rock Salt Sales

   CHICAGO -- Morton International Inc. expects to report
earnings of about $39 million, or 82 cents a share, for its
third quarter ended March 31, on sales of $450 million,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles S. Locke said in
an interview.
   Harsh winter weather that increased demand for
ice-controlling road salt, along with rising demand for the
company's automobile airbags, more than offset an earnings
drop at Morton's biggest segment, its specialty chemical
operation, Mr. Locke said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year-ago period, in which Morton took a variety of
charges associated with the July 1, 1989 divestiture of its
Thiokol Corp. aerospace operations, the company had restated
net income of $9.6 million, or 20 cents a share, on sales of
$400 million.
   Thiokol has been hurt by its association with the fatal
explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, which used a
Thiokol-manufactured rocket motor. The spinoff has permitted
Morton to focus on its specialty chemical division, Mr. Locke
said, adding that he expects that operation will soon enjoy a
turnaround.
   "Specialty chemicals is down. It seems to be getting a
little better . . . but we're still down," Mr. Locke said.
But the demand for road salt, "particularly in Canada," is
contributing to "clearly the best year ever" for Morton's
salt operations, Mr. Locke said.
   For the third quarter, pretax operating profit in Morton's
salt business segment climbed to $30 million from the
year-earlier $23 million, he said.
   After 15 years of researching and developing its airbag
business, the company is just beginning to realize a profit
from the operation, Mr. Locke said. He estimated that
third-quarter operating profit for the airbag segment totaled
$3.7 million, compared to a loss of $1 million last year.
Sales more than tripled in the latest period, to about $40
million from the year-earlier $12 million.
   The recent growth in the airbag business, of which Morton
holds nearly a 50% market share, is due largely to new
federal safety regulations requiring automobile manufacturers
to include driver-side passive restraint systems in 1990
model cars. Regulations also call for restraint systems on
the passenger side in coming years.
   Analysts estimate that Morton's airbag sales will rise
from about $150 million for the current fiscal year, ending
June 30, to about $350 million by fiscal year 1992.
   Rising costs for raw materials, an electronics industry
that has been "flat on its bottom" and cuts in auto output
have caused the company's specialty chemical business to fall
off, Mr. Locke said.
   For the third quarter, the company estimates specialty
chemical operating profit slipped to $36 million from $37
million the year earlier.
   Morton's recent $220 million purchase of Whittaker Corp.'s
specialty chemical segment will raise the company's specialty
chemical sales to about $1.2 billion annually, Mr. Locke
said.

   Gorbachev Plan
   May Curb State,
   Double Prices

   Economist Cites Proposal
   To Remove the Kremlin
   From 70% of Economy

   MOSCOW -- Mikhail Gorbachev and his advisers are
considering far-reaching economic changes that would remove
government control from 70% of the Soviet economy now
dominated by the state, drastically curb central planning and
raise most prices by an average 100%, a leading economist
says.
   The report comes from Pavel Bunich, an economist in
Parliament who is helping to write the plan. But after weeks
of speculation over what kinds of radical changes Mr.
Gorbachev intends in order to create a market economy, Mr.
Bunich said the package of proposals still contains many
murky areas and isn't final.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There is nothing like `yes' or `no' in that package," Mr.
Bunich explained at a news conference yesterday. "Some of it
is so porous it's impossible to say whether the government
agrees or not."
   Mr. Gorbachev's newly created council of presidential
advisers is scheduled to meet this weekend to discuss the
package, and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov will present it
to Parliament later this month, Mr. Bunich said. Parliament
will act on the new laws in its current session or at its
next one. Mr. Bunich said he hopes the first reforms are in
place by the start of 1991.
   Mr. Bunich didn't provide a timetable but said many
changes would occur after 1991 and that some would bypass
Parliament to be enacted by decree. He said he didn't expect
any of the measures to be enforced by Mr. Gorbachev using his
new presidential powers.
   The basic points of the program include a market-oriented
economy, a new pricing mechanism, and laws to permit economic
activities free of government control, Mr. Bunich said.
Though only at an "embryonic stage" now, the package also
considers creating competition, a law to control unemployment
and the indexation of incomes to compensate for higher
prices.
   Mr. Bunich said he expects unemployment to rise to 10
million, or about 7% of the work force, during the
transition. Officially, the Soviet Union doesn't have
unemployment, but unofficial estimates put the number of
people without jobs at about two million. The new laws will
contain some measures to combat unemployment, Mr. Bunich
said. He didn't specify what form this would take, but others
familiar with the package have mentioned job-training and
unemployment benefits.
   Huge state industrial monopolies will be broken up and
leased to work collectives or sold to individual owners, Mr.
Bunich said. Some leasing of state-owned enterprises began
under a law passed last December. Mr. Bunich didn't explain
how it would be accelerated or expanded to eliminate
government control of 70% of the public sector.
   Free-market competition, he said, would have to evolve
slowly. The government could encourage it by splitting up
some large sectors, he said. For example, Aeroflot, the
Soviet national airline and biggest airline in the world,
could be broken into three companies, he said. Other
officials say that anti-monopoly legislation is also part of
the package. And the government is likely to further punish
big organizations by introducing a supertax on their profits.
   Mr. Bunich said that when 70% of the public sector turns
private, 70% of the government will no longer be needed, and
the ministries, as they exist now, "will be meaningless." He
said he didn't think it was necessary to preserve them,
except in some sort of advisory capacity in areas that will
remain government-regulated, such as space and defense.
   The two main planning agencies that control most of the
economy are also likely to undergo transformation. Gossnab,
the mammoth state agency that runs all wholesale trade, "must
not look like the current octopus," Mr. Bunich said. He also
said he "no longer sees the necessity for preserving that
supergiant Gosplan," the state planning commission, or its
five-year plans. Some officials say planning may be retained
for a few key strategic items.
   "The sooner we realize that the administrative top
(bureaucracy) isn't only expensive, but in the way of reform,
the sooner we will have reform," Mr. Bunich said.
   Final details of the price increases must be approved by
Parliament, and Mr. Bunich said his figure of 100% increases
was only a "rough estimate." The price increases will affect
retail and wholesale goods comprising about 70% of the
economy. The government is likely to continue to set prices
for the other 30%, so-called strategic goods that it buys for
defense, space and energy.

   Brazil's Congress
   Gives Backing
   To Collor Plan

   Central Elements Approved
   In Anti-Inflation Fight;
   Deep Recession Feared

   RIO DE JANEIRO -- President Fernando Collor de Mello won a
major victory as Brazil's Congress approved the central
elements of his bold anti-inflation plan, including a squeeze
on the circulation of money.
   But Mr. Collor's success in his battle with Congress may
have been the easy part. Now that he has a free hand, Mr.
Collor faces the challenge of finding a way to soften the
plan's recessionary effects without triggering a new wave of
inflation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The situation in Congress looked pretty messy and what he
did is pretty extraordinary," said a diplomat who followed
the process closely. "But administering this thing will be a
challenge and a half. He has to fine-tune monetary policy,
cut spending and balance the budget in the face of a possibly
deep recession."
   Mr. Collor's biggest victory in the fight with Congress,
which has been voting on the plan measure by measure for nine
days, came early Thursday when it unexpectedly approved by a
slim margin the program's centerpiece: an 18-month freeze on
about 80% of the money in circulation in the Brazilian
economy, estimated at about $115 billion.
   The government achieved this freeze, believed to be one of
the biggest liquidity squeezes in history, by bottling up all
funds in excess of 50,000 cruzeiros ($1,052) in savings and
checking accounts for 18 months, to be redeemed in 12 monthly
installments with 6% interest. The government also limited
withdrawals from the overnight market, a one-day savings
account in which about $60 billion was invested as a hedge
against inflation; capped withdrawals from interest-bearing
accounts to 20,000 cruzeiros or 25% of total funds, whichever
is highest; and limited withdrawals from money-market
accounts to 20%.
   By deliberately starving the economy of cash, the
government is seeking to prevent the boom in consumer demand
that accompanied previous anti-inflation plans here and curb
spending when price and wage controls are lifted. But the
freeze has brought to a standstill large parts of the
Brazilian economy, including the automobile and construction
industries, and many feel the government has simply replaced
high inflation with deep recession. Industrial production
fell by 14.7% in March, according to the National
Confederation of Industry, and many companies, deprived both
of working capital and cash flow, have had to borrow money to
pay wages, temporarily lay off workers or even close down.
   In a bid to soften the plan's impact, the center-right
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the largest in Congress
with 179 of 570 seats, sought to push through an amendment
significantly raising the ceiling on withdrawals from the
frozen funds. But 51 Democratic Movement deputies broke ranks
with their own party and voted down the proposal, ensuring
the approval of Mr. Collor's original text by a 249-206
margin. "I am extremely satisfied with the result of the
session in Congress," Mr. Collor said.
   If that was his most important victory, it wasn't his only
one. Almost all the most important of the 20-odd measures he
submitted to Congress have been approved, although sometimes
with minor modifications. Key measures approved include the
closure of 23 state institutions, new taxes on financial
transactions, and authorization to sell off many of Brazil's
188 state-run companies, which have a combined deficit of $62
billion.
   But in approving the privatization plan, Congress
prohibited the sale of Banco do Brasil, the country's largest
commercial bank, Petrobras, the state oil company, Embratel,
the national telecommunications giant, the postal service and
national development banks. Congress also limited foreign
ownership to 49% and a maximum of 40% of voting capital.
Congress also decided that any debt-for-equity swaps in the
privatization process will be governed by a separate law.
   With the major planks of his plan now approved, attention
is shifting to how Mr. Collor will succeed in avoiding too
deep a recession, or even a depression. Analysts now expect
the government to announce measures to boost the automobile,
construction and other capital-goods industries and promote
exports, which have been paralyzed. The central bank earlier
this week effectively devalued the cruzeiro against the
dollar by about 5%. The dollar is now worth about 47
cruzeiros on the official market.

   What Would Happen If Quebec Were to Secede From Canada?

   QUEBEC -- Canada's Francophone and Anglophone leaders have
about another month in which to try to cobble together a new
constitutional compromise.
   If they don't, Quebec Province returns to the limbo in
which it does not recognize the national constitution.
Failure also will reinforce a growing belief in the country's
two linguistic communities that, eventually, the province's
6.5 million mostly French speakers are going to go their
separate way. If they do, it will have a lot to do with the
growing cockiness in the French-speaking business community.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the period 10 years ago -- during which Quebeckers
voted to stay inside Canada -- this time independence is not
being preached only by politicians posing as left-wing
radicals. A small but growing part of the French-Canadian
business community has come out for leaving Canada. Perhaps
even more important, a larger part of Montreal businesses
don't regard independence as the unmitigated catastrophe they
were sure it would be in the 1970s. And the latest polls
indicate that independence has the support of 60% of
Quebeckers.
   French-Canadian nationalism now is based as much on
economic grounds as it is on political, cultural and
psychological reasons. The nationalists say French-Canadian
entrepreneurs have proved their mettle, even in international
competition. Seventy-seven percent of Quebec's exports go
outside Canada, mostly to the U.S., and are rising at a more
rapid clip than Canada's as a whole.
   Quebec nationalists claim that the English-speaking
companies frightened away to Toronto by Quebec terrorists
have been replaced by enterprising French-Canadian
businesses. A prime example they give is the blossoming
Quebec insurance industry that moved in behind Sun Life when
it departed for Toronto. And they say Quebec has developed a
special kind of government-private sector cooperation, with
technocrats moving back and forth between business and
government more like Washington than Ottawa.
   They also argue that during the last four years Quebec was
a "donor" province, giving more to the federal government
than it got in return.
   And, in a curious down-the-up-stairs analogy, Quebec
nationalists point to trade relations between Canada, the
U.S. and now, possibly, Mexico as the kind of integration
that is building the European Community. If the French,
Germans, British, etc., can get together and talk about a
common currency, why can't a viable, independent Quebec exist
parallel to a Canada that is entering a free-trade area with
the U.S.?
   All of these rationalizations have led Quebeckers, some
other Canadians, and even Merrill Lynch (recently the lead
member of a Quebec Province Yankee bond issue), to pooh-pooh
the economic fallout from Quebec independence if it comes.
The truth is that whatever form Quebec independence takes, it
conjures up enormously complex negotiations, at least a
minimum period of instability, and new headaches for U.S.
policy makers and perhaps American businesspeople.
   Here is only a brief menu:
   -- Canada's national debt. It is running at about C$350
billion (about 15% higher than the U.S. debt on a per capita
basis). Perhaps Quebec simply would inherit C$90 billion of
that. Some Quebec nationalists would argue bitterly against a
simple per capita distribution, however.
   -- Central banking and money. Unlike in the 1970s, most
Quebec nationalists argue for remaining inside the Canadian
monetary union (and here the European Community's ECU is
brought up). But the main beef of the Montreal business
community right now is the Bank of Canada's high interest
rates. They argue that they are being victimized to protect
the manufacturing sector in southern Ontario from inflation.
Francois Beaulnes, a former banker who advocates independence
as a member of the Parti Quebecois in Quebec's National
Assembly, wants to stay in, at least in a first stage. But he
calls for a "junior partner" role for an independent Quebec
in a newly constituted central bank, "and maybe a rule that
says that Canada's rates must not be more than 2% above the
Fed's."
   -- Federal assets. Quebec would take over the post and
telegraph and other federal properties. But there are
problems: Quebec's northern territories are disputed with the
federal government. Its boundary with Newfoundland -- a
province that now is holding up approval of the latest
attempt to paper over differences between Quebec and Ottawa
-- is in dispute. And Hydro Quebec buys some 20% of its power
(at bargain rates) from Newfoundland's Labrador, which it
then resells to the U.S.
   -- Free Trade Agreement. Quebec's business community and
the pro-independence politicians were among the strongest
supporters of the agreement to eventually wipe out all
restrictions with the U.S. But if, and when, the U.S. gets
down to business on the problem of subsidies, Quebec (perhaps
the most "dirigiste" government in North America) may sweat.
Take the provincial government's Caisse de Depot et
Deplacement -- the huge kitty composed of retirement funds of
government workers. Its C$30-plus billion has been used very
effectively by politicians to favor French-Canadian
businessmen, including the takeover of Steinberg's, and its
U.S. holdings, including A&amp;P.
   In all these complexities, one point is increasingly
clear: There is a growing consensus in Quebec that there must
be some resolution of the continuing crisis brought on by two
decades of agitation for separation. Premier Robert Bourassa,
until recently a strong opponent of independence, in January
slid over toward his opponents when he suggested some new
form of "association" among Canada's provinces. Meanwhile,
Jacques Parizeau, leader of the opposition Parti Quebecois,
now talks of another referendum.
   Among English speakers there is a sense of betrayal that
former Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau's national
bilingualism has not been the solution he promised, and a
belief that Quebec keeps upping the ante in negotiations for
a revised federal structure.
   Yet Quebec already is paying a price for its nationalism.
Province-owned Hydro Quebec bonds now yield about 30 basis
points over Ontario Hydro, up 20 points, marking growing
worries about instability. Pierre S. Pettigrew of the
brokerage house Samson Belari International Inc., a former
aide to a Quebec premier and an opponent of independence,
says: "What I really wish is that we could get on with the
economic challenges of the 1990s, the real problems of
productivity and competitiveness that all of Canada has to
face, instead of these problems of our past."
   If Quebec independence really comes, Washington also may
be blamed by many Anglophones for encouraging Quebec
separatism through the Free Trade Act. The U.S. then may find
itself embroiled in complex legalities of splitting up the
pie instead of working at the very real problems of expanding
trade, productivity and security cooperation with our
northern neighbors.

   For the First Quarter

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
BANKS (BNK)

<LP>
   MINNEAPOLIS -- Norwest Corp. expects to report that
first-quarter profit exceeded the previous record of $61.1
million, or 65 cents a share, reached in the 1989 fourth
quarter, Lloyd P. Johnson, chairman and chief executive
officer, said.
   In an interview here, Mr. Johnson also said that the bank
holding company's nonperforming assets rose between $12
million and $15 million for the quarter from $145 million at
year end. That figure was equal to about 1.1% of total loans,
which compares favorably to most other big banks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Johnson wouldn't elaborate on the first-quarter profit
expectations. In the year-ago period, Norwest reported profit
of $57 million, or 60 cents a share, adjusted for a 2-for-1
stock split paid last July.
   Despite the continued profit growth and relatively low
level of problem loans, Mr. Johnson said he is concerned
about the weakness of real estate and other parts of the
economy, and that Norwest's troubled assets could increase
further during the year. He wouldn't make a projection,
however.
   The company expects to add further to its reserves for
loan losses, which at year end were 164.3% of problem loans.
   Mr. Johnson said Norwest has forgone profits -- in the
hope of avoiding big losses -- in recent years by not making
very large loans. While the company could conceivably lend a
single customer, under federal regulations, $200 million or
more, it has limited its exposure to any single customer to
amounts far less than that.
   Richard M. Kovacevich, president and chief operating
officer, said that currently Norwest's biggest single loan is
$65 million.
   Norwest Mortgage, which has had losses in recent years, is
expected to reach the corporatewide return-on-equity level of
close to 19% soon, Mr. Johnson said. To do that, the mortgage
unit must originate about $5 billion of mortgage loans this
year. It originated $4.4 billion last year, when it had
profit of $5.8 million, against a 1988 loss of $9.7 million.

available seats occupied, decreased to 61.1% from 63.1%
because the year-earlier month included Easter travel results
that will occur in April this year.

   NEW YORK -- Harper Collins Publishers, the book publishing
arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., said it is putting J.P.
Lippincott Co. up for sale to reduce debt and focus Harper
Collins more tightly on book publishing.
   Publishing analysts said Lippincott, which publishes
specialized newsletters, journals and books on medical and
nursing topics, is believed to earn between $15 million and
$20 million a year on revenue of about $100 million. The
analysts said it could bring between $200 million and $250
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   George Craig, president and chief executive officer of
Harper Collins, declined to comment on the sum Lippincott is
expected to fetch. But he said that in combination with
several other divestures made recently Harper Collins will
collect about $500 million in all. News Corp. has said it
plans asset sales of about that much to reduce the publishing
subsidiary's debt, which totals nearly $1 billion.
   Industry analysts said potential buyers include a number
of large, diversified media concerns, such as Paramount
Communications Inc. Paramount officials declined to comment.
Smaller publishing boutiques might also be buyers, such as
K-III Holdings, a year-old publishing concern headed by
William Reilly, ex-chief of Macmillan Inc., and financed by
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co. "We're not in journals, and
we'd love to be," said Mr. Reilly. "It's a terrific
business."
   Mr. Craig said other recent divestitures by Harper Collins
include Gordon &amp; Gotch, a magazine distributor in New Zealand
and Australia, and the Angus &amp; Robertson Bookshops, a chain
of about 100 stores in Australia. There were several other
small properties, he said, which he didn't identify.
   Although Lippincott is quite profitable, "it is the
farthest away (of Harper's subsidiaries) from our mainstream
businesses," said Mr. Craig. "We've been evaluating our
portfolio recently and we decided to concentrate our efforts
on textbooks (elementary school through college), religious
books and general book publishing. We'll continue to grow and
we'll need money to grow."
   News Corp. has quickly built a huge book-publishing
empire, piling up debt along the way. In 1987, it acquired
Harper &amp; Row, a big but sleepy publishing house, for about
$300 million. News Corp. also bought a British publisher,
Collins; a religious publisher in the U.S., Zondervan; and
textbook publisher Scott, Foresman, for $407 million in
November.
   Mr. Craig said the sale of Lippincott is being conducted
by investment adviser Munroe Pofcher of New York. The
Philadelphia-based publishing company, founded in 1792, is
regarded as an established name in an area of publishing that
is steadier than general-interest trade books. Harper &amp; Row
bought Lippincott in 1978 for about $16 million and the
assumption of about $15 million in debt. Mr. Craig said it
has been quite profitable in recent years, growing in such
areas as electronic transmission of data to pharmacies.

   Overheated Economy
   In Taiwan Is Showing
   Signs of a Slowdown

<LP>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan's booming economy shows signs of
a slowdown that could help cool off rampant stock and real
estate speculation and boost slackened industrial production,
officials said.
   But economists warned of an economic recession if the
government fails to take quick measures to stop an exodus of
industries hit by Taiwan's soaring wages, crime and
anti-pollution protests.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The slowdown offers us a good chance to make many
economic and social adjustments," said Chang Hsiu Lien,
deputy director of the government Council for Economic
Planning and Development.
   Taiwan's trade surplus in the first quarter dropped 34.6%
from a year earlier. The index of manufacturing industries'
output in the first two months declined 3% from a year
earlier.
   An Economic Ministry forecast put the 1990 trade surplus
at US$7 billion, down sharply from last year's record $14
billion.
   Mr. Chang said the surplus reduction could help ease
inflationary pressures and stabilize the Taiwan dollar, which
has appreciated more than 50% since 1986 under pressure from
the U.S. to reduce Taiwan's trade surpluses.
   Officials also said they expect that the rampant stock
speculation of the past two years could ease.
   The stock market index has already dropped about 20% in
the past two months to the 10,000-point level. The index
soared from 1,000 points in 1986 to 12,000 late last year, as
cash-rich Taiwanese rushed to make easy money from the
market.
   Soaring land prices could cool off and make it easier for
industries to acquire land for new projects, officials said.
   Officials hope that several important public projects,
including a Taipei mass-transit system and construction of
freeways that were delayed because of soaring land prices and
labor shortages, could be renewed and give the economy a
boost.
   But economists said the 1990 economic growth rate could
fall below 5%, compared with a government-projected 7%.
   "If things do not improve, we can even expect a recession
in a year or two," said Chen Wen Lan, an economist at the
Chunghwa Institute for Economic Research.
   The deteriorating investment climate has triggered an
unprecedented exodus of industries.
   Economists said the overseas relocation of labor-intensive
industries, such as footwear and textiles, could foster the
transition to high-technology industries that are pivotal to
Taiwan's future development. But they fear that other
industries, such as electronics and petrochemicals, also may
follow suit.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. posted a
net loss of $8.9 million, or 48 cents a share, for its fourth
quarter, ended Jan. 29, after taking a $14.5 million charge
for the planned sale or franchising of its fast-food
restaurants in Arizona.
   In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Karcher had net income
$4.2 million, or 23 cents a share. Revenue for the quarter
rose 6% to $118 million from $111.3 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said it is considering disposing or
franchising some or all of its 40 Arizona restaurants, which
have had losses of about $5 million a year. "It has become
apparent that the Arizona market does not make economic sense
for corporate operations," said Donald F. Karcher, president
and chief operating officer. "The future investment required
would have been prohibitive in view of the expected return."
Karcher and its licensees and franchisees operate 553
restaurants in California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Japan.
   In addition to the one-time charge, results for the latest
fiscal year were hurt by generally weak conditions in the
restaurant industry, including heavy discounting and use of
coupons, plus inflation of food prices, Mr. Karcher said.
   For the year, net income fell 73% to $5.6 million, or 30
cents a share, from $20.8 million, or 97 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $511.3 million from $445.9
million. Prior-year per-share figures were adjusted to
reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid last July.

BANKS (BNK)
</IN>
<LP>
   MANAMA, Bahrain -- Saudi Arabia has opened its fledgling
domestic bond market to offshore banks in the Persian Gulf in
a new move to increase trading, bankers said.
   The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (Sama), the kingdom's
central bank, has told domestic banks that it will permit
trading in its so-called "development bonds" in offshore
centers such as Bahrain and Dubai.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Previously the secondary market in the government bonds
had been restricted to domestic banks.
   "It's a fairly major concession," one Saudi banker said.
"Any major financial institution with an outlet in Bahrain
and Dubai will now be able to trade the bonds," he added.
   Bankers said the concession reflects Sama's determination
to make a success of the bond program, which has been used
since 1988 to finance the kingdom's substantial annual budget
deficits.
   Saudi Arabia began considering changes in the program last
year after the kingdom's banks showed increased reluctance to
take up all the fortnightly issues.
   For the moment, dealing will be open only to banks with a
branch presence in one of the Gulf Co-operation Council
states, or overseas banks that have a Saudi shareholding.
However, bankers said they believe the change is only a first
step towards the full internationalization of the bond
program.
   Bankers say the bond program will likely appeal to
offshore banks already active in the Saudi riyal deposit or
currency markets and to the major Gulf institutions such as
Arab Banking Corp., Gulf International Bank and National Bank
of Abu Dhabi. However, they say it may be some time before
the offshore banks get heavily involved in Saudi bond
dealings.
   Earlier this year six Saudi banks started acting as market
makers in the bonds, quoting continuous prices on
screen-based communications systems during banking hours.
Domestic Saudi banks are being encouraged to market the bonds
to state companies and private citizens.
   Saudi Arabia plans to issue 25 billion riyals ($6.6
billion) of bonds in 1990 to finance this year's expected
budget deficit. The kingdom has run substantial deficits in
every year since 1983, but the bond program wasn't introduced
until 1988 when it became clear that Saudi Arabia needed an
alternative to drawing on its foreign reserves to finance the
deficits.
   Diplomats estimate that the kingdom has issued about 80
billion riyals of bonds since the program began.
   Officially the bonds pay a return linked to the profit on
various development projects in Saudi Arabia, thus overcoming
the Islamic prohibition on interest payments. In practice,
however, the bonds have a fixed spread over equivalent U.S.
Treasury instruments.

   Security Pacific's New Chief Can't Take
   His Eyes off First Interstate's Troubles

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   LOS ANGELES -- Robert H. Smith's stock as a manager is
pretty high these days in banking circles. Unfortunately for
Security Pacific Corp.'s new chief executive officer, the
banks' stock price isn't very high.
   That may help explain why the 6-foot-3 Mr. Smith smiles
like a Cheshire cat at the mere mention of troubled crosstown
rival First Interstate Bancorp., which is considered
vulnerable to a takeover. Everyone in banking knows that one
way for Security Pacific to improve its stock price sharply
is to take over First Interstate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Smith knows that, too. "I have said and continue to
say that bringing together First Interstate and Security
Pacific could be a very beneficial transaction for
shareholders, the industry and banking customers," he says.
He rubs his chin and fiddles with his tie, smile broadening.
"But about all I can say beyond that is I'm studying my
options."
   Mr. Smith, 54 years old, took over as chief executive of
the nation's fifth-largest bank in January, succeeding
Richard J. Flamson, who remains chairman. So far, Mr. Smith
has received high marks from analysts for embarking on a
tough reassessment of the bank's far-flung operations, which
are among the most diverse in banking, and for telling
managers that controls must be stricter.
   Moreover, he shares Mr. Flamson's longtime objective of
building Security Pacific, which has $86 billion of assets,
into a super-regional giant that's big and strong enough to
take on both East Coast competitors and global rivals. Mr.
Smith says his goal is to see Security Pacific with banks in
35 states by the end of the decade; currently, it has banks
in six states.
   But Mr. Smith is bedeviled by the same fundamental problem
that frustrated Mr. Flamson during much of his 12-year stint
as chief executive: Despite generally strong performance,
Security Pacific's stock price is stuck at about book value,
a depressed level relative to its earnings. That fouls up a
lot of Mr. Smith's long-term plans, because a higher stock
price makes stock-swap acquisitions cheaper, and purchases
are crucial to Security Pacific's growth. Without a big move
-- such as a deal with First Interstate that would result in
a huge increase in size and ultimately could prove a profit
gusher -- many analysts wonder if Security Pacific can ever
light the necessary fire under its stock needed to make more
purchases.
   Mr. Smith got a distressing reminder of his problem
Wednesday, when the bank reported that first-quarter earnings
rose a healthy 5% to $188.4 million. The stock immediately
drifted downward before leveling off and winding up unchanged
at $35.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading; Wall
Street had been expecting better results. Yesterday, Security
Pacific closed at $36.50, up 62.5 cents.
   In an interview, Mr. Smith dances around the question of
whether Security Pacific would ever make a bid for First
Interstate, which is considered vulnerable because its stock
has been hammered by a string of huge surprise losses in
recent quarters. But it is known that Security Pacific's top
management believes it might be able to cut expenses at a
merged Security Pacific-First Interstate by as much as 30% in
about three years. Given First Interstate's lucrative retail
network and strong California operations, that kind of cost
savings would make a combination into a certain bonanza. "It
would be a real home run," says one of the bank's managers.
   Of course, First Interstate is attempting to restructure
itself and has said it wants to stay independent, so no deal
appears imminent -- with Security Pacific or with other banks
known to be interested in some sort of combination, such as
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and BankAmerica Corp.
   In the meantime, Mr. Smith says, he intends to boost
profits through a combination of squeezing costs,
restructuring low-return businesses and pushing the retail
side of the bank. People who know him say he's particularly
suited to that. Since joining the bank in 1961, he has held a
wide range of positions in many of the bank's major segments,
including heading up the retail banking operation, where he
was renowned as a cost-cutter. "Bob knows this company inside
out," says Mr. Flamson.
   Mr. Smith says he foresees "strong" earnings growth for
the company in 1990. He wouldn't make a specific earnings
estimate. He said the bank's 1990 losses in Arizona, where
the real estate market is moribund, will be "about half" of
1989's $140 million Arizona loss.
   Mr. Smith has already shown he isn't sentimental. Much of
his vision for Security Pacific seems to involve undoing
things for which Mr. Flamson and the bank were known. For
example, he's likely to decrease further its involvment in
capital markets, which Mr. Flamson charged into a few years
ago before beginning a retreat because of poor returns.
   Separately, Security Pacific unveiled a 10-year program
under which it will invest $2.4 billion in community
reinvestment, primarily thorugh lending for low and moderate
income housing and for small and minority-owned businesses.
   Banks are required by law to invest in lower income
communities, but community activists have frequently
complained that large institutions, including Security
Pacific, don't do enough.
   Security Pacific said the funds earmarked for the new
program represent an increase of about 20% annually in the
money it puts into such projects. In 1989, Security Pacific
said, it put $199.7 million into community reinvestment.
   Mr. Smith called the new program an "expression of our
goal and the important priority we place on community
involvement. . . . $2.4 billion is a lot of money."

   HOWELL, N.J. -- Union Valley Corp. said it may miss a May
15 payment to certain of its debenture holders as it races
against the calendar to complete a revised bank-credit
agreement.
   The real estate concern also said a "liquidity deficiency"
has already caused it to default on a payment of $967,000
because of another creditor. In addition, the company has
missed interest payments to its lead lender, First Fidelity
Bank, for March and April. But the bank hasn't declared Union
Valley in default, though it also hasn't provided the company
with a written waiver.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In making the disclosures, Herbert E. Wishnick, Union
Valley's president, said he couldn't offer assurances that
the company can restructure its senior debt or its 14 1/4%
subordinated debentures on which it owes the May 15 payment.
   The disclosures were further signs of the company's
deepening financial woes. Union Valley previously announced
that First Fidelity Bank had declined to renew a $100 million
revolving credit agreement and had demanded repayment by Aug.
1 of $70.5 million outstanding. Union Valley said it has
relinquished all of its cash flow from its delivery of
housing units to Fidelity Bank since March 1, which hindered
its ability to pay other creditors.
   Union Valley designs, builds and sells retirement and
pre-retirement communities, houses and commercial real estate
in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. In 1989, it earned
$300,000, or eight cents a share, on revenue of $86.6
million.
   "The company may encounter further difficulties in meeting
the payment terms of its outstanding debts until more
permanent sources of financing can be worked out or until
market conditions in the homebuilding industry improve," Mr.
Wishnick, the president, said.
   He said that Union Valley and First Fidelity have agreed
on significant changes in the loan arrangement but that full
agreement is unlikely before June 30. As a result, Union
Valley is seeking interim financing, which it said will be in
place within a few days. This will allow the company to meet
some of its obligations, Mr. Wishnick said.

   English Mime in Hong Kong

   Hong Kong -- When Hong Kong's only Western mime, Jane
Watson, first came to Asia two years ago, she never would
have dreamed of making an audience feel insecure.
   As a student in Paris under Jacques LeCoq and mime master
Etienne Decroux, who also instructed Marcel Marceau, Ms.
Watson was taught to worry constantly about the audience. "I
learned that I should show myself, show my character, show
the style, show where you are, and do it very quickly so the
audience feels secure in what it's watching." But next month,
in a unique combination of Western mime, Japanese dance and
modern music, Ms. Watson hopes to frighten as well as
entertain her audience.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 25-year-old Englishwoman shunned traditional education
in favor of an audience at an early age. She began to study
ballet at the age of three, and five years later was
arranging garden fetes so she could perform dance and mime
skits. "I didn't know it was mime at the time; I just loved
it and felt completely comfortable in front of an audience."
   After seven years of ballet and one year of training in
traditional dance at the Arts Education School in England,
she became frustrated by the limitations of choreography and
enrolled in a movement-theater course in London. Inspired by
the technique's emphasis on self-expression and creativity,
she moved to Paris, where she studied mime for four years.
While visiting a fellow performer in Japan, she decided to
move there. "I wanted exposure to different audiences so I
could sharpen my performance skills. And the Japanese
appreciate Western things, so I knew I could find work
there."
   Only when performing in Tokyo did she learn that it's not
easy to bore an audience. "You don't have to be pushing
something at them all the time. You can sit still, you can
take a position, you can lie down for 10 minutes, and it's
still possible to hold the audience's attention," she says.
   She also studied Bhuto, a form of Japanese avant-garde
dance that she says is "ugly, frightening and quite grotesque
to watch . . . but people always seem to enjoy watching it
because it takes them places; it's like moving pictures or
looking at a piece of abstract art."
   The most interesting aspect of Bhuto, she says, is that --
unlike mime -- the performer has no ego. Creating images in
his mind, the Bhuto dancer moves quietly and slowly. Ms.
Watson gives the example of an actress creating the image of
insects crawling between her toes. The performer appears to
be uncomfortable but gives the audience no explanation. That
the performer appears to be taking no notice of the audience
scares people, she says. "Many people are frightened because
you can't see the dancers' eyes . . . you can't see where the
movements are coming from; it's as though they're {the
performers} possessed."
   Ms. Watson believes she is the first performer to blend
Bhuto with Western movement theater. "It's possible to mix
these art forms because they both work on the use of images
and so it's a natural progression, to me anyway, to combine
them.
   "I think people are interested in seeing something new and
a bit exotic," she says. "Because of television,
advertisements and films, audiences are constantly dealing
with images now . . . people's minds can work much more
quickly now."
   "Doris Jones' Diary," which Ms. Watson will perform Feb.
1-2 at the Fringe Club Theatre here, aims to give the
audience a steady stream of such images. "I want it to be
like flipping through the pages of a scrapbook . . . image,
image, image."
   Written by Ms. Watson and with directing assistance from
Patrick Neville, a British actor, the solo uses Western and
Asian performance arts to trace the highs and lows of Doris's
life: theater clown for the playful scenes from Doris's
childhood and energetic snippets from her adolescence; mime
to re-create street scenes as Doris goes to the city to work;
and Bhuto to convey Doris's painful failure as a nightclub
singer.
   With clear blue eyes and sharp facial features, Ms. Watson
creates scenes of extreme pleasure and excruciating pain. A
brilliant selection of music includes pieces such as
"Cabaret" to accompany her "dress-up-for-a-party" scene and
Philip Glass's dissonant "Knee 5" for her mechanical
movements of marriage and motherhood. She uses minimal props
and stage equipment, and during costume changes the audience
sees slides such as a teddy bear with her glasses, a hand
half-painted with nail polish and a pair of shoes next to a
baby.
   The key to making "Doris Jones' Diary" work will be
masking the differences in the art forms, Ms. Watson says.
"The show is episodic, and I'm trying to get it so that
people don't say, `Oh, that was a bit of mime, that was a bit
of Bhuto, and that was a bit of clown.'"
   Ms. Watson's first full-length theater production, "One
Day, Maybe Tuesday," was written and directed with a British
actress and performed in Tokyo last year. Although pleased
with the audience's reception, she decided it was time to
leave Tokyo. "I was tired of marketing myself only as a
Western performer; the Japanese want to see the Westerners do
Western shows. In Hong Kong, people are more exposed to
Western things, so I can try something new."
   Ms. Watson plans to take her show to the Singapore Fringe
Festival in June and to the Bangkok Club Med Festival later
this year. "If it works," she says, "this blend also should
give me an advantage when I decide to go back to Europe and
America."

   Soviets Wonder if Populace Will Accept
   Hardships of Planned Economic Changes

   MOSCOW -- Despite its economic shortcomings, the Soviet
Union has insisted for decades that its socialist system is
superior to capitalism in at least two respects: guaranteed
jobs and low prices.
   But as Mikhail Gorbachev moves toward what he calls a
"regulated market economy," this longstanding social contract
with the Soviet people is about to be broken. Officials say
the new Soviet economic package, due later this month, will
inevitably bring mass unemployment and big price increases
for basic goods.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Government economists insist that the changes are vital to
halt the economy's slide and bring about lasting
improvements. But as many admit, the crucial unanswered
question is whether the Soviet public is willing to pay such
a price, especially in the short term. If they aren't, the
already beleaguered President Gorbachev could face the
toughest challenge of his five years in office.
   "An explosion will occur that {the government} doesn't
expect," predicts Alexei Sergeyev, an economist who teaches
at the Labor Unions' Higher School. He warns that mass
strikes and social unrest could quickly erupt. "People will
initially say it's OK {to change to a market economy} as long
as it makes life better. But as soon as they see it
translates into millions of unemployed and price increases
without compensation, they'll say no."
   Even government economists who are drafting the new plans
echo some of Mr. Sergeyev's fears. They concede that their
biggest problem is devising measures to cushion the impact of
an economic overhaul that won't render the whole package
ineffective.
   "Any radical reform needs certain agreement among social
forces," says Leonid Abalkin, a deputy prime minister and key
architect of the new legislation. He and other economists say
the package will include provisions such as index-linked
social benefits and unemployment insurance.
   Because of fears of social upheaval, it will be softer and
slower than Poland's economic "shock therapy." Mr. Abalkin
worries that after five years perestroika and broken promises
of a better life, the government "doesn't have the trust of
the people." But he insists: "We shouldn't back down in the
face of disagreement or resentment."
   The greatest threat to the reforms is likely to come from
Soviet workers. Even before they are faced with the prospect
of unemployment, workers in many parts of the country are
furious about dwindling supplies of food and consumer goods.
   This month, oil field workers in Western Siberia
threatened to strike in protest against chronic housing
shortages and poor living standards. The strike was postponed
after Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov met with them to calm
their anger. But labor officials say the crisis is far from
over.
   Coal miners in Siberia and the Ukraine are also
increasingly militant. They complain the government hasn't
delivered many of the improvements it promised last year when
it settled a nationwide miners' strike. Mr. Sergeyev, who
recently visited coal fields in Siberia, says the miners are
talking about new strikes. "The situation is very tense," he
says.
   To head off potential unrest that could cripple
implementation of his reforms, several government officials
say Mr. Gorbachev may ban strikes. If he does, it is
uncertain how he would enforce it. Such a move could alienate
the huge official labor movement, which is urgently seeking
to regain its credibility with workers. Some officials are
concerned that the labor unions may seize on the economic
overhaul as a way to strengthen their political authority.
   So far, labor representatives won't talk publicly about
their plans. But, "last September we took a decision to
defend workers," says Pyotr Fyodorov, a senior official at
the unions' headquarters in Moscow. "In the past, labor
unions were linked to defending and implementing {the
nation's economic} plans, and people got lost. We now say
that isn't right."
   The unions have already shown their clout by forcing the
government to retract price rises on diesel fuel, freight and
electricity supplies to industry that were supposed to begin
at the beginning of this year. They have also persuaded the
government to scale down its plans to sell many goods in
short supply at auctions.
   To assuage the unions, Mr. Gorbachev has included one of
the most militant labor officials, Veniamin Yarin, on his
council of presidential advisers, which plays a big role in
setting the reforms.
   Mr. Gorbachev may also face trouble pushing his measures
through parliament. It has already rejected planned price
increases on beer and cigarettes. Pavel Bunich, a legislator
and economist, says "resistance will be there," when the
parliament debates the government's new program, though he
believes a majority will approve it.
   Raising prices is a particularly sensitive issue in the
Soviet Union because the cost of many consumer goods and
foodstuffs has remained unchanged for years, sometimes
decades. The government now spends about $160 billion a year
on subsidies. The economic distortions are enormous: The
retail price of meat is about half the cost of the grain that
is fed to cattle, for example.
   Even if it makes economic sense, adjusting prices will be
extremely hard on people long used to being told that stable
prices are a fundamental human right. "For their whole life,
people have believed that meat should cost two rubles per
kilo, and if the state charges 15 rubles it will be a shock,"
says Alexei Slavich-Pristupa, a reform economist. "It isn't
important that meat can be bought twice a week or every day.
It's just important that it costs two rubles."

   The IRS: Big, Bad and Even `Benevolent'

   To any taxpayers who've been audited, the Internal Revenue
Service is a frightening behemoth that can shatter your peace
of mind and balloon your tax bill.
   In "A Law Unto Itself: Power, Politics and the IRS"
(Random House, 419 pages, $22.50), author David Burnham
provides copious details on how the IRS, with its 123,000
employees, keeps tabs on the nation's 152 million taxpayers
who fork up $1 trillion a year to pay ever-increasing
government bills. And almost four million IRS notices assess
an added $1.8 billion a year on underreported income.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some stories about IRS assessments are terrifying. Take
the Husbys of San Francisco, who were asked for added taxes
in 1986. The couple took the case to Tax Court, but a
computerized IRS service center in Ogdon, Utah, still
demanded payment.
   The Husbys' attorney complained, saying the petition to
the Tax Court made the second IRS demand illegal. But a third
arrived, then two more.
   A year later, an IRS notice of levy was sent to the credit
union of the police department from which Mr. Husby had
retired, seizing almost $3,800. Another notice was served on
the couple's stockbroker. Even after a federal judge enjoined
the IRS from further notices, a tax lien wound up in public
files. Credit for the couple dried up.
   The IRS contended that it wasn't liable for its computers'
mistakes since such errors rarely occur. But Mr. Burnham says
such IRS computer errors "continue to affect an unknown
number of other taxpayers."
   Bureaucratic gaffes apparently are more common than the
IRS would like the public to believe. For example, this
reviewer recently wrote in this newspaper about an accountant
who was enrolled by an overzealous IRS agent to inform on his
client for five years -- to the outrage of other accountants
who fear this disclosure may lose them tax clients. The
accountant had failed to pay his own taxes but was never
prosecuted.
   The IRS sometimes ends up wasting its efforts and funds on
seemingly nonproductive targets, according to Mr. Burnham, a
former investigative reporter for the New York Times.
Consider that the service had to take a Billings, Mont.,
taxpayer to an appeals court before it could collect an extra
$500 assessment. The taxpayer apparently had violated an
obscure section of the tax law prohibiting "frivolous"
comment on the return. The scribbled comment: "Signed
involuntarily under the penalty of statutory punishment."
   Mr. Burnham is at his best relating anecdotes about
government ineptitude, incompetence or pigheadedness. But his
book bogs down when it strings out barely related facts. For
example, most readers may find it hard to resist yawning when
Mr. Burnham tells how the IRS and state organizations
exchange tax data.
   Even in some of its most gripping sections, the book tends
to be skimpy on certain key details. For example, it relates
how the IRS began investigating the National Council of
Churches in the late 1960s because of its civil-rights and
anti-Vietnam War activities.
   The investigation ended in 1972 but not until the
council's business records for at least three years were
scrutinized by the IRS. The church group told Mr. Burnham
that "a particular conservative senator," disturbed at the
council's political stands, had gotten the IRS to harass the
council. The senator isn't identified nor does the reader
learn how he got the IRS to do his handiwork. As it turns
out, the IRS concluded that only 8% of the council's funds
had been used for allegedly non-tax-exempt activities. And
this didn't justify raising the council's tax bill.
   IRS attempts to enforce evenhanded treatment of tax-exempt
and religious organizations have been less than fruitful,
according to Mr. Burnham. For example, pro-choice groups have
long contended that the Catholic Church has avoided IRS tax
penalties despite its spending funds to oppose abortion -- a
political activity that the groups say shouldn't be
tax-exempt under the law. But Mr. Burnham says that "given
the power of the Roman Catholic Church, it is inconceivable
that the IRS would revoke its tax-exempt status, no matter
what it did."
   Individual taxpayers, on the other hand, often fall into
the trap of thinking the IRS loves them too, because they
mistakenly see their tax refunds as a gift instead of a
byproduct of overwithholding. Mr. Burnham notes, for example,
that in a recent year, the IRS paid out an average of $800 to
four out of five individual taxpayers. Adds Mr. Burnham:
"Because the withholding process is almost invisible, and the
refund check so visible . . . a substantial number of
taxpayers gradually have abandoned the essentially correct
picture of the agency as a hard-nosed tax collector and have
adopted the false view that the IRS is a benevolent
bureaucracy that gives away money to the needy middle class."
   Although Mr. Burnham doesn't flesh out some sections of
his book enough, the reader will still find it hard to put
down once he's begun. As tax day approaches next week, we all
want to know more about the agency that pinches our
pocketbook.

   For George Preston, the Lincoln Highway -- that 3,119-mile
stretch between Atlantic City, N.J., and Astoria, Ore. -- is
no lonesome trail.
   That's why the Belle Plaine, Iowa, historian has
established George's Story Line, a 900-line toll-call
telephone service that takes callers down his favorite memory
lane. Unlike some other stories popular with 900-line
callers, Mr. Preston's tales are rousing rather than
arousing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And they're all about a highway most drivers know as U.S.
Highway 30 rather than the Abraham Lincoln Highway. (Much of
the highway hasn't officially been called the Lincoln Highway
since the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials started numbering highways in 1926.)
   The 79-year-old Mr. Preston has been gathering lore about
the highway since 1923, when his family purchased a gas
station on it and he began collecting maps from every state
along the route. He then began storing up stories told to him
by tourists and companies doing business on the road. "I've
got stories on every town along the highway," he says.
   Nearly every day, he tapes a three-to-five-minute message
for callers to 900-773-8111. No Garrison Keillor, Mr. Preston
delivers his stories in a gravel-voiced, grammar-wrecking
manner. One minute he rattles on about the first company to
operate a carwash on the highway (Skelly Oil Co.), and the
next he recalls the first president to appear on a Lincoln
Highway map (Herbert Hoover).
   Often, he tells listeners what travel -- and life -- was
like back when motorists had to stop frequently in winter to
refill car radiators with alcohol, the quick-to-evaporate
antifreeze of those times. "I can remember. . . ." a recent
tape began, as he recalled how drivers often got "lost so
bad" along the way that, in Chicago, police had to be
enlisted to "put people back on the highway." He rarely gives
his stories a time frame, preferring simply to say, "back in
them days."
   The line -- which costs callers $1.75 for the first minute
and 75 cents for each succeeding minute -- receives 50 to 100
calls a day. Mr. Preston gives his share of the proceeds to
charities, including a local volunteer fire department and a
new Belle Plaine library.
   And callers get more than old stories. He sends them a
free Lincoln Highway refrigerator magnet and bumper sticker.

   Ad Agencies Will Post Modest Gains

   Advertising agencies, focusing on cost control, are
expected to report slightly higher first-quarter earnings,
according to securities analysts.
   Analysts who track Madison Avenue say agencies are
suffering from an environment in which advertisers continue
to spend only modestly, reflecting inflationary fears. Ad
agencies are being forced to live with low revenue growth and
are concentrating on in-house cost-cutting to improve
earnings.

   "Assuming we don't see any structural upheaval in the
industry, I think they're going to have a generally up
quarter," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst at PaineWebber
Inc., New York. He said agencies are closely monitoring
personnel, a major cost that they can control by holding the
line on new hiring.
   Mr. Gottesman and other analysts note, however, that the
first quarter is a minor one in terms of absolute profits.
The first quarter, along with the third quarter, is
traditionally weak. Advertising agencies are most profitable
in the fourth quarter, when clients spend more money in
anticipation of the holidays.
   Mr. Gottesman is projecting first-quarter profit of
Chicago-based Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications Inc. at 30
cents a share, up from 24 cents a share a year earlier.
   "Whatever earnings are eked out will be eked out because
of cost control, not revenue growth," agreed James D.
Dougherty, an analyst at County NatWest Securities, New York.
Mr. Dougherty is projecting earnings for New York-based
Omnicom Group at 37 cents a share, up from 33 cents a share a
year earlier. Omnicom is the parent company of the BBDO
Worldwide Inc. and DDB Needham Worldwide Inc. ad agencies.
   Greg Ostroff, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New
York, estimates that earnings for Interpublic Group of Cos.,
parent of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide and Lintas:Worldwide
agencies, will come in at 26 cents a share, up slightly from
24 cents in the year-earlier quarter. "The client companies
haven't been increasing budgets as fast as they have been in
the last few years," Mr. Ostroff said.
   Some analysts are looking for earnings to improve as the
year progresses.
   Mr. Gottesman of PaineWebber said there's good news in
that spending among auto makers looks to be strong, despite
reports to the contrary. "They're talking about retrenching,
but they're not doing it," he said. "There may be some
problems on the local level, but the national ad data
suggests that business seems to be holding up quite well.
That's a plus."
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. and WPP Group PLC, two British
firms, are major players in the advertising business that
don't report quarterly earnings.

   VAN NUYS, Calif. -- Pinkerton's Inc. said it was sued by
competitor Guardsmark Inc., a Memphis, Tenn., private
security services firm, alleging that Pinkerton's engaged in
unfair and deceptive trade practices.
   The suit involves Pinkerton's use of a personality
assessment test to screen security personnel. Guardsmark
claims that it has licensed the test from University of
Minnesota and that Pinkerton's has no such license.
Pinkerton's is a security and investigation firm.
</LP>

   The suit seeks to enjoin Pinkerton's from using the test
or advertising its testing program. It also seeks corrective
advertising by Pinkerton's to notify customers and the public
that Pinkerton's hasn't been authorized to use the test.
   Gerard S. Brown, Pinkerton's executive vice president and
general counsel, said, "We believe this lawsuit to be
entirely without merit. Pinkerton subscribes to the highest
standards in its advertising and psychological testing
programs. We expect that the ultimate outcome of this
litigation will vindicate our practices."

   Japanese Chains
   Setting Sights
   On U.S. Market

   TOKYO -- Seventeen years ago, when Southland Corp. came to
Japan to spread its 7-Eleven chain, Japanese retailers
eagerly took notes and diligently tried to emulate the new
concept. Now, the student thinks it can give its old teacher
a few lessons.
   The agreement last month by 7-Eleven Japan Co. and its
parent, Ito-Yokado Co., to buy 75% of Southland for $400
million suggests that retailers may be ready to do what
Japanese manufacturers have long been famous for: taking an
American concept, attacking it with ruthless efficiency, and
managing it better than the creator.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "When it comes to coming up with new business concepts,
Americans are No. 1," says Koichi Hori, vice president and
director of Boston Consulting Group Inc. But, he says, "after
a few years, the Japanese become better at it."
   Like Ito-Yokado, other Japanese chains are starting to buy
American operations. A few months ago, Kyotaru Co., a
700-unit takeout sushi and restaurant chain, agreed to pay
$105 million for Restaurant Associates Inc., which owns a
number of well-known restaurants in the U.S., including Mamma
Leone's. Five years ago, Skylark Co., Japan's biggest
family-restaurant chain, bought hamburger chain Red Robin,
which has 57 outlets in the U.S. Sales have grown at around
8% for the past few years, says a Skylark spokesman.
   Taking the adapted principles of success in Japan back to
the U.S. is no easy task. Japanese chains must manage U.S.
personnel differently, says Ernest Higa, executive vice
president of Y. Higa Corp, which operates Domino's Pizza
here. "They should be very, very concerned about the people
issue."
   For 7-Eleven Japan, the cultural hurdle is just one the
company must clear. It is assuming a portion of the debt load
that led Southland to sell the stake in the first place.
Competition from Circle K Corp. and National Convenience
Stores Inc., among others, is tough, and many gasoline
retailers have entered the fray by adding convenience outlets
to their pumps.
   Just what 7-Eleven Japan intends to do to the U.S.
operations isn't clear. "It's a complete blank piece of
paper," says Hidetoshi Akiyama, a spokesman for the Japanese
chain.
   Analysts agree that the Japanese methods can't be
implemented directly to the U.S. operations. The hallmark of
Japanese management style, however, isn't jumping in with
strategies to restructure companies they bought but spending
time and money researching and making adjustments, analysts
say.
   The key to success for 7-Eleven Japan, which estimates
sales at 780 billion yen ($4.9 billion) for the year ended
Feb. 28, is a centralized computer system that links its
3,940 stores nationwide. The chain took up the system eight
years ago. Instead of simply logging sales data, 7-Eleven
used the computer to chart consumer trends.
   "We found for the first time that we had to change the
range of products we had for every single store," not just by
region or size of the store, says Mr. Akiyama. Outlets near
schools should have a large stock of boxed lunches, for
example, while stores in residential areas sell more
groceries.
   Sales data were coordinated with the chain's computerized
delivery system. As a result, 7-Eleven stocked some of its
stores as often as three times a day, keeping inventory small
and ensuring that the sandwiches and rice balls were fresh.
   Data on deliveries helped 7-Eleven spot potential new
business, Mr. Akiyama says. Noting that many
convenience-store shoppers were young, single Japanese doing
their shopping after the banks were closed, the stores
started accepting payment of gas and electricity bills. The
Japanese stores, however, don't have bank teller machines, as
many of the U.S. outlets do. But the Japanese stores handle
overnight delivery packages and will start accepting
insurance forms for mopeds in the next few months.
   The Japanese chain intends to spend 10 billion yen on
further improvements for the computer system in the next few
months. Southland barely has the system past the experimental
stage. Southland has said that debt costs have kept it from
investing in computers as it would like.
   Now, 7-Eleven Japan hopes to introduce the system to the
7,000 Southland stores in the U.S. and Canada. The company
won't comment on how much the implementation will cost, or
how soon it will be done. Analysts say that although 7-Eleven
Japan and Ito-Yokado are both cash-rich companies, they first
must get Southland's financial house in order.
   Like 7-Eleven, other U.S.-born chains such as Denny's and
Mister Donut, which developed in Japan through ties with
Japanese companies, are surpassing the American operations in
sales per store.
   Denny's Japan Co., a 343-store chain also in the
Ito-Yokado Group, bought the Japanese operation in 1984 from
the American chain. The Japanese chain installed a computer
system in all its restaurants and used it to create a wider
variety of menus than in the U.S. chain. It also instructs
waitresses to serve a glass of water and give a hot towel to
every customer that arrives. "The Japanese are concerned
about little details," says Ichiro Yamamoto, a Denny's
spokesman.
   Average sales for a Japanese Denny's totaled 223 million
yen last year ($1.4 million) while the American Denny's
averaged about $1 million, says Mr. Yamamoto, even though
U.S. outlets are larger and more of them are open 24 hours
than in Japan. Now, a regular program brings American Denny's
managers to Japan to study the menus and services.
   Duskin Co., Japan's biggest chain operation, started the
Mister Donut chain in Japan under a licensing agreement. The
company says profits improved six years ago after it bought
the Japanese operations from International Multifoods Corp.
of the U.S. Sales growth rose by as much as 25% a year,
rising especially in new outlets styled after American diners
of the 1950s, complete with jukeboxes and checkered floors.
Monthly sales per Japanese outlet average 10 million yen,
says a Duskin spokesman, or 2.5 times as much as an American
outlet.
   International Multifoods offered to sell the entire chain
to Duskin, but the Japanese company decided not to bid for
it. "It's easy to draw a picture on a blank canvas, but it's
harder to draw on top of somebody else's work," says
Shigeharu Komai, Duskin's president. Instead, the company
decided to expand into Asia, buying operating rights in the
region.
   Japanese chain operators in general believe that major
American presences, such as McDonald's and Kentucky Fried
Chicken, provide better service in Japan than they do in the
U.S. "Here, the consumer is more demanding," says Mr. Higa of
Domino's Pizza, noting that Japanese fast food outlets have
more workers behind the counters than in the U.S. "The
consumer orientation is toward better service."
   7-Eleven Japan is confident that it can turn around its
ailing parent company and expand in the new market. "When we
first learned the know-how from Southland, we didn't apply
everything exactly as they did," says Toshifumi Suzuki, the
president of 7-Eleven Japan. Now, as the Japanese chain gives
advice to the U.S., he says, "we have to think about how
things should be in the U.S."

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Baseball as Usual, From Wrigley to Shea
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein

<LP>
   Chicago -- What's the difference between opening day of
the Major League Baseball season and day two? About 30,000
people. The Chicago Cubs opened Monday night in Wrigley Field
against the Philadelphia Phillies before a full house of
38,000, but were rained out. On Tuesday afternoon, they drew
7,800. Day two really was game one, because Monday night's
soggy two innings didn't count, but the point holds.
   The weather here Tuesday was cold (36 degrees), windy
(north, 26 mph), gray, raw, blustery, nasty and otherwise
unpleasant. The April calendar might have been in double
digits, but the wind-chill figure was in the singles. Given
those conditions, it was a wonder anyone showed up at all.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   You had to give the folks who came some credit; they took
advantage of available shelter. At 1:15 p.m., five minutes
before game time, there were, maybe, 1,000 people in the
stands, but as soon as the last two words of the
Star-Spangled Banner sounded ("Play ball]"), the main force
emerged from beneath the stands to huddle in their seats.
   If a fans' boycott of the game had been contemplated,
Tuesday would have been the perfect day for it. But the
people of Chicago -- or the rest of America, for that matter
-- are not up for such displays, however darkly they muttered
during the three-week spring-training lockout that preceded
this season. That has been the pattern throughout the
numerous recent visits of labor strife to our playgrounds.
   "The lockout didn't bother us. We've been die-hard Cub
fans since the '30s -- win, lose, or whatever]" whooped
Lorraine Madonia, a housewife from suburban Arlington Heights
at the ballpark with her quieter sister, Fran Tepps. Mrs.
Madonia said her only regret about anything was that the
inclement weather forced her and her sister to don parkas
that hid their Cubs sweatshirts, covered with pins and badges
proclaiming their loyalty to the team. "People from out of
town take our pictures when we have all our stuff showing,"
she declared.
   A few rows away, Russ Schlosser, a real estate salesman
from Algonquin, Ill., was almost belligerent in rejecting
suggestions that off-field doings might affect his
spectating. "If they're playing baseball here, I'm watching.
The Cubs could swap their whole team for minor leaguers and
I'd still come out," said he.
   It's worth noting that while Cubs fans may be sheep,
they're not cheap. I dug out my 1985 Cubs media guide and
compared the team's ticket prices then and now. A box seat
that sold for $9.50 then fetched $13 on Tuesday, while choice
grandstand seats had been hiked to $10 from $7.50 and
bleacher spaces (no seats there) to $5 from $3.50. I cite
those figures not to single out the Cubs for obloquy, but
from the conviction that their boosts are typical. Their
players, after all, are joining the plutocracy no quicker
than those of other clubs.
   The next patron I encountered was bearded Kim Goudreau, of
Rockton, Ill., a community-college sociology teacher. In full
expectation of getting an earful about a credit-card
society's heedless embrace of hedonism, I asked what he made
of the public's willingness to paper the nests of their
sporting heroes, and those heroes' employers, with their
hard-earneds. Instead, he mumbled that baseball is a business
like any other, ticket prices aren't that big a deal to most
people, and -- hey] -- other things cost more, too. That's
what you get when a sociologist becomes a baseball fan.
   In fact, you have to admire the skill with which baseball
arranged its latest labor-management set-to. You usually hear
that nobody wins such fights, but this was one that nobody
lost, unless you count motel keepers in Florida and Arizona
and municipalities in those states unwise enough to bankroll
splashy training facilities for clubs. The players didn't
miss a paycheck, and the owners stretched and twisted the
schedule so they could open their gates the usual 80 or so
times. I guess that's what they meant when they said they'd
preserved the season's integrity.
   Sure, we had a truncated spring, but that will serve
mainly to give the players a creditable excuse for
early-season failures. "Why aren't you hitting, Slugger?"
"Didn't get enough whacks this spring." "Why can't you get
anyone out, Lefty?" "Couldn't work out the kinks in Florida."
   The season began Monday with few deviations from the norm.
The Texas Rangers' Nolan Ryan held Toronto hitless for five
innings but was yanked after 90 pitches to preserve his
43-year-old arm, even as he might be in July. While the New
York Mets were opening against Pittsburgh at Shea, the
cross-town Steinbrennarians were trying to upstage them with
a press conference. This one announced that George had made
Don Mattingly baseball's highest-paid player, at $3.8 mil per
year for five.
   The Cubs' opening-day lineup lacked their big bopper,
Andre Dawson, who's recovering from knee surgery, but the
cold had more to do with that than any training lacks. In his
absence, the team reverted to its "Rush Street Offense,"
consisting of lots of singles but little scoring. They strung
three singles to take a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the eighth
inning, then called in Mitch "Wild Thing" Williams, their
scary, left-handed reliever, to hold the Phils.
   In last year's opener, also against Philadelphia, Williams
loaded the bases with none out in the ninth inning before
retiring the next three batters to get his save. This time,
bare-armed despite the cold, he put runners on first and
second bases, and messed up a possible double play by failing
to cover first on a ground ball, before getting pinch-hitter
Randy Ready to end things by popping out to right field. The
cheer that greeted that development was made up of equal
parts of joy and relief.
   Asked later how he kept warm out there, Williams said he
"found the two biggest guys on the bench and sat between
them." When the questioner said he meant how he kept warm on
the mound, Williams shrugged. "I didn't think of cold or
warm, or anything else. I just pitched," he said.
   Sounded to me like baseball as usual.

   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered the credit
ratings of 155 companies in the first quarter -- nearly three
times as many as the number of companies given higher credit
ratings.
   S&amp;P said preliminary figures show it lowered ratings on
$75 billion of debt in the first quarter, while raising
ratings for $41 billion of debt issued by 55 companies. The
credit-rating service cited negative trends for junk-bond
issuers as one reason for the downgrades affecting industrial
companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among U.S. financial-services companies, reduced credit
ratings exceeded the number of improved ratings for real
estate, life-insurance and health-insurance companies. Rating
changes for banks were "decidedly negative," S&amp;P said,
because of sharp increases in bad loans for real
estate-related ventures.
   Separately, S&amp;P said municipal credit quality deteriorated
in the first quarter, largely reflecting downgrades on debt
ratings of New York State and Connecticut and their agencies.
   S&amp;P said ratings on $23.8 billion of municipal debt were
lowered, while ratings on $1.4 billion of debt were raised.
In the quarter, 87 ratings were lowered, while 29 were
raised, compared with 61 lower ratings in the fourth quarter
and 50 upgrades.

   TOKYO -- Japan's steel production in March grew 2% from a
year earlier to 9.16 million metric tons, the Japan Iron and
Steel Federation said. This brought output in the year ended
March 31 to 108.1 million metric tons, the fifth-highest
level in history, up 2.3% from fiscal 1989.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. Steel
production exceeded the 100 million metric-ton level for the
third consecutive year. The steel industry was supported
strongly throughout the latest fiscal year by robust domestic
demand as Japan's economy continued to expand, a federation
official said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Production in March also represented an 11% increase from
February, when output fell 0.9% from a year earlier, the
first year-to-year decline in 12 months. The quick recovery
in March indicates the underlying trend toward higher
production continues, the official said.

   TOKYO -- Corporate bankruptcies in Japan stayed at low
levels both in March and in the fiscal year ended March 31, a
private credit research agency said, reflecting continuing
strong business performances despite the simultaneous tumble
of the yen and Japanese stock and bond prices since the
beginning of this year.
   The agency, Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., said bankruptcies fell
36% in March from a year earlier to 503 cases, marking the
63rd consecutive month of year-to-year declines. The number
of bankruptcies was up 13% from February, climbing above 500
cases for the first time in four months. But this increase is
unique to March, Teikoku said, as most Japanese companies
settle their accounts for the year on March 31.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The value of liabilities left behind by the failed
companies totaled 73.2 billion yen ($463.4 million), down 35%
from the previous year, and down 3.7% from the previous
month. The number of businesses that went bankrupt with debts
of more than one billion yen rose to 13 from 11 a year
earlier and fell from 16 in February. The average value of
liabilities was 145.5 million yen, slightly more than the
year-earlier 142.9 million yen.
   The number of companies that went bankrupt in fiscal 1990
totaled 6,653, down 29% from a year earlier. The total amount
of liabilities declined 39% to 1.146 trillion yen. This was
the first time in 17 years that the total cases fell below
the 7,000 mark. The amount of total liabilities was also the
lowest level in 16 years.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- A leading index of the Australian
economy fell 1.4% in February, compared with January,
signaling a continuation of the economy's slowdown.
   The index is compiled by Westpac Banking Corp. and
Melbourne University's Institute of Applied Economic and
Social Research. Their coincident index of the current level
of economic activity also has started to decline, falling
0.6% in January from December.

   A Westpac official said that the gradual slowdown was
expected and that the index suggests this will be prolonged.
The leading index has declined in seven of the past 10
months.
   A preliminary calculation of a lagging index of the

   TORONTO -- John Kachmar resigned as president and chief
executive officer of Wharf Resources Ltd. after Goldcorp
Investments Ltd., a major shareholder, succeeded in a proxy
battle in replacing five of the eight Wharf directors with
its own nominees.
   The moves were expected following a similar shakeup a day
earlier at Goldcorp's Dickenson Mines Ltd. subsidiary, which
is Wharf's largest shareholder with a 36% stake. Goldcorp
directly owns 5% of Wharf.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kachmar, 53 years old, said at the annual meeting that
his resignations from executive positions at both Wharf and
Dickenson were "part of an orderly and normal process." He
wouldn't elaborate. Wharf and Dickenson are gold mining
concerns based in Toronto.
   The Wharf board later elected Robert McEwen, Wharf's
chairman, to the additional post of chief executive. Mr.
McEwen also is chairman and chief executive of Dickenson and
president of Goldcorp.
   David Libby, previously Wharf's vice president, mining,
assumed the new titles of president and chief operating
officer. He holds similar positions at Dickenson.
   Mr. McEwen led the proxy battle against a slate of
directors nominated by Wharf's management. Mr. McEwen said
the rival nominations were made to place more mining
engineers on the Wharf board.
   Mr. Kachmar and Wharf's general counsel, Barry Fisher,
withdrew their own nominations to the board. Mr. Kachmar
remains a director of Dickenson.

   McDonald's Corp., blistered by a newspaper advertisement
contending it is contributing to the "poisoning of America,"
warned several of the nation's largest newspapers against
printing the ad again.
   "The advertisement is recklessly and maliciously
calculated to inflict the greatest possible injury on
McDonald's," a letter to publishers said, claiming the ad had
numerous factual errors. "Any further publication of the
advertisement without (corrections) . . . would have to be
considered malicious," the restaurant chain said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Headlined "The Poisoning of America] Part III," the
full-page ad appeared last week in this newspaper as well as
the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today and about
a dozen other papers around the country. The ads were paid
for by an Omaha, Neb., businessman, Phil Sokolof, a crusader
against cholesterol who blames a heart attack some 23 years
ago on poor diet. In the ad, Mr. Sokolof was identified as
the president of the National Heart Savers Association.
   Mr. Sokolof's ad singled out McDonald's, asserting that
"your hamburgers have too much fat]" Adjacent to a drawing of
a Big Mac hamburger and McDonald's french fries was copy
saying those two items together contain 25 grams of saturated
fat. The ad also said "many fast-food chains" cook their
fries in "heart healthy oils" while McDonald's uses beef
tallow -- all contentions that the McDonald's letter
disputes.
   The letter was written by Joseph A. Califano Jr., a
prominent Washington attorney who represents the Oak Brook,
Ill., fast-food chain on nutrition and other food matters.
The former secretary of Health, Education and Welfare is now
with the law firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer &amp;
Wood.
   A McDonald's spokesman said the letter, with its implicit
threat of legal action, "reflects how strongly we feel about
correcting the misinformation in the ad." He said he knew of
no newspaper that contacted McDonald's prior to publication
to check out the advertisement's veracity. "We're asked to
demonstrate the facts behind ads we run in newspapers and on
television," he said.
   Bernard T. Flanagan, vice president of marketing for The
Wall Street Journal, said the newspaper's advertising
department had "looked at the ad very carefully and decided
it was all right to run." Asked whether the paper would
publish it again, Mr. Flanagan said "we would have to take a
look again and see if any of our standards were broken."
   A New York Times spokeswoman said, "We had no reason to
suspect the facts in this ad, so it's unlikely they were
checked." She added that "we neither agree nor disagree with
the ad. We don't think it was irresponsible to run the ad and
we have a long-standing tradition of running opinion
advertising which allows an advertiser a forum for expression
of its position." She characterized the letter, written to
Publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, as private correspondence,
but said he intends to reply to Mr. Califano.
   A USA Today spokeswoman said the Gannett newspaper's
lawyers were reviewing the Califano letter.
   Mr. Sokolof said the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Sun-Times,
the Boston Globe, New York Daily News and the Houston
Chronicle, refused to run his ad. He wouldn't comment
yesterday on whether he intended to republish it but said he
had been overwhelmed by the "positive response" it received.
"But some people have said, `Hey, I like McDonald's. Go
whistle,' or worse than that," he said.
   Mr. Sokolof, 67 years old, said he had been in contact
with McDonald's as well as several other major fast-food
chains in recent days but wouldn't elaborate. Asked whether
McDonald's had threatened legal action against him, Mr.
Sokolof said there had been no such conversation.

   Despite Unrest in 1989, Major Firms
   On Hong Kong Exchange Prospered

   HONG KONG -- Robert Riley looks back on 1989 as a year of
shocks for his hotels. The managing director of Mandarin
Oriental International Ltd. ticks off the tremors: three
hotels affected by the June 4 killings in Beijing, one jarred
by a coup attempt in Manila, the Philippines and one swayed
by an earthquake in San Francisco.
   The disturbances, however, didn't keep the hotel chain's
profit from growing 12% last year to a record HK$392.8
million (US$50.4 million). And Mandarin Oriental isn't the
only Hong Kong-based company continuing to prosper amid
concern that the local business environment is declining.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Profits of most of the main companies listed on Hong
Kong's stock exchange grew in 1989 for the fifth consecutive
year, despite widespread worries that China's turmoil and the
colony's uncertain political future would damp corporate
performance. Two of Hong Kong's biggest conglomerates, Cheung
Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd.,
surprised analysts with profit increases of 33% and 42%,
respectively.
   In fact, the rate of profit growth for all companies
making up the Hang Seng index slowed only slightly from the
previous year, to 21% from 21.4%, according to a survey by
brokerage firm Hoare Govett Asia Ltd. And while those rates
were well off the breakneck pace of 1986 and 1987 earnings
increases, Hong Kong's economy was booming during the earlier
period.
   Analysts expect the colony's slowing economy and the
consolidation of past gains to lead to a significant drop in
profit growth this year. Hoare Govett projects a rise of only
12% for Hang Seng-index companies in 1990. Even so, there is
broad agreement that local companies are performing well in
difficult times.
   "If Hong Kong is that resilient and can survive June 4,
maybe the risk of investing here isn't so high," says
Christopher Chong, an analyst at James Capel (Far East) Ltd.
(The killings of demonstrators by Chinese troops in Beijing
on June 4, 1989, caused a sharp deterioration in confidence
about Hong Kong's future.)
   The strength of the latest results could inspire new faith
in many Hong Kong companies. Coming amid doubts that Hong
Kong can continue to prosper when it returns to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997, the corporate results may lift the
spirits of international investors and local businessmen, and
lend credence to analysts who have argued that political
meddling from Beijing won't directly affect businesses in
Hong Kong.
   "These results should show people that Hong Kong isn't
going to collapse overnight," says Victor Kwok, an analyst at
Elders Roach Asia Ltd.
   Indeed, anticipation of strong profits helped the Hang
Seng index rise 5.7% in the first quarter, despite persistent
turmoil in the New York and Tokyo markets. In the past, the
Hong Kong exchange usually has echoed sharp movements in
those major markets. The announcement of Jardine Matheson's
results, for example, pushed the market up 1.6% in a single
day.
   The Hong Kong market did, however, get jolted on Monday by
a 6.6% drop in Tokyo's Nikkei average. The Hang Seng index
fell 63.28 points, or 2.1%
   Hong Kong shares have long traded at prices well below the
value of their underlying assets, largely because investors
regard the colony's future as uncertain. A shift in that
perception, or a so-called rerating of Hong Kong stocks,
would probably lead to a sharp rise in share prices.
   Not that there aren't several question marks hanging over
Hong Kong companies and the stock market. The flight of
skilled workers and managers is eroding the efficiency of
local businesses. A shortage of manual labor is keeping wages
and inflation high and stifling some businesses' growth.
Moreover, Hong Kong's economic growth slowed last year, and
many analysts believe corporate investment declined after
June 4.
   "There won't be a significant improvement {in the stock
market} until there are signs that the economy is turning
around," says Phillip Niem, research director at Hoare
Govett.
   In the short term, the dull economy may cloud investors'
perception of the stock market and keep down the share prices
of what many analysts regard as increasingly sound companies.
Analysts argue that companies that stood up to 1989's
difficulties aren't likely to crumble now.
   "What we're seeing is the success of two themes," says
Niall Shiner, an analyst at BT Brokerage Asia Ltd. "The
movement to very high-quality earnings that can be
independent of the economy and an increase in international
earnings."
   Underlying the earnings growth of many big companies is a
shift in strategy begun in the mid-1980s. For real-estate
companies in particular, the change in focus from property
development, where profit depends on often-volatile prices,
to retaining and renting out buildings is proving prudent.
   "Property-investment companies now make up 9% of the Hang
Seng index," says Stuart Cook, an analyst at Baring
Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. "Once a rental agreement is
signed, the company isn't subject to these political
hiccups."

   Household International Debt Review
   For Possible Downgrade Set by Moody's

   CHICAGO -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed $9.5
billion of debt issued by Household International Inc., one
of the nation's largest consumer finance companies, on review
for possible downgrade, because of concerns about expansion
strategies, holdings in commercial real estate and highly
leveraged transactions.
   The rating concern cited Household's planned growth
strategy and the potentially risky assets of its main
operating unit, Household Finance Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   News of the possible downgrade sent Household shares
tumbling $2.75, to $46.50 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, when turnover in the issue was
stopped by the exchange, pending news from the company, but
trading in the issue didn't resume. In a detailed statement
released before the market closed, Household denounced
Moody's assessment.
   Household has been building a large regional thrift
organization through its Household Bank unit, aimed at
customers with a higher income level than that targeted by
Household Finance, a leading consumer loan company. Moody's
said this project has entailed heavy infrastructure and
acquisition costs, including an increased dependence on
short-term borrowed funds and a rise in what the industry
calls corporate good will -- premium prices paid for bank or
savings assets that cover customer additions, location and
staff recognition but are carried on the negative side of
cash balance sheets.
   Moody's also said it will evaluate the adequacy of
Household's capital basis, including that of each of its
units. In the past two years, Household has spun off its
manufacturing interests to concentrate on financial services.
   Household's chairman and chief executive officer, Donald
C. Clark, said in a statement that he is "very disappointed"
with Moody's action. Substantial investments in new business
have contributed to consistently higher earnings by
Household, according to Mr. Clark's statement. Household last
year earned $239.5 million, including $21.1 million in
discontinued operations, or $6.47 a share, compared with the
year-earlier $246.7 million, including $63 million in
discontinued operations, or $6.80 a share.
   Earnings of Household Bank were positive last year, Mr.
Clark's statement said, and are expected to increase this
year. Good will is being written off over an aggressive
schedule of eight to 10 years, he said.
   Household's commercial real estate portfolio totaled $720
million, or less than 3% of $26.2 billion in assets at the
end of last year, according to Mr. Clark. He said the
portfolio is well-diversified geographically and by type of
property, and has little exposure in the Northeast and none
in New England.
   Highly leveraged transactions are focused in an
acquisition finance portfolio totaling $1.1 billion, or 4% of
assets, Mr. Clark said. The majority of these credits are
secured through senior debt, and Household hasn't experienced
any credit losses in the area, he said.
   Household's statement also took a jab at Moody's for
giving seven times as many downgrades as upgrades among
financial institutions rated in the 1990 first quarter.
   Analysts expressed sympathy for Household's position.
"Moody's never tells a company what it expects ahead of
time," said Lawrence W. Eckenfelder, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco. He
estimated that, even if negotiations between Household and
Moody's couldn't prevent a downgrade, Household earnings
wouldn't drop by more than five to 10 cents a share.
   Robert B. Albertson, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
called the Moody's move "an overreaction to the {phrase},
highly leveraged transaction. Household is a very strong
company with a very positive strategy that will decrease its
reliance on leverage through the planned growth of Household
Bank."
   "Household has one of the best records in the industry in
consumer and commercial finance, especially consumer
finance," Mr. Albertson said. "Moody's is just missing the
most important part of the picture."
   Moody's spokesmen were unavailable to comment.
   Moody's rates Household's senior debt at single-A-3 and
Household Finance's senior debt single-A-1. Also under review
are shelf registrations, subordinated notes, preferred stock
and commercial paper for Household International and
Household Finance; Euronotes issued by Household Finance
Corp. Ltd. (Canada); and preferred stock of Household Global
Funding Inc.

   Early this year, the House Ways and Means Committee
released a controversial study that was widely interpreted as
indicating that affluent families were not paying enough
income tax, while poor families were paying too much Social
Security tax. The study has obvious political importance,
since the chairman of the committee, Dan Rostenkowski (D.,
Ill.), has proposed a tax increase of nearly 18% on the
highest-bracket taxpayers. And Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
(D., N.Y.) has also proposed cutting Social Security taxes.
   Robin Hoods in the press quickly focused on a theme
implicit in the report: that the poor are worse off than
before and the rich better off. But there are some problems
with the statistics on which this assertion is based. In
particular, the report understates the income of the poor,
and so overestimates their tax rate; it overstates the
increase in the incomes of wealthy Americans, and so
understates their tax rate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The slanting starts with the portrait of America's poor.
The press paid a lot of attention to the "news" that many
low-income families now pay more of their income in Social
Security taxes than in income taxes, as though that were
somehow scandalous. Yet Social Security taxes are larger than
income taxes for the working poor only because many of the
poor pay no income tax at all] This is thanks to an expanded
earned-income tax credit and doubled personal exemption, both
Reagan administration changes.
   In any case, those in the bottom fifth of the income
distribution range as a whole could not be badly damaged by
Social Security taxes, since the Congressional Budget Office
calculates that only 16% of them hold full-time jobs all
year. Even the Ways and Means study shows that half the
taxpayers "earning" less than $10,000 a year paid no Social
Security tax, for the obvious reason that they did not work.
   The study also assumes that half of the corporate profits
tax is borne by consumers, in the form of higher prices. The
study concludes that corporate taxes account for 11% of all
the taxes supposedly paid by the poorest fifth of the
population, but only 10% for the richest fifth. This
arbitrary assumption ignores competitive restraints on
business; if a business passed along as much of the costs of
the tax to consumers as the study assumes, it would price
itself out of the market. If the assumption made sense, some
politician would surely be proposing to slash corporate taxes
as a way to alleviate tax burdens on the poor.
   The Ways and Means study has another big problem. It
simply excludes 2.4 million people in "families with negative
or zero incomes." As there were 500,000 more families in that
seemingly awful situation in 1980 than in 1990, excluding
them means the number of families remaining in the poorest
fifth appears to increase faster than the rest of the
population, by 12.5% rather than 10.9%. This illusion of a
faster increase in the number of "poor" families reduces the
measured growth of income per family.
   This raises the question, though, of how 2.4 million
family members could possibly survive with a zero or negative
income. One way is by receiving in-kind benefits, such as
food stamps and public housing. Another is by receiving cash
benefits, such as the earned-income tax credit.
   In the Ways and Means study, however, in-kind benefits
don't count at all, and any cash benefits that are counted
are apparently just treated as a "negative tax" rather than
as income. The estimated individual income tax rate for those
who have jobs (and pay Social Security tax) in the bottom
fifth is minus 2.3%. That is, rather than saying that someone
who makes $1,000 has $1,023 of income, after receiving cash
from the government, the study says his income is $1,000 but
his tax rate is minus 2.3%.
   It is also well known that much of the income that is
counted among the 18% of the households remaining in the
"bottom fifth" is vastly understated. Census Bureau surveys
acknowledge that about a fourth of the income from pensions
and from Aid to Families with Dependent Children is routinely
unreported. Since all in-kind benefits and many cash benefits
are not counted as income, Social Security, excise and
corporate tax rates on the bottom fifth of the population
appear larger than they really are. To pay excise taxes as
high as estimated by this study, for example, the poor would
have to devote a huge share of their budgets to liquor,
tobacco and gasoline. That would be quite impossible without
either uncounted cash subsidies or uncounted in-kind aid that
frees up cash that otherwise would be needed for necessities.
   Nearly all of the exaggerated increase in tax rates among
the lowest fifth is concentrated among "non-elderly
households without children." Although the study repeatedly
refers to "families," these "non-elderly households" consist
mainly of young single people, some of them students, and
many with uncounted financial help from their parents.
   Mr. Rostenkowski's report has also served as the basis for
a second major complaint: that the rich have become richer,
while their tax burden has been shifted to the poor. "For the
lowest 20% of the population," claims the study, "real income
fell by 3.2% {from 1980 to 1990}, while the total federal tax
rate rose by 16.1%. By contrast, for the highest 20% of the
population, real income rose by 31.7%, while the total
federal tax rate fell by 5.5%."
   In reality, this grossly overstates the increase in
incomes of the most affluent fifth of families, and
understates their tax rate. One "trick" here is that capital
gains are included as income in the year during which assets
are sold. This vastly exaggerates regular income, because
homes and lifetime savings are often sold in large lumps only
once or twice in a lifetime, particularly at retirement. Such
one-time capital gains surely account for the study's finding
that the number of elderly households in the most affluent
two-fifths of the population supposedly increased by an
astounding 46.4% during the bull market of the 1980s.
   Yet counting one-time gains from the sale of assets as
regular income (while also excluding rental losses) is not
nearly sufficient to account for the estimate that real
income is "expected to rise by 31.7 percent" before taxes for
the highest fifth. Instead, what mainly accounts for the
illusion of such a huge income gain is that the Ways and
Means study adopts a bizarre, purely relative definition of
real income. Estimated income in the top fifth, it argues,
rose from 8.6 times the poverty level in 1980 to 11.3 times
the poverty level in 1990. The difference between 8.6 and
11.3 equals 31.7%. That is, people in the most affluent fifth
of the population are 31.7% better-off relative to poverty
than they were in 1980. By that same standard, though, the
entire population was likewise 18.7% better-off.
   With average income up 18.7% -- relative to the poverty
level -- and the top fifth up 31.7%, the top fifth might
nonetheless be said to have beaten the average by 13
percentage points. Yet this too does not mean what so many
politicians think it means. It is not that incomes for
one-fifth of the families have risen about 13% more than
average (much less 31.7%), but rather that so many families
are now earning so much more money that it now takes a 13%
higher real income to be counted among the top 20%.
   The percentage of families earning more than $50,000, in
1987 dollars, soared from 17.5% in 1980 to 22.9% in 1987. It
is obviously impossible to stuff 22.9% of all families into
the "top 20 percent." So, the amount of income needed to
reach the "top 20 percent" had to be raised from $47,609 in
1980 (in 1987 dollars) to $52,910 in 1987. Since the incomes
of those earning between $47,609 and $52,910 were no longer
counted among the "top 20 percent," incomes of those
remaining in that top group were obviously higher -- by
definition -- since the average was no longer diluted by
incomes below $52,910. It is not that "the rich are getting
richer," but that so many couples have surpassed a level that
used to be called "rich" that they cannot all fit within the
top fifth.
   Despite the interpretation many have given reports like
this one, the truth is that the share of all federal taxes
carried by the most affluent fifth of taxpayers is
nonetheless estimated to have increased from 55.7% to 58.1%
since 1980, while the estimated burden on the poorest fifth
remained unchanged at a trivial 1.6%. Only in the topsy-turvy
world of Washington, where the worst numbers are the best
political weapons, could it be considered "unfair" to lift
more and more families above what was once the "middle
class," so that they could afford to pay a larger share of
taxes.

   Statehood Proponents Gain Favor in Puerto Rico
   As Debate Over Island's Status Heats Up Again

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Carlos Romero Barcelo often flies
to Washington to argue that Puerto Rico should become the
51st state.
   Thousands of Puerto Ricans "have bled for their country,"
he told a Senate committee last year. For example, a young
Puerto Rican pilot was killed in the 1986 bombing raid on
Libya, he said, yet the pilot's mother has no right to vote
for the president who ordered the raid because she lives in
Puerto Rico.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Juncos, a hurricane-beaten town half an hour from here,
an excited crowd gathers to hear Mr. Romero Barcelo, a former
governor of Puerto Rico, preach his statehood message with a
different emphasis. To the triumphant strains of the theme
from "Rocky," he bounces onto a makeshift stage and
enumerates statehood's potential benefits:
   A person who now receives a $90 monthly check for food
assistance would receive more than $130. Aid to families with
dependent children would more than double to $200 a month.
And, since a majority of Puerto Ricans make too little to pay
federal income tax, "just for filling out the income-tax
form, many people will get $910 back," the Yale-educated Mr.
Romero Barcelo says. Almost overcome by emotion, Juan
Hernandez, a retired accountant, shouts from the audience:
"If we were a state, billions of dollars would roll down the
street."
   What is surprising in these days of U.S. budget deficits
is that Washington's biggest proponent of sending those
dollars rolling Puerto Rico's way is President Bush. (Just
last week, a study released by the Congressional Budget
Office said that under statehood, payments to Puerto Rico
under U.S. entitlement programs would increase by $1.7
billion in 1992.)
   To the dismay of U.S. corporations here, Mr. Bush is
aligned with Mr. Romero Barcelo. It was Mr. Bush, a statehood
supporter since his days as ambassador to the United Nations,
who surprised everyone earlier last year by the last-minute
insertion of a plea for statehood in an address he read to
Congress. For President Bush, says Andrew Card, the White
House's assistant chief of staff, the debate about economics,
taxes and welfare is not the point. "It's more a
human-rights, a civil-rights issue," says Mr. Card.
   The issue of Puerto Rico's status is once again red hot
here. Legislation moving through Congress would set a 1991
referendum on the island's future, giving voters a choice
among statehood, a version of the present commonwealth system
or independence. The issue has always deeply divided Puerto
Rico. But now the tide of statehood is slowly rising.
   Sooner or later, the island will be knocking at Congress's
door. The question then will be: Is the U.S. ready to accept
as a state what is in essence a Latin American country --
densely populated, Spanish-speaking, culturally different and
poor?
   In Washington, where few are paying close attention, even
fewer think Congress will act on the referendum bill this
year. But here the status question is an obsession. Not much
is heard about the principles of justice, democracy or
patriotism Mr. Romero Barcelo elaborated on before Congress.
Instead, the most talked-about question is money and who is
going to get it -- individuals or corporations.
   Statehood advocates, for the first time in history ahead
of commonwealthers in the polls, promise a welfare bonanza.
They say the more than 50% of Puerto Rico's families that
receive money for food and other welfare assistance would get
a $2.3 billion yearly windfall.
   Opponents of statehood -- including a Who's Who of big
multinationals that, although officially neutral, lobby
vigorously behind the scenes in Washington -- say statehood
would mean the end of what has been a corporate gold mine. It
would cost about 400 U.S. companies here federal tax
exemptions valued at about $1.9 billion, and that in turn
would mean a corporate exodus costing the island many of the
300,000 direct and indirect jobs the companies provide.
   Like the statehooders, Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, the
chief of the pro-commonwealth forces, seeks a richer piece of
cake. He wants broadened powers for the commonwealth -- for
instance, the right not to apply certain federal laws to
Puerto Rico -- and more federal aid.
   Mr. Hernandez Colon says his party probably won't go along
with the plebiscite unless the commonwealth option is assured
the same welfare payments available under statehood. He's
against paying federal taxes. The governor doesn't see any
problem with this, but Congress does.
   The independentistas, a tiny minority who get only about
5% of the vote in gubernatorial elections, propose dual
Puerto Rican-U.S. citizenship for islanders born before
independence is granted.
   The debate is illuminating the complex relationship that
ties the U.S. and Puerto Rico, which the U.S. seized at the
end of the Spanish-American War in 1898. Puerto Ricans,
citizens since 1917, have fought in all U.S. wars beginning
with World War I. Yet, they can't vote for president, and are
represented in Congress by a resident commissioner in the
House who votes in committee but not on the floor. They pay
no federal income taxes, but receive most federal benefits.
(Federal transfer payments make up 31% of an average Puerto
Rican's individual income. That's twice as high as the figure
for mainland citizens.) Most Puerto Ricans have relatives in
the U.S, and more than two million are in the U.S.
   The island, with a population of 3.3 million, has a
per-capita income of $5,653, about half that of Mississippi,
the poorest state. But thanks to the U.S. factories lured
here by the tax-exemption program and the welfare
entitlements, the island, whose poverty once rivaled Haiti's,
is Fat City by Latin American and Caribbean standards.
   Last year, Puerto Rico imported about $9.4 billion of U.S.
goods and exported $14.2 billion to the mainland. And among
other measures of wealth, it boasts one of the largest and
most-profitable shopping malls in the U.S. (The J.C. Penney
Co. store at the Plaza Las Americas mall chalked up sales
last year of more than $70 million and is the 1,700-store
chain's most-profitable location.)
   Most Puerto Ricans agree that if it weren't for the U.S.
connection, the island, crowded and resource-poor, would be
locked into extreme poverty. "Puerto Ricans hang onto the
U.S. like a drowning man to a life preserver," says Alex
Maldonado, a political analyst here.
   Almost to a man, the island's cultural and intellectual
elite are independentistas. But for the vast majority of the
population, independence is a dirty word.
   Antonio Colorado, the commonwealth government's
development chief, worries about what life would be like if
statehood wins and the federal tax exemption, known as
Section 936, is repealed. He paints a grim picture --
unemployment could jump to 35% from the present 14% (low for
Puerto Rico), pushing one million Puerto Ricans to emigrate
to the U.S. in search of work.
   Last week's Congressional Budget Office study said a
phase-out of Section 936 would hurt the island's development
and eliminate as many as 100,000 jobs by the year 2000. "The
economic situation in Puerto Rico would be black without
936," says Narmo Ortiz, the head of government relations for
American Cyanamid Co.'s Puerto Rico unit.
   Beyond the dollars and cents of the status debate,
cultural issues are involved. Commonwealthers and
independentistas worry that statehood would spell the end of
Puerto Rico's distinct culture. "The question is, are people
ready to push the button that will spell the end of one of
the nationalities on the planet?" says Sen. Marco Rigau.
   As it is, the island's culture already has been bent out
of shape by its close encounter with the U.S. Sometimes the
cultural clash takes on an absurdist tone. Luis Rafael
Sanchez, a Puerto Rican writer, remembers that in 1952 the
mayor of San Juan brought a planeload of snow to Puerto Rico
so the island's poor children could see snow first hand.
   The snow, gathered by children in New Hampshire, was met
with great fanfare and escorted to a sports stadium. There,
children bused from the city's meanest slums made snowmen,
which in the hot Caribbean sun melted in the twinkling of an
eye.

   WASHINGTON -- Marriott Corp. reported first-quarter
earnings dropped 39%, reflecting continued overcapacity in
the lodging industry.
   Sales for the first quarter increased 3.5% to $1.68
billion, from $1.63 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Net income for the quarter ended March 23 fell to $28
million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $46 million, or
41 cents a share, a year earlier. Results for the
year-earlier quarter included profit from discontinued
operations of $8 million, or seven cents a share, for two
restaurant businesses that are being sold. That quarter also
included $5 million, or five cents a share, from airline
catering operations that were divested in December, and $8
million, or seven cents a share, in lodging transaction
gains.
   Excluding effects of discontinued operations and one-time
gains, Marriott said profit from continuing operations
increased 14% during the 1990 first quarter. Per-share
earnings from continuing operations increased 23% in the
latest quarter, the company said.
   J. W. Marriott Jr., chairman and president, said the
company expects to complete the sale of its Roy Rogers
fast-food restaurant during the 1990 second quarter, and has
received strong interest from potential buyers of its family
restaurant operations.
   Mr. Marriott said lodging operating profit was up 11%,
excluding transaction gains in the year-earlier quarter.
Occupancy for comparable hotels increased 2% to the upper 70%
range. Contract services operating profit was up 19% in the
first quarter, excluding gains from divested airline catering
operations.

   Winnebago Dismisses Conner as Chief,
   As Founder Again Is Tough to Please

   The revolving door to the chief executive's office at
Winnebago Industries Inc. took another spin as the motor home
maker fired Richard D. Conner four months after naming him to
the post.
   As it has done in the past, the board named John K.
Hanson, the 76-year-old chairman and founder, to run the
Forest City, Iowa, company -- at least on an interim basis.
Mr. Hanson, who with his wife controls about 46% of the
company's stock, becomes "acting chief executive."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest management shuffle comes amid signs of growing
problems at Winnebago, including a slump in its basic
business of making motor homes, and continued losses at
Cycle-Sat, a pet project of Mr. Hanson that transmits
commercials to television stations via satellite.
   Winnebago wouldn't go beyond a brief statement that it
"terminated the employment" of Mr. Conner. But the action
heightens concern among analysts and a growing legion of
former executives over the apparent inability of Mr. Hanson
to get along with his top executives.
   Among the seven executives Mr. Hanson has ousted from the
top spot over the past 15 years is his son, John V. Hanson.
The son eventually rejoined the company and became deputy
chairman before leaving again last year.
   "The theme that emerges is whoever runs that place has to
run it to the complete approval of John K., and if not, he
sees fit to find someone he likes," said Frank Rolfes, an
analyst who follows Winnebago for Dain Bosworth Inc. in
Minneapolis.
   Mr. Conner was named chief executive officer and president
in December after a stint heading the company's Cycle-Sat
unit. For 14 months before that, Winnebago had no chief
executive -- a management committee that included as many as
10 people ran Winnebago. The appointment of the committee
followed the ouster of Gerald W. Gilbert, who was fired in
1988 after his moves to reform the manufacturing process
angered production workers and Mr. Hanson.
   In the six months ended Feb. 24, Winnebago had a loss of
nearly $10 million, or 40 cents a share. Declining demand for
motor homes sent revenue plummeting 32% from a year earlier,
to $159.6 million. Also hurting results were continued losses
at Cycle-Sat and start-up costs for a new division that makes
commercial vehicles.
   Despite Mr. Hanson's penchant for dabbling in the stock
market, one of Mr. Conner's early goals was to turn the
company's $20 million portfolio into instruments with "very
low risk." But he apparently failed to do that quickly, as
the company had a loss of $1 million before taxes on its
financial investments in its latest quarter.
   Winnebago recently liquidated its marketable securities
and sold dealer receivables to help pay off short-term debt.
The action came after negotiations with financial
institutions failed to achieve what the company called
"acceptable credit terms."
   When appointed in December, Mr. Conner sounded optimistic
about his ability to get along with the founder, despite the
troubles of others before him. Referring to Mr. Hanson as
Winnebago's "coach," Mr. Conner said he planned to talk
frequently by telephone to Mr. Hanson at the chairman's home
in Florida.
   "I don't believe we've ever had a cross word," Mr. Conner
said at the time.
   Neither he nor Mr. Hanson returned phone calls.

   Even in Bulgaria, Spring Is Coming

   SOFIA, Bulgaria -- After three months of wrangling with
the emerging opposition parties, the Bulgarian Communist
Party pledged itself to free multiparty elections in June and
renamed itself the Bulgarian Socialist Party on April 3. At
the same time, the Communist-controlled Parliament amended
the constitution so as to eliminate the words "socialist" and
"communist" from the text and elected Petr Mladenov, the
Communist leader who precipitated these reforms, to the new
position of president of the republic.
   But Bulgaria's success in reaching democracy depends not
on the goodwill of the old regime, but on the profusion of
democratic forces that have sprung up since Todor Zhivkov,
the man who ruled Bulgaria since 1954, was deposed on Nov.
10. Many of these forces can be found in a five-story
building on Sofia's Knyaz Dondukov Boulevard, where scores of
young Bulgarians briskly move from office to office. On one
floor is the near-libertarian Radical Democratic Party; on
another is the Social Democratic Party and its more militant
non-Marxist fraction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About a mile away, on Rakovsky street, in the former home
of the Bulgarian Industrial Society, is the office of the
United Democratic Front -- an umbrella group that has united
a broad coalition of democratic political parties,
environmental groups, student groups and free trade unions.
The Democratic Front's chairman, Zhelyu Zhelev, is
unabashedly optimistic about the prospects for democracy: "If
we hold together a broad coalition of all democratic forces,
we can change everything in Bulgaria within a few months of
taking power. By the end of the year, we will resolve all the
political and economic transformations necessary for
democracy."
   The Front promises to restore private ownership excluding
only mineral resources, water, forests and pastures. Shares
in most state enterprises would be given to privately held
pension, insurance and health funds. Those bits of the state
sector that the Front does not intend to dispose of would be
transferred from the national government to the
municipalities. The minimum wage and unemployment insurance
would be retained; otherwise, the Front intends to plunge
into the market.
   One of the country's most powerful democratic leaders is
Konstantin Trenchev, who heads Bulgaria's independent trade
union federation, Podkrepa (Support). Only last summer, Mr.
Trenchev was in jail. Today, with his movement grown to
150,000 members, Mr. Trenchev senses victory. "By the time
elections come in June, Podkrepa can have as many as 500,000
members. I am confident that we will win."
   On the streets of Sofia, Mr. Trenchev is stopped every few
minutes by wellwishers, by those seeking help or by union
colleagues. In restaurants, his arrival turns heads. His
sharp interventions at televised roundtable discussions with
the authorities have made a celebrity of him.
   Mr. Trenchev is a strong admirer of the free market. "When
we take power in June we must move decisively to dismantle
all the structures of totalitarianism. We have to make a dash
for the market, which is the normal state of economy. We must
move from a pathological system to a normal one. And the
social tension in the country is already enormous. I'm for
the Balcerowicz Plan," he says, referring to the program of
currency convertibility and subsidy elimination adopted by
Polish finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz.
   Until the elections, the old authorities are still in
charge. Mr. Zhelev worries that outside Sofia and other major
urban centers, the opposition program is still not well
known. Party bosses still rule like lords over the small
peasant communities in the provinces. Above all, the party
retains control of the media: television through the state
monopoly, and the press through its control of newsprint
allocations. While the party's papers together print 3
million copies a day, the UDF paper, Democratsiya, had been
permitted to print only 70,000. After a March 12 rally for
more newsprint drew 150,000 protesters, the UDF was permitted
300,000 copies.
   Nevertheless, the communists' commitment to reform might
look more sincere if each successive act of liberalization
were not so obviously stamped "Made in the U.S.S.R." "If
Moscow passes land reform legislation or joint-venture laws,
Bulgaria passes similar legislation within a matter of days,"
a diplomat here observed.
   Still, the secret police are not much in evidence and the
ordinary police now lackadaisically enforce the decrees that
restrict demonstrations, public meetings and street
merchants. The traffic police in their imposing watch towers
blithely pass the day reading newspapers where they once
flagged down drivers and pedestrians for the least
infraction.
   The government's lingering attachment to central economic
controls is the opposition's ultimate weapon. Newsprint is
not the only item in short supply. Industrial output declined
by over 10% in the three months after the toppling of Mr.
Zhivkov. Price controls restrain nominal inflation to around
10%, but more and more basic foodstuffs -- sometimes milk and
at other times even bread -- are vanishing from shops for
weeks on end. Under these circumstances, the population is
likely to vote for change as soon as it gets the chance.
   With some justice, it was the communists' campaign of
repression against the country's Turkish minority that
precipitated the economic crisis. Persecution persuaded more
than 300,000 Turks, most of them farmers, to flee Bulgaria
last year. Their fields were left unplanted and soil untilled
-- and the result was, soon enough, the food shortage from
which Bulgaria now suffers. This crisis provoked a wave of
industrial unrest, which in turn persuaded the authorities to
relax their control of daily life.
   The opposition is eager for Western assistance: Election
observers to help ensure a fair count or a visit by a
prominent U.S. political figure -- such as Sen. Edward
Kennedy, or Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan. An entertainer
such as Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson or Joan Baez might be
even better.
   But the opposition, which is indignant over the
squandering of billions of dollars in Western loans by the
Zhivkov regime, also seems to agree that economic assistance
should come only after the democratic process has become
irreversible.

   FCC Approves Plan to Tune Up Ailing AM Radio Band

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
launched a crusade to rescue ailing AM radio.
   The commission, in a series of 5-0 votes, adopted a
package of engineering changes and proposals to improve the
quality of AM service, including opening new bandwidth,
1605-1705 kilohertz, for AM stations. With 5,000 stations, AM
radio has been plagued with congestion and interference,
particularly during nighttime hours, and has been battered by
competition from FM stations. The agency plans not only to
expand the bandwidth, but also to weed out the overgrown AM
garden over the next 10 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Adding bandwidth would require radio manufacturers to
modify their products because receivers on the market today
stop picking up signals between 1600 and 1620 kilohertz.
Manufacturers have already begun planning for the additional
bandwidth because the FCC signaled its intention to authorize
its use in the U.S., and Canada and Mexico have already
approved its use for AM radio, said William Hassinger,
assistant chief for engineering of the FCC's Mass Media
Bureau.
   Under the proposals, the commission would encourage 25 to
30 existing AM stations nationwide that are causing the most
static to move into the expanded band. It would also give
broadcasters incentives to improve AM service, such as
allowing licensees to negotiate among themselves to reduce
interference. The commission suggested it could provide tax
breaks to AM licensees who receive payments from other
stations to reduce their service areas or turn in their
licenses.
   Further, the FCC said it could ease its multiple-ownership
rules to allow licensees to own AM stations with overlapping
service areas if one of the stations cuts down its
interference with other AM stations. And it said it is
considering banning AM-FM simulcast stations.
   Among other steps, the commission changed some rules to
improve AM reception, such as modifying the way it calculates
skywave and groundwave field strength. The new skywave model
-- a key to improving AM service during nighttime hours --
gives engineers more accurate information on the likelihood
of interference.
   The FCC's actions drew immediate praise from the National
Association of Broadcasters, which called the proposals
"sweeping and historic." The NAB said broadcasters "are
encouraged by the FCC's far-reaching changes and proposals
and look forward to reviewing" the plans.
   William Sanders, president of KICD/ KICD-FM, in Spencer,
Iowa, and chairman of the NAB's radio board, said the
commission's actions will improve all classes of AM stations.
The changes, he said, "look to the future of possibly radical
changes in the currently dense population of the AM band" to
reduce interference and make AM radio a more competitive
service.
   For years, broadcasters have been complaining about
interference on the AM band. Earlier this year, the FCC
conducted a daylong hearing to explore ways to improve AM
service. Yesterday's proposals grew out of that hearing and
voluminous proposals from the industry.
   The commission will accept public comments on all the
proposals before deciding on final rules.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes noted that Congress is also
taking up legislation to improve AM radio, and that the
agency "is looking forward" to working with lawmakers. As the
AM industry moves toward stereo broadcasting, he said, the
commission's actions help "set the technological stage." In a
competitive, high-tech market, the chairman warned, "being
second best isn't good enough."
   Commissioner Andrew Barrett, a former state public
utilities regulator from Illinois, raised concerns about
shifting channels from the existing AM band to the expanded
AM band. "I understand the desire to remove interference and
congestion from the existing AM band," he said. "However, the
cure for AM may be the denial of opportunity for new
entrants, including minorities, women and public
broadcasters." The commission, he said, needs "to ensure that
minorities are not precluded from ownership opportunities as
this commission allocates new spectrum."
   Commissioner Barrett said minorities own only about 3% of
the nation's 11,000 broadcast properties. Just what the FCC
can do to change this isn't clear. The FCC's
minority-preference programs, which gives members of minority
groups and women an edge in competing for broadcast licenses,
currently are under review by the Supreme Court.

   A big buy program and an upbeat earnings outlook for
International Business Machines put some sparkle into an
otherwise dull stock market, while bond prices eased in a
shortened pre-holiday session.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 22.07 points to
2751.80. But the gains came on light volume and were
concentrated in blue-chip issues. Broader market averages
gained only modestly. For the week, the industrial average
rose 34.68 points. The stock market is closed today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bond trading was muted too, with little to drive the
market ahead of today's release of the March producer price
index, a measure of wholesale inflation. The bond market was
open only part of yesterday and is closed today for the Good
Friday holiday. The dollar ended narrowly higher in late
afternoon New York trading.
   Analysts said a buy program early in the day boosted stock
prices sharply. But trading activity quickly waned after the
initial flurry, leaving prices stalled at the higher levels.
Speculation that IBM's first-quarter profit, to be reported
Monday, will be better than expected, helped sustain the
higher prices, as did demand for blue-chip oil stocks. Smith
Barney, Harris Upham raised its estimate of IBM's
first-quarter results by 10 cents a share to $1.70 a share
and reiterated a buy recommendation.
   A report yesterday that retail sales in March fell 0.6%
had little noticeable impact on the stock and bond markets,
although economists had predicted sales would be flat.
Similarly, economists are looking for the March producer
price index to be about flat.
   The dollar remained locked in a narrow trading range.
Rumors that the Bank of Japan might push interest rates
higher during the long weekend failed to depress the U.S.
currency against the yen. Traders said central-bank
intervention in the past week to support the yen against the
dollar hasn't had much effect. But they said a return to
normal trading volume next week will be necessary to
determine the underlying strength of the dollar.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices climbed in light trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 142.5 million shares. Advancing
issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 908 to 573.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices slipped. The benchmark 30-year Treasury fell
less than a quarter of a point, or less than $2.50 per $1,000
face amount. The yield rose to 8.59%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar edged higher. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6724 marks and 158.18 yen, vs.
1.6715 marks and 158 yen Wednesday.

   Scientists Say Alaska Oil Spill Cleanup
   Would Have Benefited From Microbe Use

   Alaskan shores contaminated by oil from the tanker Exxon
Valdez could have been cleaned far more effectively with a
new detergent-producing microbe than the hot water spray that
was used, according to a group of microbiologists.
   The researchers from the biotechnology division of the
U.S. Army Chemical Research and the University of Illinois
said the new microbe performed successfully in a test on
oil-soaked gravel and stones collected from Prince William
Sound, the site of the Exxon Valdez spill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Our results show that the microbial surfactant can remove
three times as much oil as water can," said A.M. Chakrabarty,
a microbiologist at the university, who led the experiment.
Mr. Chakrabarty, while at General Electric Co., developed the
first genetically engineered microbe to be patented.
   The experiment with Valdez oil, however, didn't involve a
genetically altered microbe. A public unease over the release
of such man-made organisms in open environment has prevented
the use of such bacteria. The researchers instead used a
strain of natural bacteria, called Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
that was forced through a natural selection process to live
on solid and liquid hydrocarbons that are the building blocks
in oil.
   Mr. Chakrabarty also said that by the time his group
finished its experiment Exxon was already far into its
cleaning process with warm water jet sprays and an army of
scrubbers. He said his team nevertheless suggested the
microbial solution to the oil company, but "we didn't get a
favorable response."
   Robert Mastracchio, technical manager at Exxon Alaska
Operations in Anchorage, said that only 74 miles of the 1,089
miles of coastal lines Exxon cleaned last year were suitable
for biological remediation. The company has been using
special chemical fertilizers there to stimulate the local
bacteria to speed up the degradation nature does on its own.
He said that Exxon didn't think "it was necessary" to
introduce foreign bacteria. "It raises questions about what
impact it will have on the environment," he said.
   The bacteria clean up the oil just as common dishwashing
soap pulls grease out of water. Oil is insoluble in water.
But the soap emulsifies the grease into tiny droplets that
can be grabbed by water molecules and dragged down the drain.
Using the same trick, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa first
releases a soap-like surfactant to emulsify the oil into tiny
droplets. That allows the bacteria to take up the oil, which
they then convert into carbon dioxide and water.
   In their experiment, the researchers washed paired batches
of the oil-coated Alaskan gravels, one batch in each pair
with water and the other with a 1% solution of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa surfactant. They then repeated the process at
several different temperatures on a scale from 10 to 80
degrees Celsius. In their report, published in the latest
issue of Bio/Technology journal, the researchers said the
surfactant removed at least twice as much oil as did water at
every temperature tested.
   The surfactant removed three and a half times as much oil
as water at 40 degrees, and 2.4 times at 50 degrees.
   The report suggested that surfactant may be particularly
useful at low temperatures, which make oil dispersal with
water difficult. At 30 degrees, for instance, water removes
only 5% of the oil. At that temperature, the surfactant
solution removes three times as much oil within a minute
after contact. Mr. Chakrabarty said that higher concentration
of the microbial solution cleans more oil, but adds
significantly to the cost.
   He said a big advantage the microbial surfactant has over
chemical surfactants is that it's nontoxic and biodegradable.
The oil released with warm water tends to go back into the
sea unless special measures are taken to contain it.
   "We think that microbial surfactant is the only ecological
acceptable way to tackle oil spills in coastal areas," Mr.
Chakrabarty said.
   The use of microbes to treat oil pollution and hazardous
waste, as well as for oil recovery from deep wells, is
getting increasing attention from researchers. That's because
traditional remedies, which involve chemical treatment or
incineration, are either expensive or environmentally unsafe.
But environmentalists and ecologists' fear that altered
bacteria, however natural, may upset the balance of nature.
The opposition is even more fierce to the use of genetically
engineered microbes, which can do specific tasks more
effectively than natural bacteria can.
   Mr. Chakrabarty's genetically altered microbe, which won
the first patent in 1981 after a celebrated Supreme Court
decision, is languishing in a GE laboratory. Herman
Finkbeiner, manager of GE's biological sciences laboratory,
said GE decided to suspend further work on the microbe
largely because of public concern.

   Chase Banks on Limited Partnerships

   Credit-Card Users
   Are Target Market

   The nation's second-biggest banking company is plunging
into one of Wall Street's most tarnished businesses: limited
partnerships.
   Putting its reputation on the line, giant Chase Manhattan
Corp. says it plans to offer public limited partnerships to
its customers, including more than nine million credit-card
holders, later this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bank will also expand its roster of privately placed
partnerships for wealthy, supposedly sophisticated investors,
an area in which it says it has already raised about $75
million since 1988.
   Chase's move comes as the limited-partnership business,
which boomed in the 1980s, continues to unravel.
   With mounting investor lawsuits and arbitration claims
over partnerships that have soured, sales of new public
partnerships have dropped drastically. First-quarter sales
fell 41.6% from a year earlier, to $990.2 million -- the
worst quarterly figures in eight years, according to Robert
A. Stanger &amp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., partnership-research
firm.
   Designed as long-term investments, partnerships are a way
for investors to put money in everything from real estate to
movies; investors are supposed to get some current income
plus profits when the partnership liquidates, usually in
about 10 years. The risks are substantial because an
investor's money is tied up for such a long period of time,
and there is no guarantee that an investor will get any money
back.
   Some limited-partnership experts say they're surprised
that Chase, which is second in assets only to industry leader
Citicorp, is expanding activity in limited partnerships just
as chastened Wall Street brokerage firms are pulling back.
   The timing couldn't be worse, says Scott G. Miller, a
Houston partnership analyst. "It would be like a manufacturer
going into the Hula-Hoop business because it's bottomed out.
They {Chase} haven't caught on that the {partnership}
syndication industry is dead. It's rotting in the coffin."
   But Chase officials say that by being careful, they can
succeed in an industry in which Wall Street has stumbled.
   "The fact of the matter is, the partnership is a very
efficient investment vehicle as part of an investor's
portfolio," says Joseph E. Vincent, a Chase vice president
who runs the bank's investment-products group. "There are
material advantages to owning an investment in this form that
aren't in other forms."
   As Chase sees it, the partnership industry is
controversial and misunderstood these days, because Wall
Street and other purveyors of partnership investments sold
poorly designed products and made unjustified claims.
   Bank officials say they are being "very selective" in the
products they offer. For example, the five deals the bank has
offered privately came from 100 that it reviewed.
   Mr. Vincent says the uproar over partnerships -- which
recently caused Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., formerly Wall
Street's top seller of partnerships, to stop originating new
offerings -- creates an opportunity for Chase. "Not many
people are called by banks offering to sell limited
partnerships," he notes.
   "When you buy from a broker, there's an implied caveat
emptor. When you buy from a bank, there's an implied
warranty," says Mr. Vincent. But he stresses that Chase's
sales force won't make the mistake of implying to customers
that partnership investments are risk-free. "We make sure all
the risk factors are right up on page one," he says.
   The Chase move is part of a trend in which commercial
banks are selling more and more investment products to
clients, as the regulatory walls between banks and brokerage
firms continue to crumble.
   "Banks are trying to do everything else brokerage firms
are doing. They can register their people to sell
partnerships easier than they can to sell stocks," says
Fuhrman Nettles, a vice president of Stanger. Still, Chase
could face rough going, Mr. Nettles says. "Even if you had
the best replacement for bottled beer, it would be hard to
sell it with the barrage of information coming out, almost
all of it negative."
   The private-placement limited partnerships that Chase has
offered so far require a $50,000 minimum investment. Its most
profitable deal, completed just this week, was LINC Income
Partners II, a medical-equipment leasing partnership in which
Chase raised $16.7 million acting as co-placement agent.
   Chase says it may expand its private deal offerings to oil
and gas, commodity-futures, real estate, venture capital and
"media."
   Public partnerships, meanwhile, will allow Chase to tap a
wider market, because they can be sold to small investors,
often at $5,000 to $10,000 a pop. Chase says it wants to sell
as many different products as possible, and partnerships
create opportunities to sell other products to its customers.
   Mr. Vincent stresses, however, that his sales force
doesn't work for commissions as Wall Street brokers do, so
they won't be pushing products on unsuitable investors. He
says Chase won't get involved in "high-risk" deals -- which
the bank defines as those that promise an annual return of
more than 20% to 25%. And he says Chase "requires the general
partners we work with to have proven track records."
   Mr. Miller, the Houston partnership analyst, says Chase's
equipment-leasing partnerships have been selling well only
because many investors don't understand them. Real estate
partnerships have received the most negative publicity, but
"leasing partnerships have always been worse. It's just a
more gradual death," Mr. Miller says. Fewer leasing deals
have returned "even the passbook savings rate than any other
kind of partnership."
   Chase's Mr. Vincent says it's unfair to tar all
partnerships or a certain form because of past failures.
"There are good stocks and there's bad stocks, and junk bonds
and government bonds. And within any product, there's a range
of quality."
   While leasing partnerships have high yields, much of that
is a return of investors' own principal, because the
equipment is depreciating in value over the partnership's
seven to 12-year life. In the end, when those assets are
sold, investors rarely see any profits.
   Mr. Nettles of Stanger, however, is more optimistic about
Chase's timing. "If you've got a better mousetrap, I guess
you can sell it almost any time."
   Despite the partnership industry's current woes, Mr.
Nettles predicts the business "will slowly turn around, but
when I don't know. Syndicators who haven't gotten into
trouble by now will probably survive, but they aren't
necessarily going to be as big as they were."

   When a retired Air Force officer dropped into the Veterans
Administration hospital in Dallas in 1985, he only wanted his
hearing aid checked. Instead, he became the focus of an
assault on coronary heart disease.
   The veteran, known in medical literature only as G.R., was
told he needed surgery to correct a hearing disorder, and
thus was given a pre-operative blood test. It showed an
abnormally high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the
"bad" form of cholesterol that predisposes people to heart
attack or stroke. The finding led in turn to Mr. R's
volunteering for an experiment involving a then-obscure
cholesterol-lowering drug.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That, he recalls, "was when they found out I had this
screwball thing" -- a previously unknown defect in his LDL
cholesterol. It was a finding that has helped scientists
understand how, in some cases, cholesterol comes to be
elevated.
   To heart researchers, that was excitement enough. But over
the last several months scientists in Dallas and San
Francisco have made even more startling discoveries. Mr. R's
defect is inherited; he has four blood relatives with the
same defective LDL cholesterol. Other persons have been found
with the same flaw.
   And, most recently, scientists have identified a minute
alteration in a gene that they think is responsible.
   Researchers now are trying to measure the prevalence of
Mr. R's defect in the population. A conservative guess is
that it is found in one in every 500 Americans. These people
are at high risk to develop coronary heart disease, or
atherosclerosis, the gradual clogging of the arteries with
fatty deposits.
   Mr. R's defect is thought to be just one of perhaps scores
of genetic flaws that leave people prone to atherosclerosis,
a condition that claims 500,000 lives a year. This
susceptibility "varies widely," and "the basis for it is
largely genetic," says Jan Breslow, a molecular geneticist at
Rockefeller University in New York.
   Uncovering more of these genetic defects would give
scientists priceless insight on exactly how cholesterol in
the blood often leads to artery blockage. It would also point
the way to new therapies. At the least, discovery of more
such gene defects should soon make it possible to identify
early in life, perhaps at birth, people likely to get heart
disease decades later; then they could be taught from
childhood to eat a low-fat diet, avoid cigarettes, get a lot
of exercise and otherwise behave so as to retard
atherosclerosis.
   For researchers on this trail, Mr. R's case is emerging as
a landmark. At the time he showed up at the Dallas VA
hospital, two University of Texas scientists associated with
the hospital had recently spotted the footprints of one of
these mysterious genetic defects during human experiments
with a cholesterol-lowering drug called mevinolin. Mevinolin,
later renamed lovastatin, has become one of Merck &amp; Co.'s
biggest sellers under the brand name Mevacor. But for several
years following its 1978 discovery, Merck feared it might
cause harmful side effects, and abandoned human trials. "At
the time it looked like mevinolin would never get off the
ground," recalls Scott M. Grundy, of the University of Texas
Health Sciences Center in Dallas.
   He was among a handful of researchers who felt Merck was
being unduly cautious. They thought the drug had promise for
treating a rare disorder known as familial
hypercholesterolemia (FH), an inherited form of high blood
cholesterol that leads to heart attacks early in life.
   "We went to Merck and asked for the drug to try" on FH
patients, Dr. Grundy says. "They said they would give it to
us, but we would have to get our own clearance" from the Food
and Drug Administration. Another researcher, D. Roger
Illingworth at the Oregon Health Sciences University in
Portland, also decided to launch a clinical trial in FH
patients.
   Where other drugs had failed, mevinolin worked; LDL
cholesterol dropped 30% to 40%. Prodded by the insistent
Dallas and Portland researchers, Merck resumed human trials
of the compound in 1984.
   Dr. Grundy and a colleague, Gloria Lena Vega, next decided
to test it in more typical coronary patients, people who had
moderately high cholesterol levels but not FH. The results
were puzzling.
   Mevinolin was known to work in FH patients by boosting the
activity of "receptors" on liver cells that pulled LDL
cholesterol out of the passing blood. In four of the first 10
non-FH patients they tested, mevinolin seemed to work: The
rate at which LDL cholesterol disappeared from the
bloodstream jumped sharply. But in the other six, no such
effect was seen; LDL cholesterol continued to disappear from
the blood only slowly.
   Perhaps, the two Texas scientists speculated, there was
something strange about these volunteers' LDL cholesterol
that prevented it from sticking to the receptors on their
liver cells.
   It was about this time that Mr. R checked into the VA
hospital for ear surgery. His checkup showed a total blood
cholesterol level of 323 milligrams (per deciliter), he
recalls, or about 100 higher than doctors thought advisable.
"After my operation, they {Drs. Grundy and Vega} called me
and asked me to get in this experiment," Mr. R says. He and
14 other patients soon found themselves spending two weeks in
a special ward.
   The scientists first measured how fast the volunteers' LDL
cholesterol was cleared from the bloodstream. They then took
LDL samples from medical students who had normal cholesterol
levels, injected this presumably normal LDL into Mr. R and
his fellow volunteers, and measured how fast it cleared the
bloodstream.
   Mr. R was one of five volunteers in whom there was a
marked difference in the clearance of the two LDL samples.
The donated cholesterol was rapidly cleared from Mr. R's
bloodstream, indicating the receptors on his liver cells were
functioning normally. But his own LDL cholesterol cleared far
more slowly. There had to be something peculiar about it.
   Dr. Grundy described these intriguing results to a
conference in Australia in 1985. One listener who perked up
was Robert Mahley, director of the Gladstone Foundation
Laboratories at the University of California, San Francisco.
"We were both seated in the front row, and when Scott
finished his presentation he sat down beside me," Dr. Mahley
recalls. "I turned to him and said, `Scott, I think you have
the patients we've been looking for.' "
   He and colleagues in San Francisco were deeply involved in
one of the molecular mysteries of LDL cholesterol: figuring
out the structure of its protein component. Since fat and
cholesterol don't mix with water, the body, in order to
transport them around in the bloodstream, wraps LDL
cholesterol packets in a protein that can be grabbed by the
watery part of the blood. The protein is known as
apolipoprotein B100, or simply apo B-100.
   Over the years, scientists had seen strong hints that apo
B-100 wasn't identical in all humans -- that there might, in
fact, be a dozen or more different versions. They suspected
that some of these variations could explain why some people
had high LDL cholesterol levels and coronary disease. Like
all proteins, apo B-100 is the product of a gene, so the
variations in apo B-100 would reflect inherited variations.
   Dr. Mahley and his colleagues wanted to look at an
inherited variation of apo B100 associated with high LDL and
see how it differed from other apo B-100. Perhaps one of Dr.
Grundy's volunteers had the variation they were seeking.
   Mr. R, it turned out, was a prime candidate, partly
because he had living relatives -- a son, two brothers, three
nieces and a grandniece -- who could be tested to see if his
strange LDL cholesterol was passed through the family
according to the laws of inheritance.
   At this point, Drs. Grundy and Vega encountered a social
problem that may become common as scientists uncover the
genetic susceptibilities to diseases like heart disease or
cancer: the question of genetic labeling. Some of Mr. R's
relatives provided blood samples only with great reluctance,
fearing their careers might be hurt if an employer found out
their family had a predisposition to coronary disease. (When
Mr. R was interviewed he had no objection to use of his name,
but Dr. Vega wanted him kept anonymous to protect the
relatives.)
   Samples of the R family's LDL cholesterol were forwarded
to the Gladstone Laboratories in San Francisco. Scientists
there faced a formidable problem. Apo B-100 is an incredibly
long string of more than 4,500 simple amino-acid molecules,
making it one of the largest and most complex proteins known.
The Gladstone scientists had to find out where, along this
molecular superstring, there might be an alteration that
could account for Mr. R's high LDL.
   In a test-tube experiment, they found that Mr. R's LDL
cholesterol barely stuck to liver-cell receptors. This
indicated the problem was in the portion of apo B-100 that
was supposed to bind to the receptor. Other experiments then
traced the defective "binding site" to a stretch of about 100
amino acids located about three-quarters of the way down the
amino acid string.
   Mr. R's apo B-100 genes were then plucked out of a blood
cell by another Gladstone team. Like anyone, he had two
copies of the gene, one from each parent. The researchers
essentially laid the two copies side by side and began
sifting through them, molecule by molecule. One copy appeared
to be identical to what scientists had seen in others and
hence was presumed to be normal.
   But in the other copy of the apo B-100 gene, researchers
found that a single molecule was different. This minute
defect caused the variant gene to produce a protein that was
also different, by a single amino-acid molecule. Mr. R, in
other words, had two types of apo B-100 circulating in his
blood that differed by only a single amino acid out of
thousands.
   When the researchers probed through the genes of Mr. R's
seven living relatives they found four with the same
single-molecule difference in their apo B-100 gene and
protein. Mr. R and his two brothers had inherited the variant
copy of the apo B-100 gene from one of their parents,
probably the father, who died of pneumonia; "my mother lived
100 years," Mr. R says. A brother also had passed the gene to
one of his three daughters, who, in turn, passed it to her
daughter.
   The evidence so far indicates strongly that about half of
the LDL cholesterol in Mr. R and his affected relatives is
unable to stick strongly to liver-cell receptors because of
this tiny variation. The liver can't pull the LDL out of the
blood quickly, and it backs up in the bloodstream. The
discovery indicates that the tiniest molecular change deep
inside a gene can sabotage the battle against coronary heart
disease.
   The experiment to add the final bit of proof of this
theory is now under way, Dr. Mahley says. The Gladstone
biologists are trying to induce the single-molecule mutation
in cells in the test tube, to see if they will produce an apo
B-100 that fails to bind securely to the liver-cell
receptors.
   Meanwhile, the call is now out to U.S. and European
clinics to check for others who might have the same genetic
defect. "So far, none have been found in Scandinavia but a
few have been found in England," suggesting there may be
geographical or ethnic differences in the prevalence of the
defect, Dr. Grundy says.
   Among the more than 1,100 people checked so far, 10 have
been found with the same defect as seen in Mr. R, and each
has one or more relatives with it, Dr. Mahley says. A random
sampling of the population to determine the defect's
prevalence is under way.
   Mr. R himself hasn't yet had any signs of heart trouble,
but one brother had a heart attack several years ago and the
other more recently had a stroke. "I'm on two of these
lovastatin pills a day and I don't eat any eggs or fatty
meats," Mr. R says. His cholesterol level has dropped by 100
milligrams to the 220 to 230 range, reducing his odds of a
heart attack to the moderate to average risk range.

   For years, I've watched TV network correspondents as they
stand forlornly in the driveway outside the White House,
reporting with almost pathetic panache whatever scraps of
information can be gleaned from inside, usually from some
mysterious individual named "Sources."
   Night after night, in winter cold, summer heat and
constant carbon monoxide they keep their lonely vigils, and
not just in the White House driveway but in similarly swell
driveways all over Washington; State Department, Pentagon,
Justice, you name it. From these limousine limbos they
breathlessly pass along whatever "Sources" has confided that
particular day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All of this gives rise to some troubling questions that
might even call for a congressional investigation, since the
TV gang in the Capitol Hill driveway also churn out no end of
tidbits slipped to them by "Sources."
   Why are these free-born Americans confined (I would assume
against their wills) to federal driveways? Why are they kept
outside like pets that have never been housebroken? Besides
the civil-rights implications of their non-admittance, the
practice seems downright inhumane.
   Imagine the demeaning way these obviously sensitive souls
must spend their days -- making forced conversation with
bored chauffeurs waiting to pick up VIPs, being shooed off
the grass by groundskeepers when they absent-mindedly wander
off the asphalt, lost in bitter self-reproach as they recall
lost opportunities to become chiropractors or undertakers.
   But the most troubling questions derive from the
apparently all-pervasive power of "Sources" to control
information flowing from the nation's capital. Since there
must be many "Sources," is this some new Mafioso-type family
specializing not in loan sharking, numbers or protection, but
in news dissemination?
   Once in a while we hear of "Authoritative" or "Reliable"
Sources, but there have to be other members of the clan.
Somewhere behind all those federal facades there must be a
Bill Sources, Herb Sources, Doris, Noreen, Hank or even Frank
Sources; but Sources all.
   Let's get all these Sources outside in the light of day
and find out who they. At the same time we can let those TV
talkers inside. It's only right and besides, with no Sources,
what harm can they do?

   SUMMIT SNAG? Stiffer Soviet stances threaten to delay arms
agreements.
   Soviet concessions on long-range missiles have stopped,
U.S. officials say. Meanwhile, Soviet negotiators at talks in
Vienna on conventional forces appear to have gone without
instructions from Moscow for weeks. The result may be to slow
goals of wrapping up a strategic-arms treaty by the
Bush-Gorbachev summit in late May and a conventional-weapons
accord by November.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Baker and other Bush advisers remain upbeat. They dismiss
as bargaining tactics recent Soviet efforts to backtrack on
tough issues such as sea-launched U.S. cruise missiles. U.S.
officials predict easier going when Baker goes to Moscow for
a last round of strategic-arms negotiations in May.
   Still, the White House begins sending out signals that a
full strategic-arms treaty wasn't expected by the summit.
                                                                                                       

   DEFENSE CUTS are put on hold in the Senate until Nunn
takes the lead.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee chairman carefully
avoids tipping his hand about which weapons he wants cut,
angering contractors and other lawmakers. Budget Committee
leaders wait for clear signals from him before voting to
shrink Bush defense proposals. Friends say the Georgia
senator is analyzing Pentagon data and taking political
soundings before acting.
   Nunn's support for two mobile nuclear missiles may be
eroding. He urges the White House to trade away the
rail-based MX missile for Soviet concessions to stop
deploying their own versions. He is likely to seek cuts in
Bush's $3 billion request for the MX and Midgetman missiles.
He hints about trimming requests for Air Force F-16 jets and
Army anti-tank missiles.
                                                                                                       

   NEW DOUBTS about the economy add to worries about the
deficit and S&amp;Ls.
   Recent signs of weakness mean the White House may have to
revise its economic forecast downward in July. If so, the
resulting budget cuts needed to fit the deficit target could
be so large that Congress will try to get around the
Gramm-Rudman law. A new survey of business economists finds
only 20% expect next year's deficit to actually end up below
the target.
   A weaker economy also worsens the thrifts problem. Real
estate seized by the feds proves hard to sell. S&amp;L deposits
grow slowly. And the government pays higher interest rates
than expected to borrow the billions needed for the bailout.
Heavy short-term borrowing for working capital will swell the
midsummer deficit forecast under Gramm-Rudman rules.
   One possible deficit quick fix: The administration soon
may back a bill to exclude working capital from Gramm-Rudman
calculations.
                                                                                                       

   IRAN-CONTRA PROSECUTOR Walsh plans a report to Congress
that could provide new insights about former President
Reagan's role in the scandal. Walsh is considering a broader
report than is required by law in an effort to shed light on
secret White House actions that remain murky despite seven
convictions.

drug Zantac made in his state, Zantac's British-based
producer dickers to make the drug also in a Soviet factory in
partnership with state-owned Karl Marx Kombinate. The Helms
bill, an aide notes, affects only the U.S. unit that makes
the drug here.
                                                                                                       

   CLASHES LOOM on the House Commerce Committee between
chairman Dingell and Rep. Waxman on responding to the
generic-drugs scandal. Waxman aides seek uniform penalties
for misdeeds by makers of generic and of brand-name drugs.
Dingell's staff, hoping to avert a fight with the
pharmaceutical industry, would limit rules to generic drugs.
                                                                                                       

   CIVIL-RIGHTS GROUPS press Bush not to oppose a bill to
supersede five Supreme Court rulings making job bias harder
to prove because he objects to parts of the measure. Activist
Ralph Neas warns that Bush would join "Andrew Johnson and
Ronald Reagan as the only presidents in American history to
veto a civil-rights bill."
                                                                                                       

   PENSION TENSIONS spur bills to head off a potential
S&amp;L-like crisis.
   Lawmakers, spooked by the S&amp;L scandal, move to protect the
nation's $2.7 trillion in pension funds. A leading bipartisan
proposal by Sens. Kassebaum and Metzenbaum would restrict
employers' ability to terminate pension plans and to tap
excess funds for corporate use. Rep. Lantos considers a bill
to prevent companies from underfunding pension plans.
   Chances are good for a planned enforcement bill based on
Labor Department proposals. It would increase pension-fund
audits and the fines for law violations. Currently, pension
funds are "highly vulnerable to fraud and abuse," warns
Raymond Maria, the department's acting inspector general.
   But a bill by Sens. Kassebaum and Dole aimed at curbing
short-term stock trading by pension funds faces strong
opposition.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Texas pundits call Ann Richards's decisive
win in the state's nasty Democratic gubernatorial primary "a
mudslide." . . . Priorities: The same day the GAO raised the
S&amp;L bailout's estimated cost to $243 billion, regulators at
the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York issued a news release
welcoming the baseball season. . . . Nyet to Maine? Bush
wants to take Gorbachev to his Kennebunkport vacation home,
but Soviet planners seem cool to the idea.

   Ivan Boesky is a free man, having served his three-year
sentence in two years. Not everyone got off so easily.
Federal judges in New York have spent recent weeks trying to
graft some concept of proportionality onto several Wall
Street prosecutions.
   Federal appeals judges rapped the wrists of Judge Leonard
Sand for his punitive sentencing of Lisa Jones, the
26-year-old former Drexel Burnham Lambert assistant. Miss
Jones was convicted of perjury and sentenced to 18 months by
Judge Sand, fully half the Boesky term. The appeals court
said Judge Sand shouldn't have added time to her sentence on
his highly dubious assumption that her perjury somehow caused
the prosecutors to expend more resources in their
investigation of Princeton/Newport.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps not coincidentally, Rudolph Giuliani's successors
in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan have now decided
to settle for forfeitures of $3 million against
Princeton/Newport officials. The Giuliani team asked for a
whopping $21 million. This is the firm that was RICOed into
liquidation before trial.
   Judge Mary Johnson Lowe recently sentenced James Sherwin,
the former GAF official. "I have been a judge since 1972 and
I can't remember a case that has caused me more anguish in
attempting to fashion an appropriate sentence," Judge Lowe
said. There were three trials and millions spent in legal
fees before the government finally convinced a jury that Mr.
Sherwin had somehow fraudulently caused a 1/8-point movement
in Union Carbide stock several weeks before GAF sold its
shares.
   Judge Lowe called the offense "an aberrational happening."
But she said the jury decision "should be accepted and
respected by this court." So she sentenced Mr. Sherwin to
jail, but for the relatively light sentence of six months.
Judge Lowe earlier had refused to send trader Salim Lewis to
jail at all for his equally controversial alleged stock
manipulation, perhaps because Mr. Lewis pleaded instead of
insisting on going to trial.
   Next up is Judge Pierre Leval, scheduled to sentence
Robert Freeman next Tuesday. Mr. Freeman, recall, was the
Goldman, Sachs partner handcuffed at his desk by Mr.
Giuliani's forces along with fellow arbitragers Richard
Wigton and Timothy Tabor. Prosecutors eventually had to drop
all the original charges against the Giuliani Three, and even
apologized for the too-hasty arrests. Mr. Freeman later
agreed to cop a plea to one count of mail fraud based on the
oblique "Your Bunny has a good nose" line, referring to
problems in a takeover from admitted inside trader Martin
Siegel.
   Judge Leval turned down the prosecution request that in
addition to the single plea to the supposed crime, he take
into account allegations against Mr. Freeman that the
government never tried to prove against him. Mr. Freeman's
lawyers urged in a sentencing memo that jail time is
especially inappropriate because of the "suffering that Mr.
Freeman and his family have been compelled to undergo for the
37 months following the government's precipitous arrest, an
arrest which the government has since acknowledged was a
mistake."
   The granddaddies of disproportionate prosecutions remain
the cases against Drexel and Michael Milken. Drexel is
bankrupt, thousands of people are out of work, credit is
being squeezed in the U.S., yet there is still no trial date
set for Mr. Milken.
   Prosecutors had a good run against Wall Street in the
1980s. Now federal judges are doing their best to see that
some justice is done.

   DALLAS -- Taxpayers shouldn't hold their breath waiting
for the perpetrators of thrift fraud to repay the millions of
dollars they stole, according to the top federal prosecutors
in Texas.
   "I don't think there's a lot of restitution to be had on
the criminal side," said U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins of
Dallas during testimony here yesterday before the House
Banking Committee.

   Courts in Texas ordered about $100 million in restitution
last year from people convicted of fraud related to banks or
thrifts, or almost one-third of the $361.5 million in
restitution ordered nationwide, according to William S.
Sessions, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Mr. Sessions testified before the committee Wednesday.
   But collecting on those orders is another matter. When the
money is available, restitution is often spread out over the
term of a defendant's probation, slowing collections. Of the
$2.2 million in restitution ordered in the Southern District
of Texas in 1989, for example, only $29,000 has been
collected, according to U.S. Attorney Henry Oncken of
Houston.
   Besides, the restitution ordered is minuscule when
compared with the total cost of the thrift bailout, which, it
was estimated last week, would cost a minimum of $325
billion.
   The committee members' questions about restitution were
the sharpest leveled during the two days of hearings on the
progress of prosecution in thrift-related fraud cases. "We
haven't had any S&amp;L fraud in Delaware," said Rep. Thomas
Carper (D., Del.). "Yet we're having to help you pay for it.
We don't like it."
   But Mr. Collins and his fellow U.S. Attorneys from Texas
offered little hope to Rep. Carper and intimated that long
prison terms were a higher priority for prosecutors. "People
in jail don't pay a lot of restitution," Mr. Collins said.
"Another complication is the length of time it takes for
these cases to come to investigation."
   In the case of the defunct Sunbelt Savings Association of
Texas, which was singled out by the Banking Committee,
investigators have been worked for 2 1/2 years and won guilty
pleas from five officers of Sunbelt or affiliated companies.
   But the investigation has yet to produce an indictment
against Sunbelt's former owner, Edwin T. McBirney III, who
was paid an annual salary of $252,000 on top of wildly
expensive perquisites, according to evidence given to the
House Banking Committee. Thrift regulators attribute almost
$20 million in Sunbelt losses to expenditures for airplanes,
parties, gifts and overdrafts on insiders' accounts.
   Mr. Collins, when asked by Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez why Mr. McBirney hasn't been charged yet, said he
couldn't respond because of the secrecy of the grand jury
process. Mr. McBirney declined an invitation to testify
before the committee.
   A civil suit to collect some of Sunbelt's losses is
currently being pursued against Mr. McBirney and other former
Sunbelt officers and directors by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   Such civil actions by the FDIC offer a better chance of
collecting restitution than criminal cases, Mr. Collins said.
He resisted Rep. Gonzalez's suggestion that U.S. Attorneys
take on more restitution chores through their civil sections.
   "We cannot begin to match what the regulators spend" on
outside lawyers to pursue restitution, Mr. Collins said.

   Your Money Matters -- Getting Started:
   Don't Look Only at Money-Fund Yields

   Yield isn't everything.
   That may sound like heresy to investors in money-market
mutual funds. Typically, they go for the highest yields.
   But the fact is that there are a lot of other things to
consider when choosing a money fund.
   Safety for one. Although nobody has ever suffered a loss
in a money fund, there have been a couple of close calls.
"The biggest issue is risk," says John Markese, director of
research for the American Association of Individual
Investors, a Chicago educational organization. "Most
questions (from investors) used to be about yield, now
they're about safety."
   Other things -- from the size of the fund, to its
geographic location, to the services it provides and the fees
it does or doesn't charge -- are also important for investors
pouring tens of billions of dollars a year into money funds.
   Here's a look at the key factors:
                                                                                                       

   SAFETY. Money funds are among the safest investments,
although they don't carry federal deposit insurance like bank
accounts. They are structured so that the value of an
investor's shares remains at $1 each, and only the yield
changes to reflect the return on the investments in fund
portfolios. Money funds are also highly liquid; in most cases
an investor can withdraw money simply by writing a check.
   For the most part, differences in safety are slight. The
Securities and Exchange Commission limits money funds'
investments to highly rated securities. But there are
gradations.
   Some funds limit themselves to the very highest ratings of
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc.
Others accept the second-highest rating. Some funds invest
only in Treasury securities, or Treasury and
government-agency securities. Others are putting much of
their cash into commercial paper, which is unsecured
short-term corporate IOUs, and dollar-denominated
certificates of deposit sold overseas.
   About half the assets of taxable money funds are currently
invested in commercial paper. That's up from 44% at the start
of 1989 and 29% at the start of 1984. Thus the quality of
that commercial paper is a question for money-fund investors,
especially if the economy turns down.
   Just last month, when the commercial paper of Mortgage &amp;
Realty Trust was downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's, the parent
companies of several money funds bought Mortgage &amp; Realty
paper from their funds to protect them from possible losses.
Last year, when Integrated Resources Inc. defaulted on nearly
$1 billion of commercial paper, the parents of Value Line
Cash Fund and Liquid Green Trust absorbed the losses.
   "Look at a fund's standards for buying commercial paper,"
says Kurt Brouwer, an investment adviser with the San
Francisco firm Brouwer &amp; Janachowski. "You should be willing
to give up a quarter or a half point (of yield) to make sure
you're safeguarding" your investment.
   The safest funds usually are those that invest exclusively
in Treasury and government-agency securities, which are
backed by the U.S. government.
                                                                                                       

   YIELD. On average, money-fund yields are higher than those
on many comparable investments, such as bank money-market
accounts and short-term certificates of deposit. The latest
average seven-day compound yield is 7.99%. Compound yields
assume reinvestment of dividends.
   But yields on the more than 400 taxable funds vary widely.
Yields on individual funds range from 6.54% to 8.85%. The
difference is equal to $231 a year on a $10,000 investment.
   "You can earn one-third more by picking the right fund,"
says William E. Donoghue, publisher of IBC/Donoghue's Money
Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter.
   Yields on funds that limit their investments to government
securities are usually slightly lower than on other funds.
According to Donoghue's, the average seven-day compound yield
of Treasury-only funds is currently 7.70%.
                                                                                                       

   AVERAGE MATURITY. Longer maturities enable a fund to
retain higher yields when interest rates are falling, just as
shorter maturities permit it to latch onto higher-yielding
securities sooner when rates are rising. The average for the
taxable funds tracked by Donoghue's currently is a fairly
long 45 days.
   Some financial advisers recommend choosing a fund that's
close to the average for all taxable funds. "I wouldn't want
a fund with a real long average maturity . . . beyond 50 or
60 days," says Mr. Donoghue of Money Fund Report.
   The problem with the longer maturities is that they make
it difficult for fund managers to take advantage of quick
increases in interest rates. As a result, yields can lag
those of funds with shorter average maturities when rates are
rising.
   In an extreme case, average maturity could also become a
safety issue. If shareholders decided to bail out, the
manager could be forced to dump securities at fire-sale
prices, thereby lowering the net asset value of the fund.
   Currently, one of the funds with the longest average
maturities is Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, at 83 days. Joseph
DiMartino, president of Dreyfus Corp. and manager of the
fund, says the long average maturity isn't a problem. There
are securities maturing every day that could be used to meet
redemptions, he says.
                                                                                                       

   FUND EXPENSES. These are the charges a fund deducts from
the return on its investments to meet various costs of
running the fund. What's left is the yield that's passed
along to investors.
   The current average is about 0.75% of assets, but some
funds, like Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, temporarily are waiving
fees. Others, like R. Meeder &amp; Associates Inc., which manages
Flex-Fund, waive a portion of the fees as a matter of policy
to keep the fund among the highest yielding.
   Dreyfus now says it will waive fees on Worldwide Dollar at
least until June 15, or when assets reach $7.5 billion.
Fidelity Spartan currently is charging investors just 0.10%
of assets and has guaranteed that the so-called expense ratio
won't top 0.45% at least until March 1991.
   "If it's not too inconvenient, you should take advantage
of" the fee waivers, says Sheldon Jacobs, editor of No-Load
Fund Investor, a newsletter based in Hastingson-Hudson, N.Y.
"It's like buying things on sale."
                                                                                                       

   SERVICES. Most funds offer free check writing, but
Fidelity Spartan, which is among the highest yielding,
charges $2 a check. Check minimums also differ. The minimum
is $1,000 at Fidelity Spartan and just $100 at Flex-Fund.
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s Cash Management Account, the largest
money fund, doesn't charge a per-check fee but carries an
$80-a-year account fee.
   Active investors might want to choose a fund that's part
of a large family of funds that permits switching between
funds by telephone, so they can move their money around
easily.
                                                                                                       

   SIZE. Larger funds may have lower expense ratios, because
fixed costs are spread over a broader base, and may be better
able to absorb losses in case of a default.
   Some people even consider a fund's location in their
decision because they don't want their deposits spending time
in the U.S. mail instead of earning interest. Some funds
permit wire transfers from your bank.
   "Look at what you want from a money fund," advises Mr.
Donoghue. "If you want to use it as a checking account, look
for low check minimums and no check-writing fees. If you're
looking for a supersavings account, you want the highest
yield. For super-safety, take a government fund. A small
saver wants a low minimum deposit. You're buying this thing
for the services."

   U.S. Retail Sales

   Consecutive Drop Is First

   WASHINGTON -- Retail sales fell again in March, marking
the first time in more than three years they have fallen for
two consecutive months, the Commerce Department said.
   Sales dropped 0.6% during the month, after dipping 0.3% in
February. But economists, for the most part, insisted that
the retail sector is better off than the numbers imply.

   "Consumer spending is doing quite respectably at this
point," said Robert Chandross, chief economist of Lloyds Bank
in New York. "There's not a lot of evidence of sustained
weakness here."
   While auto sales continued to show troubling declines last
month, analysts said other retail purchases were slipping
only a bit after posting strong gains in January and
February.
   "Excluding autos, sales were up 1.1% in January and 1.5%
in February, and down 0.4% in March," said Charles Lieberman
of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. "With those kind of
increases in January and February, the March numbers
certainly aren't troublesome."
   Nevertheless, every type of retailer except food stores
reported falling sales in March. Auto sales declined 1.4%
after plunging 6.5% in February. Hardware and
building-material purchases dropped 0.8% after jumping 2.5%
the month before. Furniture sales slipped 0.1% after growing
2.2%. Sales at general merchandise department stores shrunk
1% after growing 2.4%, and apparel sales declined 0.5% after
increasing 1.7%.
   Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail
Federation, said the March figures don't "resemble reality."
She explained: "My reports from speaking to retailers were
that they were very happy."
   Retail purchases totaled $148.55 billion in March, after
adjusting for seasonal fluctuations, 5.1% above the total for
March 1989.
   Economists pointed out that the department revised its
initial calculation of February retail sales to show a far
smaller decline than the 0.8% drop it originally reported.
Analysts also speculated that March retail sales were hurt
because Easter doesn't come until mid-April this year.
Theorizing that many holiday-related purchases thus weren't
made in March, many expect a pick-up in sales this month.
   "There isn't much of a hint here of anything traumatic
happening in the economy," Mr. Chandross said.
   The government's retail sales estimates are based on a
relatively small sample of reports and frequently are revised
substantially as more data are collected. The numbers exclude
spending on services, which accounts for a large portion of
consumer outlays.
   But retail sales account for about onethird of the
country's economic activity, so many economists pay close
attention to them. Last year, consumer spending slowed along
with the overall economy. Still, analysts say, the consumer
sector seems to be more vigorous than some other parts of the
economy, especially manufacturing.

   BOSTON -- A federal court declined to prohibit coverage of
the Boston Marathon by television stations that don't have a
contract with the race's organizer, in a ruling that may make
some existing sports-broadcast rights arrangements
unenforceable.
   The ruling effectively invalidates a contract between the
Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the race, and
WBZTV, the local National Broadcasting Co. affiliate, for
"exclusive" live broadcast rights to the marathon, scheduled
to be run Monday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After other local stations indicated their intention to
broadcast live despite the contract, WBZ sought an injunction
against the other stations, saying their transmissions would
violate the athletic association's property and trademark
rights. In his ruling yesterday, U.S. District Court Judge
David S. Nelson denied the injunction.
   In his ruling, Judge Nelson said the BAA had "no property
right in the unfolding news event of the Boston Marathon as
it occurs on public streets."
   The ruling was issued despite an affidavit from ABC
Sports, a division of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., that argued
that without exclusive rights arrangements, television
coverage of many sporting events that take place on public
property wouldn't be viable. In its affidavit, ABC listed 40
public events covered by exclusive rights arrangements,
including many Olympic events, the New York City and Los
Angeles marathons, Grand Prix auto racing and bicycle races
including the Tour de France.
   The ruling "may well have an adverse impact" on other
contracts, said James Spence, president of Sports Television
International Inc., a New York firm that markets sporting
events. "If you eliminate exclusivity, you undermine the
financial support that accrues the event, and that's
unfortunate," Mr. Spence added.
   The case produced some odd bedfellows. Although Capital
Cities/ABC supported the WBZ-Boston Marathon contract, the
local ABC affiliate in Boston, WCVB, was a direct beneficiary
of the judge's ruling.
   Despite the ruling, final coverage details of the marathon
remained murky. WBZ, the NBC affiliate, and the BAA
immediately appealed, asking for a dispatched ruling before
the race. Meanwhile, the BAA said it will continue to
withhold press credentials for the finish-line area from WCVB
and other television stations. NBC is a unit of General
Electric Co.
   The ruling also produced the possibility that mobile
camera trucks from various stations will show up to cover the
event, complicating safety and security arrangements. In the
past, TV stations have pooled access to feeds from trucks at
various race points.
   Also unclear was the status of the supposedly exclusive
rights sold by the BAA to Sports Channel for live national
coverage of the event.
   Local television stations, including WBZ, WCVB and CBS
Inc. affiliate WHDH, have given extensive live coverage to
the marathon in the past. The race, which occurs on a state
holiday in Massachusetts and attracts thousands of public
spectators along the 26-mile route, has been a big revenue
producer in the past for broadcasters.

   The crowds that cheer wildly when hostages are released
are joyful that the hostages' ordeal is over. Everyone shares
in that happiness. But France's dealings with Libya to gain
this release raise questions. Let us quickly note that the
French are not alone in having succumbed to the temptations
of over-sophisticated diplomacy. Some U.S. State Department
officials are so in love with their talks with the PLO they
are spinning in circles trying to turn a blind eye to recent
PLO terrorist activities. But the French are playing a
dangerous game by engaging in subtle minuets with the likes
of the Libyans, the Iranians, and the Iraqis. After the
Mirage shipments, a meeting with Yassir Arafat in Paris, a
friendly visit to Tehran and an offer to Iraq to help rebuild
the nuclear reactor Israel blew up in 1981, France's allies
have a right to wonder what all this subtle flirting is meant
to achieve. In France, the U.S. State Department, and
elsewhere, process is running policy. Those who try to cuddle
with beasts often end up with their hands bitten off.

   Better-Than-Expected Sales for March

   Several mall retailers reported better-than-expected sales
for March, given this year's late Easter holiday season.
   Analysts estimate sales at stores open at least a year
rose an average of 3% to 4%, or about the same rate as
inflation. But the analysts said the results suggest April's
showing will be much stronger because of Easter's shift into
April this year from late March. The analysts, who favor
combining the two months for comparison purposes, predict a
same-store increase averaging about 6% for the period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The numbers show a great deal of underlying strength in
spending," said Margo McGlade of PaineWebber Inc. "In the
beginning of February, most people thought consumer spending
was going to be quite sluggish."
   The March results also suggest that department stores and
mall specialty stores that sell apparel may be gaining market
share. "Malls are doing better than strip centers," said
Thomas Tashjian of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. "All of the
price promotions and additional advertising in the fourth
quarter has clearly brought consumers back into the mall, and
they are staying there."
   Mr. Tashjian and other analysts noted that mall stores are
ringing up respectable sales gains now, without having to
slash prices as often as they did over the Christmas season.
"There appears to have been a decline in promotional
activity," said Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities.
   Because of a difference in their fiscal calendars, only
about half of the nation's big retailers reported March sales
yesterday. Gap Inc. led the pack with a 12% increase in
same-store sales. Limited Inc.'s same-store sales rose a more
modest 4%, disappointing some analysts.
   Last week, several big retailers, including Sears, Roebuck
&amp; Co., Woolworth Corp. and Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., reported
generally weaker results. Two exceptions were Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and J.C. Penney Co., where same-store sales rose 12% and
8.7% respectively.
   K mart Corp., a big discount chain, said sales at stores
open at least a year in the U.S. and Canada declined 1.1%. K
mart Chairman Joseph Antonini said "sales were strong in the
first two weeks of March," but "weakened in line with
expectations" because of the late Easter holiday.
   Same-store sales rose 8.2% at Dayton Hudson Corp., which
operates the Target and Mervyn's discount chains in addition
to its Dayton Hudson department store division. At May
Department Stores Inc., same-store sales rose 2.7%. Neiman
Marcus Group Inc.'s same-store sales rose 2.3%. And Carter
Hawley Hale Stores Inc. said its same-store sales declined
2.4%.

   Regulation Cop
   No Longer
   Walks His Beat

   The day a story on expanding regulation ran in this
newspaper last November, George Bush sat down at his
typewriter and tapped out a note to chief of staff John
Sununu.
   "Surely we're not re-regulating," the president wrote,
underlining the word for emphasis. "If" -- another underline
-- "it is happening," Mr. Bush added, "maybe I should mention
it at a cabinet meeting."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Well, maybe he should do something.
   Six months after that presidential warning shot, the Bush
administration's re-regulators are back at the barricades.
White House sources not easily given to alarm say they
haven't seen anything like it since the Carter years. Even
discounting for hyperbole, this doesn't sound like the kind
of policy favored by the man who, as vice president, presided
over a task force to slash government red tape.
   The battle is being waged over one of those Washington
jobs that sounds obscure but has real power. It's the White
House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. During
the Reagan years, this was the administration's main traffic
cop for regulation, a sanity check on bureaucrats. George
Bush's own task force gave the cop political support in
fights with the Reagan Cabinet.
   Yet in the Bush White House, the cop is off the beat. The
post has been vacant for six months. Budget director Richard
Darman controls the office, but has other things to worry
about. And Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio) is now pushing
legislation that would strip the office of much of its power.
   Why should anyone care? Consider the bright ideas now
bubbling up from the bureaucracy:
   -- Pedestrians struck by cars are often killed when they
land on the metal hoods. One proposal being studied would
require a rubber hood to cushion the blow, with a sandpaper
surface to keep victims from bouncing far off. Why didn't
Detroit think of that?
   -- The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered cities
to recycle 25% of everything that now goes into incinerators.
Since recycling is difficult and often unpopular, this means
fewer cities will rely on efficient incinerators to dispose
of garbage.
   Instead they'll dump more into landfills, which are
filling up too fast anyway. In any case, isn't this a choice
for the local voters who'll have to do the recycling?
   -- The Department of Transportation wants to require all
new city buses to have wheelchair lifts for the disabled.
Expensive but possibly worth it -- except that DOT also wants
to require cities to provide taxi or van service for any
disabled person who, for a wide variety of reasons, can't
take the bus. Naturally, almost everyone will insist the bus
is somehow inconvenient and opt for a cab.
   -- Another EPA idea would tighten up the already tight
rules for disposing of low-level nuclear waste. This sounds
good, until EPA lists the benefits. It turns out the change
will save from three to 13 cancer deaths over 10,000 years,
with one cancer prevented in the first 500 years.
   Wags have dubbed this the "Christopher Columbus rule,"
since if it had applied in 1492 we'd soon be saving our first
cancer victim.
   -- With EPA Administrator William Reilly off giving
speeches, his minions have floated the possibility of
toughening the nation's "ambient" air-quality standards. One
critic says the new standard for sulfur dioxide pollution is
designed for "an asthmatic, exercising near a power plant,
without medication, during peak emissions."
   -- Agriculture regulators are proposing new rules to
better treat animals in laboratories. Hundreds of millions of
dollars will be diverted from medical research in order to
build new cages and assure that air is recycled more times
each day than even human hospitals require.
   The point isn't that all regulations are this silly.
Obviously many are useful. The point is that without a
traffic cop there's no incentive not to be silly. No
regulator ever got promoted for not regulating. Cabinet
members who show restraint end up being described as a
"disappointment."
   With tax and spend out of fashion, members of Congress now
try to expand their influence through regulation. Every new
rule purports to serve some noble goal, so private-sector
opponents seem selfish. Without an institutional check in the
government, there's no incentive for any restraint at all --
no matter how much a regulation costs.
   Mr. Bush should also be worried about the loss of his own
powers. Killing the regulation cop means reduced control of
the executive branch by the White House. No wonder many on
Capitol Hill want to strip the job of any real power. As just
one example: Sen. Glenn's bill would in effect cancel the
regulatory cop's current power to review paperwork demands
every three years.
   Fortunately, the re-regulation binge is drawing political
flak. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Richard Lesher
recently sent a letter to President Bush decrying the
"troubling" trend. A bipartisan group of 13 senators --
liberal Arkansas Democrat Dale Bumpers, for one -- has sent
Mr. Glenn a letter urging that the regulatory office not be
gutted. Some White House aides also want Vice President Dan
Quayle's competitiveness council to have the same status that
Mr. Bush's task force had in the Reagan White House.
   Presumably, George Bush believes his work as the
deregulation vice president was worth something. Presumably,
he'd like to consolidate that legacy as president. But on the
evidence so far, he'll have to do more than mention the
subject at a cabinet meeting.

   Accord With Regulators
   Brightens Utility's Outlook

   For years, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. suffered the
corporate equivalent of a migraine: a $5.8 billion nuclear
plant reviled by environmentalists and criticized by
regulators.
   The Diablo Canyon facility, nearly 20 years in the making,
became a fixation at PG&amp;E, preoccupying the company's
management and its board. "We were totally absorbed,"
confesses Richard A. Clarke, chairman and chief executive.
"We were worn out."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a striking about face, the nation's largest
investor-owned utility has shed its woes lately, turned
potential financial disaster into a profit, and is trying
hard to rework its tarnished image.
   Thanks to an unconventional pact with state regulators-in
which the company's revenue from Diablo Canyon depends on the
plant's performance rather than a fixed return on investment
-- PG&amp;E last year coaxed $225 million in after-tax profit
from its one-time white elephant and may make more this year
if the plant continues its current output.
   Moreover, the San Francisco-based utility is enjoying
considerable public good will from its quick restoration of
services after the city's Oct. 17 earthquake. The company
expects to recoup nearly all of its estimated $100 million in
earthquake-related outlays from insurance and from rates.
   With regulatory treatment of Diablo Canyon settled, "we
feel liberated," says Mr. Clarke. Now PG&amp;E is wooing the same
environmentalists who once hectored it. It's also striving to
operate Diablo Canyon efficiently and safely, and broaden
investments in non-regulated businesses with which it says it
feels familiar.
   A number of utilities have enjoyed a similar burst of cash
flow, as heavy borrowing for nuclear construction suddenly
has reversed and become a stream of revenue when a plant
comes on line. The sudden wealth has been badly spent in some
cases. Pinnacle West Capital Corp., for instance, squandered
anticipated profits from its Palo Verde nuclear station by
investing in the thrift business, nearly bankrupting itself
in the process.
   PG&amp;E is determined to avoid such pitfalls, says Mr.
Clarke. "We're not diversifying; we're taking advantage of
the business that we know," he asserts.
   Mr. Clarke says the company expects first-quarter net
income to be lower than the year-earlier 53 cents a share. A
scheduled refueling outage of the Unit 2 reactor at the
company's Diablo Canyon nuclear plant makes it "reasonable to
assume that our earnings will be lower than they were last
year," he said.
   But the executive said 1990 net income likely will exceed
the $1.90 a share reported for 1989. However, he said an
average of analysts' estimates of $2.07 a share is "a little
high."
   PG&amp;E had net income of $244.4 million, or 53 cents a
share, in the 1989 first quarter on revenue of $2.11 billion.
Net income last year totaled $900.6 million, or $1.90 a
share, on $8.59 billion in revenue.
   To expand its non-regulated business, Mr. Clarke said PG&amp;E
may substantially boost its investment in natural-gas
exploration and production. The company's PG&amp;E Resources Co.
subsidiary presently holds interests in exploration leases
covering about 600,000 gross acres in Texas, Louisiana,
Arkansas, California, and the Rocky Mountain region. The
holdings amount to about 220,000 acres, net of other
investors' interests.
   "It's not infeasible that in resources you might see a
huge acquisition of reserves," Mr. Clarke added.
   PG&amp;E, late in 1988, acquired Wessely Energy Co.'s U.S. oil
and gas assets for about $100 million. At the time, it said
further acquisitions were planned. However, purchases haven't
materialized yet. Mr. Clarke said the company is constantly
reviewing possibilities.
   In another gas-related venture, PG&amp;E is opening refilling
stations for vehicles powered by compressed natural gas. The
company expects to have nine such stations open to the public
by the end of the year.
   PG&amp;E also plans to about double the capacity of a pipeline
that carries natural gas from western Canada to the Pacific
northwest and California, adding 900 million cubic feet daily
of new transmission capacity. Operation of the $1.5 billion
project is scheduled for 1993. Its capacity is already
contracted for, Mr. Clarke says.
   Jointly, the three natural gas projects are part of an
overall strategy. "Our whole premise is that . . . gas is a
good business to be in," Mr. Clarke says.
   PG&amp;E's environmental thrust is focused on future power
developments, where the company is working at least as hard
on the generating capacity it won't build as that which it
will. Of about 3,300 megawatts of forecast potential new
demand over the next decade, PG&amp;E thinks it can forestall at
least 2,500 megawatts -- roughly equal to the output of two
nuclear generating units -- through energy conservation.
   The utility plans to spend about $170 million this year
and about $200 million annually after that on financial
inducements to reduce demand among a wide range of
electricity consumers. Plans include educational efforts for
energy-efficient lighting, inducements for industry to use
more efficient motors, and better residential insulation
programs.
   The California Public Utility Commission currently is
considering proposals under which PG&amp;E would receive a return
on these investments.
   Mr. Clarke said about 800 megawatts of capacity not
achieved through customer efficiencies may be provided in
part by wind and solar power. A substantial portion, however,
likely will be come from updating existing gas and oil-fired
generating stations, he said.

   SANTE FE, N.M. -- The New Mexico Public Service Commission
said it ordered a $2.9 million decrease in rates for Public
Service Co. of New Mexico.
   The commission said the action closes the book on three
years of deliberations involving the investment by PS New
Mexico in Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. This
decision is the last of three orders that have been issued by
the commission during the past year dealing with PS New
Mexico's excess capacity and investment in Palo Verde.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Originally, PS New Mexico had requested a $13.7 million
rate increase, which would have resulted in a 4.4% increase
for residential customers.
   Meanwhile, the commission authorized a $1.9 million rate
increase for El Paso Electric Co.
   After the decision, PS New Mexico warned its shareholders
that they "will receive little or no return on their
investment over the next several years." The company said it
would evaluate "possible strategic options" and has hired an
investment banking firm to assist.

   NEWARK, Calif. -- Ross Stores Inc. said its sales for the
five weeks ended April 7 rose 6% to $70 million from $66
million a year ago.
   Sales at stores open more than a year fell 6%. For the two
months ended April 7, the retail chain said sales rose 7% to
$113 million from $106 million. Sales at stores open more
than a year slipped 5% for the two months.

   NEWARK, N.J. -- Exxon Corp. was sued by the U.S.
government in federal court here, seeking penalties and
interest from fines the oil giant failed to pay for four
small oil spills in area waterways.
   The civil complaint isn't related to much-larger spills
that occurred in the same area in recent months, the U.S.
attorney said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the U.S. attorney, Exxon's Exxon Co. U.S.A.
unit, Linden, N.J., refused to pay a total $1,350 of fines
the Coast Guard imposed from 1985 to 1987 because the oil
company claims the minor spills didn't harm the environment.
The spills occurred in the Kill Van Kull and Arthur Kill
waterways, which separate New Jersey from Staten Island, N.Y.
   Exxon couldn't be reached for comment. The New York
company and its Exxon Shipping Co. unit recently pleaded
innocent to five-count criminal indictments, charging them
with violating various federal laws in the nation's worst oil
spill a year ago. The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in
March 1989, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil
into Alaska's Prince William Sound.

   Soviet Army Is Under Increasing Stress
   But Gaining Political Clout, Report Says

DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)

   WASHINGTON -- The Soviet military is showing growing signs
of stress and disintegration but is gaining clout in the
Russian government, according to U.S. military officials and
analysts.
   A report by Rand Corp. bolsters views by Bush
administration Moscow-watchers that the Soviet army, which
now stands almost alone in Eastern Europe as a result of the
collapse of the Warsaw Pact, is reeling from widespread
homelessness among retired officers, desertions among
draftees and turmoil within the ranks of its active officers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There is no doubt the Soviet military is under a great
deal of stress," says Henry S. Rowen, assistant secretary of
defense for international security affairs.
   The upheaval comes as the Red Army is being asked to take
on a heavier burden in carrying out internal missions,
including controlling riots and other disturbances in ethnic
republics and protecting nuclear-weapons sites. Some U.S.
officials believe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
growing reliance on the army to quell disturbances has given
the military a stronger hand in his government. For instance,
they believe dissatisfaction within the military is forcing
civilian leaders to resubmit military-backed proposals,
including proposed limits on sea-launched nuclear missiles,
and to slow talks in Vienna on conventional-arms control.
   "Who would we turn to if we were told that Canada and
Mexico had just turned communist and the state of Florida was
about to secede?" asked one analyst, seeking an analogy to
Mr. Gorbachev's position.
   Some U.S. officials question how much support the military
will give Mr. Gorbachev. The report says there are signs that
some officers have "increasingly tended to distance
themselves" from the Soviet leader, even though many of them
are younger officers who originally supported his reforms.
   The report says a "staggering" number of officers are
homeless after leaving the military, many of them uprooted as
a result of Soviet cuts in forces in Eastern Europe and along
the Chinese border. The report also asserts, "a powerful
demographic shift" is filling the bottom ranks of the army
with Moslem draftees, many of whom speak little Russian.
   Signs of the military's crisis, especially the officer
housing problems, have been appearing almost daily in the
Soviet military press. For example, retired Navy Captain V.
Shatskiy complained in the military newspaper "Red Star" last
month that he hasn't received his pension and can't find a
job. Because an apartment promised by the government never
materialized, Capt. Shatskiy said, "I am sitting on suitcases
with my two children and I do not know what to do." Since he
has no home, he added, local civilian authorities threatened
him and his wife with violating the Soviet Union's internal
passport law.
   According to Red Star, there were 170,500 homeless
military families as of Jan. 1, including over 10,000 in
Moscow alone. The great majority of them were retired
officers' families.
   "They literally don't know where to put them," says Murray
Feshbach, a demographer at Washington's Georgetown University
who specializes in the Soviet Union. The housing crisis and
growing ethnic problems, he says, are among the factors that
seem to be causing Soviet military planners to shift toward
favoring a much smaller, all-volunteer army. Ethnic turmoil
among the Armenians, Azerbaijanis and other nationalist
groups, Mr. Feshbach believes, will accelerate the shrinking
of the Soviet military because diverse groups will refuse to
serve in the same units.
   Mr. Feshbach, who recently returned from talks with
officials in Moscow and in the Baltic states, predicts the
military that will emerge from the current upheaval will be
predominantly Russian. That would end a growing,
destabilizing split between the current officer corps, which
is mostly Russian or Slavic, and enlisted troops, close to
40% of whom now come from other ethnic groups.
   The Rand report adds that Mr. Gorbachev has created a
"generational change" in the upper ranks of the military,
replacing most senior men with younger officers. The officer
corps now breaks down into two factions, according to Rand:
the "far easterners," led by Soviet Defense Minister D.T.
Yazov, men who spent many years serving together in Siberia,
Central Asia and in the Pacific Fleet; and a tier of younger
officers, slightly below them in rank, who served in
Afghanistan. This second group, according to Rand, is "likely
to play an important role for some time to come."
   Some Rand analysts see the growing splits in the army as
reflecting general ethnic strife that could grow worse in the
years ahead. "You have most, if not all, the necessary
ingredients present for a civil war," says Jeremy R. Azrael,
a senior Rand Soviet specialist.
   Such upheaval could affect U.S. security interests in a
number of ways, he says. For one thing, ethnic strife could
endanger the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal, the majority of
which is in such outlying republics as Kazakhstan. Mr. Azrael
said he believes the chances are one out of three that a
civil war could break out in Russia within the next five
years.

   CHENGDU, China -- It is 8 a.m. and Tang Daqin, director of
the Sichuan No. 1 Knitting Mill, is staring down his first
crisis of the day. It's a big one: His factory has run out of
cash.
   In the daily meeting with his top aides, Mr. Tang devises
an emergency plan. One vice director will go to a nearby bank
to beg for a loan. Another will hit up a trading company for
repayment of a longstanding debt. Mr. Tang himself will lean
on the People's Construction Bank's local branch chairman, a
longtime personal friend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With a little luck, the soft-spoken factory boss tells his
assistants, the enterprise can raise enough money to keep
operating for at least another two weeks. Then the directors
can turn to other matters, like figuring out how to find
cotton supplies amid a shortage that has already forced
hundreds of textile companies to close.
   The day's problems are serious, though hardly unusual. For
the men and women who run China's state-owned factories,
nearly every day brings new calamities. A national austerity
program has made working capital virtually unattainable.
Skewed pricing policies create crippling shortages of raw
materials and energy. Shifting political winds mean sharp
swings in economic policy. And, despite China's attempt to
modernize, it is still personal connections, not business
skills, that matter most in running an enterprise. For a
reform-minded factory director, operating efficiently in this
half-reformed economy is a daily struggle.
   "I feel like I spend all of my time running around just
trying to find the money and materials I need to keep going,"
says the 46-year-old Mr. Tang. "It's hard to get anything
else done."
   By the time Mr. Tang sits down at his desk at 8:30 a.m.,
he is already well into his first pack of Kents. The strain
of his job is evident in the way he handles his cigarettes:
He pinches them so tightly they sometimes go out. His office
is neat and spare. On the walls are clipboards of statistics
and a poster of a beach scene far removed from this drab
industrial city in central Sichuan Province. On Mr. Tang's
desk sits a phone, a photo of his family and a vase of garish
plastic flowers.
   For the next few hours, his office maintains all the
decorum of a fast-food counter. All morning long, assistants
dash in and out, bringing problems that demand his "immediate
attention." A trade-union official wants to get Mr. Tang's
approval to buy red cloth for hanging political slogans in
the factory's meeting hall. A senior engineer comes to
discuss a scheme to invest in Fiji. A scruffy young vice
director runs in every 10 minutes with progress reports on a
Chinese businessman who has come to tour the factory.
   A moment of quiet comes, finally, at 11, when Mr. Tang is
left alone to read the newspapers. He scans the business
sections of the major economic and trade papers for tidbits
on prices and supplies, jotting down the information in a
notebook.
   "I've got to keep up with the needs of the market," says
Mr. Tang, who takes a week off each month to tour the
province and talk to customers and shopkeepers. "Nowadays, a
factory needs an edge."
   Recognition of the market is one of the major results of
China's past decade of reform. In Mao's day, all was mandated
by the state. The life of the factory director was easy, if a
little dull. The state set output quotas, provided all raw
materials and bought up the factory's production. Workers
earned a set wage, and directors often held their jobs for
life.
   A dash of liberal economics changed that. Today, directors
are held accountable for their factory's performance and can
lose their bonuses, or even their jobs, for poor results.
There is also competition now, largely from upstart rural
enterprises that operate outside the planned economy and
scavenge for the same customers and raw materials.
   Sichuan No. 1 Knitting, whose 1,500 workers produce
T-shirts, underwear and sports suits, still gets most of its
raw materials from the state, but it pays a huge premium for
what it must buy on the free market. The factory, for
example, gets 90% of its supplies of "32-S" yarn at the
state-subsidized price of $2,265 a ton. But the remainder
must be bought on the open market, at a 55% markup.
   Some materials are barely available at any price. Low
government prices have discouraged farmers from growing
cotton, and supplies have shrunk, throwing factories into
turmoil.
   "At this point, all I can do is pray for good luck," says
Mr. Tang.
   Even when raw materials are available, energy may not be.
China's energy shortage means factories often don't operate.
Mr. Tang recently installed two generators, at $35,000 each,
but the cost per kilowatt hour -- three times normal rates --
is prohibitive. For five months each year, the factory simply
closes half a day.
   Mr. Tang, a high-school dropout, came to the factory as a
machine repairman at age 15. He quickly worked his way up the
ladder and, in 1981, the factory sent him to the Chengdu
University School of Business Management. There, he learned
theories that attempted to graft Western management technique
onto socialist ideology.
   As factory director, a job he assumed in 1988, Mr. Tang
enjoys prestige but limited material gain. In the fledgling
private sector, enterprise bosses are getting rich, so rich
the state has begun re-emphasizing Maoist egalitarianism. But
for managers in the state sector, living conditions have
remained roughly constant.
   Mr. Tang lives with his wife and son in a small three-room
apartment near the factory. The living-room centerpiece is a
bright green refrigerator, far too large for the closet-like
kitchen. "I don't dare give myself a bigger apartment," he
says. "My workers would complain."
   Back at the factory, it is now 11:30, and Mr. Tang is
ringing up the chairman of the local branch of the
Construction Bank. He tells his banker friend that China's
tight credit policy is hurting business, and that many of his
customers aren't paying their bills. The factory, he says,
stands to lose the equivalent of $11,000 a day if it doesn't
get an injection of cash soon.
   The debt problem results from the austerity measures China
imposed in late 1988 to cool the overheated economy and curb
inflation. The credit squeeze has created a mounting cycle of
debt. Customers owe Sichuan No. 1 Knitting $1.4 million in
all, about three times the normal level. The factory, which
in turn owes its suppliers about $1 million, has formed a
team of 10 managers who travel around the country hitting up
clients for repayment.
   When he finally hangs up the phone, Mr. Tang breaks into a
big smile: He got his money. An aide will go to the bank in
the afternoon to pick up $81,000. "It helps to have
connections," he says.
   The jubilation is soon broken, however, when a vice
director, Tang Jianchuan, comes in to report that the state
trading company he visited in the morning refused to pay the
$135,000 it owes. The company said that it had the money, but
that Bank of China wouldn't allow them to repay the factory.
The bank later said this wasn't true. "It's just a delay
tactic," the factory boss says, shaking his head.
   At 12:30, Mr. Tang breaks for lunch, and factory workers
begin their two-hour break. Workers' time off is sacred.
Indeed, the right to xiuxi, or rest, is enshrined in the
Chinese constitution. Mr. Tang tries to motivate his workers
by combining individual incentives with appeals to a sense of
the collective. In Mao's day, workers got a guaranteed wage.
No one got rich, but no one got fired, and no one did much
work. Today, while wage scales fall within a narrow range,
hard-working laborers can increase their pay according to a
piece-rate system Mr. Tang introduced last year.
   In extreme cases, Mr. Tang theoretically has the power to
fire poor performers. But he needs approval from the trade
union head and the Communist Party secretary, who generally
resist.
   To reinforce the collective message, Mr. Tang has prepared
a series of elaborate posters, hung outside the main office
building, that graphically depict losses due to workers'
lapses. "If you just say something is bad, nobody listens,"
he says. "It's much more effective to show workers just how
much money the factory is losing because of their mistakes."
   Money is used to motivate Mr. Tang, too. Like most of
China's state-run factories, his plant adopts the "director
responsibility system," which gives him a stake in the
factory's performance. Each year, Mr. Tang signs a contract
with a state agency that obliges his factory to meet a
certain production quota. The factory can sell any additional
output freely, and retain most of the profits.
   It's an improvement on the old system, where everything
was set by the state. But as reforms go, it's half-baked.
Contracts are set through negotiation, and depend as much on
a director's relations with state officials as on business
acumen. Once a contract is signed, the plant has to meet its
quotas even if economic conditions or state policies change
drastically. The challenge of meeting this year's contract is
one reason Mr. Tang pinches his cigarettes.
   As Mr. Tang begins his regular afternoon inspection of the
factory's workshops, where long wet strands of white cloth
are stretched from clattering machines, he explains to a
visitor the tangled web of incentives and state dictates he
must cope with. If Sichuan No. 1 Knitting matches the
previous year's profit of $540,000, Mr. Tang stands to earn a
bonus of $300, equal to about four months' salary. If the
factory doesn't make it, he not only won't get a bonus, he
will forfeit $270 of his own money put up as "risk"
insurance.
   In recent years, the factory has met its goal, and Mr.
Tang has profited. But the economy has gone to pot in the
last year, and the system holds him responsible for a lot of
things he can't control. Besides the scarcities,
anti-inflation regulations limit the selling price of the
factory's garments, even while prices of raw materials soar.
The director isn't permitted to lay off redundant workers.
   "This is the worst period we've ever experienced," Mr.
Tang says. He expects sales to tumble 10% this year. "It will
be very tough to make the contract."
   At 5:30, Mr. Tang leaves the factory for home. The
seven-minute walk takes him past a large complex of workers'
apartments, built by Sichuan No. 1 Knitting. Sewage flows by
in narrow, open channels abutting the sidewalk.
   Reflecting on the crises of the day, Mr. Tang becomes
philosophical. "Dealing with problems is part of being a
factory director in China," he says. "It's a challenge I
accept."
   Nonetheless, radical shifts in national policy trouble
China's factory bosses. Since the massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing last June, the government has been
re-emphasizing the Maoist model, threatening to reduce the
independence of factory directors. Already there is more
emphasis on political work at Sichuan No. 1 Knitting, where
Mr. Tang spends six hours a week in study. He is supposed to
root out "bourgeois liberalization" at his factory, though he
concedes, "Frankly I'm not sure what bourgeois liberalization
is."
   "I'm afraid the planning system will play an increasing
role in the economy for a long time," he says. "China is
moving very cautiously with reform."

   NEW YORK -- Crowthers McCall Pattern Inc. said it reached
a definitive agreement to be acquired by a Philadelphia
investment partnership for $45 million.
   Although the agreement advances reorganization efforts by
McCall, which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
proceedings since December 1988, the pact leaves open the
question of how claims of creditors, who are owed $64.4
million, will be satisfied. The purchase agreement, with
Dimeling &amp; Schreiber's MP Holdings Inc., is for all of the
assets of McCall, a maker of home-sewing patterns. McCall
intends to use the proceeds to pay for its reorganization
plan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for McCall creditors said the creditors expect
to make up the difference between the purchase price and the
debt through a $60 million lawsuit that is pending against
Reginald F. Lewis, an investor with a 20% equity stake in
McCall. Mr. Lewis led a group that purchased McCall Pattern
Co. in 1984 for $24.5 million. The group sold McCall for $63
million in June 1987 to an investor group controlled by John
Crowther PLC, a British textile company that was taken over
by Coloroll Group PLC.
   In September, McCall sued Mr. Lewis and others, including
Shearson Lehman Brothers Group Inc. and a unit of Bankers
Trust New York Corp. McCall charged that Mr. Lewis's highly
leveraged purchase and sale of the company triggered its
bankruptcy-law filing. Mr. Lewis also is the subject of a
pending suit by Travelers Insurance Co., a unit of Travelers
Corp., seeking $35 million in damages from a senior note on
which Crowthers McCall defaulted in 1988.
   As part of the agreement with MP Holdings, members of
McCall's management will acquire an equity stake, the size of
which officials didn't disclose. Bankruptcy court has
approved a breakup fee if McCall accepts a competing bid and
gives MP Holdings the right to change its offer if McCall's
receives competing bids. MP Holdings posted a $2 million
deposit.

   NEW YORK -- Chemical Banking Corp.'s first-quarter net
income rose 29%, as the bank cut costs and its provision for
loan losses, while Bank of New York Co.'s net edged up 1.3%
despite a higher provision.
   Chemical's net climbed to $151.7 million, or $1.55 a
share, from $117.9 million, or $1.49 a share, in the
year-earlier period. Per-share profit reflected an offering
of 16.1 million shares in November.

   Interest the bank received on loans declined 12% on
factors including lower payments from Brazil and Mexico on
medium-term and long-term loans.
   Also, revenue from sources other than interest would have
been flat but for a $114.7 million gain before tax on the
sale of the bank's warrants and common stock in Florida
National Banks of Florida Inc.
   Frank DeSantis Jr., analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc.,
noted that Chemical was able to pare expenses, and its
provision for loan losses dropped to $70 million from $90.7
million. The provision for loan losses at the Texas Commerce
unit took "a big positive swing" to $15 million from $39
million, he said.
   Charge-offs of loans at the parent fell to $58 million
from $78.5 million, the bank said.
   Fitch Investors Service Inc. cut its ratings on a number
of Chemical Banking's securities, including the senior debt
to triple-B-plus from single-A-minus. The downgrades,
affecting $540 million of debt and $200 million of preferred
stock, reflect "a weakened operating environment" in
Chemical's primary markets, the New York metro area and the
Northeast.
   Bank of New York earnings rose to $102.3 million, or $1.38
a share, from $101.1 million, or $1.45 a share on fewer
shares a year earlier. The provision for loan losses climbed
to $63 million from $42 million in the year-earlier period.
   The bank said the return on average assets in the latest
period was nearly flat at 0.86% compared with 0.85%. The
year-to-year quarterly comparisons are the first that fully
take into account Bank of New York's merger with Irving
Trust, which was completed in December 1988.
   Chairman J. Carter Bacot said the company reduced loans
outstanding to less-developed countries to $552 million by
selling loans totaling $171 million, by reducing its Mexican
exposure by $86 million, and by charging off $31 million for
Argentine debt.
   The loss allowance for less-developed-country loans is
$330 million, or about 60% of the total loans outstanding.
Nonperforming assets at March 31, 1990, totaled $1.19
billion, essentially unchanged from Dec. 31, 1989.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chemical Bank's stock rose $1, to $24.375 a share, while Bank
of New York's slipped 37.5 cents, to $31.375.

   MILAN, Italy -- Electricity consumption in Italy totaled
20.58 billion kilowatt-hours in March, up 5.3% from a year
earlier, ENEL, the state electricity utility, said.
   ENEL also said electricity demand in the first three
months rose 4.3% to 61 billion kwh. A kilowatt-hour is the
amount of electrical energy consumed when 1,000 watts are
used for one hour.

   Gross electricity generation in Italy rose 9.3% to 18.92
billion kwh in March. Net imports totaled 3.11 billion kwh,
down from 3.4 billion kwh in March 1989. In the first
quarter, however, net imports totaled about 8.8 billion kwh,
up 2.4% from a year earlier.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Former Governor
   To Plead Guilty
   To Several Charges

   Former West Virginia Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr. agreed to
plead guilty to charges of extortion, obstruction of justice,
and tax and mail fraud in a scheme to extort money from a
coal operator and buy votes.
   Mr. Moore, 66 years old, faces up to 36 years in prison
and fines of as much as $1.2 million, said Larry Ellis, an
assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of West
Virginia. A sentencing date hasn't been set.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday's five-count indictment by a Charleston grand
jury accused Mr. Moore, a three-time Republican governor of
the predominantly Democratic state, of illegal activities
while campaigning and serving as governor.
   John Campbell, an investigator with the Justice
Department, called the case unprecedented. "We know of no
other case of similar significance in election-related
crimes," he said.
   In a prepared statement, Mr. Moore said: "This news will
be greeted with a great joy by some in the state of West
Virginia. There will be others who will be sincerely grieved
by reason of their devotion to me and my family. I know I
have their understanding and love. For that, I shall be
forever grateful."
   This is the second time Mr. Moore was indicted for
campaign-related wrongdoings. He was charged and then
acquitted in an alleged 1972 scheme to extort money from a
Charleston savings and loan institution.
   The latest indictments accuse Mr. Moore of illegally
diverting $100,000 in state funds to his 1984 election
campaign, which his supporters paid to voters in southern
West Virginia counties.
   The extortion charge relates to a scheme in which he
agreed to use his influence as governor to refund $2.3
million from the state's black-lung fund to H. Paul Kizer,
owner of Maben Energy Corp. of Beckley, W.Va. Mr. Kizer,
whose concern is one of the state's top coal producers,
agreed to offer Mr. Moore 25% of the refund as kickbacks, the
indictment says. The black-lung fund is a coal
industry-funded pool of money that provides payments to
disabled miners who suffer from the disease.
   Charleston attorney James Lees, who represents Mr. Kizer,
said his client was "a victim of extortion." Mr. Kizer hasn't
been charged, Mr. Ellis said.
   The former governor is also charged with filing false
campaign finance statements and tax returns in 1984 and 1985.
In 1984, he allegedly failed to report contributions by a
lobbyist, Samuel D'Annunzio, and an unidentified agent
representing Island Creek Coal, a unit of Occidental
Petroleum Corp. In Lexington, Ky., a spokeswoman for Island
Creek said the company isn't aware of any payment that was
made on its behalf to Mr. Moore.
   Mr. D'Annunzio, a former president of the West Virginia
Beer Wholesalers Association, committed suicide in 1988.
   In the 1985 tax return, Mr. Moore allegedly failed to
report contributions from Marrowbone Development Co., a West
Virginia coal company. Several Marrowbone officials have
previously been convicted of tax and fraud felonies in an
investigation of Mingo County corruption. That investigation
led officials from the U.S. Justice Department and U.S.
attorney's office to Gov. Moore, Mr. Ellis said.
   The obstruction-of-justice charge relates to Mr. Moore's
alleged attempts to influence the testimony of two witnesses,
Mr. Kizer and John F. Leaberry, Mr. Moore's 1988 campaign
manager, during the investigation.
   Mr. Moore served three, four-year terms before he was
defeated in 1988 by a wide margin by current Democratic Gov.
Gaston Caperton.

   SEC Ready to Ease Private-Placement Rules

<LP>
   Regulators are poised to usher in a new era of selling
bonds and stocks in the U.S. that could sharply swell the
$165 billion market for privately placed securities.
   After a 1 1/2-year debate, the Securities and Exchange
Commission next Thursday is expected to pass a rule that
could exempt billions of dollars in new securities offerings
from disclosure rules.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The chief beneficiaries will be big institutional
investors, corporate issuers and Wall Street investment
bankers. Individual investors, on the other hand, won't gain;
they will be barred from buying any of the expected crop of
new securities. And there are risks for buyers in a market
with less-stringent disclosure requirements.
   The SEC's new Rule 144a would exempt U.S. and foreign
institutions from registration requirements for the sale of
bonds and stocks to any institution already holding at least
$100 million in securities.
   These securities are sold in the private-placement market,
which is limited to institutions; individual investors are
shut out of this private market, which is largely used to
sell corporate debt.
   In effect, the SEC is expected to allow large players to
trade among themselves without going back to the registration
and disclosure process. This step could vastly enlarge the
volume of bonds and stocks sold in the private-placement
market, although the market isn't likely to mushroom
overnight.
   The rule would put a stamp of approval on a process that
the SEC has tacitly allowed over the years among many
institutions in the private market. By codifying these
informal practices, the SEC will create a safe harbor that is
expected to draw into the market institutions that had been
reluctant to venture forth without regulatory guidance.
   "The whole character of the private-placement market will
change," says Sara Hanks, who until recently headed the SEC's
international corporate finance unit.
   The rule has several important implications. It's expected
to attract droves of foreign companies to the U.S. markets to
raise capital; foreign concerns have largely avoided the
marketplace here because of stringent American disclosure
rules.
   And the rule could make U.S. markets more competitive, by
lowering financing costs and keeping U.S. companies from
heading overseas to finance themselves.
   Equally important, the rule is likely to bolster liquidity
-- the ease with which securities can be bought and sold in
the secondary, or resale, market for private placements.
   But the rule will be no panacea. That's because
restrictions on snapping up private securities still exist
among many of the expected buyers.
   Mutual funds generally can't invest more than 10% of their
assets in so-called restricted securities such as private
placements. And state law doesn't allow insurance companies
to buy private securities in a big way: New York state, for
example, prohibits insurance firms from putting more than 1%
of their assets in foreign securities. Until the restrictions
are lifted, some say, the rule's impact will be blunted.
   "The $64,000 question is: How long is it going to take to
get buyers to come to the party, and how many will come once
they decide what the party is?" says Curtis Welling, a
managing director at First Boston Corp.
   Says Robert Pozen, general counsel for Fidelity
Investments, the nation's biggest mutual-fund group: "It's
not going to be a huge revolution, but a modest evolution."
   The rule may create yet another barrier for small
investors, who can't trade these securities. By greatly
expanding the market to which individual investors lack
access, critics say, it will allow the big boys to use their
size and clout to create even more favorable deals than they
already get.
   There are risks, too: Just because an institution holds a
boatload of money doesn't necessarily make it a smart
investor. Many large thrifts proved that. And the money
that's at risk in a big pension fund ultimately belongs to
small investors.
   As a result, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden is considering
seeking to impose an additional barrier for banks and
thrifts, by setting minimum net capital standards. Mr.
Breeden, a veteran of the thrift bailout, is said to be
concerned about the sophistication of banks and thrifts. The
SEC won't offer this proposal next Thursday, however.
   Says Monte Wetzler, an attorney for Breed, Abbott &amp;
Morgan, a New York law firm: "The underlying assumption is
that institutions are sophisticated enough to deal with the
lack of disclosure."
   Despite a lack of regulation, there is often more
disclosure in the private market than for publicly traded
securities, some securities executives contend. Jerome
Greene, a managing director at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., says "the
very personal process" of negotiating deals in the private
market ensures that institutions receive adequate
information. Of course, institutions that want more
disclosure can demand a better rate or simply walk away.
   The rule couldn't come at a better time for Wall Street.
Stung by a deep recession, securities firms hope the rule
eventually will be a shot in the arm. It also could help
revive the private-placement market by removing the
regulatory uncertainties that have deterred some companies
from using it.
   After booming throughout the 1980s, private placements
have slowed recently amid the collapse of the junk-bond
market. Nearly 82% of the $165 billion in securities sold
through private placements last year was corporate debt,
according to IDD Information Services.
   But there will be outcasts from this market under whatever
rule the SEC passes: companies whose stock or debt already is
listed on an exchange or quoted over the counter.
   The result nevertheless will be a chance for institutions
to freely swap massive blocks of securities. "The impact is
already occurring, much like {preparations for} 1992 in
Europe," says John Miller, an executive vice president at
Equitable Capital Management Corp. in New York. "Foreign
issuers already are coming into the market more often. The
pace has picked up in the past year or so."
   The firms most likely to benefit from the new rule will be
those with the biggest international presences, including
Morgan Stanley Group Inc., First Boston and Salomon Inc.,
specialists say.
   Among other things, the new rule is ideal for sovereign
and semi-sovereign debt, executives say, because of the high
quality of the issues. A debt offering in the private market
likely to test the effect of the new rule is one by the State
Bank of India. Philip Bennett, a director for capital markets
at Salomon Brothers, says the India debt placement, and an
expected issue for the State Bank of South Australia, "will
be precursors of 144a offerings."
   Moreover, the rule also might open up a market for easily
trading controlling interests in companies that have been
taken private in leveraged buy-outs. In that way, it could
provide an alternative for LBO owners who don't want to take
the companies public again to get their money out.
   Frederick Zuckerman, vice president and treasurer at
Chrysler Corp., said he thinks finance companies could emerge
as the most frequent users of the new private market. He says
the market would be ripe for "the guys who come to the party
every other week for $100 million or so." He adds: "I just
think it makes life a little easier for people who use the
capital markets."
   The New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, may face pressure
to upgrade its trading systems. That's because the SEC also
is expected next Thursday to approve a new automated trading
system by the National Association of Securities Dealers that
the NASD hopes will serve as the central marketplace for
privately placed securities.
   The system, dubbed Portal -- for Private Offerings,
Resales and Trading through Automated Linkages -- will be
able to handle any bond or stock exempted from SEC
registration under Rule 144a.

   `Cats' Composer Hopes Theater Investors
   Will Greet His `Blind Pool' With Raves

   NEW YORK -- The man who made "Cats" sing is lining up a
chorus of investors for more than one show.
   Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer of hit musicals "Evita,"
"Cats" and "The Phantom of the Opera," among others, is
attempting to raise as much as $20 million in a private
placement offering to wealthy individuals. The offering is
the largest of its kind in the theater and the first offering
for more than one play. If successful, it may open up a new
source of money in the increasingly expensive and risky
business of live theater.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Webber's extravagant productions have made lots of
money for investors, but this offering warns of substantial
risks. Still, Mr. Webber and his advisers are betting that
the composer's impressive record in producing mainstream hits
will attract investors willing to buy units of $50,000 each,
even though they won't know ahead of time every production on
which the money will be spent.
   In a prospectus being circulated by Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. and Mutual Benefit Financial Service Co., a
unit of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., investors are
offered the chance to put their money into "financing the
production of musical and dramatic plays." According to the
offering document, about three-quarters of the money will be
used for Mr. Webber's plays, both on Broadway and for touring
productions around the world. But about $4 million or so will
go for a "blind" fund, producing non-Webber musicals and
plays chosen by Mr. Webber's London-based Really Useful Group
Inc.
   The securities firms, lawyers and consultants on the
offering are tight-lipped about details. But theater experts
say the Webber offering is being closely watched in the
industry. "If this offering works, it opens the possibility
of a lot of people doing something like it," says Paul
Woerner, an entertainment attorney with Leavy, Rosenweig &amp;
Hyman. "It took someone who was willing to assume the
enormous risk and expense of putting together an offering: If
this goes, their offering literature will become the form
everybody uses."
   Although limited partnerships to raise money for movies
became popular in the '80s, Broadway producers had a hard
time getting similar concepts through the New York attorney
general's office. Finally, after several years of lobbying
and work sessions between attorneys and producers, the rules
were changed in November 1988 to allow theatrical offerings
for more than one play. But the Webber offering is the first
to take advantage of the change.
   "I'm surprised it took this long," says Elizabeth Block,
the assistant attorney general who specializes in theatrical
financing. She adds that "the theater industry made it clear
all along that this wouldn't necessarily be a common thing,
and they wanted the first one out of the box to be a good one
for investors. They didn't want the industry to get a bad
name." Ms. Block says that until now, the biggest investment
fund that she has approved for a single show was about $8
million for the flop musical "Carrie."
   It isn't clear that the Webber fund will be a winner for
investors. The offering documents say that about $4.2 million
will go toward a U.S. road show of "Phantom of the Opera,"
with another $1 million going to the French production of the
smash hit. But investors won't get any money from the
continuing Broadway and London productions, and Mr. Webber
now plans a movie of the play that may reduce appetites for
theater tickets.
   More than $6 million of the $20 million maximum is to be
spent on the Broadway production of Mr. Webber's newest
musical, "Aspects of Love," and $1.3 million is going to the
Canadian version of that show. But the just-opened Broadway
show received some of the most negative reviews of Mr.
Webber's career, with some critics even suggesting that it
may snap the composer's winning streak. Although the offering
document says the show opened with more than $10 million in
advance Broadway ticket sales, it isn't clear yet that this
show will be a long-running megahit like "Cats" and
"Phantom."
   Although the document doesn't disclose revenues for any
shows or project future revenues, it does say that "Aspects"
would have to run for a minimum of 74 1/2 weeks to a capacity
house before investors could start making a profit. As the
document points out, few plays ran that long in the 1988-1989
season, and "few {of those that did} played to capacity
audiences."
   Perhaps the biggest gamble for investors involves Mr.
Webber's future plans. The composer has announced his
intentions to stop writing musicals for the foreseeable
future and turn his efforts to making movies. That's why,
according to Mr. Webber, he's buying back the public stock in
Really Useful Group, which has jumped in value as profits
from "Cats" have continued to roll in. "The profits from past
shows will fall over time, and he doesn't want to have to
write more musicals just to puff up the profits of Really
Useful," says Robert Kretowicz, a financial adviser to Mr.
Webber at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London.
   That means that the "blind" portion of the new theater
fund will go into non-Webber shows selected by Really Useful,
and the offering documents show that only one out of seven
non-Webber shows so far produced by Really Useful has made
money for investors. Several are still running.
   Nevertheless, many Broadway veterans are delighted that at
least an attempt is being made to bring a new source of
funding to the theater.
   "I think this is great," says Miles Wilkin, chairman of
Pace Theatrical Group, which mostly puts on touring
productions of Broadway shows. "People view investing in
Broadway as a major crapshoot and anything that upgrades
investment in theater as legitimate business is very
positive. For us, most shows outside New York make a modest
or better profit. and I've often thought that a blind pool
could be put together that would combine a New York premiere
with some less risky touring productions," Mr. Wilkin says.
   Less optimistic observers point out that few producers and
playwrights have Mr. Webber's track record, making it much
harder to float such a fund. Veteran producer Arthur Cantor,
who is trying to save money these days by putting on one-man
shows, says that if Broadway figures such as choreographer
Jerome Robbins and playwright Neil Simon wanted to raise
funds in a blind pool, "investors would jump right in." But
"it's a short list."
   "The cost of doing plays is too high," argues producer
Emanual Azenberg. "This won't change that, or make better
plays. Besides, plays are not like movies: There aren't as
many ways to make money on a flop," he adds.
   Some argue that theater pools may take out too much of the
fun for investors. Entertainment lawyer Elliot Brown says: "I
have put a lot of investors in a lot of shows, and they do it
because they love a particular project and they love going to
opening night and hanging out in the theater. This sort of
turns theater into a flinty-eyed investment, and that may
take the romance out for some people."

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   Suffering and Renewal
</HL>

   These are days of intense reflection for much of the
Christian and Jewish population of the United States. In the
period of Passover and in the days from Holy Thursday through
Easter, it is common for men and women to measure the
profound and steadfast seriousness of these holy days against
events in the secular world. In doing so on a day such as
Good Friday, it is normal to grieve at the persistent
grimness that besets many of the world's people. It's
surprising, then, to consider how wondrously much of the
secular world has been transformed since this time last year.
More astonishing, perhaps, is how well the content of these
events -- the Berlin Wall broken, Eastern Europe freed,
democracies re-emerging -- reflects the essential message of
these holy days, which is renewal and liberation.
   It has been a long time since one could emerge from this
week's contemplative moments with cause for celebration. For
many years, for example, one could still find priests in old
Polish-American parishes who would end their Masses as they
had for 45 years -- with a firm, if seemingly hopeless appeal
for the conversion of Russia. So these old priests are a
little more hopeful than they were 12 months ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ironically, the exhilarations of this sudden progress are
experienced simultaneously with continuing news of suffering
and conflict. Christians are slaughtering Christians in
Beirut. Moslems are murdering Moslems in Karachi, Pakistan.
In Peru, communist guerrillas attempt to break the will of
people who voted bravely in last Sunday's elections; in
recent days the guerrillas have hurled bombs at schools,
factories and housing projects. Yesterday, on Holy Thursday,
the government-sanctioned Russian Orthodox church accused the
Ukrainian Catholic church of fomenting "violence and
illegality." Vietnam's refugees fester in Hong Kong. In
China, with the anniversary of its democratic uprising
imminent, the government has restricted access to Tiananmen
Square. It has become China's dead ground.
   This suffering is the traditional object of prayers and
sermons. But it would be good, we think, if among these
entreaties some mention were made of what has been
accomplished and what we have learned.
   In the past, much human suffering has been the consequence
of the political illegitimacy of governments, the persistence
of philosophical errors such as statism, ethnic animosities
or deep and untended grievances. It is now clear that there
is an alternative to political systems that kill the spirit
and breed evil.
   The alternative is self-determination. This is a
well-settled truth, but it has been remarkable in the past
year to watch the way self-determination works. It is as if
we have all been looking at a biology of politics regenerate.
Once born, self-determination seems to grow quickly into
discussion groups, newspapers and platform speeches, and then
spread into parties, candidates, elections and ultimately a
new government. Within months, prisoners had become
presidents and parliamentarians.
   One of the most widely talked-about features of this
process as it unfolded in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany is how few people have been killed. Presumably
they value their new political responsibility more highly
than retribution. That people are willing to risk much to
acquire the right of self-determination has been shown in El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Peru, where citizens braved the
threat of assault or death simply to cast a vote.
   It is apparent that the spread of self-determination has
occurred so quickly and with such force that many of the
world's leaders are having some difficulty knowing how to
balance the competing interests of the new status quo.
Government-to-government policy-making is so much more
manageable, if by "the Soviets" one simply means a handful of
men, not the 15 Soviet Republics of 287 million citizens. Or
if "the Chinese" are four old men, instead of 1 billion
democrats.
   But with the minds of men and women turned toward their
most firmly held beliefs this week, it is appropriate to
consider how we who have become accustomed to
self-determination can best ensure that those who have just
achieved it will keep it, and that those who want it can also
win its benefits. Spiritual and secular renewal are by no
means coincident, but both worlds surely prosper if they have
the means and freedom to coexist.

   A University of Michigan study of how much time various
nationalities spend at work and at play shows that Japan lags
behind the U.S. in leisure time.
   American men spend on average 20.5 hours a week at
leisure, compared with 13.3 hours taken by Japanese men,
according to the study. The disparity is even greater between
American women, who take 21.8 hours of time out each week for
leisure, and Japanese women, who take just 10.6 hours.
   The study was based on surveys conducted between 1964 and
1987 in the U.S., Japan, the Soviet Union, Finland, Hungary,
Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Among other findings, it reported
that the work week ranged from 54 hours in the Soviet Union
to 33.4 hours in Denmark.
   Soviet women spent more time working than women in the
other countries, averaging 39.3 hours a week on the job and
27 hours a week doing housework. American women averaged 23.9
hours a week on the job and 30.5 hours a week working at
home.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA PARDONS BOMBER
                                                                                                       

   The South Korean cabinet agreed to pardon a North Korean
agent condemned to hang for blowing up a Korean Air Lines
jetliner in 1987 and killing all 115 people on board.
Officials said President Roh Tae Woo would soon release
28-year-old Kim Hyun Hui on the grounds she was both a pawn
and a victim of the communist North. Seoul's Supreme Court
last month had upheld the death sentence.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S PRESSURED STUDENTS
                                                                                                       

   The pressure of college-entrance exams has led to more
class hours and required courses in Japan's public high
schools, the Education Ministry said. According to a ministry
survey of Japan's 3,893 public high schools, 12.4% require
more than 35 hours of classes per week, up from 7.9% in 1982,
when the ministry urged high schools to reduce classes to 32
hours per week. The ministry also wants schools to limit
their academic year to 35 weeks, but 65.7% of the high
schools had more than 35 weeks of classes, the ministry said.
                                                                                                       

   ITALIAN BANK ACCORD
                                                                                                       

   After eight months of negotiations, the Federation of
Italian Banks and unions representing 320,000 bank employees
reached an accord in principle over a new, four-year labor
contract. The contract calls for an average monthly pay
increase of 356,000 lire ($289) and an extension of bank
opening hours to 35.5 hours a week from the current 32.5
hours. The unions have also agreed to keep banks open to 6:30
p.m. once a week to accommodate working people.
                                                                                                       

   KLM FARE CUT
                                                                                                       

   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is cutting the price of tickets
bought in the Netherlands for destinations in the U.S. The
reduced fare on a round-trip flight to New York from
Amsterdam will be 1,000 guilders ($530), compared with the
current fare of 1,400 guilders. The reduced fare for a
round-trip flight to Los Angeles will be 1,400 guilders,
compared with the current 1,734 guilders. A spokesman for the
airline said the move will coincide with a KLM campaign that
will advertise tourism to the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   SPEEDING ACROSS TAIWAN
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan's cabinet approved the nation's largest public
project ever: construction of a high-speed railway system
across the island to relieve congested traffic on the
north-south freeway. Officials said the railway would cost
279.2 billion Taiwan dollars ($10.66 billion) and would be
built over 10 years. The 225-mile elevated rail will link
Taipei with the southern port of Kaohsiung. Travel between
the two cities will take 105 minutes on the high-speed train,
compared with five hours on the present railway line.
                                                                                                       

   SAFETY OF EUROPEAN FERRIES
                                                                                                       

   The European Community Commission is considering action to
remedy what many see as lax ferry-safety standards.
   Last weekend's disaster aboard the Danish-owned
Scandinavian Star underscored the need for harmonization and
toughening of design and safety procedures throughout the EC,
commission officials say.
   Member states in the past have rejected commission
proposals, arguing that the matter is best left to the
International Maritime Organization. Britain, however, has
been enforcing tougher ferry standards in the wake of the
Herald of Free Enterprise disaster off the Belgian coast
three years ago and is urging EC action.
   Responding to the deadly fire on the Bahamas-registered
Scandinavian Star, a maritime commission from Norway, Sweden
and Denmark decided to tighten inspection procedures for
foreign-flagged ships in Scandinavian waters.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Billionaire businessman Yoshiaki Tsutsumi said he would
resign as president of Japan's Olympic Committee to take
responsibility for a mix-up in national anthems at last
month's Asian Winter Games in Sapporo. During the games,
Japanese officials erroneously played the Mongolian and North
Korean anthems at a medal ceremony for a South Korean
speed-skater. . . . Only hours before ex-King Michael of
Romania was scheduled to fly from Geneva to Bucharest, the
Romanian government canceled his visa and asked Swissair not
to let him board the flight. The airline complied.

   Toyota Picks OMON for Image Campaign

   Toyota Motor has selected OMON, a tiny New York agency
staffed by Australian creative executives, to develop a
corporate-image campaign.
   The account, which will bill about $10 million this year,
is a big victory for OMON, which beat out several larger
agencies for the business, including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
OMON's parent agency in Australia is well regarded there, but
the New York office opened only a year ago and has only about
15 employees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   OMON and Toyota, which has never done image advertising in
the U.S., declined to comment on the new campaign. Executives
close to Toyota said the auto maker is interested in, among
other things, promoting its record as a large employer of
Americans to gain favor with U.S. consumers. The campaign
will begin next month.
   The other agencies that bid for the account were Ingalls,
Quinn &amp; Johnson in Boston and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific,
Toyota's main agency, which created the long-running "I Love
What You Do For Me" campaign.
   OMON has announced only a few small business wins since it
opened. But earlier this year it scored a quiet coup when
Philip Morris invited it to pitch the $60 million Benson &amp;
Hedges account in competition with four much larger agencies.
Philip Morris wound up retaining the account at Wells, Rich,
Greene, but OMON walked away with a significant consolation
prize that it didn't announce: the ad assignment for a new
cigarette brand.
   In an interview last year, OMON executives said the agency
plans to hire some U.S. staffers, but said the creative
department would be led by Australians. Its co-creative
directors, George Betsis and Rodd Martin, opened the office
last April after holding the top creative spots at Mojo's New
York office.
   But it is Joanne M. Davis, a former Wells Rich executive
tapped by OMON last June to be president, who is credited
with bringing in high-profile clients, industry executives
said. As head of new-business development at Wells Rich, she
led teams that helped win major business from International
Business Machines and MCI.
   Executives say Ms. Davis and her colleagues have worked to
make the shop's Australian heritage a point of difference
from other agencies. It's not a conventional Madison Avenue
agency: At its arty headquarters in Manhattan's SoHo
district, staffers answer the phone with a rousing "It's a
great day at OMON]" greeting.
   Shortly after it opened, OMON began a hunt for new
business by sending selected companies copies of their ads
that OMON judged to be of poor quality -- along with a note
about why they should hire OMON. On each ad, the agency
slapped a sticker with the headline, "It's quite possible
that we're the only ones who noticed this ad." Some
advertising people criticized the approach as brash, but
others commended the shop for taking a gutsy stand.
   "They're not going to be the agency for everybody," said
Leslie Winthrop, president of Advertising Agency Register,
which helps clients with ad agency searches. "But I think
they'll probably bring opinions and ideas {to clients} that
haven't been done here. They're not suffering from the
Made-in-the-USA syndrome."

   Chrysler Safety Campaign
                                                                                                       

   Chrysler is launching an ad campaign that uses actual
crash survivors to endorse the company's air-bag-equipped
cars.
   The campaign is the most aggressive step yet in the No. 3
U.S. auto maker's effort to make a marketing plus of
outfitting all its 1990-model U.S.-made cars with air bags.
Chrysler's campaign is unusual because it features
testimonials from customers who have survived wrecks. It even
shows pictures of smashed-up cars to dramatize the benefits
of air bags.
   In one of the new television spots, Karen McGowan of
Columbia, Md., declares: "A Chrysler air bag saved my life."
Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca appears with her and says:
"I could give you a dozen reasons why you should consider a
Chrysler product. But today I'll give you just one: Karen
McGowan."
   The television and print ads will continue the "Advantage:
Chrysler" theme begun earlier this year by pointing out that
a greater share of Chrysler cars come with standard air bags
than any major Japanese car maker. Bozell created the new
ads.

   WHO'S NEWS: Jack Taylor and Gene Case were named vice
chairmen at Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor. They were
executive vice presidents. The agency also appointed eight
executive vice presidents: Stephen Badenhop, Alice Bond, Tom
Finneran, Bruce Guidotti, Mark Itkowitz, Alex Ross, Ilon
Specht and Don Weir.

May issue will drop its trademark red logo for a special

   FCC Votes to Give
   Formal Clearance
   To Airline Phones

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
formally established a service that enables airline
passengers to make phone calls during flights.
   The action, on a 4-1 vote, lets Airfone Inc., a unit of
GTE Corp., continue operations, but also opens up the
four-megahertz spectrum to competitors, including a new
service, In-Flight Phone, owned by Jack Goeken, Airfone's
founder.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Airfone has been operating under an experimental license
since 1984 and has installed air-to-ground phones in about
1,260 aircraft, or about a third of the U.S. airlines'
domestic fleet.
   In recent months, Airfone has begun installing phones in
each row of seats, a move that has led to a fourfold increase
in calling. So far, Airfone has installed the additional
phones on 93 aircraft, and has signed contracts with several
carriers, including United Airlines, to equip their fleets, a
spokesman said.
   The commission said it adopted an "open entry" plan
because the panel believes the service would develop faster
and be more innovative. The agency envisions that individual
carriers will contract with phone-service providers.
   A GTE spokesman said the company was pleased with the
outcome of the lengthy FCC proceeding. In recent weeks, other
companies had proposed alternative uses for the spectrum,
including using it for cellular-phone service.
   Sandra Goeken, a vice president with her father's company,
said the Goeken Group is "delighted." The FCC's action clears
the way for competitors to apply for licenses to operate
phone systems, and the In-Flight Phone service could be ready
by the fall, she said.
   The new Goeken service is digital, compared with the older
analog technology used by Airfone, and Ms. Goeken said she
expects to provide airline passengers with a wide range of
information services, facsimile service and computer links.
"As an airline passenger, you could have access to everything
you have at your desk," she said.
   To discourage speculative applications, the FCC requires
applicants to have a service agreement with at least one
airline and insists that construction of the systems are
completed within five years, with a minimum of 25 base
stations before service can begin. In addition, licenses
can't be transferred until a year after construction is
completed.
   Separately, the commission approved plans by the regional
Bell telephone companies for breaking out the basic services
in their network so that all information-service providers
can obtain individual services on an equal footing with the
Bell companies themselves.
   The move was a step forward in the fight to open up the
networks so that business and residential telephone users can
have more choices of special services.
   The commission required seven Bell companies to file minor
changes by July and update their plans by April 15, 1991.
   The Bell companies were generally pleased with the
commission action, but expressed concerns about the changes
the commission may require. Geni Porti, a specialist in the
field at Nynex Corp., called the commission's action "a
significant step forward in the whole process."
   On another telephone matter, the commission voted
unanimously to make all credit card phones and phones in
workplaces, hotels, motels, hospitals and other public
facilities compatible for persons with hearing aids.
   The commission decided that credit card phones must be
accessible to the hearing-impaired by May 1, 1991, and those
in workplaces and other facilities by May 1, 1992. Under law,
phones made for use in the U.S. after August 1989 must be
compatible with hearing aids.

   Louis deSabla thinks he knows why his New Age newspaper,
Pathways, is prospering while some businesses that promote
natural foods, personal growth and other rituals of the
neo-1960s life style have flopped.
   The Takoma Park, Md., publisher doesn't let his idealism
blur the bottom line. "People out there in New Age
never-never land expect God to create their income," he says.
"It never works."

   To some, the label "New Age" brings to mind latter-day
flower children eating alfalfa sprouts and listening to
terminally mellow recordings of ocean waves and whale mating
calls. But entrepreneurs such as the 38-year-old Mr. deSabla
are focusing on age-old business methods as well as New Age
brown-rice recipes.
   As they evolve, the entrepreneurs are thriving. "I've
gotten to be a little more of a capitalist," says Mr.
deSabla. "My daughter goes to private school and I drive a
Volvo. And I've taken up golf. Zen golf, of course."
   New Age entrepreneurs are also learning to profit from
growing mainstream acceptance of many values and interests
shared by the New Age movement, including environmental
awareness, nutrition, a variety of physical fitness
techniques and self-improvement, all underwritten by yuppie
affluence.
   "We've found a way to bring the value system of the New
Age into the marketplace," says Tom Chappell, president of
Tom's of Maine Inc., whose toothpaste, shampoo and other
personal-care products are challenging mass-market brands in
some East Coast stores.
   David Thorne, publisher of Boston-based New Age Journal,
says New Age companies are "stressing their environmental
sensibility, and this value-added approach actually helps
sell products. People are willing to pay more money because
they feel their values are aligned with the store."
   Mr. Thorne lists natural food grocery chains, such as
Bread &amp; Circus in the Boston area, and "socially responsible"
mutual funds, such as Calvert Social Investment Fund of
Washington, as being in the mainstream of the New Age
movement, which stresses social and environmental concerns as
well as personal growth and alternative life styles.
   Mr. deSabla's nine-year-old quarterly tabloid newspaper is
quintessential New Age. Its 80-plus pages serve as a sort of
New Age bulletin board for the nation's capitol, carrying
listings for massage therapists, acupuncturists, holistic
veterinarians, macrobiotic cooking classes and a travel agent
offering "metaphysical tours around the planet."
   But like many New Age survivors, Mr. deSabla's business is
firmly grounded in generally accepted accounting principles.
A self-described "child of the 60s" who previously worked as
an executive recruiter in California and as a benefits
negotiator for the National Education Association, he says he
aims his newspaper at readers and advertisers like himself:
"People who decided to hang up their pinstripe suits and live
alternatively."
   Mr. deSabla's New Age publishing formula is simple: Keep
advertising rates cheap; make the newspaper a resource guide
that's a must for advertisers because readers won't throw it
away; and use the paper to promote your other ventures.
   Pathways is free. Readers snatch up the 40,000-copy press
run in days. It's full of ads. Mr. deSabla doesn't have an ad
salesman.
   A full-page ad costs $600. Revenue from advertisers runs
about $35,000 an issue, which amply covers the $15,000
production costs. "I'd say 85% of our advertisers are on an
annual contract," Mr. deSabla says. "We do one mailing a year
and everything just comes back. We've never felt the need to
launch a big sales effort."
   New Age papers in a number of cities follow much the same
strategy. Among them: Common Ground in San Francisco, Thought
Trends in Atlanta, Free Spirit in New York and Catalyst in
Salt Lake City.
   To keep his desktop publishing system from gathering dust
between editions of Pathways, Mr. deSabla started a monthly
mainstream community newspaper in Takoma Park. Circulation
has hit 20,000. Once a year he stages a "Natural Living Expo"
at a local armory that, with little overhead, brings in
$20,000 from gate receipts and vendors. The show, a one-day
New Age bazaar, is heavily advertised in Pathways.
   He also runs weekend retreats on the East Coast, called
"Medicine Wheel Gatherings," where several hundred persons
pay $20 to sleep in a tent and listen to Native American
elders demonstrate tribal folkways.
   Others, such as Mr. Chappell, the toothpaste manufacturer
from Kennebunk, Maine, have found that their ideas are
gaining a broader following. The Tom's of Maine products have
extended their reach beyond health-food stores and into major
pharmacy and grocery chains with a marketing campaign that
promotes the products' natural ingredients and the company's
refusal to do testing on animals.
   The credo of the New Age customer, according to Mr.
Chappell: "Don't just give me a toothpaste that has colors
and tastes good, but one that also has human and
environmental dignity."
   Mr. Chappell's products sell for considerably more than
competing mass-market brands. Nevertheless, Tom's of Maine
sales should hit $11 million in the fiscal year ending this
June, Mr. Chappell says, up 35% from the previous year.
   "It doesn't take much market share before you change how
people think," he says. And, the entrepreneur adds: "The New
Age consciousness is firmly based. I'd say it's adaptable to
at least 25% of Americans."

   Credit Ratings:
   Moody's Lowers
   Ratings on Debt
   Of Gulf Canada

   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings
on various Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. debt securities, citing
the oil and gas producer's "weak earnings and fixed-charge
coverage outlook" over the intermediate term.
   Moody's said its forecast for Calgary, Alberta-based Gulf
Canada, which is controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family,
reflects the company's high interest charges and preferred
dividend costs, a poor outlook for its drilling operations,
and falling domestic oil output.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ratings downgrade, which Moody's said affects about
900 million Canadian dollars (US$774.4 million) of debt
securities, follows an announcement last month by the agency
that it had placed Gulf Canada under review for a possible
ratings cut.
   Moody's said its downgrade affects Gulf Canada's senior
debentures, lowered to Baa-1 from single-A-2; Series 1
preferred shares, cut to Baa-2 from single-A-3; and a Gulf
Canada shelf registration, reduced to (provisional) Baa-1
from (provisional) single-A-2. Moody's also lowered Gulf
Canada's commercial paper rating to Prime-2 from Prime-1.
   The agency said it expects Gulf Canada's ability to
comfortably service debt to "remain constrained over the next
several years" because of dividend requirements. As a result,
it said, "capital spending is likely to outpace net cash flow
generation, leading to increased financial leverage" without
an equity infusion or asset sales.
   A Gulf Canada spokesman said, "We're disappointed
naturally, but that's their assessment. What else can I say?"
   Moody's said it sees Gulf Canada's longer-term prospects
as sound in light of its big reserves in frontier areas, such
as the Beaufort Sea and off the east coast of Newfoundland.
It said Gulf Canada has also made "significant progress" in
extending its exploration prospects in Indonesia, where it
gained a major foothold with its 1988 acquisition of Asamera
Inc.
   Moody's said this should help offset the company's
shrinking output from conventional fields in western Canada.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Gulf Canada common stock closed at $13, unchanged.
   Moody's said it also downgraded to Prime-2 from Prime-1
its rating on about C$160 million of short-term debt of
Olympia &amp; York (Gulf Canada Square) Ltd., a unit of Olympia &amp;
York Developments Ltd., the Reichmann family's wholly owned
flagship real estate concern.
   The unit was formed to issue notes secured by the
corporate headquarters of Gulf Canada. A Moody's analyst said
the downgrade of the unit's debt doesn't affect ratings on
the debt of Olympia &amp; York Developments or any of its other
units.
   Moody's said the rating cut, which followed a similar
ratings downgrade last month by Canada's Dominion Bond Rating
Service Ltd., was "prompted by the fact that the company's
ability to meet its obligations depends largely on the
receipt of lease payments" from Gulf Canada, whose debt
ratings have been downgraded.

   Arbitration Settles
   A Lot, Unsettles a Few

<TEXT>
   THE VERDICT is still out on the booming field of "dispute
management," in which disagreeing parties go to an arbitrator
instead of the courts.
   Robert Coulson, president of the American Arbitration
Association, calls dispute management "the buzz word for the
1990s."
   With the heavy backlog in both federal and state courts,
it's not surprising that independent arbitration filings grew
to some 90,000 in 1989. The arbitration association, the
largest of some 600 socalled alternative dispute-resolution
groups, reported 55,520 case filings last year, a jump of
more than 36% from 1980.
   Business arbitrations with the association almost doubled
to 12,220 last year from 6,140 in 1980, and represented $2.41
billion in claims and counterclaims. Disputes over
construction, securities, computer software, labor and
insurance make up the bulk of business cases. Increasingly,
contracts spell out that any dispute will go to arbitration.
   Not everyone is excited about the rush to settle disputes
outside the courts. Judith Resnik, professor of law at the
University of Southern California, argues that independent
arbitration raises "serious questions about power and
justice" and that the privatization of justice doesn't
necessarily translate into the better administration of
justice.
   Arbitration, she says, favors the well-to-do, such as
large companies, which "can afford to go out and hire an
arbitrator or set up a system of arbitration."
   And studies recently done by Rand Corp. show that while
court-supervised arbitration programs are popular, they may
not actually save time or money, a key reason for avoiding
the courthouse in the first place.
                                                                                                       

   Paralegal Jobs Thriving
   In Atmosphere of Thrift
                                                                                                       

   LAW FIRMS and corporate law departments continue to bring
paralegals on board at swift rates.
   The number of paralegals, or legal assistants, in law
firms increased 18% in 1987 and 16% in 1988, says a study by
Ernst &amp; Young's legal consulting group.
   The 300 law firms surveyed had an average of one paralegal
for every four attorneys and paid paralegals an average
salary of $31,000. Paralegals logged an average of 1,350
billable hours a year, and clients were billed $41 to $60 an
hour for their time finding documents and carrying out other
tasks that don't require a lawyer.
   With the dropoff in big-dollar mergers and other deals,
large law firms are facing a new economic reality, according
to Robert J. Berkow, national director of legal consulting
services for Ernst &amp; Young and chief author of the study.
"Paralegals are a key ingredient in achieving savings in
cost, timeliness and even quality," Mr. Berkow says.
   In corporate law departments, the number of paralegals
increased nearly 10% in 1988. Company legal departments
employ one paralegal for every two attorneys, perhaps because
of limits on the numbers of attorneys corporations can hire
and the more routine nature of corporate legal work, the
study theorizes.
                                                                                                       

   Law Schools' Fall Down
   On Minority Recruiting
                                                                                                       

   DESPITE GUNG-HO recruiting efforts by the nation's law
schools, the number of black, Mexican-American and Puerto
Rican law students has increased only slightly in the past 12
years.
   According to the American Bar Association, members of
these three minority groups account for only 7%, or 8,456, of
the 120,694 students enrolled at the 174 ABA-accredited law
schools.
   While the number of black students rose about 5% in the
past six years to 6,321, and the number of Puerto Rican
students increased about 10% to 478, the number of
Mexican-Americans in law school actually dropped about 100
students to 1,657 from its peak in the early 1980s.
   By contrast, the number of Asian-American students more
than doubled in the past decade, from fewer than 1,400 in
1977 to 3,133 in the '88-'89 school year.
   Considering the much-ballyhooed recruitment efforts of
schools, what's the reason? Some law professors point to the
scarcity of minority faculty members at law schools, saying
it's a turnoff for prospective students. "Of the more than
7,000 law professors in the country, only 28 or 29 are
Chicano or Puerto Rican," says Richard Delgado, a law
professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
   Harvard Law School Prof. Derrick A. Bell says the dearth
of minority faculty members "is even greater at the so-called
elite law schools." The University of Chicago Law School, he
points out, "has no minority faculty presence whatsoever."
   Kathryn R. Stell, an admissions dean at the school, says
the absence of minority faculty "may be a factor for some
students" in whether to attend the school. She is also quick
to point out that 35 of the schools 550 students are black,
up from 15 in the 1985-1986 academic year.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   LAWYERS SHOULD be required to use recycled paper for state
filings, a Chicago public interest law group tells the
Illinois Supreme Court. Petitioning the court, Business and
Professional People for the Public Interest notes that the
panel already regulates the size and quality of paper filed.
. . .
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist calls for more postage
stamps featuring Supreme Court justices. The Postal Service
recently issued a stamp with Chief Justice John Marshall, his
fourth appearance. "When it comes to members of the court who
aren't John Marshall, the {stamp} pickings are pretty slim,"
Justice Rehnquist said recently.

   Management:
   Firms Oust
   `No Layoff'
   Tradition
   ----

   When is a layoff not a layoff?
   When you're shown the door, but it's called something else
at Digital Equipment Corp., International Business Machines
Corp. or any of a dozen other corporate giants recently
forced to retreat from paternalistic traditions of lifetime
employment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Intense competition increasingly has caused companies in
industries from banking to consumer products to reverse their
no-layoff policies. "It's impossible to maintain these
policies today," says James C. Cabrera, president of Drake
Beam Morin, a big New York-based outplacement firm. "The old
womb-to-tomb psychological contract has been broken."
   The retreat at some of the nation's best-known firms
reflects the triumph of short-term thinking in American
business, says Prof. Oscar Ornati of New York University's
graduate business school. "Companies tend to view employees
as fixed costs that can be cut," he says. "More companies
today are focusing on short-term gains -- not building for
the long term."
   Some of the companies ending no-layoff traditions go to
ridiculous lengths to claim they still never force people
out. Targeted workers are "redundant," "excessed" or
"transitioned" -- never laid off.
   "It's a form of double-think," says Marc Schulman, an
analyst with UBS Securities. "They're trying to disguise
what's really going on." He was especially critical of
Digital for failing to disclose the full extent of planned
cuts -- which insiders assert could total 5,000 to 8,000 this
year -- that the company began making in a piecemeal fashion
last month. "Their salami-style approach is hard on
employees, who never really know when it will end," Mr.
Schulman says.
   In addition to using euphemisms for layoffs, some
companies are heavy-handed in the way they send the signal to
employees.
   At Digital, people who once wore suits and ties were put
to work in recent months painting hallways at a plant in
Salem, N.H. At a factory in Phoenix, Ariz., Digital in the
past loaned unneeded employees to the city, "sprucing up
parks, painting signs and other civic work," a former
executive recalls. "It didn't take people long to decide it
was time to go."
   The end of some lifetime-employment policies is old news
for Peter Clavelle, mayor of Burlington, Vt., which will have
to absorb this year's loss of as many as 1,000 top-flight
manufacturing jobs at nearby IBM and Digital plants.
   "These companies may claim they don't lay off workers, but
I don't take much comfort in that," he says. "The reality is
that as they reduce the work force, no matter how it's done,
the economic impact is the same. We still have a strong
economy, but it hurts."
   Adds a Burlington-area employment agent, who didn't want
to be identified: "Morale is down at both plants. And out at
Digital, I'm not so sure people really have a choice about
leaving the company." So, even with a generous severance
payment, "that sounds like a layoff to me."
   Still, Digital and IBM had long been the exceptions in the
computer industry, where quick and merciless cutbacks are
common.
   Hewlett-Packard Co., too, had a lifetime-employment
reputation. But it laid off 440 workers last year at its
newly acquired Chelmsford, Mass.-based Apollo Computer unit.
"It's impossible today to have a cut-and-dried no-layoff
policy," says Marleen Somsak, a spokeswoman. "We offered
transfers to as many employees as we could. But we knew there
would be redundant jobs."
   Computer makers aren't the only ones hurting, and some
companies had already abandoned lifetime-employment
traditions. "What happened to us is what happened to a lot of
big American companies in the 1980s," says a spokesman for
Eastman Kodak Co. Pressed by rising costs and intense
competition, 20,000 people left Kodak between 1983 and 1989.
And while most were able to take liberal, voluntary severance
options, "the sense of having your job for life -- which had
been a reality here for generations -- is gone," he says.
   Some firms have held fast to their no-layoff policies.
Delta Air Lines has been known to put pilots temporarily to
work pitching luggage at their same salary when other
airlines are furloughing flight crews. "It's expensive, but
we believe it pays dividends," says spokesman James H. Lundy.
"As a service business, we need well-motivated, loyal people
on the front lines serving passengers."
   Federal Express Co. feels the same. When its ZapMail
service failed, the company offered jobs elsewhere in the
company to the unit's workers. And no layoffs took place
after the buy-out of rival Tiger International last year,
despite concern the decision could hurt earnings.
   A company's first-ever layoff sends a chill through the
ranks. "It's a culture shock," says Jay P. Stevens, an
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Some of these companies had
known nothing but double-digit growth. Now they're suddenly
facing hard reality."
   Polaroid Corp., fending off hostile bidder Shamrock
Holdings in 1988, used voluntary severance to slim down by
1,700, or 15% of its U.S. work force. "No one got fired,"
says a spokesman. "It was all voluntary. It isn't written
policy, but it's part of our culture."
   But voluntary severance plans are expensive. Workers at
IBM's Boca Raton, Fla., plant in 1988 were offered up to two
years' pay, with benefits, plus a $25,000 bonus. To stay on
the payroll, most had to move to North Carolina -- and forgo
the bonus and severance check. IBM wrote off $500 million in
the latest quarter to cover the cost of cutting its work
force by another 10,000 this year, mostly through severance
offers. The latest program -- two weeks' pay for each year of
service, up to 52 weeks' pay -- is far less generous than
past offers, a point that isn't lost on employees.
   Digital is offering thousands of workers "voluntary
severance" packages of between 40 weeks and two years of pay,
plus benefits. But it says its plans are "evolving" and
hasn't publicly disclosed them. Analysts expect Digital to
cut at least 5,000 people from the work force of 125,900 and
to post a pretax charge of as much as $400 million in the
quarter ending June 30.
   Some voluntary severance and early-retirement programs
backfire. IBM lost skilled, senior-level employees in past
rounds of cutbacks. This time, the computer giant is making
only manufacturing and some administrative employees eligible
for the program. Digital says it's determined not to make the
same mistake. Insiders say that specific jobs -- and in some
cases, people -- will be shown the door.
   As wrenching as it is, many of these companies will
benefit from a leaner work force, analysts and others say.
"They've become bloated, and they're coming to the
realization that they will have to downsize to stay
competitive," says Prof. Martin K. Starr of Columbia
University's graduate business school. "And when they close a
plant, it costs jobs -- no matter how they try to finesse
it."

   NEW YORK -- The U.S. Trustee in Manhattan appointed a
shareholders' committee for Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc.'s bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   The committee is made up of eight former Drexel employees
and a holder who was an original investor in one of the
firm's predecessor companies, said Deborah Midanek, the
committee's chairwoman. Ms. Midanek began organizing efforts
to form an equity committee in February, shortly after Drexel
filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The
company has been selling its assets and plans to close all
its operations. Most of the company's stock was owned by
employees, who largely have lost their jobs since the
bankruptcy filing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Midanek, who now works as an entrepreneur, said the
committee includes seven of Drexel's 100 largest
shareholders.
   The U.S. Trustee's office, the Justice Department branch
that administers bankruptcy-court proceedings, began
contacting shareholders last month to see who was interested
in serving on the equity committee.
   In Chapter 11 proceedings, a shareholders' committee
consults with the debtor on how the company conducts its
business and liquidation. Like the creditors' committee, it
also takes part in negotiating a plan for the company to pay
its debt and can seek the appointment of an examiner if it
opposes the debtor's actions.

   Paramount Makes Peace
   With Discount Theaters

   Paramount Pictures made peace with bargain-theater owners
by slightly modifying a pricing formula adopted last summer
that exhibitors said would force them to charge more at the
box office.
   After the policy took effect with the release of
Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," some
discount movie theaters stopped screening Paramount films.
Now most of them are expected to resume showing Paramount
films without raising prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It looks as if the hiatus hurt the theater operators more
than Paramount, one industry observer said.
   Practically speaking, the change will make most Paramount
movies available to discount movie houses four months after
they are released, a month sooner than under last summer's
policy.
   Paramount Communications Inc.'s film unit said the revised
policy strikes a balance that meets discount movie theater
owners' needs and "allows us a fair return on our enormous
investments" in the films. Movie makers have complained that
discount theaters cannibalize first-run theaters. Discounters
say their customers wouldn't be going to the movies at all if
their prices, $1 to $2, weren't so low.
   Paramount's revised pricing formula specifies that films
are available on a percentage of box-office gross basis four
months after theatrical release. The old formula required a
per-capita payment up until 30 days before videocassette
release. Under the per-capita payment requirement, a theater
owner must pay the studio $1.05 for each adult admission (75
cents for children and senior citizens) or 35%, whichever is
higher.

   WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau admitted that returns from
the 1990 census are lagging badly, in part, because Americans
are treating the forms like another piece of junk mail.
   Nearly two weeks after the April 1 target day, the bureau
said only 57% of the 103 million households that were mailed
census forms have returned them. The bureau is hoping for a
minimum 70% return rate by mail. It plans to count the
remaining households in a massive, and costly, household
canvass this spring and summer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Census Director Barbara Bryant said each 1% of the return
rate that falls below the 70% goal will cost taxpayers an
extra $10 million. The money will be spent to hire and pay
extra door-to-door enumerators. At the same time, census
officials concede that tens of thousands of Americans haven't
received their 1990 population forms due partly to erroneous
mailing lists.
   Census officials were prepared for a poor response rate
from low-income neighborhoods and areas with high immigrant
populations. But Ms. Bryant expressed surprise at the number
of affluent households ignoring their forms.
   "We understand that over the last 10 years, the American
people have been bombarded by direct and junk mail," Ms.
Bryant said. She called the census form "one piece of mail
that counts."
   Population totals from the decennial census are used to
allocate seats in the House of Representatives and state
legislatures. They are also the benchmark for handing out
billions of dollars in government grants.

   CINCINNATI -- The judge overseeing the bankruptcy-court
proceedings of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. approved an employee retention plan designed to
keep key managers from defecting from the retail companies.
   The plan will affect about 2,300 of Federated and Allied's
approximately 101,000 employees. They will be offered
employment contracts, termination agreements, enhanced
severance pay and bonuses. Federated and Allied, which are
units of Campeau Corp., filed for protection under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code Jan. 15.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plan approved by U.S. bankruptcy court Judge J.
Vincent Aug Jr. will cost the companies about $10.6 million
in the first year and $11 million in the second year,
according to documents filed in federal bankruptcy court
here. In addition, $5 million a year will be available for
discretionary bonuses. Heads of stores, merchandise managers
and corporate vice presidents will be covered by the plan.

   Japan's March Trade Surplus Widened
   By 7.2%, the First Increase in 11 Months

<LP>
   TOKYO -- A drop in imports last month caused Japan's trade
surplus to widen for the first time in 11 months, but
government officials and economists said the rise was due
largely to one-time factors.
   The March surplus, measured when goods passed through
customs, rose 7.2% to $7.09 billion from $6.61 billion a year
earlier, the Finance Ministry said. Exports fell 1.8% to
$26.01 billion from $26.49 billion, while imports dropped
4.8% to $18.92 billion from $19.88 billion. The widening of
the surplus was the first since April 1989, when it rose 7.7%
to $7.3 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Officials said the year-on-year decline in imports came
about because of unusually high imports in March 1989, when
Japanese consumers and companies rushed to purchase goods
before imposition of a consumption tax that April; March 1989
imports jumped 30.3% from the year before. A Finance Ministry
official noted that last month's imports were actually higher
than February's $16.95 billion.
   The March trade surplus with the U.S., meanwhile,
contracted 5.9% to $3.77 billion. Imports fell 2.2% to $4.54
billion, while exports dropped 3.9% to $8.31 billion. Imports
from the U.S. were boosted by a more than fivefold increase
in airplane purchases to $231.8 million, the government
official said. But Japanese car makers increased exports
11.3% to the U.S. in the month to $2.17 billion, mainly to
fill their self-restraining quota before the end of the March
31 fiscal year. Auto exports have dropped in recent months,
contributing to the steady decline in the trade surplus.
   For the full fiscal year, Japan's global surplus
contracted 24.3% to $59.68 billion. Imports increased at a
double-digit pace for the third year in a row, rising 10.3%
to $213.96 billion. Exports rose only 0.3% to $273.64
billion.
   But the fiscal year surplus with the U.S. narrowed at a
slower, 12.7% pace to $42.75 billion. The surplus with the
U.S. made up 71.6% of the total surplus, compared with 62.1%
a year earlier.
   Economists expect the surplus to shrink again in April but
at a slower pace. That expectation is based primarily on the
recent strength of the dollar, which has been pushing down
the value of dollar-denominated exports. "The low yen during
the past year seems to have pushed up volume" of exports,
said Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Bank.
Export volume stayed level in the last few months of 1989 but
rose 2% in February from the year before and 4% in March. "As
the yen becomes lower," said Mr. Kakimoto, the surplus "won't
fall as it used to."
   Import growth, caused by strong domestic demand, is also
slowing, said Matthew Berlow, an economist at Credit Lyonnais
Securities (Japan). The dollar's recent sharp rise against
the yen will mask the increase in export volume for a few
more months. But the surplus may expand more consistently
toward year end.
   That would be bad news for the Japanese government, which
is under U.S. pressure to remove so-called structural
barriers that the U.S. says prevent the surplus from
shrinking even more. In negotiations that ended last week,
U.S. officials particularly pressed Japan to revise a rigid
law governing its retail system, so American companies can
have a better chance of selling their goods in Japan.
   After seasonal adjustment, March's trade surplus stood at
$5.89 billion, up 3.2% from February's $5.71 billion.
Adjusted imports rose 7.5% to $18.75 billion from $17.44
billion, while adjusted exports rose 6.4% to $24.63 billion
from $23.15 billion.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush has an "early" case of
glaucoma in his left eye and will be treated with eye drops,
White House physicians said after the president's annual
physical.
   Glaucoma is an eye ailment in which there is increased
pressure within the eyeball and a hardening of the eyeball.
It can lead to gradual deterioration of sight and can result
in blindness if not properly treated.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a written statement, the White House said that
"extensive visual testing" indicated that Mr. Bush hasn't
suffered any loss of sight because of the glaucoma. He will
begin taking eye drops to correct the condition and will take
the medication permanently, the White House said.
   Otherwise, the four-hour exam indicated that Mr. Bush is
in "truly excellent health," Dr. Burton Lee, the White House
physician, said in the statement.

   Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest

in Milan, Italy, that will specialize in management and
leveraged buy-outs. The value of the planned investment
wasn't disclosed.
   Union Bank said the move will mark its first direct
presence in the Italian market. It said it decided to
establish a unit that will focus on buy-outs because the bank
"sees interesting business possibilities, especially
involving medium-sized and small companies." A spokeswoman
said that a decision hadn't been made on when the unit will
be established but that three investment banking specialists
have been selected to set up the operation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Union Bank also said its 20% stake in Banco Internazionale
Lombarda of Milan won't be effected by the new investment
banking unit, because the Italian institution isn't active in
equity holdings, but concentrates instead on capital markets,
asset management, foreign exchange, treasuries, and hedging
instruments.

   Stock Prices Rally on Busiest Day

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices rallied as market investors found
reasons to be less pessimistic about the first-quarter
earnings reports starting to flood the market.
   Upward revisions of some first-quarter earnings estimates
for International Business Machines spurred the gains,
traders said, while Chemical Banking moved higher as its
results for the quarter proved better than expected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 22.07 to 2751.80
--  only its second close above 2750 in the past three
months. The first came March 19, when the 30-stock average
reached its recent high of 2755.63.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
climbed 2.42 to 344.34, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index went up 1.23 to 188.80, and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index added 2.41 to 320.73. Advancing issues topped decliners
on the Big Board by 908 to 573.
   Prices steadily advanced through midday, when they peaked
as trading began to slacken in advance of the observance of
Good Friday. U.S. stock exchanges will be closed today for
the religious holiday.
   Despite the slowdown, brisk activity in a handful of
issues resulted in the busiest Big Board session of the
holiday-shortened week. Volume totaled 142,470,000 shares on
the Big Board, compared with 141,080,000 Wednesday.
   For the week, the industrial average recorded a gain of
34.68 points, or 1.3%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow equity index
also rose 1.3%, while the New York Stock Exchange Composite
gained 1.1%.
   Several Wall Street analysts have forecast that
first-quarter earnings overall could show double-digit
percentage declines from the level of a year earlier, and
stock prices have stayed within narrow trading ranges since
mid-March as investors awaited the earnings reports.
   "People are kind of steeled for a really tough
first-quarter round of earnings," said Eric T. Miller, chief
investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   As a result, Mr. Miller said, any positive earnings
surprises are likely to have a more broadly based impact on
the market than negative ones. "For the short term, the path
of least resistance is up," he said.
   But Jack Baker, head of capital commitments at Shearson
Lehman Hutton, said the market isn't likely to break out of
its trading-range pattern immediately. The industrial average
has remained within a range of about 60 points since hitting
the March 19 high.
   The latest advance is "just another run-up to the top end
of the trading range, and I don't see any reason to get
overly excited about it," Mr. Baker said. "I don't see the
urgency that (suggests) institutions are going to rush in
here on Monday."
   IBM gained 3/4 to 107 1/8 and traded as high as 108 during
the session. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein and Smith
Barney, Harris Upham both raised estimates of the company's
first-quarter earnings by 10 cents a share to $1.70, citing
indications that demand for IBM products may have been
stronger than they had anticipated. Bernstein also raised its
1990 estimate by 10 cents a share to $10.60.
   Chemical rallied 1 1/8 to 24 1/2 on Big Board composite
volume of 1.3 million shares after issuing its first-quarter
earnings data. Net income went up 28.7% from the year-ago
level, partly because of a gain in the latest period from the
sale of its stake in Florida National Banks of Florida.
   Bank of New York, which reported a 1.2% increase in
first-quarter net, dropped 3/8 to 31 3/8. Analysts had
generally anticipated a sharper rise. Other regional banks to
report first-quarter results included Barnett Banks, which
gained 1/4 to 30, and First Wachovia, which added 1 1/4 to 39
3/4.
   Ames Department Stores, the Big Board's most active issue
by a wide margin, tumbled 5/8 to 1 7/8 as more than 7.3
million shares changed hands. Some manufacturers have stopped
shipping goods to the discount department-store operator as a
result of its financial problems, and the delays could worsen
its difficulties, The Wall Street Journal reported.
   TJX, which holds a major stake in Ames, went down 1 to 13
1/2 as 2.1 million shares were traded. Activity was also
brisk in Public Service of Colorado, which rose 3/8 to 21 3/8
as trades designed to capture the stock's dividend pushed
volume to 5.2 million shares, and Federal National Mortgage
Association, which added 1 3/4 to 36 3/4 on 2.2 million
shares in the wake of a better-than-expected earnings report
Wednesday.
   Carter Hawley Hale skidded 1/2 to 7 after reporting that
its sales were down 1.9% in March from a year earlier, but
several other retailing issues rallied. K mart, whose March
sales were up 8.6%, climbed 1 to 35 1/4; J.C. Penney added
1/2 to 68 3/4; Dayton Hudson rose 1 1/4 to 70 3/4; Wal-Mart
Stores advanced 1 3/8 to 51 3/8, and Dillard Department
Stores gained 2 1/4 to 75 7/8.
   Oil stocks rebounded from their sell-off Wednesday as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries confirmed it is
considering an urgent meeting and other options to stop the
current decline in world oil prices. Mobil rose 1/2 to 60
1/8, Chevron added 7/8 to 66 3/4, Texaco gained 1 to 58 3/8,
Amoco tacked on 1 1/4 to 51 3/4, and Phillips Petroleum went
up 3/8 to 25 3/4.
   Glaxo Holdings added 1 to 27 1/8 after a presentation in
London by a Canadian company, Biochem, which is developing an
anti-AIDS drug. Glaxo holds U.S. distribution rights for the
drug and is funding Biochem's research.
   Marion Merrell Dow gained 3/4 to 25 3/8. Dow Chemical,
which acquired about 67% of the company's common stock
through the merger of its drug operations with Marion
Laboratories last year, said it plans to purchase an
additional four million shares -- a stake of about 1.5%.
   Mylan Laboratories fell 1 1/4 to 22 after Salomon Brothers
lowered its investment rating on the stock and its earnings
estimate for the fiscal year ending next March. Analyst
Robert Uhl told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report he
based the changes on a cutback in his 1990 sales forecast for
Eldepryl, a treatment for Parkinson's disease that Mylan and
Bolar Pharmaceutical produce in a joint venture. Bolar lost
1/4 to 8 7/8 in American Stock Exchange trading.
   Norton rose 1 1/8 to 77 1/8 on 1.5 million shares amid
speculation that the company could be forced to deal with its
hostile suitor, BTR PLC of Britain, or attempt to find
another bidder. A federal judge on Wednesday ordered Norton
to hold its annual meeting April 26 as scheduled; the
company, which is appealing the decision, has already
conceded that it was unlikely to prevail in its proxy fight
with BTR if the meeting isn't delayed.
   Control Data gained 1 1/8 to 21 1/8. The company is
expected to report its first-quarter results later this
month, and analysts said they expected the figures to show
that it returned to profitability after posting a loss of
$16.11 a share last year.
   RMI Titanium finished at 12 5/8 on its first day of
trading, up 1/8 from the price at which Quantum Chemical's
entire 50% stake in the company was sold in an initial
offering of 7.5 million shares. Quantum, which gained 1/4 to
23 1/2, said it expects to report a gain of about $15 million
on the sale.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index gained 0.34
to 357.88, cutting its loss for the week to 0.9%. Volume
totaled 12,560,000 shares compared with 13,520,000 Wednesday.

   Analysts expect Peugeot S.A., France's sole private-sector
auto maker, to announce next week that its 1989 group profit
climbed by roughly 13% to about 10 billion francs (about
$1.78 billion) despite a debilitating strike last September
and October that shaved about three billion francs from group
revenue.
   Group profit totaled 8.85 billion francs in 1988. Peugeot
announced last February that 1989 group revenue rose 11% to
152.96 billion francs from 138.45 billion francs in 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most Peugeot-watchers are bullish about the auto group's
performance this year. Group revenue in 1990 is expected to
increase to more than 160 billion francs, while group
earnings are seen reaching 12 to 13 billion francs.
   Peugeot is scheduled to release 1989 earnings figures
Wednesday.
   The strike at assembly plants in Sochaux and Mulhouse cut
about 60,000 vehicles -- mostly from the 205 and 405 models
-- from the production of main unit Automobiles Peugeot in
1989 and tainted an otherwise positive year for the company.

   Tesco PLC said fiscal 1990 pretax profit rose 31%, largely
helped by the sale of several stores and strong performances
by the company's new outlets.
   The U.K. food retailer said pretax profit in the period
ended Feb. 24 climbed to #361.6 million ($594.8 million) from
#276 million a year ago, just edging past the upper end of
analysts' expectations of #360 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pretax figure includes #35 million of property
profits, "substantially in excess of previous years," the
company said. Property sales brought in #10.7 million of
profit a year ago.
   The group recommended a final per-share dividend of 2.89
pence, which would bring the final payout to 4.3 pence a
share, a 23% gain from the fiscal 1989 dividend.
   Profit after tax rose 36% to #253.8 million from #186.3
million, as per-share earnings climbed 22% to 13.8 pence from
11.3 pence. Sales rose 15% to #5.73 billion from #5 billion.
   During the year, Tesco opened 22 stores while closing 17.
The company said it plans to continue to expand, with 23
outlets set to open this year.
   Tesco was bullish about fiscal 1991 prospects, saying
current trading conditions are "satisfactory" and predicted a
profitable year.

   WASHINGTON -- Japan has offered to lower tariffs on some
wood products but not quickly enough to ensure the early
completion of an accord with the U.S. to eliminate Japanese
trade barriers in these commodities.
   U.S. officials, acknowledging Tokyo's increasing
flexibility on the tariff issue, said the chances of a
comprehensive forest-products accord currently "look a little
better" than they did when negotiations started in Tokyo this
week. But they also indicated that the talks may have to be
extended until after the Easter holidays.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Individuals in the forest-product industry, who are
following the talks closely, said the Japanese offer includes
the lowering of wood-product tariffs that currently range
from 5% to 20%. However, the reductions would be phased in
over periods of one to two years.
   Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), chairman of the Senate
subcommittee on international trade, said he is concerned
about the proposed "extremely long-term phaseout period."
U.S. producers, he added, want "meaningful and immediate
access to the Japanese market."
   If the wood-products issue isn't settled by the middle of
June, the U.S. could impose trade sanctions on Japan under
the so-called Super 301 provision of the 1988 U.S. trade act.

   Smiths Industries PLC, a British aerospace, medical

damaging disputes affecting two of its business units, pretax
profit for the six months ended Feb. 3 rose 6.3% to #50.1
million ($82.4 million) from #47.1 million a year earlier.
   Profit after taxes increased 6.2% to #33.1 million from
#31.1 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose 5.6% to
11.4 pence from 10.8 pence. Sales rose 3.5% to #317.8 million
from #306.9 million.

   Smiths declared an 11% rise in the interim dividend to 3.6
pence from 3.25 pence a year earlier.
   "The underlying businesses of each of the three operating
groups made good progress," Smiths said, "though the results
of the aerospace and defense group have been damaged by two
industrial disputes" at its Cheltenham plant and at
Seattle-based Boeing Co., which is Smiths' main civil defense
customer. Smiths said that without the industrial action,
profit for the latest six months would have improved.

   WASHINGTON -- President and Mrs. Bush paid $101,382 in
taxes for 1989, the president's new tax return indicates.
   Mr. Bush reported an adjusted gross income of $456,780 for
the year, returns released by the White House indicate. That
income includes $189,167 from his salary as president; $6,229
in salary for the time he spent as vice president in 1989
before his Jan. 20 inauguration; and $208,274 in income from
the Bushes' private trust.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, a net long-term capital gain of $36,068 from
the blind trust was reported.
   Mr. Bush has placed nearly all his personal holdings into
the blind trust, so the sources of his investment income
aren't disclosed to him nor listed in detail on the tax
return.
   The tax return also shows that Mr. Bush received $14,282
in royalties from his autobiography, "Looking Forward." White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that Mr. Bush sent half
the proceeds as a contribution to the United Negro College
Fund and the other half to the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston.
   Separately, Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife,
Marilyn, released tax returns showing they had adjusted gross
income of $133,696 for 1989, and paid federal income taxes of
$25,479. The Quayles' income included $106,526 from his
salary as vice president and $14,572 in dividend income from
Central Newspapers Inc. stock.

   Heard on the Street:
   Bell Companies Are Facing Delays in Moving
   Into Information Services, Some Analysts Say

   WASHINGTON -- This month, the Bell companies moved one
step closer to the day when customers will just punch a
button to summon up a movie, a billing record or a plumber
available at midnight on New Year's Eve.
   The green light came from a federal appeals court here,
which reversed a lower court's extension of the ban on Bell
ownership of electronic directory services, sports scores,
stock quotes and other information that might one day be
transmitted over telephone networks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The appeals court told the lower court to rethink the
decision using a more lenient legal standard.
   The regional Bells' shares initially jumped more than $1
on the news, as Wall Street contemplated the potential of the
giant, unfettered Bells thundering into the information
services market. After all, the Bell regional phone companies
have spent six years fighting in the courts and in Congress
to end the restrictions on information services,
manufacturing and long-distance service that were imposed
under the consent decree breaking up the Bell System.
   But now reality is setting in, and many analysts are
concluding that the Bells' payoff from the electronic
information age isn't just around the corner.
   The Bells "could become reasonably powerful in electronic
yellow pages," says Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley. But
it will take a while. And he believes the lower court, in
unleashing the Bells, will probably take pains to "ensure
that the Bells have absolutely no advantage over independent
data providers."
   Bell companies' stocks have been buoyed of late by the
strong promise of their cellular mobile-telephone businesses,
as well as by regulatory breaks and cost-cutting. Their
stocks generally trade at multiples of earnings that match or
exceed the overall stock market.
   Ameritech and U S West both trade at 13 times the past
year's per-share earnings. BellSouth, Pacific Telesis and
Southwestern Bell have multiples of 15 to 16; Bell Atlantic,
17, and Nynex 20 (last year's Nynex profit included heavy
one-time charges.)
   Most residential telephone customers don't currently own
computer terminals to call up fancy information services.
Punching buttons on a phone keypad isn't the easiest way to
extract certain types of data. And it's unclear exactly what
the Bells might try to sell that isn't already available,
sometimes for free.
   To be sure, all seven will benefit once they can offer
electronic yellow pages. Some Bells are trying to position
themselves better than their siblings to bolt when the
judiciary or Congress opens the gate.
   "Bell Atlantic has been very aggressive on the class
services side (Caller I.D., Call Forwarding, Call Trace and
the like), and BellSouth has a lot of advanced technology in
its network, so it's more leading-edge," says Jack B. Grubman
of Paine Webber.
   "Some have shown a proclivity to be more venturesome,"
says Greg Sawers at Sanford Bernstein. He rates BellSouth and
Southwestern Bell the most aggressive, although Southwestern
recently ended its yearlong videotex "gateway" tests in
Houston. (Through a gateway, customers with computer
terminals can reach a wide range of information providers.) U
S West, which is providing low-cost computer terminals with
its gateway in Omaha, could be in a relatively good position,
too.
   On the other hand, Mr. Sawers notes, Ameritech didn't even
attempt to test a videotex gateway, and Pacific Telesis,
scanning the ruins of other electronic publishing ventures,
canceled a gateway test just before its scheduled debut.
   One part of the appeals court ruling hobbled the Bells by
upholding a ban on their entry into long distance. So the
Bells won't be the ones pocketing the long-distance revenue
when faraway customers dial up a central computer brimming
with costly-to-gather information.
   "The real benefit of owning a data base and providing it
to customers is to centralize," says Robert Morris III,
telecommunications analyst for Goldman Sachs. "Take the
example of California. Pacific Telesis would have to contract
with, say MCI Communications to carry calls between San
Francisco and L.A."
   For years, the Bells have complained that phone companies
in other countries such as France have been able to provide
information services to their customers. The Bells contend
that because of their ban, the U.S. is slipping into a
second-rate telecommunications power.
   What the Bell companies eventually want is clearance from
Congress to enter the cable television gold mine -- and
permission to own at least a portion of the programming.
Revenue from video entertainment, they say, will allow them
to build a state-of-the-art fiber-optic network.
   If the French Minitel system is indeed the model the Bells
claim it is, information services could be a mixed blessing.
"Minitel was a nice windfall for French businesses because it
made it easier to reach customers," says Mr. Morris of
Goldman Sachs. "The phone company gave away all these
terminals, and the public is paying for them through higher
rates. But one of the main things the general public uses
Minitel for is pornography."

   The attorneys general of five Midwestern states urged the
U.S. Justice Department to step up antitrust enforcement in
the meatpacking industry.
   In a letter sent yesterday to U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, the state prosecutors cited statistics that they
claim indicate dangerously high concentration of market share
in the meatpacking industry. For example, the state attorneys
general said that the four largest competitors in the
beefpacking industry control about 70% of the fed-cattle
market, up from 39% in 1980.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "For the past decade, antitrust has been the forgotten
area of federal law enforcement," Minnesota's attorney
general, Hubert Humphrey III, said in a statement
accompanying release of the letter. Mr. Humphrey signed the
letter along with his counterparts from Iowa, Montana, North
Dakota and South Dakota.
   A Justice Department spokesman said Mr. Thornburgh hadn't
seen the letter, but that federal prosecutors have "looked at
the meatpacking industry because of the concerns of meat
producers about concentration in that market." The
department's "antitrust division is aware of the situation
and will continue to monitor it," the spokesman added.

   Westwood One Inc., Los Angeles, reported that its fiscal
first-quarter loss widened sharply on a rise in revenue
because of increased interest costs, increased investments in
programming, and good-will amortization related to its
acquisition of radio stations in New York and Los Angeles.
   The company, which recently said it is launching its
fourth major radio network, reported a net loss of $7.7
million, or 53 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier
net loss of $3.1 million, or 21 cents a share. Revenue for
the quarter, ended Feb. 28, increased 20% to $31.8 million
from $26.5 million a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Because of the increased seasonality of its business,
Westwood One said it expected a "significant portion" of its
projected loss for the year to occur in the first quarter.
"As we move into our second quarter, we expect to see
increasing revenues and improved operating results for the
balance of fiscal 1990 from the company's radio networks and
station operations," said William Battison, president and
chief financial officer.

   Alcan Aluminium Ltd., hit hard by falling aluminum prices,
said in Montreal that net income for the first quarter
dropped 36% to $172 million, or 74 cents a share, from $269
million, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue was $2.20 billion compared with $2.31 billion.

   The latest quarter includes a one-time nonoperating gain
of $63 million, or 28 cents a share. The 1989 first quarter
includes a one-time nonoperating gain of $30 million, or 13
cents a share. Excluding the gains, net income dropped 54% to
$109 million, or 46 cents a share, from $239 million, or
$1.03 a share.
   The steep drop in earnings was in line with analysts'
expectations.
   Alcan said aluminum ingot prices in the latest quarter
were down 11% from the fourth quarter of 1989 and 30% from
the year-ago quarter. While order levels are improving in the
U.S. market "it's still too early to change our cautious view
of prospects for 1990," Alcan said.

   State Street Boston Corp., bolstered by higher fee and net
interest income, reported a 14% rise in first-quarter
earnings.
   Net income in the quarter was $27.6 million, or 73 cents a
primary share, compared with $24 million, or 66 cents a
share, in 1989. Fully diluted earnings were 73 cents a share
compared with 64 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Boston bank-holding company said its gains would have
been even stronger without higher provisions for loan losses.
Provisions in the quarter rose to $10.4 million from $3.6
million. State Street derives most of its income from fees
from financial services such as back-office work for mutual
funds.
   Fee revenue rose 17% in the quarter to $118.9 million from
$101.6 million. State Street attributed the gain in part to
growth in international and mutual fund assets under
management and expanded use of international asset-custody
services. Foreign exchange trading revenue rose 21% to $7.5
million from $6.2 million.
   Net interest revenue rose 11% to $53.6 million from $48.2
million.

buy-out. Mr. Mullen said he hadn't made a specific offer for
the company.

   The company said preliminary results for the first 12
weeks of this year reflect earnings of $312,000, up sharply
from $36,000 a year earlier. Revenue rose 30% to $23.7
million from $18.2 million. Earnings were buoyed by the
acquisition last May of the Casa Lupita restaurant chain,
divestiture of unprofitable restaurants, and the opening of
other restaurants, Mr. Mullen said.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Famous
Restaurants shares closed at $1.50, down 6.25 cents.

   Barnett Banks Inc., as expected after a big addition to
its loan-loss reserves, said its first-quarter earnings fell
75% to $15.5 million, or 25 cents a share, from $62.4
million, or $1 a share, a year earlier.
   The latest results were hurt by a $66 million charge to
increase to $317 million the Jacksonville, Fla.,
superregional bank holding company's reserves for potential
losses from problem loans. Write-offs of problem loans
increased 34% to $47 million from $35 million a year earlier,
and, as expected, nonperforming assets -- including about
$310 million in problem loans -- increased to $455.8 million
from about $340 million. Nonperforming assets include
foreclosed loans and loans for which interest payments are 90
days past due.

   Though first-quarter profit was at the lower end of
Barnett's target range, a spokesman said the company, with

   General Development Corp., which recently filed for

   The troubled Florida developer said 81 employees came from
its Miami headquarters, while the remaining 57 were in field
offices. They were essentially the support staff for the
homesite-development division, which was closed earlier this
week, the spokeswoman said. That closing put 239 employees,
primarily in construction and engineering, out of work.

   Last week, the company filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code when it wasn't able to pay
more than $10 million in property taxes due April 1. In
recent months, General Development has laid off or fired
about 1,600 other workers, or more than one quarter of its
work force.
   General Development's troubles stem from a grand jury
investigation of its selling practices. Last month, the
company pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to
defraud about 10,000 homebuyers by charging inflated prices
based on improper appraisals. The company's former two top
executives pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy.

   Marcus Schloss Fined for Insider Trading

   A federal judge fined Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. $480,350 for
two counts of conspiring to trade on inside information and
securities fraud.
   The securities firm could have been fined $500,000 on each
count, but Judge Charles Haight Jr. said that imposing a
large fine on both counts would have been unfair because the
two convictions stem from one incident. In an unusual ruling,
the judge fined the firm $480,350 on each count, but said it
only has to pay the fine once. As a result, the fine will
stand even if one of the two convictions is overturned on
appeal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors had urged the judge to order a
"substantial fine" but had not been more specific. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Howard Heiss, one of the prosecutors on the
case, declined to comment on the size of the fine.
   Marcus Schloss, a trading firm on the New York Stock
Exchange, was convicted of the two counts in July in
connection with its purchases of stock in American Brands
Inc. in March 1986. The firm made illegal profits of $9,825.
Marcus Schloss has said it is appealing the conviction. The
firm was acquitted on securities fraud charges involving its
trading in three other stocks.
   That case marked the first time that a Big Board member
firm had ever been convicted of insider trading. A specialist
trading firm, such as Marcus Schloss, acts as a market maker
in certain stocks.
   In determining the sentence, Judge Haight said he took
into consideration a settlement Marcus Schloss reached with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 1988. In
that settlement, which involved trading in American Brands
and other stocks, the firm turned over alleged illegal
profits of $136,900 and paid civil penalties of $273,800.
   Of those SEC penalties, however, only $19,650 was directly
related to the American Brands trading. Judge Haight, in
federal court in Manhattan, said he deducted that amount from
the fine he considered appropriate for the criminal
conviction. At the sentencing, Marvin Schwartz, an attorney
for Marcus Schloss, said it would be "double hitting" for the
criminal fine not to take into account some of the civil
penalties paid to the SEC.
   Judge Haight said he believed the reduced fine would still
send a message to the securities industry. "Trading while in
possession of material, confidential, nonpublic information
is a crime. . . . It constitutes an affront to the fair
operation of the marketplace," the judge said.

   NEW JUDICIAL PROCEDURES may be needed in cases involving
secret documents, says the independent counsel in the
Iran-Contra investigations.
   Congress may have to set special procedures, with
curtailed individual rights, to avoid problems with
disclosing classified documents in cases such as the
Iran-Contra prosecutions, Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh
said.
   Mr. Walsh suggested in an interview that Congress may want
to restrict certain defendants' rights to a public trial or a
jury of ordinary citizens because of the reluctance of
intelligence agencies to surrender classified material. The
attorney general, acting on behalf of the intelligence
agencies, can unilaterally bar the disclosure of classified
documents.
   "The picture is not happy," said Mr. Walsh, whose office
recently won the conviction of former National Security
Adviser John Poindexter for coordinating the cover-up of
covert U.S. arms sales to Iran and secret White House support
for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. "The question you come
down to," Mr. Walsh said, is: "Do you have to go to some
special system of justice like the military has?" Military
courts have restrictions on defendants' rights not found in
the civilian judicial system.
   Mr. Walsh's suggestion isn't new. Jack Friedenthal, dean
of George Washington University's law school and an expert on
legal evidence, said that "restrictions (on rights at trial)
perhaps should be the cost of holding sensitive government
positions."
   Another alternative, Mr. Walsh said, is "forcing greater
flexibility on the (intelligence) agencies in dealing with
documents." Mr. Walsh has criticized the Bush administration
for being overly zealous in protecting documents deemed
secret by the Central Intelligence Agency. He was forced to
drop conspiracy and fraud charges against Mr. Poindexter and
other defendants because of the government's concern about
disclosing secret documents.
   The independent counsel said he will submit a report to
Congress on this and other matters at the conclusion of the
Iran-Contra investigation. Meanwhile, Mr. Walsh reiterated
that he may bring additional indictments later this year.
   He is expected to recommend that Mr. Poindexter be
sentenced to prison for coordinating the cover-up of the
Iran-Contra affair. The other convicted defendants have not
received prison terms.
   Mr. Poindexter was convicted on five felony counts,
including making false statements and obstructing
congressional inquiries.

   AIDS TEST MANUFACTURER drops lawsuit against government.
   University Hospital Laboratories Corp., manufacturer of a
controversial home kit that tests for infection of the AIDS
virus, settled its suit in federal court against the Health
and Human Services Department and the Food and Drug
Administration.
   Under the terms of the settlement, the FDA must decide
within 120 days whether to approve the company's kit. The
company's chairman, Elliot Millenson, a vocal critic of the
FDA approval process, said the settlement was tantamount to
approval. "The public health benefits are so compelling that
there's little doubt that the product would be rejected," he
said. The product would allow consumers to perform blood
tests on themselves and mail them anonymously to the company.
Results would be retrieved by calling a toll-free phone
number and giving an identification number.
   But FDA spokesman Brad Stone described the outcome as more
uncertain. "It's not a guarantee that we're going to approve
the product," he said. "What it does say is that we will
review it."
   Mr. Millenson first sought FDA approval in 1987 after
clinical trials. But the FDA withheld the application on the
ground that tests for acquired immune deficiency syndrome
should be marketed only for use in a hospital or clinic.
   Under the terms of the settlement, FDA will reconsider
that decision.

   CO-OP AND CONDO DIRECTORS have broad authority to make
building policy, New York's highest court rules.
   The state's Court of Appeals ruled that cooperative and
condominium boards are shielded from judicial scrutiny by a
standard similar to the business judgment rule. The rule
prohibits judges from second-guessing actions taken by
corporate directors no matter what the result, as long as
their decisions were reasonable, legal and made in good
faith.
   "Application of a similar doctrine is appropriate because
a cooperative corporation is -- in fact and function -- a
corporation, acting through the management of its board of
directors, and subject to the Business Corporation Law," the
court wrote in a unanimous opinion. The court noted that New
Jersey, Washington and Colorado have adopted the same
standard.
   The case involved an action brought by tenant-shareholder
Ronald Levandusky challenging the board of One Fifth Avenue
Apartment Corp. in New York. At the board's request, a court
ordered Mr. Levandusky not to relocate a steam pipe in his
apartment. His attorney, Irwin Brownstein, said he had not
read the opinion and had no comment.
   One Fifth Avenue's attorney, Arthur Abelman, predicts that
the decision should diminish the amount of litigation brought
by tenant-shareholders challenging board decisions.

   COMPROMISE IS REACHED on SEC's efforts to join Drexel
creditors' committee.
   Attorneys for the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. creditors' committee
told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman that they have
agreed to resolve the matter on an interim basis. The interim
agreement will at least postpone a court fight over the SEC's
efforts to join the committee.
   Drexel filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
in February, and the SEC maintains it is the firm's largest
creditor because Drexel owes it $150 million as part of a
settlement last year of civil charges. The creditors'
committee and the U.S. Trustee's Office, a Justice Department
branch that administers bankruptcy proceedings, have opposed
the SEC's unprecedented request to be made a member of the
committee.
   Under the interim agreement, the SEC will be able to
consult with the committee's attorneys and with the
committee's chairman "to share information and ideas
regarding the conduct of the Chapter 11 case." The SEC will
also be notified of matters on which the committee plans to
make a formal decision -- except for issues involving the
internal functioning of the committee and anything relating
to actions that the committee may take against the SEC.
   In the event the agreement doesn't work out, a hearing on
the SEC's original motion is set for June 12.

   TWO BUSINESSMEN and their Connecticut companies plead
guilty to federal tax charges.
   Peter M. Brant, 43, of Greenwich, Conn. and Joseph Allen,
48, of Manhattan, and their companies, the Bato Co. and
Riviere Du Loup Newsprint Ltd., entered the pleas in federal
court in Bridgeport, Conn., and agreed to pay $2.4 million in
fines.
   U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. said Messrs. Brant and
Allen pleaded guilty to willful failure to maintain records
from which their taxable income and tax could be determined.
Bato and Riviere Du Loup pleaded guilty to two counts each of
making and subscribing false tax returns for two years. The
two men were accused of charging substantial personal
expenses to their companies, which then reported the expenses
as business deductions.
   Bato and Riviere agreed to pay maximum fines of $1 million
each and Messrs. Brant and Allen agreed to pay maximum fines
of $200,000 each. Mr. Brant will also pay $250,000 in taxes
due and a civil fraud penalty of $125,000.
   Neither Mr. Brant nor his attorney were available for
comment. Mr. Allen's attorney did not return phone calls.

   Costain Group PLC, a British construction, civil
engineering and mining concern, reported a 38% drop in pretax
profit for 1989, reflecting a depressed housing market.
   Costain reported pretax profit for the year of #55.1
million ($90.7 million), down from #89.2 million the year
before. The market had expected the company to post pretax
profit of between #70 million and #75 million.

   Sales rose 22% to #1.4 billion from #1.15 billion.
   Costain said it decided to write down the value of its
housing land in the United Kingdom by #20 million to "reflect
the current very depressed conditions in this sector of our
business."
   Profit after tax and minority interests but before
extraordinary items declined 31% to #40.4 million from #58.9
million.
   The company said its engineering and construction units
posted 50% increases in operating profit. In addition,
Costain's mining and commercial property businesses reported
record profit. But these gains were "offset by very poor
results from U.K. housing," the company said.

   NEW YORK -- The dollar finished narrowly mixed in thin
trading, with dealers reluctant to take positions for fear of
having them jeopardized by unexpected news during the long
Easter weekend.
   The U.S. unit edged higher against the yen, the mark, the
Swiss franc and sterling, while it slipped against its
French, Italian and Canadian counterparts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6724 marks, up from 1.6715 marks late Wednesday, and at
158.18 yen, up from 158 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6415, down from $1.6433 Wednesday.
   Early Friday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 158.30
yen, up from Thursday's close of 158 yen in Tokyo.
   The market remained cautious after last Saturday's meeting
of the Group of Seven industrial nations. Traders are still
struggling to grasp the probable results of the meeting,
speculating that heavy coordinated intervention to defend the
yen is yet to come, or that the Bank of Japan will raise
interest rates as early as this weekend. Another possibility
is that Japan has agreed to raise rates in exchange for
coordinated intervention by the other G-7 members, dealers
said.
   James Merrill, senior international economist at McCarthy,
Crisanti &amp; Maffei in New York, contended that the G-7 sent a
signal when it talked about a currency -- the yen -- other
than the dollar, and then said it wouldn't be helpful for the
Japanese unit to weaken. "The market was maybe left in doubt
about what would be done, by whom, and when," he said.
   Because of the recent G-7 meeting, a quick increase in the
Japanese discount rate can't be ruled out, according to Chris
Manno, chief dealer at Midland Bank PLC in New York. The
other G-7 members may have forced Japan to take that step, he
said.
   The discount rate is the Japanese central bank's base rate
on loans to commercial banks.
   Mr. Manno said dealers are consolidating after the U.S.
unit's recent gains in preparation for another sharp climb by
the dollar against the Japanese currency. He said the dollar
could reach 165 yen by early summer, a level that some
traders had expected this week in the absence of G-7 action
to stop its rise.
   But Robert White, vice president and manager of corporate
trading at First Interstate of California in Los Angeles,
said the absence of G-7 intervention was reflected in the
yen's slide against the West German currency. "You could make
a point that there are problems in Japan and there are
problems here {in the U.S.} and the mark is benefiting," he
said.
   The mark crept to 94.58 yen in late New York trading from
94.47 yen late Wednesday in New York.
   The Commerce Department said that the nation's retail
sales for March fell 0.6%, contrasted with a consensus
estimate for a gain of 0.2%. The revision for February showed
a decline of 0.3%.
   Most of the recent U.S. economic numbers have been worse
than expected, said Mr. White. Although he doesn't expect the
Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy immediately, Mr.
White said the market is switching its perception more and
more to the possibility that the next Fed move could be in
favor of lowering rates.
   Noting, too, the pressure of the Treasury and the White
House on the Fed to lower rates, Mr. White said a drop in
commodity prices could allay the inflationary fears of the
Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee.
   European dealers said the market is growing anxious over
the dollar's range trading in recent weeks. And while the
dollar has been locked in a range to a degree because of
skittishness over potential G-7 action to prop up the yen,
some dealers said that there are signs of growing
disenchantment over the dollar's chances for making
significant gains against the yen and other currencies.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $375.90, up $1.60, on light volume of an
estimated two million ounces.

   Par Pharmaceutical Inc. said it reached agreement with its
majority-owned subsidiary, Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc., to buy
out Quad management's 40% interest in the unit.
   Terms weren't disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Par, a Spring Valley, N.Y., genericdrug manufacturer under
federal investigation, said the transaction, which is subject
to a definitive agreement and approval by boards of both
companies, would result in Quad being wholly owned by Par.
   In addition, Par said senior managers at
Indianapolis-based Quad, who are now on leaves of absence,
would resign once the transaction closes. Quad is currently
being operated by Par management.
   Officials of both companies couldn't be reached for
comment.
   In late March, Par said Quad had halted distribution of
all products subject to federal approval. That action, which
concerned findings the company might have made product
changes without following appropriate regulatory notification
or approval processes, came after Quad had recalled other
products.

   LONDON -- Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group SmithKline
Beecham PLC said it has agreed to sell its U.K.-based
Yardley-Lentheric Cosmetics business to Old Bond Street Corp.
of the U.S. for #110 million ($180.7 million).
   Although shareholder approval has been obtained, the deal
still requires both U.S. and U.K. regulatory approvals, tax
clearances and proof of financing by Old Bond Street, a
company spokesman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Proceeds from the disposal -- part of SmithKline's
strategy to focus on its core healthcare business following
its creation last year from the merger of Beecham Group PLC
and the SmithKline Beckman Corp. -- will be put toward
trimming debt, SmithKline said.
   The sale represents the first disposal of a cosmetics unit
since the merger. Negotiations are under way with possible
buyers of the remaining cosmetics divisions, which include
Yardley-Lentheric operations in South Africa and the
SmithKline Beecham Astor-Lancaster businesses in continental
Europe, the spokesman said.
   Old Bond Street, a holding company, plans to pay for the
cosmetics unit with a combination of cash and debt,
SmithKline said. Additionally, the U.K. company will hold a
10% stake in Old Bond Street, it added.
   SmithKline's spokesman said he didn't know when the deal
might be completed.

   First Interstate Bancorp, Los Angeles, said it is amending
a dividend reinvestment and stock repurchase plan because
arbitrage programs were causing First Interstate's stock to
dip around the time the company declares its dividend.
   The plan provides discounts to holders who want to
reinvest their dividends into purchasing stock or who want to
repurchase stock under certain conditions. First Interstate
said certain shareholders have been shorting the stock in the
period when the programs are in effect, driving down the
price so they can buy more shares and take greater advantage
of the plan's discounts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Essentially, the bank-holding company reduced those
discounts and made certain other changes aimed at
discouraging the practice.
   First Interstate's stock is having enough trouble without
the arbitrage problems. The bank has been hammered by a
string of huge losses.

   OPEC's Bid to `Talk Up' Oil Prices Acts to Calm
   Markets, but Futures in the U.S. Still Close Lower

   World oil markets calmed, if only briefly, as the oil
ministers of OPEC tried again to "talk up" the price of
petroleum.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
announced that the ministers were considering an emergency
meeting to deal with the oil glut if the oil market
deteriorated further.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On that official word from OPEC, prices of North Sea
crudes rose as much as 55 cents a barrel in European spot
markets. In the U.S. futures market, where crude had firmed
sharply on Wednesday's rumors of a possible OPEC meeting
soon, prices were up and down during the day but closed
lower. The swings, however, were relatively narrow compared
with the volatile pricing action earlier in the week.
   In thin trading in advance of the three-day Easter
holiday, West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery
declined 28 cents a barrel to settle at $17.78. The June
crude contract was down 21 cents to $18.51. Other fuels
futures were mixed, although gasoline showed big drops of as
much as one cent a gallon.
   The OPEC announcement, released at its headquarters in
Vienna, quoted the acting president, Sadek Boussena of
Algeria, as saying the ministers were considering "various
options" to halt the slide in oil prices. Among the options,
according to Mr. Boussena, were "an urgent meeting of the
eight-member ministerial monitoring committee and an
extraordinary meeting of the conference."
   Until yesterday, OPEC officials still were debating
whether there would be time -- or the need -- to try to work
in a special meeting of the 13 ministers before the midyear
conference already set to begin May 25. The ministerial
monitoring committee, which reviews world oil markets, had
scheduled its next meeting two days ahead of the official
conference. That influential committee can only recommend
OPEC actions, but its sessions often attract all 13 ministers
and can quickly evolve into full meetings.
   Still, as crude oil prices plunged in wild trading this
week -- dropping $1.48 a barrel in 40 minutes before
rebounding Wednesday morning on the New York Mercantile
Exchange -- leading oil ministers grew increasingly worried.
They launched a frantic round of phone calls to try to come
to terms on something to firm the market.
   "The deterioration of prices has been observed with
alarm," said a senior OPEC official involved in the talks.
Discussions will continue through the weekend, he added,
noting that European markets will be closed Monday for the
Easter weekend, thus giving OPEC another day's breathing
room.
   The official said no decision would be taken on a new
meeting date earlier than Tuesday. If by then "production has
dropped or the price has increased, there will be no
meeting," he said. "But if the situation hasn't improved," he
added, "there will be a meeting -- by April 22 or 23 at the
latest."
   In the statement released by OPEC yesterday afternoon
Vienna time, Mr. Boussena said he had been in intense
consultations with his colleagues "with a view to taking the
necessary corrective steps to arrest the present slide and
reverse the trend of steady price decline witnessed since
January."
   In the talks, Mr. Boussena said he had "noted, with
satisfaction, the clear commitment to the minimum reference
price of $18 per barrel for the OPEC basket and the
willingness to act responsibly in order to safeguard the
stability of the oil market and restore prices to the agreed
level."
   OPEC's first-half production agreement provides for a
production ceiling of 22 million barrels a day and a minimum
reference price of $18 a barrel. OPEC bases its reference on
a basket of seven crudes.
   The basket average reached $19 a barrel early this year,
but now is near $17. Some individual crudes have fallen even
more -- as much as $6 a barrel. The big factor is high OPEC
output of 24 million barrels a day during this seasonally
slack period for oil demand.
   All OPEC nations able to produce above their quotas,
including kingpin Saudi Arabia, seem to be doing so. But
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates still are said to be the
chief quota violators.
   Even so, Mana Said Otaiba, the oil minister of the
Emirates, joined in the chorus of complaints from OPEC about
the slide in oil prices. "There is a fixed red line which oil
prices should not fall behind," he said, according to the
Emirates' news agency.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures contracts moved in narrow ranges
in featureless pre-holiday trading. June-delivery gold rose
$1.30 an ounce, to $379.70. May silver finished four cents
lower, at $5.1080 an ounce. July platinum ended the session
$1.70 higher, at $486.50 an ounce. William O'Neill, research
director for Elders Futures, New York, said the metals seem
to be in league with the dollar and are ignoring the wild
goings-on in the energy market. But he said, "If crude
weakens and crashes through the recent lows, it can't help
but have a negative impact on the precious metals because of
the deflationary implications." Mr. O'Neill pointed out that
recent economic numbers don't reflect a very strong economy,
and that "this could cause the Federal Reserve Board to ease
its monetary posture somewhat, which would lead to lower
interest rates. That would be supportive for gold." He said
investor confidence has been shaken by recent Saudi Arabian
gold sales, and noted that there have been rumors that the
Saudis will be paying for some major arms transactions fairly
soon, which could lead to additional sales of the metal.
Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank,
New York, said precious metals have been pulled in both
directions by weak oil prices (negative for gold) and a weak
dollar (positive for gold), which have "produced a
directionless market with disappointing volume." Mr. Mehta
said he thinks investors fear a credit crunch, and that "if
we got one, it would produce a weakened real-estate market
and a deflationary environment. That would certainly foster
lower prices for gold."
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Prices moved over a fairly broad range, but the
May-delivery contract finished down only 1.25 cents a pound,
at $1.1685, after being as high as $1.20 a pound. Mr. O'Neill
of Elders Futures said that even though strike-affected
Southern Peru Copper Corp. hasn't declared a force majeure,
it has in effect put one in place for April. A force majeure
is a condition that would permit a company to depart from the
strict terms of a contract -- in this case the delivery of
copper for April -- because of an event or effect that can't
be reasonably anticipated or controlled. The company's miners
and smelter workers in Peru have been on strike since March
12. According to news-service reports, the company has said
it has no intentions of declaring a force majeure and that
such talk is pure speculation. Mr. O'Neill says that unless
the strike is over soon, he believes it inevitable that a
force majeure will be declared. "The company is putting up a
good front. But it's clear that they are running low on
refined copper," he said. "It's just a question of time." Mr.
O'Neill noted that shipments of copper out of Zambia have
been picking up. The most recent cargo was for 13,400 tons,
up from 10,600 tons the previous week. Michael Frawley, a
metals trader at PaineWebber, New York, says he believes the
production problems in Peru are fully discounted in the
market. He added that he thinks the strike in Peru will end
soon and the market has taken this into account. He also
noted that the market has run into considerable price
resistance in the $1.20-a-pound area for the May contract,
and that physical demand for copper in April has been largely
satisfied. However, he adds, "If physical demand in May picks
up, it could provide renewed strength to the market."
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures fell
slightly amid reports that the harvest in Brazil is rapidly
approaching the halfway point. Prices were also depressed by
news that lawmakers in Brazil approved a sweeping
anti-inflation program. The program, if successful, would
take away the incentive for Brazilian farmers to hoard their
soybean harvest. Analysts are speculating that farmers will
begin to sell their crop, which would increase the supply of
Brazilian soybeans for export. Brazil is a major competitor
of the U.S. in the world soybean market. Prices of corn
futures fell slightly yesterday. Prices of soft red winter
wheat contracts settled mixed at the Chicago Board of Trade.

   Dutch aerospace group Fokker N.V., citing decreased
financing charges in 1989, reported that 1989 net profit more
than tripled. It said net rose to 42.4 million guilders
($22.5 million) from 13.3 million guilders in 1988.
   The aircraft builder said, "Fokker looks to the future
with confidence, not least in view of the present order book
of 10 billion guilders."

<TEXT>
   The company said that its net profit picture for 1989 was
considerably improved by a reduction in financing charges to
55 million guilders from 64 million guilders in the year
earlier. In addition, Fokker's participating interests in
other companies contributed revenue of 15.9 million guilders
in 1989 compared with 8.6 million guilders in 1988.

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices ended modestly lower in a quiet,
shortened session.
   Most securities firms and major banks closed their bond
desks at 2 p.m. EDT, and many will remain closed today in
observance of Good Friday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In trading yesterday, bond dealers said activity briefly
perked up and prices rose following the morning release of
the March retail sales report by the Department of Commerce.
Retail sales fell 0.6% in March, a bigger decline than some
analysts had expected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones
Capital Markets Report, for example, had forecast a 0.2%
decline.
   The larger decline was interpreted by investors as a sign
that consumer spending might be dwindling, which in turn
could lead to slower economic growth. The data are considered
bullish for bonds because slower growth could reduce
inflationary pressures.
   However, some economists said investors may be reaching
too far by basing investment decisions on movements in the
retail sales statistics, which can gyrate wildly from month
to month.
   "I really think the market is searching for some news to
move on," said Ken Ackbarali, senior economist and vice
president at First Interstate Bancorp. "Sometimes it invents
its own interpretations of very small changes in the
numbers," he said.
   Later in the day, bond prices fell as dealers and large
institutional investors began selling bonds to square
positions ahead of the long weekend and the release of the
March producer price index.
   By the end of the day, investors were focusing on today's
producer price index report, considered the most important
economic indicator to be released this week.
   Producer prices, a measure of inflation on the wholesale
level, are estimated to have advanced 0.1% in March and 0.3%
excluding the volatile energy and food components of the
index, according to the average estimate of 16 economists
surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
   In February, the index was unchanged, after rising 1.8% in
January. Excluding food and energy prices, February's index
gained 0.4%, following January's 0.1% rise.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Citicorp expects to sell $250 million of securities backed
by credit-card loans to retail investors later this month
through an underwriting group headed by Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   The issue, the third retail offering by Citicorp, is due
to have a five-year average life and will be available in a
minimum denomination of $1,000.
   The planned sale by Citicorp, the largest issuer in the
three-year-old credit-card securities market, is part of
Citicorp's strategy to broaden the investor base for the
securities. So far, the bulk of the $11 billion of Citicorp
credit-card securities has been sold to large institutional
investors and other banks.
   Some money managers don't think credit-card securities are
right for individuals.
   For one thing, the transactions are structured in such a
way that many small investors don't fully understand what
they are getting. Also, credit-card securities targeted to
retail investors have lower yields than those targeted to
institutions because of higher distribution costs. Sales
commissions are much higher on retail issues than on
institutional issues.
   Citicorp's retail offering in November was priced at 1/2
percentage point above comparable Treasury securities, while
its institutional offerings were priced at 9/10 of a
percentage point above Treasurys.
   Still, Citicorp hasn't had much trouble selling the
securities to the little guy. The banking concern made a $500
million sale to retail investors in April 1989, which was the
first credit-card offering targeted to retail investors, and
$325 million of securities was sold to retail investors in
November. Citicorp has made nearly $4 billion of credit-card
securities offerings to institutional investors this year.
   The planned retail offering is expected to get a triple-A
rating.
   Meanwhile, mortgage securities ended mixed in light
trading. Government National Mortgage Association 9%
securities for April delivery were quoted at 95 30/32,
unchanged, to yield 9.72% to a 12-year average life
assumption. Ginnie Mae 10% securities were at 100 5/8, down
1/32.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices ended moderately lower in light trading
activity. The benchmark 30-year bond ended nearly 1/4 point
lower, a loss of about $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue ended at 98 29/32 to yield 8.59%, compared
with 99 4/32 to yield 8.57% on Wednesday. The latest 10-year
bonds ended at 99 to yield 8.63%, compared with 99 5/32 to
yield 8.61%.
   Short-term rates ended little changed. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at 7.76% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 8%, while the discount rate on
six-month Treasury bills rose slightly to 7.78% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 8.19%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. gave back some of their
recent gains to close lower on light profit-taking.
   RJR's 13.71% pay-in-kind convertible debentures due in
2009 fell 1/2 point to 80 3/4 in thin trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The other widely held RJR issue, the 13.71% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures maturing in 2007 was 5/8 point lower
at 67 7/8.
   The bonds advanced as much as 4 3/4 points Wednesday on
rumors that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. was buying back the
pay-in-kind bonds, which pay interest in the form of
additional bonds rather than cash. Officials at the companies
declined to comment.
   In other activity, high-yield bonds of Ames Department
Stores Inc. were bid for "flat," or without accrued interest.
When bonds trade "flat," it means that bondholders don't
expect the company to make future interest payments.
   Ames junk bonds plunged nine points Tuesday on news about
the company's financial woes. Since then, the retailer's 13%
senior subordinated reset notes due in 1999 have dropped an
additional 10 points to a bid price of 27.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, actively
traded issues finished unchanged.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds ended weaker as the monthly
measures of inflation and labor costs were higher than
expected.
   Britain's retail price index rose 1% in March from
February and 8.1% on the year, with the year-on-year pace of
inflation reaching its highest level since July 1989.
Officials attributed the gains primarily to increases in
mortgage rates, which are predominantly adjustable in the
United Kingdom and to higher food prices.
   The labor report showed, among other things, that average
earnings increased at an annual rate of 9 1/2% in February,
up from 9 1/4% in January.
   Among benchmarks, the 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 1/2
point to 97 3/8 to yield 12.11%. But trading was muted by
absences ahead of the four-day Easter holiday weekend.
   In Japan, government bonds ended stronger on a large buy
order in the futures market just before the Tokyo Stock
Exchange closed.
   Dealers said in the last half hour of trading, a buy order
of 200 billion yen ($1.26 billion) came into the futures
market.
   "I think this was the second-largest buy order ever, and
I've been here for four years," said a dealer at a
foreign-based securities firm. "After the order came into the
market, futures prices climbed by 20 ticks."
   The buyer may have bought futures because it needed bonds
to deliver into options, said one dealer at a U.S.-based
bank. Today is the change of settlement date for options. He
also said the buyer may have simply been covering short
positions.
   In a short sale, dealers sell borrowed securites and later
seek to make a profit by buying the securities back at a
lower price.
   Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond rose 0.16 point
to 86.39 to yield 7.275%.
   West German bonds ended slightly weaker in very quiet
trading.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempts were flat to up 1/8 point in quiet trading.
   In competitive dealings, a Prudential-Bache Capital
Funding group won a $53 million issue of Milwaukee County
general obligation corporate purpose bonds.
   This week, $910 million in new debt was priced.
   Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was up 1/8 point at 97 1/2
bid to yield 7.40%.

   GORBACHEV'S ECONOMIC proposals could free 70% of the
Soviet economy from state control, slash central planning and
raise most prices an average 100%, according to a key
adviser, Pavel Bunich. But the economist cautioned that the
plan still has many murky areas and isn't final.

   Retail sales fell 0.6% in March, the first two-month
decline in over three years. Still, economists said retailers
are better off than the figures imply. Auto sales remained
weak, but most other sectors had minor declines.

   Torchmark Corp. won the latest round in its fight to
acquire rival American General Corp. when a federal appeals
court stayed a preliminary injunction against Torchmark's
soliciting of proxies to elect a slate of directors to
American General's board.
   The Birmingham, Ala.-based insurer said it was pleased
with the ruling and intends to proceed with the solicitation
as soon as possible.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest ruling is an about-face from one last week in
which federal Judge David Hittner sided with Houston-based
American General. The company argued that Torchmark failed to
notify American General of its plans 60 days in advance of
the May 2 annual meeting as required by American General
bylaws.
   Despite Judge Hittner's ruling, Torchmark earlier this
week began soliciting proxies in support of a resolution that
seeks to force American General's board to sell or merge the
company. Torchmark's resolution also calls for appointment of
a committee of independent directors to evaluate all
acquisition proposals. American General officials couldn't be
reached for comment.

   Everest &amp; Jennings International Ltd. said it expects to

it needs a $55 million credit line and a $15 million cash
infusion to continue operating.

he was "very confident" that the company could work out the
credit line and cash infusion.

   The Camarillo, Calif., company attributed the
larger-than-anticipated year-end loss to operating and
restructuring costs. It said new product startup costs in the
U.S. and delays in new product shipments, a $2.2 million
write-down in inventories in the United Kingdom and a
provision against a note receivable also contributed to the
loss. The loss includes $15 million in costs for
restructuring the company's manufacturing, marketing and
financial operations.
   For 1988, the company had net income of $2 million, or 25
cents a share. The company said sales were about $187
million, compared with 1988 sales of $191.2 million.
Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., a Hong Kong investment
firm, has said it controls 56.6% of Everest &amp; Jennings. It is

   Credit Lyonnais, a French state-owned banking concern,
said its profit for 1989 jumped 52%, led by commercial
banking, leasing, and asset management operations in France,
as well as new acquisitions in Italy and Belgium.
   Consolidated profit after payments to minority interests
rose to 3.13 billion francs ($556.5 million) from 2.06
billion francs in 1988. The results just topped the half-way
mark toward the bank's goal set by last year of doubling
annual profit by 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Part of the growth reflected acquisitions aimed at
expanding Credit Lyonnais's profitable retail network across
Europe in preparation for the unified market of 1992. These
included the purchase of just less than 50% of Bank Credito
Bergamasco of Italy and the first-time consolidation of a
Belgian retail bank network that Credit Lyonnais bought in
1988.
   Customer loans rose 14% to 575 billion francs, and
equipment leasing activities increased 44% and real estate
leasing climbed 28%. Customer deposits climbed 13% to 464
billion francs.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- A state court here rejected a request
by software company founder Frank H. Dodge to block Dun &amp;
Bradstreet Corp. and its McCormack &amp; Dodge software unit from
interfering with his efforts to start a new concern.
   In rejecting the request for a preliminary injunction,
Justice Peter M. Lauriat of the Superior Court of
Massachusetts said he wasn't persuaded that Mr. Dodge was
likely to prove his claim of interference by Dun &amp;
Bradstreet. He added that he was unconvinced that Mr. Dodge
would be irreparably harmed without a preliminary injunction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, Judge Lauriat said, a preliminary injunction
of the scope Mr. Dodge was seeking would "impose a prior
restraint on {Dun &amp; Bradstreet's} protected speech."
   Mr. Dodge had filed a lawsuit contending he was fired
recently without cause by Dun &amp; Bradstreet as president and
chief executive officer of the McCormack &amp; Dodge unit. Thus,
the suit argued, he wasn't bound by an agreement that bars
him from competing against the software company.
   Mr. Dodge and a co-founder sold McCormack &amp; Dodge to Dun &amp;
Bradstreet in 1983, and Mr. Dodge stayed on as president. Dun
&amp; Bradstreet answered that Mr. Dodge resigned and was
therefore subject to the terms of the agreement.

   69% Decline in Profit

   AKRON, Ohio -- B.F. Goodrich Co. reported a 69% drop in
first-quarter net income, mainly because of weak prices for
polyvinyl chloride, a plastic that is the company's most
important product. Nonetheless, the profit was somewhat
higher than analysts had expected.
   The plastics, specialty chemicals and aerospace concern
earned $16.2 million, or 56 cents a share, down from a
first-quarter record of $53 million, or $2.02 a share, a year
earlier. The 1989 first-quarter profit includes $2 million
from discontinued operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales fell 4.2% to $589.8 million from $615.9 million.
   Operating profit from polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, and
related materials dropped 85% to $10.1 million from $68.1
million, on a 22% decline in sales to $272.1 million. Prices
for PVC fell sharply in the 1989 second half and remained
weak until the end of the 1990 first quarter. Meanwhile, the
price of propane, an important feedstock or raw material,
soared following the extremely cold weather in December.
   Operating profit from specialty chemicals rose 33%,
Goodrich said. Aerospace reported a 57% rise in operating
profit, but more than two-thirds of this increase resulted
from reversal of a previously established reserve, following
Goodrich's victory in a patent infringement suit brought by a
competitor.
   Analysts expect a sharp improvement by Goodrich in
subsequent quarters because of rising demand and higher
prices for PVC. Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. said that for 1990, he expects Goodrich to earn $3.75 a
share, which would be a decline from 1989 net of $172.4
million, or $6.48 a share. But last year's results reflected
a first-half boom in PVC, and 1989 profit was partly shielded
from taxes by investment tax-credit carryforwards, which were
exhausted by year end.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Goodrich shares closed at $42.375, up 12.5 cents.

   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. filed two suits
against dissident investors who have challenged it in a proxy
fight.
   The first suit, filed in U.S. District Court here, asks
that the investors, Centaur Partners and Walker Street
Associates, be forced to divest their holdings in National
Intergroup. Centaur holds 16.5% of NII; together, the two
groups own about 25% of the drug distribution and steel
concern, which is based here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit alleges that the two groups have made materially
false and misleading statements in their solicitation of
proxies. The suit also claims that the two defendants may be
acting together as a group without making required
disclosures.
   The second suit, filed in state court here, seeks a
declaratory judgment that share holdings owned by Walker
Street and its affiliates as well as Centaur's investment
bankers should be attributed to Centaur. If the state court
grants that judgment, National Intergroup said, it will
initiate a rights offering that would decrease the percentage
of its stock owned by the defendants.
   Walker Street Associates had no immediate comment on the
suit. Centaur Partners said it's not acting as a group with
Walker Street or others. Centaur termed the suit an attempt
by National Intergroup to "intimidate us."

   Efforts to Save
   Dolphins Are Set
   By Tuna Canners

   Two tuna canners said they will stop buying and selling
tuna captured along with dolphins, a move long sought by
enviromentalists seeking to protect dolphins from fishing
nets.
   H.J. Heinz Co.'s StarKist Seafood unit said it will no
longer buy tuna caught in a manner that can injure or kill
dolphins. StarKist, the world's largest tuna canner, said it
was responding to consumer concerns over dolphin safety.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. followed suit a short time later.
It told the Associated Press that it "would now implement its
plan to end the purchase of tuna caught in association with
dolphin."
   "Our tuna cans will begin to reflect the dolphin-safe
label in U.S. stores within the next three months," the San
Diego-based company's statement said.
   A third tuna canner, Van Kamp Seafood of St. Louis, which
sells the Chicken of the Sea brand, said it would make
"further enhancements to its established campaign for the
protection and preservation of dolphins."
   Pittsburgh-based Heinz had come under fire from
environmentalists who say 100,000 dolphins are killed each
year in nets set to capture tuna, specifically in the Pacific
Ocean from Chile to Southern California. Earlier this week,
in another gesture to environmentalists, Heinz unveiled plans
for a recyclable plastic ketchup bottle.
   StarKist said 90% of the 250,000 tons of tuna it buys each
year is already "dolphin safe," but now it will only buy tuna
from boats in which government observers have certified no
dolphins were killed.
   StarKist said it will have to buy some of its tuna from
other oceans, which will increase costs. But it said that
would have little effect on price.
   Environmentalists praised the latest announcement.
"They've really taken the lead on this and gone beyond what
we expected," said Blair Palese, spokesperson for Greenpeace,
an environmental group.
   Representatives of the nation's tuna fishing fleet,
however, called the move "a political response to a
scientific issue" that would do little to save the lives of
dolphins, and said it could "severely impact, if not destroy,
the U.S. tuna fleet."
   For years, most tuna have been caught by boats that cast
their nets around the herds of dolphins that generally swim
above the fish. Fishermen then push the dolphins out and
harvest the fish, although dolphins can die if they become
tangled in the nets.
   August Felando, president of the American Tunaboat
Association, said that dolphins will continue to be encircled
by foreign boats seeking the larger yellowfin tuna that swim
beneath. "Foreign boats, which operate free of stringent U.S.
quotas (for killing dolphins) will simply sell their catch to
a growing European market and elsewhere," he said.

   With technology and financial stocks leading the way, the
over-the-counter market ended the holiday week higher, but
not yet fully recovered, analysts cautioned.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 2.78 at 436.31, for a
0.06% gain. Advancing stocks outpaced decliners by the week's
largest margin, 1,068 to 797, as volume rose to 141,412,600
shares from 133,820,400. There were 118 new highs and 87 new
lows set for the day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The high flier for the day was Northeast Bancorp, which
soared 8 to close at 40 1/2 on reports the Stamford, Conn.,
bank is negotiating the book value on which its planned
merger with Bank of New York is based. There had been doubts
the merger would go through.
   Robert C. King, senior vice president of OTC trading for
Robinson Humphrey Co. of Atlanta, says the week was marked by
a rebound in some of the battered regional bank stocks, with
Bank South up 1/2 at 10 1/8, Colorado National, up 1/8 at 14
5/8 and Midlantic Corp. of New Jersey holding steady at 16
1/2. The Nasdaq Financial 100 Index, which includes the
market's largest regional bank stocks, rose 3.41, to 387.25.
   Technology stocks gained early in the day as Intel pleased
Wall Street with earnings on the high end of expectations,
but ended off slightly on profit-taking. Intel joined other
technology stocks such as Microsoft and Sequent in testing
yearly highs in morning trading, before closing off for the
day as investors left the market early for the long Easter
weekend.
   Intel closed off 1/4 at 42 1/2, Microsoft was off 1/4 at
120 3/4 and Sequent fell 1/4 to 26 1/4. Also trading heavily
was Apple Computer, up 3/4 to 43 1/4.
   The Nasdaq 100 index, which tracks the market's largest
technology stocks, gained 0.7% yesterday and 1.7% for the
week, beating the composite index.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton technology analyst Paul Johnson
says he thinks the annual peaks of high-quality companies
such as Intel and Apple will be tested as their earnings
encourage investors. Intel reported higher-than-expected
first-quarter earnings of 73 cents a share, up from 52 cents
a share a year earlier. Apple is expect to report quarter
earnings next week.
   But Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak calls the recent
strength in the technology sector "very tenuous." The
economy, he says, is too sluggish to support strong growth in
all but the strongest companies that are enjoying "boomlets"
in demand for their products, such as Intel's 32-byte
products.
   Preston Athey, manager of T. Rowe Price's emerging-growth
stocks fund, says he hasn't forgotten the few "torpedoes"
that recently shook the sector: the earnings disappointments
of Oracle, Legent and the Big Board's Network Equipment
Technologies.
   "The technology sector can be a graveyard for aggressive
managers who get too far out on a limb," Mr. Athey says.
   Candela Laser ended up 1 1/8 to 14 7/8. The company filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the issue of
stock related to the potential conversion of subordinated
notes.
   The laser maker says it hasn't decided whether it will
call the $3,625,000 principal amount of 8% convertible notes,
but a decision is expected in a week. The company is also
expected to report fiscal third-quarter earnings on April 26.
   Iomega fell 7/8, to 4 1/4, on heavy volume after the maker
of computer disk drives reported net income of $2.5 million,
or 15 cents a share, on sales of $29.1 million, compared with
net the year ago quarter of $1.6 million, or nine cents a
share, on sales of $24.8 million.
   In other areas, Pic 'N' Save was among the day's most
active stocks closing up 5/8 at 14 1/8 with more than eight
times average volume changing hands. Late Wednesday, a
partnership controlled by David H. Batchelder, a former
strategist for T. Boone Pickens and an adviser to Marvin
Davis, disclosed that it holds a 6.6% stake in the company
and plans to make a bid for the retail-discount chain. The
company's shares traded actively last week on speculation
about Mr. Batchelder's interest.
   Improved earnings lifted U.S. Bancorp's shares 1 1/8, to
28 3/4. The bank reported first-quarter net income of 85
cents a share, up nearly 20% from year-earlier income of 71
cents a share. Shares of the Portland, Ore., company rose 1
1/4Wednesday on heavy volume.
   Burnup &amp; Sims added 5/8 to close at 15 5/8 after
announcing its shareholders would receive both a stock
dividend in a new telecommunications company, and shares
representing closely held National Beverage Corp., which will
become a publicly owned company.
   Shares of J. Baker continued to tumble in heavy trading
following Ames Department Stores' announcement earlier this
week that it plans to close 74 of its 680 stores. The
footware retailer is an Ames supplier. J. Baker closed off 1
3/4, or 13%, at 12 1/8.

   Keating Charges

   Lincoln Collapse

   WASHINGTON -- Hostile federal regulators prevented Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association from raising capital even as they
criticized the thrift for being short of capital, the
chairman of Lincoln's former parent claimed in court
testimony.
   Charles Keating, chairman of Phoenix-based American
Continental Corp., also suggested that the hostility of the
regulators was fueled by a feud Mr. Keating had with a thrift
trade group executive who is the father of one of Lincoln's
regulators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., was seized by the
government a year ago, and regulators say cleaning up the
thrift will cost the government about $2 billion. Mr. Keating
was testifying in his suit against the regulators to reverse
the takeover.
   Mr. Keating said that under a 1988 agreement with
regulators, Lincoln was to raise $50 million to $150 million
in capital by offering subordinated debt. But when Lincoln
applied to offer the debt, the regulators "simply wouldn't
process it," Mr. Keating said. In December 1988, the
regulators told Lincoln they were $114 million short of
capital requirements, said a lawyer for Mr. Keating, John
Lundin.
   When Lincoln tried to argue that a mathematical error by
the regulators had added $65 million to the shortfall, the
regulators wouldn't listen and forced Lincoln to issue a news
release about the capital problem that hurt the thrift's
value, Mr. Keating said.
   "They complained we didn't have enough capital, but
wouldn't let us raise capital," Mr. Lundin said in an
interview.
   But lawyers for the government said they held up the debt
offering because Lincoln intended to sell at least part of
the debt in $2,000 chunks in Lincoln offices, which might
attract unsophisticated investors. Customers might not have
known they were buying risky debt and not making insured
deposits, said James Murphy, an attorney for the regulators.
About $200 million of now-worthless American Continental debt
was sold through Lincoln branches.
   Also, Mr. Murphy said, federal regulators had at that
point discovered the controversial tax-sharing agreement
under which Lincoln paid $94 million to American Continental
for tax payments that were never made. The regulators were
"suspicious of Lincoln" and wanted to finish an exam of
Lincoln before deciding on the debt offering, Mr. Murphy
said.
   Mr. Keating also said he was surprised to learn in late
1988 that Kevin O'Connell, a regulator overseeing the 1988
exam of Lincoln, is the son of William O'Connell, a former
president of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, an
industry trade group. William O'Connell had criticized Mr.
Keating for opposing a regulation limiting the amount of
direct investments in real estate that thrifts could make.
Mr. Keating had one of his attorneys write to the trade group
president and accused him of "defamatory comments."
   Mr. Lundin, the Keating lawyer, said he wasn't directly
accusing Kevin O'Connell of a conflict of interest, but said
"it shows the atmosphere in which this all took place." Mr.
Lundin introduced a memo written by the younger Mr. O'Connell
just a week before the government takeover, that said of
Lincoln: "under every document is another scam," and that
regulators "finally understand what type of thieves we are
dealing with . . . ."
   Kevin O'Connell, now an official of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said "whether somebody is for or against a
regulation has nothing to do with whether I enforce it or
not." He said he hadn't been aware of the dispute between his
father and Mr. Keating.
   Testimony in the trial is to continue next week.

   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Hughes Aircraft Co., in partnership with
Brazil's Promon Engenharia S.A., won a contract to supply
Brazil with a new generation of telecommunications
satellites, according to Telebras, the state
telecommunications company. Hughes Aircraft is a subsidiary
of General Motors Corp.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. was defeated by France's
Arianespace in a separate bid to launch the two satellites,
Telebras said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two contracts have a combined value of $244.3 million
-- $155.5 million for the satellites and $88.8 million for
the launchers, Telebras added.
   The awarding of the contracts caps over one year of
international lobbying, high-level diplomacy and internal
political disputes. The dispute became so fierce that there
was speculation that Brazil would simply reopen the bidding
rather than make a decision -- raising fears that the
country's telecommunications system could collapse.
   The fight centered on who would supply Brazil with two
second-generation satellites having both civil
telecommunications and military applications.
   To win the satellite contract, Hughes outbid a consortium
formed by Canada's Spar Aerospace, France's Matra S.A. and
Brazil's Victori International. While Hughes's price was
lower than the consortium's final offer, opponents said they
offered more generous technology transfer conditions.
   The previous government avoided a decision and passed the
problem to the newly installed government of President
Fernando Collor de Mello.
   In bidding for the launchers, Arianespace offered to sell
Brazil technology to produce large rocket engines. The U.S.
government asked France to provide assurances that these
engines would be used for peaceful purposes. Brazil said it
was interested in the engines to develop an independent space
business. McDonnell Douglas said that U.S. laws on technology
transfer barred it from matching Arianespace's offer.

   Elsevier N.V. Says
   Pearson Merger
   Is Long-Term Goal

   AMSTERDAM, the Netherlands -- Elsevier N.V.'s chairman,
Pierre Vinken, said the Dutch publisher still regards a
merger with Pearson PLC as a long-term goal.
   Mr. Vinken also indicated that Elsevier, an
Amsterdam-based publisher of scientific journals, trade
publications and newspapers, is likely to show strong profit
growth again this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Elsevier and Pearson, which is based in London and owns
the Financial Times, announced an alliance in September 1988,
saying they might eventually merge. Last week, however, the
two companies confirmed that the idea of a merger had been
shelved.
   Even so, Mr. Vinken emphasized in an interview this week
that the two companies remain "a happy, engaged couple,"
adding that they are looking "for ways to tie these companies
together, rather than to divorce them." For its part, Pearson
said recently that it still regards Elsevier as "our
long-term European partner."
   Pearson owns about 23% of Elsevier, and the Dutch company
holds 9.3% of Pearson.
   Mr. Vinken said merger considerations had been blocked at
least temporarily by "enormous technical problems." For
example, he said, a merger would give rise to huge
capital-gains taxes in Britain.
   Meanwhile, a drop in the pound's value and a surge in
Elsevier's share price over the past two years has made the
Dutch company prohibitively expensive for Pearson, the two
companies have said. When the alliance was announced in 1988,
Pearson's market value was nearly twice that of Elsevier. Now
Elsevier is valued on the stock market at the equivalent of
about $2.7 billion and Pearson at around $2.9 billion, partly
reflecting the market's view that Pearson is no longer a
likely takeover target.
   Another worry for the two companies is that a bid for
Elsevier from Pearson effectively would put the Dutch company
on the block, opening the way for a third party to make a
higher offer.
   Thus, Mr. Vinken said, the two will need to seek
"creative" solutions in their effort to forge closer ties.
For the moment, he added, they are seeking ways to combine
their medical-publishing operations and are considering joint
acquisitions. The companies are particularly interested in
acquiring leading financial newspapers in European countries,
but none are on the market at present, Mr. Vinken said.

   Four Store Chains to Set Strict Standards
   For Environmental Claims of Products

   Four retail and supermarket chains in Western states said
they will adopt strict standards for products making
environmental claims to address consumers' mounting concern
about misleading advertising.
   The retailers said they have designated an independent
consulting company to review product claims and award a
"Green Cross" seal of approval to products that promote
recycling and reduce waste and pollution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The chains sponsoring the program are Campeau Corp.'s
Ralphs Grocery Co., based in Compton, Calif., with 143 stores
in Southern California; Sacramento, Calif.-based Raley's,
with 58 stores in Northern California; Phoenix, Ariz.-based
Abco Markets Inc., with 75 stores in Arizona; and Portland,
Ore.-based Fred Meyer Inc., with 125 stores in seven Western
states.
   The retailers said they planned to announce the program at
a news conference scheduled for this morning in Washington.
   Kevin Davis, vice president of advertising for Ralphs,
said retailers are adopting the program because customers are
confused by conflicting advertising claims and are pressing
stores for guidance in choosing products that are truly
"environment friendly."
   "We are interested in making sure that claims are
authenticated before we support them with in-store
advertising," Mr. Davis said.
   However, some environmentalists expressed concern that
retailers were rushing to launch a national environmental
seal program as a marketing ploy riding on publicity
surrounding Earth Day.
   Lisa Collaton, staffer with Environmental Action
Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group, said she was
concerned that product standards adopted by the retailers
might not be valid or could conflict with efforts by other
agencies. She noted that Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes
plans to launch a similar national program known as Green
Seal next month, and that government-sponsored programs are
under consideration.
   "Our concern is that the retailers may be rushing this
program to get a marketing advantage," before a consensus has
been reached on definitions and standards for labeling green
products, Ms. Collaton said.
   Mr. Davis said retailers felt compelled to respond quickly
to consumers' concerns, but that Green Cross could be
modified later to conform to national standards that might be
developed. He said he expected other retail chains would join
the program and that products would be submitted for review
within 30 to 60 days.
   The four retailers have designated Scientific
Certification Systems Inc., of Oakland, Calif., to develop
standards, review products and issue a "Green Cross" seal. To
qualify for the seal, products would have to contain at least
50% recycled material, or other materials, such as wood or
cotton, that are considered "sustainable." The recycled
content would have to be from consumer waste, not plant
scrap.
   In addition, product and packaging manufacturers would
have to meet all federal, state and local environmental
regulations to get the seal. The manufacturers would also
have to nearly eliminate plant emissions of any substances
known to cause cancer or reproductive damage.
   Products making advertising claims would be encouraged to
submit those for review by Scientific Certification, Mr.
Davis said. Stores would promote products whose claims have
been verified, he said.
   Manufacturers would pay fees to Scientific Certification
to have their products, labeling and production facilities
reviewed for compliance with Green Cross standards. Linda
Brown, a vice president of Scientific Certification, said the
company is employee-owned and has no financial ties to
retailers or manufacturers. A division of the company,
Nutriclean, certifies to retailers that produce meets FDA
standards for pesticide residues, is organic or meets other
advertising claims.
   Craig Merrilees, of the National Toxics Campaign Fund, a
Boston-based environmental advocacy group, said the standards
proposed by the retailers would be tougher than any existing
labeling programs used by manufacturers or retailers, such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in the U.S. and Loblaws Supermarkets
Ltd. in Canada. He said his group helped in developing tough
standards that could lead to "significant changes" in product
design and manufacturing.
   "This is not going to be an easy test for products to
pass," Mr. Merrilees said.
   Cheryl Perrin, vice president of public affairs for Fred
Meyer stores, said: "We must provide an incentive for
manufacturers to integrate recycled materials into their
products whenever possible." Julie Weeks, quality assurance
manager for Ralphs, said the retailer wants to "communicate
our customers' concerns back to the manufacturers."

more to foreign companies -- even in projects originally
meant to give the U.S. a boost. In June, Mr. Cyert plans to
step down as president to return to Carnegie Mellon's
faculty, as head of an institute to study international
management. In a recent interview with staff reporter Gary
Putka, he faulted both business management and business
schools for some of the country's competitive ills. Here are
highlights:
                                                                                                       

   How has U.S. competitiveness changed in the years that
you've been leading Carnegie Mellon?
   There have been two phases. Up to about the last five
years, there hasn't been any question but that American
competitiveness has been going downhill. Over the last five
years there are signs we're moving in a better direction.
   Part of the blame goes to universities. Before World War
II, we had industrial-engineering departments. They taught
things like time-and-motion studies and plant layout. While
they weren't strong academic departments, they turned out a
lot of people who thought of their job as improving the
manufacturing process.
   Business schools came along at the end of World War II and
started using a lot of mathematical techniques, and they
drove these industrial engineering departments out of
existence. Then business schools began to concentrate on
marketing and finance. So for a long time there were very few
people being turned out who viewed themselves as
manufacturing people. The Japanese, on the contrary, turn out
scads of industrial engineers, and they don't have very many
business schools. As a former dean of a business school I
don't like to say that, but there's a big element there that
has hurt us.
                                                                                                       

   What are the hopeful signs?
   A lot of schools have gotten interested in manufacturing.
Business schools are joining more closely with the
engineering schools in trying to develop programs. Firms are
getting more interested in manufacturing. In the past, when a
firm came around recruiting, {students} interested in
manufacturing would get much lower salaries. That's changing.
   We see companies like Ford that are really interested in
improving quality and the cost of manufacturing automobiles.
There's a larger amount of research dollars coming into the
universities that has manufacturing implications.
                                                                                                       

   Are foreign corporations ahead of U.S. companies in
recognizing the value of American university research?
   I believe they are. They have a better feel for being able
to read something and transfer that knowledge to
applications. If you go into a Japanese operation, you'll
find as much as two to three hours a day is spent by
supervisors and others in production in reading the journals
and trying to get ideas that can be applied. Almost every
idea they have adopted has been in the academic literature.
The same thing is true of the Germans.
   The second point is that they are much more interested in
finding out what is going on in academic institutions. We
have many more representatives of foreign firms coming around
to our robotics institute, wanting to talk to our
computer-science people and our electrical-engineering
people, than we do American firms. We go out and drag in some
American firms.
                                                                                                       

   Weren't you persuaded recently to take on some foreign
corporate research partners instead of American ones?
   We have a project where we're trying to develop the
ability to get a machine to translate language. We're
particularly interested in being able to speak into the
machine in Japanese, and have it translate in English and
vice versa. We've had difficulty in getting real interest
from American firms on it. I went to Japan, took along some
people from this project, and we put on some seminars. We got
significant support from the Japanese. Hitachi was a major
contributor. Matsushita also has gotten very interested. We
also have some Japanese scientists working on the project.
They're our Ph.D.s -- Japanese who got their Ph.D.s {at
Carnegie Mellon}.
   We started out in our robotics institute with the notion
that the Japanese would be excluded. It was my view in 1980
that our robotics institute could contribute to the saving of
American manufacturing. We got some support from American
firms, but we could not get the total support we needed. I
have now been much more willing to listen to Japanese firms,
and we're expecting some significant support from Japanese
firms. Siemens {of West Germany} has also been taken in. In
general, American firms will not support basic research.
                                                                                                       

   Haven't we seen more abuses in academic research since
business has become more involved?
   I wouldn't say the abuses have come from a relationship
between industries and universities. The abuses have come
from the fact that in many areas, more faculty members have
had business opportunities, and university administrations
have been lax. So you have the question of: Will that person
publish his results of his research, or does he want to hold
them back for proprietary purposes for his firm? The amount
of time spent on the firm may be shortchanging the students.
   You do have to be careful, however, about the intertwining
of business and the universities in that it's extremely
important for universities to do basic research, because it
isn't being done by the firms. The more businesses become
involved and emphasize short-run results -- applied research
-- you tend to divert the faculty from basic research.
                                                                                                       

   Has the great post-World War II American business school
expansion been a failure?
   I wouldn't say it's been a failure, but certainly its weak
spots have been exposed. Our business schools have let down
society by not doing a better job of truly studying
management. Looking at human resources and human-resource
development, looking at questions of how you improve
productivity, how you involve your work force to do a better
job -- these are the kinds of things we should have been
doing.
                                                                                                       

   Yet places like Yale are de-emphasizing the organizational
approach.
   I think that's a serious error. What's happening there is
those whom I'll call more discipline-oriented are in large
enough numbers so that they've driven the others out. Anyone
who's looking at management has to really lament what
happened there. The whole organization area -- even if you
can't develop strong theorems in that area -- is a crucial,
crucial area, and I think one abandons that at one's peril.

   Provokes Debate
   About Obscenity

   Cincinnati's battle over the Robert Mapplethorpe
photography exhibition highlights a question critical to
defining obscenity: What are the city's "community
standards"?
   The courtroom drama to come will likely provide an unusual
examination of that issue and other legal tests intended to
clarify what has long been fuzzy legal ground.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The exhibit of 175 works by the late photographer,
including a handful of homoerotic images, opened Saturday at
the Contemporary Arts Center, and a county grand jury
immediately indicted the museum and its director on criminal
obscenity charges. A federal judge Sunday stayed action
against the show until a jury trial is held.
   Hundreds of residents have gone to the streets, protesting
what one sign called "Censor-nati." Other citizens have
conducted letter-writing and telephone campaigns opposing the
exhibit.
   Harvey Zuckman, director of the Institute for
Communications Law Studies at Catholic University in
Washington, says the case could be a milestone for
legislators and artists fighting for understanding and
funding of contemporary art: "For the first time, a judicial
determination that this stuff isn't obscene."
   The outcome of the Mapplethorpe case will be determined by
how a jury applies a 1973 Supreme Court test of obscenity,
which many First Amendment lawyers consider among the most
subjective of legal standards. In Miller vs. California the
court ruled that an obscene work must be deemed by local
community standards to appeal to the prurient interests of
the "average person," to depict sexual activities in a way
"patently offensive" to that person, and must be judged to
have no artistic, literary, scientific or political merit.
   Many First Amendment attorneys expect the museum to
prevail on all counts. They don't think the community
standards issue will be problematic, despite reaction against
the exhibit and Cincinnati's history of aggressive
pornography prosecution. And the museum plans to base its
arguments primarily on the legal test involving "artistic
merit," which these attorneys see as a sure thing.
   In deciding the community standard issue, the jury is
assumed to "reflect" community values, says Marshall Nelson,
partner in Davis Wright Tremaine in Seattle. But the judge
will warn jury members "not to use their own reactions," says
Mr. Zuckman.
   In this test, the prosecution need not prove anything; it
can simply present the work. Hamilton County prosecutor
Arthur Ney wouldn't comment on the case. But Phil Burress, a
spokesman for Citizens for Community Values, which has
campaigned against the show, says he expects the prosecutor
to "lay those photos down in front of the jury."
   Rebuttal is up to the defense. H. Louis Sirkin, an
attorney for the museum, says he expects to call
psychologists to testify that the works wouldn't provoke a
prurient response in "the average person with a healthy
interest in sex." Mr. Sirkin also will point to the thousands
of visitors to the exhibit, say attorneys. In some cases,
lawyers defending a film, for example, have demonstrated
accessibility and tolerance in the community by showing local
box office receipts for a similar work.
   But Mr. Sirkin will also focus on the third test of
obscenity. A work can be judged "as absolutely patently
offensive as you want, but if an expert says it has serious
artistic merit, and the jury agrees, then it's not obscene,"
says Barbara Hoffman, partner in Steckler Hoffman in New
York.
   Both sides are expected to call experts to testify on
whether the work is art. Mr. Sirkin will bring in art
historians and critics, including some from the Midwest. A
1987 Supreme Court case ruled that merit must be judged by
national, not local, standards. The fact that the show is in
a museum, and presented with educational material, will also
be relevant. But there is some debate in the arts community
about Mapplethorpe's work; well-known critic Hilton Kramer
has questioned its status as art.
   One irony to the case: if the material is judged obscene,
its opponents could be liable for prosecution for using
federal mails to distribute it. The Community Values group
has been mailing copies of the photographs to raise the
hackles of sympathizers. Says Mr. Zuckman: "They could be
hoisted on their own petard."

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Intel Corp. reported that
first-quarter net income surged 48% to $144 million, or 73
cents a share, despite a prolonged slump that has hurt the
semiconductor industry.
   The results topped Intel's projection of two weeks ago,
when the company predicted it would earn about $130 million.
In the year-ago quarter, Intel had profit of $97 million, or
52 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue rose 25% to $894 million from $713 million.
   The results were the latest in a string of strong
performances by Intel, particularly in light of industrywide
woes caused by Japanese competition and problems in some
basic fields served by chip makers, such as the automobile
industry. Recently, chip makers such as Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. have had losses or profit declines because of
the slump.
   But Intel rolls on, primarily because of demand for its
latest microprocessor chips, used in many of today's personal
computers. Intel hasn't been able to keep up with demand for
its 80386 chip, causing shortages the company expects to last
into the second quarter. Its 80486 chip also is popular. Both
chips rely on what's known as "32-bit architecture," a chip
design that speeds up computing.
   "The transition to 32-bit architecture has picked up
momentum in the past six months," said Andrew S. Grove,
president and chief executive officer. He said first-quarter
80386 chip shipments doubled from year-earlier levels.
"Further growth is expected in the second quarter," Mr. Grove
said.
   An Intel spokesman said the results beat the company's
earlier projection because the company sold more
microprocessor chips, which have higher margins than its
other products.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Intel closed at
$42.50, down 25 cents.

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it is recalling
62,000 1988-89 model cars equipped with its high-tech Quad 4
engine to fix defective fuel lines linked to 24 engine fires.
   GM said the 1988-89 Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Cutlass
Calais and Buick Skylark cars equipped with the 16-valve,
four-cylinder Quad 4 engine have fuel lines that could crack
or separate from the engines. Although GM has received
reports of 24 fires caused by leaks attributable to the
faulty fuel lines, a spokesman says the company knows of no
injuries resulting from the incidents. GM sold about 312,000
cars equipped with Quad 4 engines in the 1988-89 model years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In another action, GM said it is recalling about 3,200 of
its 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais and Buick Skylark models
to fix fuel-line defects on three engines: the Quad 4,
3.3-liter V-6, and 2.5-liter four cylinder. GM isn't aware of
any fires or injuries related to the fuel line problems in
this group of cars, the spokesman said.
   All repairs will be done free of charge to owners, the
company said.
   Separately, the U.S. sales arm of Volkswagen AG's Audi
subsidiary said it is recalling 1,600 1990-model Audi 80, 90
and Coupe Quattro luxury cars to replace a defective bolt in
the assembly that locks the steering when the car is parked.
The defective bolt could break, causing the steering wheel to
remain locked even after the driver starts the car and begins
to move it, the company said.
   Audi said it received one report of a broken bolt, but
knows of no accidents related to the defect. The company said
replacing the bolt will take "less than two hours" and be
done for free.
   Another 100 of the 1990 Audi Coupe Quattro models are
being recalled to inspect a securing clip on the seat hinges
that may not be properly installed.

   BTR PLC Begins
   Proxy Fight in Bid
   For Norton Co.

   BOSTON -- BTR PLC launched a proxy fight to unseat the
board of Norton Co. and demanded it be allowed to inspect any
confidential information Norton is allowing other potential
bidders.
   BTR, a British conglomerate, nominated a slate of nine
directors for the April 26 annual meeting of Norton, which is
seeking to fend off an unsolicited $1.64 billion, or $75 a
share, bid by BTR. There are 12 directors on Norton's board,
but the board will be reduced to 11 at the meeting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Norton, a maker of abrasives and engineering materials
based in Worcester, Mass., has said that BTR's offer is
inadequate. In demanding that BTR be allowed to review
confidential information, BTR Chief Executive John C. Cahill
said in a letter to Norton: "Ironically, at the same time
that management apparently feel it is in Norton's best
interests to ignore us . . . the board has authorized the
company to provide certain confidential information to
interested parties." It added, "The board, consistent with
its fiduciary duties, should provide us promptly with the
same confidential business and financial information."
   Mr. Cahill reiterated that "BTR would be willing to
consider increasing its offer" if the confidential
information showed that a higher price is warranted.
   Norton is appealing a federal court ruling requiring it to
hold its annual meeting April 26, as initially scheduled;
Norton's board had canceled the meeting and set a special
shareholders meeting for June 26 after BTR's bid was
announced. A U.S. appeals court granted an expedited hearing
of the Norton appeal of the lower court ruling.
   A bill being considered by the Massachusetts Legislature
still could help Norton's defense, although it's unclear
whether it will be passed before the April 26 annual meeting.
The bill would require Massachusetts companies to have
staggered terms for directors, with one-third of the board
elected each year, unless the board votes otherwise. If the
bill were to take effect prior to the annual meeting, it
could prevent BTR from electing a majority to the board at
the meeting.

   NEW YORK -- Two Kirby brothers are at odds over just how
much anti-takeover protection their Alleghany Corp. financial
services company needs.
   Director Allan P. Kirby Jr., 58 years old, said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he
will solicit proxies for the April 27 annual meeting. He
opposes a proposal to extend an anti-takeover measure that
otherwise would expire after the meeting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kirby, who controls a bit more than 10% of the
company, said he wants only the flexibility "to vote my stock
in the future in concert with anyone I want to if I want to."
   The Kirby family as of March 1 controlled about 39% of the
company's shares, valued at about $213 million. F.M. Kirby,
70 years old, Allan's brother, is chairman of the company,
which has made millions from investments and has made an
occasional high-profile acquisition.
   In 1984, Alleghany sold Investors Diversified Services
Inc., the big mutual fund and investment company, to American
Express Co. for more than $700 million, at the time making
Alleghany the largest shareholder of American Express. In
1985, Alleghany was one of the final bidders seeking to buy
Consolidated Rail Corp. from the federal government. From
1954 until 1968, Alleghany owned a controlling interest in
the New York Central railroad, subsequently merged into the
Penn Central system which later collapsed and was taken over
by the government.
   In recent years, Alleghany has expanded into financial
services, acquiring several title and other insurance
companies. It bought Sacramento (Calif.) Savings &amp; Loan
Association in 1989 and also operates a steel fastener
business.
   In July 1988 the SEC adopted a rule barring from national
stock exchanges the securities of any company that acts to
reduce unequally the voting rights of existing common
shareholders. But companies with such plans adopted before
mid-1988, such as Alleghany, were permitted to continue the
plans.
   Alleghany's directors, other than Allan Kirby, have
proposed to extend the restriction to 1995. The company's
proxy statement says directors believe the restriction "is
still necessary to achieve the company's goals," and will
"deal with an active takeover environment in general and with
its possible disruptive consequences."
   Allan Kirby's letter to shareholders asserts that keeping
the restriction could limit the market value of the company
and insulate directors and senior management from
"accountability to all stockholders."
   He also noted that the company has in place a variety of
other measures to protect against unsolicited takeover
offers. Mr. Kirby stressed that he isn't part of an investing
group and doesn't want to see the company sold.

   DALLAS -- Lone Star Technologies Inc. said the unsecured
creditors committee of its Lone Star Steel Co. unit is
seeking to recover $109.3 million from the parent on behalf
of the subsidiary.
   Lone Star said the committee filed an amended complaint in
federal court in Dallas seeking to recover expenditures made
by the unit at the parent's direction and to recover amounts
alleged to have been improperly transferred to the parent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Previously, the committee sought to recover an
intercompany receivable valued at a minimum of $23 million on
behalf of the unit, which is operating under protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   In the lawsuit, the creditors group alleges that the
parent orchestrated a series of transactions allowing it to
use the steel company's funds for its own benefit. The group
also seeks to recover assets it said were diverted from the
steel company to Conroe Pipe Co. and to recover the $11.5
million that the parent received from the sale of Conroe
facilities in December.
   Lone Star Technologies said it will defend itself against
the claims.

   Univision Bond
   Bid by Hallmark
   Clears Holders

<LP>
   Holders of a majority of the $270 million in junk bonds
issued by Univision Holdings have voted to accept a sweetened
tender offer from Hallmark Cards Inc., a bondholder
representative said.
   Hallmark, which holds a 63.5% equity stake in Univision,
earlier this month had threatened that Univision would file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection if the modified bid,
which still steeply discounts the bonds, wasn't accepted.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The offer was slated to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT today.
   Wilbur Ross, the senior managing director of Rothschild
Inc. who represents holders of a majority of Univision's two
debt issues, said, "We are endorsing both the total amount of
dollars put on the table and the allocation of those dollars"
between classes.
   He said the vote makes it "a foregone conclusion the
tender offer will be a success," but he added that it's
unclear whether Hallmark will get tenders for the 90% of each
class it has been seeking.
   A Hallmark spokeswoman said the company is pleased with
the holders' decision but declined to comment further until
the tendered shares have been counted.
   Hallmark launched the tender offer in February after
Univision, the nation's biggest Spanish-language broadcast
concern, missed interest payments. The closely held Kansas
City, Mo., greeting-card concern created Univision with
partner First Chicago Corp., paying about $600 million for
eight television stations and the Univision network with
funds from the junk-bond offering and bank borrowings.
   Hallmark's original bid was widely seen as a low offer and
drew only a small fraction of the bonds despite repeated
extensions. As modified, the bid calls for holders of
Univision's $165 million in senior subordinated notes due
1998 to get 55.3 cents on each dollar of face amount, up from
45 cents earlier. Holders of $105 million in subordinated
debentures due 1999 will receive an aggregate of 37.95 cents
in principal plus accrued interest on each dollar of face
amount, up from 30 cents.
   Hallmark plans to hold the junk bonds and defer interest
payments due for several years.
   Hallmark has also reached a pact with a bank group headed
by Continental Bank Corp. under which the lenders loosened
terms on $315 million in loans to Univision. In addition, it
reached agreement with First Chicago, under which the
Univision co-owner will give up veto power and make other
concessions to Hallmark in exchange for provisions that will
tend to protect First Chicago's financial investment.

   How Many People
   Would Shell Out $20
   To Listen to Static?

   Quest for More Brain Power
   Leads Many to Mind Gym;
   Taking the Violet Cure

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- With my goggles and headphones
securely in place, I settle back into my chair and prepare
for the journey. I'm hooked up to a machine that is
bombarding my eyeballs with kaleidoscopic lights and my
eardrums with static. Billed as a sort of submarine of the
subconscious, the machine is supposed to help me run silent
and deep to the fertile inner canyons of my mind.
   Destination: the Zone.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Words will become as friendly as they were to Hemingway"
once I've achieved the trance-like state of mind called the
Zone. My brain waves will resonate in sync with the planet.
Creative thoughts will bloom profusely. Or, at least, so says
my mind coach here at the Visconti 2000 Mind/Brain Fitness
Center.
   Eager to think loftier thoughts, get better grades or
write best sellers, people are flocking to mind gyms such as
this one to plug themselves in to mind-stimulating machines.
They are "pioneers ushering in the New Age," says owner
Maryellen Krygowski-Visconti. "When you have access to your
creativity, it's like finding a hot-fudge sundae stand on a
Tuesday."
   Such are the dreams of Jerome Edwards. A 24-year-old
railway clerk who is engaged to be married, he confesses "I
spend way too much time on my triceps and not enough on my
concepts." But he has vowed to reform. "I want the married
Mr. Edwards to be a new man," he declares. "He can't be
slothful or a drag. He must be well-read, mentally fit and
interesting as heck."
   No sweat. Mr. Edwards stretches out comfortably on a
lounge chair and dons earphones and goggles. He flicks on the
MC Square, a light-and-sound machine similar to the Digital
Audio Video Integrated Device, the one I'm on, which is
called the David for short.
   A half-hour later, he doesn't seem quite convinced he has
been transformed. "I feel mentally relaxed," he says, "but
not mentally energized." The Visconti's coaches counsel
patience: The benefits of a mental workout often may not be
evident for hours, or even days.
   Most mainstream scientists put mind-stimulating machines
in the same category as miracle hair growers and bust
enhancing creams. "I think you can get smarter," says James
McGaugh, a brain researcher at the University of California
in Irvine, "through a little-used device called hard work."
   Mrs. Visconti, the gym's owner, doesn't dispute the value
of hard work. But she firmly believes that mental performance
can be enhanced with the aid of machines. Every night, she
dons headphones and listens to self-improvement tapes as she
sleeps. One of her favorites is a tape on dream programming
which she says helps her pick dream topics and visualize
solutions to problems, such as the gym's decor. It was a
breakthrough, she says: minimalist. Black furniture, white
walls.
   Trained as a nutritionist, Mrs. Visconti, 57, is the
author, and co-author, of several cookbooks, including The
Sensuous Salad and a collection of recipes based on A-1
Sauce. In the early 1980s, she began devoting more and more
of her time to the study of the mind, taking seminars and
reading scientific journals. Without any formal training in
the field of psychology, she began giving lectures and
seminars in creative thinking.
   Polaroid Corp., the camera manufacturer, is considering
offering one of her seminars to its engineers. Says Walter
Chadwick, Polaroid's chief engineer: "Sometimes the
traditional methods of getting the creative juices going just
seem to come up dry."
   Mrs. Visconti's vision of a mind gym was born a few months
ago during one of her workshops. And, with $5,000 she had
saved from writing recipes for magazines and food concerns,
she opened the gym in an upscale shopping mall, the
Cottonwood Porter Exchange, in November. Her gym is one of a
small but growing number of such outlets that offer
brain-boosting services or products.
   Mrs. Visconti's limited budget hasn't allowed for
advertising, but it hasn't been all that necessary, either.
Curious passers-by often wander into the gym, ask a few
questions, and end up staying for hours. Rarely does she
manage to shut the doors at the gym's scheduled closing time
of 7 p.m. "I am amazed," she says, "at the turnout."
   Mark Rossi, a 40-year-old stand-up comic from Boston, is a
regular. He says he was skeptical until he took a
standardized personality evaluation for $125. Among other
things, it suggested, correctly as it turns out, that he had
an unbalanced checkbook. Workouts help him write better
jokes, he says.
   Victoria Hackett, a 25-year-old nursery school teacher who
is going back to graduate school, says she hopes her workouts
will help her be a better student. "When I think of graduate
school, I get scared," she says. "Will I get C's and D's all
over again like I did in college? That to me is frightening."
   In five months, the gym, which is open six days a week,
has taken in revenue of about $30,000. (A half-hour session
on a mind-stimulating machine runs about $20.) Mrs. Visconti
has pumped most of the money into new equipment.
   In addition to the $700 MC Square and the $3,000 David,
there's the Ideafischer, a sort of computerized idea
thesaurus, and the Mind's Eye, another light-and-sound
machine which offers a choice of noises: rainfall on a
thatched roof, rainfall on a sidewalk, electric power lines,
glaciers. Similar, though less sophisticated machines can be
purchased through catalogs for people who want to experience
inspiration by the jolt in the privacy of their homes.
   At the Visconti 2000 Mind/Brain Fitness Center, the $8,000
Lumitron is especially popular. Users slide their heads and
shoulders into a white canvas bag and cinch it under the
armpits. What's inside looks like a television screen, and it
can be programmed to display a variety of colors from
throbbing red to violet. The red is supposed to excite the
brain; the violet is said to relax it. The machine's design
supposedly is based on theories that have grown up after
years of research by psychologists into the effect of color
on human behavior.
   Kathy Noonan, a thirtyish special education teacher, is
here to take the violet cure. She says she can speed read
professional journals, "but give me a nice juicy novel and
I'm asleep in five minutes."
   Over the last few months, she has spent a total of $500 on
sessions on the Lumitron. The workouts, she says, have given
her "inner core a sense of fluidity." (Translation: She feels
more relaxed.) She sees further evidence of her progress.
"The other day," she says, "I actually went down to the
library and came out with an armful of trashy novels."
   Mrs. Visconti has several assistants she calls "mind
coaches." Like the bronzed jocks who put new recruits through
their paces at health clubs, these coaches show patrons how
to use the machines. My coach is Eli Goodman, who also works
as a substance-abuse counselor for a local health-care
agency. He warns me that many people are worrisomely close to
a mental meltdown.
   "The circuits of our synapses run the danger of shorting
out," he says. "Our neuro-transmitters are on emergency
alert."
   Like Mrs. Visconti, he believes workouts can boost
creativity and relieve stress. A few sessions on the David
and I could write like a Hemingway, he says. What aspiring
scribe could resist that?
   So here we sit, buzzing our brains with sound and light.
Ten minutes into the journey, Mr. Goodman says he has reached
the Zone. But I'm still full of questions, which suggests I'm
nowhere near the place. "You're fighting the machine," Mr.
Goodman advises. "Just go with the flow."
   The journey ends a short while later. Mr. Goodman is
serene, I am disappointed. Creatively speaking, Papa didn't
bag any big game on this trip.

   Nissan Official Backs
   Fuji Heavy Industries
   In Its Bid for Subaru

   NEW YORK -- Fuji Heavy Industries Inc. should press
forward with its efforts to acquire all the shares of Subaru
of America Inc. that it doesn't already own, a top executive
of Nissan Motor Co. said.
   "I feel it is necessary for Fuji to have a wholly owned
subsidiary in the U.S. instead of an independent
distributor," said Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice
president for finance. "I feel Fuji should go forward with
this purchase."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Muramatsu's remarks are significant because Nissan is
rapidly taking a greater role in the affairs of financially
ailing Fuji. Fuji recently announced that Isamu Kawai, a
former senior executive of Nissan, will become the new
president of Fuji, pending expected shareholder approval in
June. Nissan is Fuji's largest shareholder with a 5.9% stake.
Fuji and Nissan both are part of the industrial group led by
the Industrial Bank of Japan, which itself owns another 4.9%
of Fuji.
   Speculation that Nissan might ask Fuji to back away from
its efforts to buy Subaru hammered Subaru's stock on
Wednesday, when it dropped 87.5 cents a share to close at
$5.625 in national over-the counter trading. Yesterday,
however, the stock recovered to close at $6.125, up 50 cents.
   In January, Fuji offered to pay $147 million, or $6 a
share, for the 50.4% interest in Subaru of America that it
doesn't already own. Subaru said it would form a special
committee of non-Fuji directors to consider the offer, but
since then nothing has happened. Subaru, it's widely
believed, would like to draw a higher bid from Fuji.
   Subaru's sales plunged 35% in the first quarter to 24,575
cars from 37,768. The company launched its new Legacy model
with high hopes last year. But the Legacy competes directly
against such popular cars as the Honda Accord and Toyota
Camry.
   Subaru of America officials couldn't be reached for
comment.

   Newspaper Publishers Expected to Post
   Flat to Negative Results for 1st Quarter

   Newspaper publishers, facing one of the deepest declines
in newspaper advertising in a decade, are expected to report
modest to negative first-quarter results.
   New York Times Co., for example, cited a drop in ad linage
in reporting that net income fell 51%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While there are pockets of positive advertising growth,
largely in Southern California and Florida, newspapers face a
dismal year for advertising and earnings. One positive note
for most publishers is continued favorable newsprint-price
picture -- often a quarter of a newspaper's costs -- which
will hold down increases in operating expenses.
   In the newspaper industry's three major sources of
advertising revenue, the outlook is bad. Continued
instability among the nation's retail chains and sluggish
retail sales in general are expected to lead to further
declines in retail linage. National advertising in newspapers
is expected to remain flat at best. Classified advertising
linage, robust in the late 1980s, is expected to decline,
largely because of declining help-wanted advertising, an
economic slowdown, and continued growth of low-cost
competitors such as community shoppers and weekly newspapers.
   "This is the worst quarter for publishers in a long time,"
said Edward Atorino, media analyst for Salomon Brothers.
"Most newspaper stocks are underperforming. There's some good
long-term value there."
   Lisa Donneson, analyst for County NatWest, said based on
reports for January and February, none of the major newspaper
companies showed year-to-year increases in total advertising
linage.
   Like many companies with major newspapers in the
Northeast, New York Times Co. saw its earnings get pounded by
the drop in ad linage at its flagship newspaper, the New York
Times. Net fell to $16.6 million, or 22 cents a share, from
$33.5 million, or 42 cents a share, from a year earlier. The
year-ago quarter included profit of $2 million, or two cents
a share, from discontinued operations. Excluding the year-ago
gain, profit was off 47%. Revenue rose 2% to $431.2 million
from $423.1 million.
   The company cited weakness in the New York region's
economy as a major factor for the decline. There was also an
eight-cent-a-share reduction in earnings caused by increased
depreciation and interest expense related to completion of
the building for the New York Times's new automated color
production and distribution facility in Edison, N.J., and a
new facility for the Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News.
   "The linage drop is worse than what any one expected,"
said Salomon Brothers' Mr. Atorino.
   Tribune Co. is expected to report lower earnings for the
quarter, between 40 to 45 cents a share, compared with 49
cents a share a year earlier when net was $36.7 million on
revenue of $553 million. Growth in Tribune's broadcasting
operations was probably offset by declines in newsprint
profits and weakness in newspaper ad linage. In New York,
Tribune's Daily News linage has been dragged down by the
sagging New York City economy, and the situation could
worsen. The paper, now in the midst of crucial labor
negotiations, could be facing a strike soon.
   Washington Post Co. is expected to report one of the few
per-share gains, more than $3.30 for the quarter, compared
with $3.22 a year earlier when net was $41.5 million on
revenue of $342 million. County NatWest's Ms. Donneson noted,
however, that linage for the company's flagship Washington
Post was off 5.6% in March. "They had a strong year last
year, but they were hurt by a late Easter this year," she
said. "The underlining tone of the Post's business is not
good."
   As previously reported, Dow Jones &amp; Co.'s first-quarter
net fell 88% to $24.9 million, or 25 cents a share, from $200
million, or $1.99 a share, a year earlier. The 1989 quarter
included a $164.1 million, or $1.63 a share, gain from sale
of an investment in a cable-TV system operator. Excluding the
gain, profit was off 31%.
   Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said
increases in operating profit from its business publications
segment were offset by a decline in operating profit from
information services. The decline was caused mostly by the
costs of introducing a foreign exchange trading service by
the Telerate Inc. subsidiary. Ad linage was down 3.9% at the
Journal, up 2.1% at Barron's magazine, and down 8.8% at the
23 daily community newspapers in the Ottaway Newspapers Inc.
unit.
   At Times Mirror Co., earnings are expected to be about 40
cents a share, compared with 53 cents a share a year earlier
when net was $68.8 million on revenue of $846.9 million. The
company's major problem, analysts said, is its East Coast
papers, Long Island, N.Y.'s Newsday, Baltimore Sun, and
Hartford Courant, where classified and retail ad linage has
declined severely. Despite competition from Freedom Newspaper
Inc.'s Orange County Register, the Los Angeles Times' ad
linage has been on the rise.
   Knight-Ridder Inc., buoyed by a recovery at the Miami
Herald and cost savings from the Detroit newspaper merger
involving its Detroit Free Press, is expected to report an
earnings increase to about 48 cents a share, compared with 39
cents a share last year when net was $20.5 million on revenue
of $541 million.
   Gannett Co. is expected to remain flat or possibly show a
slight increase in per-share earnings to about 48 cents for
the quarter, compared with 47 cents a year earlier when net
totaled $75 million on revenue of $818 million. Despite
falling linage and flat revenue for Gannett's newspaper
group, analysts pointed to positive factors such as
termination of its joint venture with GTG Entertainment and
cancellation of its "USA Today on TV" show.

   Tokyo Stock Prices Firm Up in Modest Trading,

   Tokyo stocks ended firmer in modest trading, boosted by
index-linked buying in the afternoon session, observers said.
   Shares on most European exchanges also moved up, in the
last day of trading before the Easter holiday weekend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues drifted within a
560-point range throughout the day to close 182.92 points
higher, at 29623.20. The index fell 184.40 points Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei index was down
378.09 points to 29245.11.
   An estimated 430 million shares changed hands on the first
section Thursday, down from 500 million shares the day
before.
   Despite the Nikkei's gain, declining issues outnumbered
advancing issues 512 to 419, while 170 issues remained
unchanged.
   Reflecting the broad declines, the Tokyo Stock Price Index
of all issues listed in the first section, edged down 1.96
points, to 2183.34. The index fell 0.94 point Wednesday.
   The second section index, which added 13.66 points
Wednesday, added 10.23 points yesterday to close at 3543.85.
Volume was estimated at 10 million shares, up from nine
million Wednesday.
   Morning highs, caused by bargain hunting at the opening,
were met by index-linked selling by institutions, traders
said. Prices then recovered softly at mid-morning, only to be
hit by profit-taking, they added.
   Trading by individual investors was quiet because of
morning volatility on the stock-futures index. In the
afternoon, however, the focus shifted more to fundamentals,
as stabler foreign-exchange rates and relatively steady bond
prices helped give the equity market some reprieve from
recent volatility, observers said.
   "The market's just stabilizing after having some horrible
volatility," said a broker at W.I. Carr, Sons &amp; Co. "It was a
quiet day, but a much more stable day. The market's heaving a
sigh of relief."
   Concern about higher world-wide interest rates is still
weighing heavily on the market, particularly in light of the
West German central bank's conflict with the government
concerning proposed monetary union with East Germany,
observers said.
   The threat of a possible interest-rate rise by the
Bundesbank, which would exacerbate the global trend toward
higher rates, is damaging buying sentiment, one foreign
broker said.
   On the other hand, the recent fall in oil prices,
attributed partly to oversupply by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, is providing a temporary
respite for inflation fears in Japan, the broker said.
   Among electrical and electronics issues, Hitachi was down
40 yen to 1,640 yen ($10.38). It was the most actively traded
issue on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with 26 million shares
trading hands. NEC was down 70 to 2,130, Matsushita Electric
was down 60 to 2,230 and Toshiba was unchanged at 1,100.
   Nippon Steel was down 11 yen to 554, and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries declined 12 yen to 899. A big loser was Honshu
Paper, down 180 yen, or more than 10%, to 1,550.
   Gainers included Casio, up 10 to 1,650; NGK Spark Plug, up
50 to 1,550; and Alps Electric, up 20 to 2,280.
   In Frankfurt, West German share prices jumped 1.3% in an
unexpectedly strong rally on the last day of trading before
the Easter holidays.
   The German Stock Index rallied 24.40 points to end at
1918.17. Trading resumes Tuesday.
   Traders said the market's recovery, which followed six
days of declines, was driven by the major blue-chip stocks,
which had fallen steeply in the past week. The index had
dropped 74.56 points, or 3.8%, since April 3.
   A firming in the bond market also helped, although bonds
finished the day flat. Trading volume was considerably above
levels earlier this week, when the market sagged.
   Traders also cited a relaxing of fears that the currency
union between East and West Germany would be put through over
the week. Rumors to that effect Wednesday were strongly
denied by government and Bundesbank officials.
   Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Bank led the market higher, as
Daimler-Benz shares gained 14 marks to 931 marks ($557) and
Deutsche Bank climbed 19.50 marks to 804. Daimler was aided
by news before the market opened that its Mercedes-Benz car
division posted a 5% increase in unit sales in the important
U.S. market in February and March, against declines for other
European luxury car makers.
   Traders said several rumors about Deutsche Bank helped
push it higher: one, that it is going to reduce its 28%
holding in Daimler-Benz, and another that it is about to
announce a deal with East Germany's Kreditbank.
   Machinery-maker issues, which had been knocked lower
earlier in the week by several sell recommendations from
London, rallied sharply, as Linde soared 30 marks to 1,014
and MAN gained 20.50 marks to 516.50.
   In London, shares finished mostly higher after a generally
thin and lackluster session ahead of the four-day Easter
weekend.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
finished up 6.6 points at 2222.1. The narrower 30-share index
closed up 7.7 points at 1741.0. Volume was 324.5 million
shares, against 311.7 million a day earlier.
   Glaxo Holdings, a major pharmaceutical, posted the
market's biggest gain on the day, surging 24 pence to 814
pence ($13.37) a share on turnover of 6.9 million shares,
also the most active of the major-index stocks. Analysts were
bullish about a new anti-AIDS drug that Glaxo is helping
develop.
   Composite insurers Commercial Union and Guardian Royal
Exchange firmed on market talk of a possible bid for either
company by Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake investment vehicle,
or by French concern Axa-Midi. Mr. Goldsmith and Axa-Midi
were set back by a recent California state regulatory ruling
that would prevent Mr. Goldsmith from selling the Los
Angeles-based Farmers Group insurance unit to Axa-Midi if he
acquires B.A.T Industries. Talk now has turned on a move
against the U.K. composite insurers, which have regularly
featured in takeover talks on the London market. Commercial
Union rose 10 pence to 479, while Royal Guardian added 7 to
225.
   Industrial conglomerate BTR advanced 8 to 422 after a
decision by a U.S. judge to force takeover target Norton, a
U.S. abrasives manufacturer, to hold its annual meeting as
scheduled, allowing BTR to begin a proxy battle.
   Reuters Holdings gained 14 pence to #11.54 on U.S. and
European buying, along with a brief rush to cover short
positions in the face of stock shortages, a dealer said.
   Elsewhere in Europe, Paris share prices continued upward,
closing at new high level in the CAC Index. Prices also
closed higher in Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan and Zurich, and
were mixed in Stockholm.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, prices closed higher in Hong
Kong and Taipei, were mixed in Wellington and Singapore, and
were lower in Seoul and Sydney. Manila was closed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   International:
   Britain's Rate of Inflation
   Jumped to 8.1% in March

   LONDON -- British inflation jumped to 8.1% in March from
7.5% in February, and the rate for this month is expected to
climb to well over 9%.
   The rate -- the second-highest level since 8.2% in July
1989 -- isn't expected to trigger further tightening in
British base rates, as the trend results largely from earlier
mortgage rate increases and the government's community charge
introduced this month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But analysts warned that if the government is forced to
increase base rates beyond the current 15% level because of
external reasons, such as a decline in the value of the
pound, the inflation rate could reach double digits this
summer.
   The government blamed the rise largely on the effect of
mortgage rate increases in February. But it said that with
the underlying inflation level, excluding mortgage rates,
rising to 6.3% from 6.2% in February, other factors were at
work, including higher seasonal food prices. It estimated
that annual food inflation alone rose to 8.7% in March -- the
highest level since May 1982 -- from 8.6% in February. Higher
food prices and the community charge, among other factors,
are expected to push inflation higher next month.
   Other government data confirmed that while the economic
slowdown will soon lead to a rise in unemployment for the
first time in nearly four years, wage demands remain high.
Unemployment fell by 6,800 in February, as expected, but this
followed an unusually small decline of 1,700 in January. Wage
settlements continued to rise, with the underlying annual
rate of average earnings boosts jumping to 9.5% in February
from 9.25% in January; a rise to 9.75% is expected by
midsummer.

   Australia's Packer
   Drops Hostile Bid
   For Bond Media Ltd.

   PERTH -- Australian financier Kerry Packer withdrew a
hostile takeover bid for Bond Media Ltd., a national
television station operator that is part of Alan Bond's
beleaguered corporate empire.
   Mr. Packer sold the network to Bond in 1987 for around 1
billion Australian dollars (US$766 million). He still is owed
A$200 million from that transaction. When it looked as if the
cash-strapped Bond group couldn't repay the debt, Mr. Packer
began a takeover bid for Bond Media that valued the company
at just A$53 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Packer announced in December that he would offer one
share in a new company, Television Corp. of Australia, for
every 10 Bond Media shares. It valued Bond Media at 10 cents
a share -- the stock currently is trading at about 13 cents a
share -- and attracted few acceptances.
   An underwriting agreement arranged by Packer for the bid
expires Sunday. Packer started wind-up, or liquidation
proceedings, on April 6 in the Western Australia state
Supreme Court against Bond Media. The action will be heard
May 2, with an application from Bond Media to have the
petition dismissed.
   Bond Media, meanwhile, is trying to arrange a capital
injection from foreign television companies to reduce debt,
and wants to restructure its finances.
   Separately, Bond Corp. International Ltd., a Hong Kong
unit of Mr. Bond's corporate group, said it concluded the
sale of its interest in Compania de Telefonos de Chile S.A.
for US$388.5 million.
   The company announced in February a preliminary agreement
to sell its 53% stake in Chile's national telephone company
to T.I. Telefonica Internacional de Espana S.A. of Spain.
   Bond Corp. is selling assets to reduce its total debt of
almost A$7 billion.
