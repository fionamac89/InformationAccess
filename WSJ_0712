   THE TAR RIVER SPINY MUSSEL lives a quiet life in the
clear, fresh waters of Swift Creek, a tributary flowing into
the mollusk's namesake. Kathy A. Smith lives in nearby Red
Oak, N.C., leading a not-so-quiet life selling prefabricated
cabins by telephone. For 90 days earlier this year, Ms. Smith
and the mussel were in the public eye together, as the
unassuming 39-year-old telemarketer found herself walking the
often fine line between economic opportunity and
environmental protection.
   Ms. Smith's saga began when two friends asked her to sign
a petition protesting plans by a Martin Marietta Corp.
subsidiary to open a crushed-granite quarry in their rural
area. The neighbors worried about noise, dust and trucks; Ms.
Smith, an amateur naturalist, worried about the quarry's
intrusion on the pristine Swift Creek area. "I can't fight
against dump trucks but I've always loved wildlife," she
explains.
   Telephone in hand, Ms. Smith began a series of phone
calls, first to private wildlife and environmental groups to
which she had contributed money in the past, and then to
state agencies. Yes, she was told by the private groups,
digging quarries can displace ground water that in turn can
pollute nearby streams. No, she was told by the state, the
issue of possible environmental damage to creeks and rivers
hadn't come up in the Martin Marietta application.
   Then Ms. Smith spoke with John Alderman, a senior
biologist with the state's Wildlife Resources Commission, and
learned two interesting facts. First, Swift Creek, which
would receive any discharge from the planned quarry, was home
to the Tar River Spiny Mussel, a creature whose rarity --
only 12 have been seen in the past four years, and no fertile
ones are known to live outside the creek -- earned it a spot
on the federal Endangered Species list. Second, turbulent
water, such as water roiled by the discharge from a quarry,
is anathema to the mussels, which choke on stirred up
sediment.
   Ms. Smith went public at a routine hearing on the Martin
Marietta application, standing to ask if there would be any
precautions taken at the quarry to protect the two-inch long
mussel.
   "Everyone looked at me like I had lost my mind," she
recalls. "And I wasn't then sure myself why I was so excited
about the mussels that most folks knew squat about."
   She kept up the phone calls, augmenting them with letters
to local politicians and contacts with environmental groups.
Before long, she had earned the sobriquet "mussel woman." Her
efforts weren't without personal cost. Her home phone bill
doubled and she had less time with her 11-year-old daughter
whom she supports with $30,000-a-year commission income
selling vacation cabins for Amerlink, the firm that produces
the prefabricated structures.
   The matter was finally resolved with a compromise. The
state's Department of Environment, Health and Natural
Resources granted Martin Marietta its mining permit but
restricted the rate at which quarry water can be discharged
into Swift Creek and required the company to build holding
ponds at the site. For its part, Martin Marietta is glad the
controversy is over. "It was an accommodation we willingly
made and it will have a minimal impact on our costs and
operations there," says Stephen P. Zelnak Jr., president of
Martin Marietta Aggregates, the quarry operator.
   Ms. Smith is back to selling cabins full time, but she
hasn't forgotten elliptio steinstansana, as the mussel is
known. She has asked the state to declare Swift Creek an
"outstanding" water resource, which under North Carolina law
means that any further development of the stream can't
interfere with its ecology.

   U.S. Companies, Baby Bells Plug In
   To Growing Cable Market in the U.K.

   LONDON -- Britain's infant cable-television industry is
turning into nearly an all-American enterprise.
   With the last three franchises awarded this week, U.S.
companies now own or hold majority stakes in more than 73% of
the 135 U.K. cable franchises. American cable-TV operators
and regional Bell telephone companies probably will spend
more than $5 billion to build an industry stymied for years
by skittish local investors and scarce programming. Optimists
believe that the Yankee investment and marketing know-how
could help raise cable-TV's penetration from today's scant
1.4% of British television households to 19%, or four million
households, by 1995 -- still far below the more than 55%
level seen in the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   U.S. money started pouring into Britain about 18 months
ago, after regulators loosened limits on foreign control of
cable operations. Among the U.S. concerns committing large
sums are: U S West Inc., U.S. Cable Corp., Jones Intercable
Inc., Pacific Telesis Group, Nynex Corp. and Comcast Corp.
   American cable-TV operators, facing an oversaturated
domestic market, see Britain as a critical beachhead for
future expansion Europewide.
   Cash-rich Baby Bells view the U.K. as a testing ground for
both Continental Europe and for expected future deregulation
at home. Unlike the U.S. and much of Europe, Britain lets
cable operators offer both television and phone services on a
limited basis; so far, it has been unprofitable. Yet "you
don't have to calculate in the telephone business to make the
case that cable will be a very profitable business in the
U.K." within a decade, argues Royce Caldwell, Southwestern
Bell Corp.'s senior vice president for corporate development.
It owns significant portions of six British cable-TV
franchises.
   The invasion from America carries risks, however. It's
dubious how much of a foothold Britain provides for the rest
of Europe. In many other European nations, cable television
has spread further than in the U.K. but remains publicly
owned and operated -- effectively closing lucrative markets
such as West Germany. Meanwhile, U.S. legislative moves to
bar foreign ownership of U.S. cable operations could have
repercussions.
   There's a much bigger worry for American players in the
British cable-TV industry: the competitive threat from the
faster installation and more aggressive promotion of
"direct-to-home" satellite television. Sky Television, owned
by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., had a shaky start last year
but claims nearly one million U.K. and Irish homes currently
get its channels through satellite-receiving dishes.
   In the U.K., most cable operators won't complete wiring
their franchise areas until "a very large chunk of the
potential audience already is receiving satellite television
direct to home," warns Caroline Bentley, a director at GAH,
London business-strategy consultants.
   Ironically, it was Sky Television's arrival and
availability over cable-TV wires that breathed new life into
the industry. Several U.S.-backed cable operators have
introduced packages that include channels from both Sky TV
and its new rival British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. -- at
prices less than renting the receiving equipment from either
satellite service.
   This approach, along with aggressive American gimmicks
such as tough sales incentives and free service for limited
periods, is winning more subscribers for some cable-TV
companies, such as East London Telecommunications Ltd., a
joint venture between Pacific Telesis and Jones Intercable.
   But despite its subscriber gains, East London
Telecommunications finds door-to-door solicitation and
direct-mail circulars "haven't worked as well as they do in
the States," concedes Managing Director Gerald Yutkin.
   Yet, Mr. Yutkin says Americans "wouldn't be putting that
much time and money and effort" into the British cable-TV
business unless they believed it could grow faster than the
U.S. industry did. But "it's just going to take longer" here,
he says. "It's tough. It's very tough."

   Perhaps the only thing to really regret about the Houston
economic summit is that the leaders of these seven great
nations didn't get the opportunity to take in a little
country-western music during their time deep in the heart of
Texas. But maybe they didn't need to. The six men and one
Iron Lady appear to already know one of the ten commandments
of country music: Don't do tonight what you'll regret in the
morning.
   Such famed party animals as Helmut Kohl, Francois
Mitterrand and the world environmental movement had hoped the
Group of Seven would join them for a couple of truly wild
schemes -- bailing out the collapsed Soviet economy with
billions of dollars in direct aid or committing the incomes
of their peoples to solving the "greenhouse effect." Neither
happened. In fact, reports yesterday said that what kept the
leaders' aides up till 4 a.m. Wednesday was work on a
remarkably positive compromise on agricultural subsidies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We have a few caveats, but on balance, it seems that for
all the heady talk about a world in transition now, the
industrial leaders handled some tough economic matters with
prudence and good sense. For this outcome, President Bush
deserves some credit.
   The two big issues at the summit were Soviet aid and world
agricultural subsidies. No one would have been very surprised
if Mr. Bush, a help-Gorbachev man, had signed on to some sort
of plan to start aid or credit flowing toward the Kremlin.
But no such cave occurred. With support from Maggie Thatcher
and Toshiki Kaifu, Mr. Bush got a final communique that
reflected the plain reality of the Soviets' economic
prospects: not good without "radical" changes.
   The communique's approving use of the word "radical,"
normally avoided by diplomats, is telling. "Radical" is the
term that the Soviet Union's proponents of the free-market
use to describe themselves. Some of these radicals have been
particularly critical of what they describe as Mr.
Gorbachev's "half-measures." The G7 will now send to the
Soviet Union an economic team to discover what most everyone
already knows about that country's "needs." It will be
interesting, and possibly even amusing, to see what the
free-market Soviet radicals make of their visitors from the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
   Prodded by the U.S., the communique also laid down a
relatively tough foreign-policy marker as a precondition for
financial support, despite a threat by a Gorbachev aide in
recent days that "we aren't taking orders." The communique
said the Soviets should shift resources "substantially" out
of the military sector and "quit support to nations promoting
regional conflict." Translation: Drop Castro. The Cold War
may be over, but it's reassuring to see attention given to a
proper mopping-up exercise.
   The resolution of the agricultural dispute -- a commitment
to "substantial reductions" in export subsidies, internal
price supports and import barriers -- will keep the Uruguay
Round on track. But the extraordinarily hard-line position
that the Europeans brought to Houston remains troubling.
   All this talk about how their farmers are the Continent's
"social fabric" raises the prospect of an almost medieval
Fortress Europe. In Houston, this issue was teed up as an
American-European dispute. But what message is the European
Community sending to the farmers of emerging economies in
Eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America, Ukraine and Asia? To
put it politely, the message isn't attractive, and unless the
GATT negotiators press hard to unwind this subsidy structure,
as U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter seems intent on
doing, the global economy is in for endless conflict.
   Members of the environmental congregation will howl at the
summit's disinclination to order up an immediate end to
global warming, but the summiteers appropriately balanced
such goals with legitimate, competing interests. Among our
problems with the environmentalists is that they seem to
think that their agenda must supersede all the other normal
concerns of humankind -- growth, feasibility, science, costs,
alternative investments (for presuming to give voice to these
concerns, John Sununu is demonized). The G-7 nations must
find a way to integrate themselves into a world of collapsed
communist economies and developing nations around the globe.
The useful message the Houston summit sent the
environmentalists is that their cause is worthy but not
pre-eminent.

   TURIN, Italy -- From his drafting table came the

secret agent James Bond. Later, he came up with the DeLorean
DMC 12, the gull-winged silver sports car that was a design
sensation when it hit the market in 1981.
   Giorgetto Giugiaro may not have his name on the hood of
any car, but he has had plenty of influence on the world's
auto industry. At 51, he is one of the most productive and
sought-after car designers in the world. Ford, Saab,
Maserati, Volkswagen and Hyundai are among the dozens of auto
makers that have made the pilgrimage to his studio since it
opened in 1968. Design experts say perhaps a third of the
cars on the road bear his imprint, either directly or more
distantly through his influence on other car stylists.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Giugiaro is one of the "carrozzeria" of Turin,
car-body designers who serve, in effect, as trouble-shooters
of the auto industry. Big auto companies from near and far
turn to the carrozzeria when their own designers fall short,
or when they have difficulty breaking free of old ideas. Thus
these designers wield influence far beyond their size (which
is maybe $500 million of annual revenue among them).
   Auto makers often pit the carrozzeria against an in-house
design team in hopes of spurring creativity. Since the cost
of developing a new model may exceed $1 billion, a car maker
may well consider it sensible to spend $3 million or $4
million to test its designs against those of the carrozzeria.
The project may be as big as creating a new model, or as
small as reworking a console.
   For a top Turin designer like Mr. Giugiaro (pronounced
Gwe-jaro), whose business is known as Italdesign, such
projects provide the steady profits that subsidize the
often-controversial prototype cars he likes to create. Cars
like the Maya, a car he designed and built but couldn't get
an auto maker to manufacture, apparently because it was too
avant-garde.
   The Maya would satisfy even the strongest lust for control
and comfort. A disk in the center of its steering wheel is
studded with buttons, putting control of the radio, the
defroster, the mirrors and other systems at the driver's
fingertips. Circling the cockpit is a chest-high leather
crash barrier intended to protect driver and passenger. "I
like this sensation of being enveloped, like a child in a
cradle," Mr. Giugiaro says.
   But the Maya is no baby buggy. Under the hood is a
250-horsepower engine. "Everyone is driving fast," says the
designer, weaving in and out of traffic in downtown Turin.
"It's a conflict of modern society. The law says drive slow,
but in reality man wants to drive fast."
   Such instincts have made Mr. Giugiaro something of a cult
figure in the auto and design worlds. Trendy restaurants in
Turin display posters of his work on their walls. Earlier
this year, when he visited General Motors Corp.'s design
center outside Detroit, young car stylists clamored for his
autograph.
   "He is one of the handful of great designers in the
history of the automobile," says Carl Olsen, head of
transportation design at the Center for Creative Studies in
Detroit. Mr. Olsen ranks Mr. Giugiaro up with such style
gurus as GM's Harley Earle, who in the '50s brought tail
fins, hardtops, two-tone paint jobs and seas of chrome to the
masses.
   Lately, Mr. Giugiaro hasn't restricted himself to cars.
The designer also is turning his hand to power boats,
cameras, watches, sewing machines, bicycles and sunglasses.
In Japan, a chain of boutiques specializes in apparel and
accessories of his design. Apple Computer Inc. has asked him
to visualize a new computer, though the project is so secret
that, when asked, Apple initially denied its existence.
   Mr. Giugiaro has even taken it upon himself to improve on
Italy's national dish, pasta. His variation, introduced a few
years ago, has grooves to hold the sauce better. Europeans
snapped it up.
   Cars, however, remain Mr. Giugiaro's passion, especially
sports cars. In the mid-1960s, he came up with the sleek
Maserati Ghibli, a car that can go 175 miles per hour; a
vintage Ghibli now commands as much as $295,000 at auction.
Mr. Giugiaro is proud of the design of the DeLorean, which is
the time machine in the "Back to the Future" movies. But in
his view, the car looked better than it drove. Even years
later, the thought of it amuses Mr. Giugiaro. "It rolls
around like a whale," he says.
   A decade ago, when a rounded, bulletlike silhouette
predominated, he began setting trends with a more angular
look. Now, Mr. Giugiaro is leading the current move towards
curvier, more voluptuous cars.
   "Our business is about emotions," says Chuck Jordan, GM's
vice president of design, "and there are not too many cars
out there that move you emotionally. Some of Giugiaro's do."
Mr. Jordan clearly is one of the designer's fans. He wears
Giugiaro-designed sunglasses and drives a Giugiaro-designed
Maserati Ghibli, which he calls "a sensation." But GM
generally doesn't employ outside car designers; it prefers to
keep such work in-house, where it has a staff of 1,200.
   Mr. Giugiaro has done some pedestrian stuff, too. When
Volkswagen decided to retool its image and shed its
functional but decidedly inelegant Beetle, it turned to Mr.
Giugiaro. He came up with the boxy Volkswagen Rabbit, which,
though a disappointment in the U.S., was a big hit in Europe.
(There, it was called the Golf.) Some analysts credit the car
with saving Volkswagen, which was facing a dearth of new
products.
   Fiat has sold millions of his sub-compact Pandas and Unos.
More recently, he has designed the Chrysler's Eagle Premier
and Hyundai's Excel, which are family cars, and the flashier
Isuzu Impulse. He also did the interior of Ford's sporty new
Capri. In all, Mr. Giugiaro has designed 70 production
vehicles; manufacturers have made more than 10 million of his
cars. "He showed you can make even utilitarian cars fun to
drive," says Stephen Bayley, former curator of London's
Boilerhouse Design Museum.
   "My philosophy is to pay attention to man and his needs,"
says Mr. Giugiaro, who says he likes to dabble in the fine
arts. "When I paint, it can be pure emotion. But with design,
one must keep one's feet on the ground."
   Mr. Giugiaro's modest origins may explain in part those
sentiments. Born in a village south of Turin, Mr. Giugiaro
studied art and drawing, just as his father, an artist, and
his grandfather, did. A sketch of a car got him a design
apprenticeship at Fiat at age 17.
   His fluid and aerodynamic designs quickly drew attention.
By the time he was 21, Mr. Giugiaro was running styling
operations at Carrozzeria Bertone, one of the three top
car-body specialists in Turin. Nine years later, after a
series of successful designs for Alfa-Romeo, Maserati and
Ferrari, he struck out on his own.
   With Aldo Mantovani, an engineering specialist, he formed
Italdesign, which in 1988, the most recent year for which
figures are available, had sales of about $56 million. Each
of the men still owns 40% of the company. (A bank owns the
rest.)
   Mr. Giugiaro's office is crammed from floor to ceiling
with books on art, design and cars. In one corner, the
designer faces a giant drafting table, gracefully sketching a
rounded roof on a new coupe for a client. Italdesign usually
works on two or three car projects simultaneously. At the
same time, Mr. Giugiaro may be thinking about a half-dozen
industrial designs as well.
   The design of a new car can take several weeks. Once the
designer has roughed out some ideas, they go to Mr.
Giugiaro's team of 15 stylists, who refine the ideas and come
up with detailed plans. Then modelers make clay mockups.
Next, builders construct prototypes that are painted and
fitted to look like the finished car. Eventually, Mr.
Mantovani's engineers start work on the blueprints of the
production car.
   Italdesign's labyrinthine workshop is a car fanatic's
dream. Along one wall, huge presses smash steel sheets into
fenders and roofs. Nearby, three assembly bays, their
superstructures painted bright red, hold prototypes in
different stages of completion. Two engines sit atop crates
nearby. Italdesign builds everything but engines.
   The atmosphere is friendly, but there's no question who is
in charge. In the paint shop, where the smell of turpentine
mixes with clay, Domenico Galante, a white surgical mask
hanging from his neck, calls Mr. Giugiaro "a tough boss."
Another former employee, who asks not to be identified
because he still collaborates with Italdesign, calls him a
"dictator."
   Clearly, the designer is hard to please. Once, after an
all-night session to paint a prototype black, Mr. Giugiaro
changed his mind and ordered another all-night session to
paint it silver. The designer recently spent the final hours
before a major auto show rigging a special lighting system
for a car; he didn't like reflections in the paint. When
designers styled a racy grille for a sports car a few years
ago, Mr. Giugiaro took out a pencil and sketched a simpler
design. "He told us, `Your idea is nice, but not for this
car,' " recalls a staff designer.
   Mr. Giugiaro has had some flops of his own. A few years
ago, he was widely ridiculed for a car he designed in which
the driver and the passengers were encased in individual
plastic bubbles. Then there was the four-passenger
convertible styled like a motorcycle. Driver and passengers
rode not on seats, but on saddles; the driver had the choice
of using a steering wheel or handlebars.
   Though he's been designing for over three decades, Mr.
Giugiaro still seems as restless as a beginner. And, despite
his flops, he has lost none of his boldness. An example is
his research model for a new Bugatti, which caused a
sensation at Turin's recent auto show.
   Bugatti, the famous builder of cars for Europe's kings and
tycoons, had fallen on hard times in past years. But a group
of entrepreneurs recently has been trying to rekindle
interest in the Franco-Italian auto maker, whose name alone
conjures images of timeless European luxury and romantic
jaunts on the French Riviera.
   Mr. Giugiaro's design -- a low-slung, voluptuously rounded
roadster -- is an effort to capitalize on that image. But the
designer also continues to aspire to new challenges. "My idea
is simplicity," he says. "You can always do better. That's
why I am always looking at cars."

   There's just no pleasing some people; ask Eastern
Airlines.
   Its promotion promising 100% refunds to dissatisfied
full-fare passengers has spawned some creative complaining.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Take, for instance, one passenger's displeasure with the
texture of his morning croissant, or the gripe another had
that his ice cream was too soft. Or the angst of a third: "I
felt ignored." All three traumas netted refunds.
   The carrier started offering the no-questions-asked
guarantee to woo back business travelers who abandoned
Eastern in droves because of a bruising strike and highly
public bankruptcy-court proceedings. The guarantee applies
only to unrestricted, undiscounted tickets -- the kind bought
most often by business people.
   The program had been set to expire last month, but Eastern
extended it through Sept. 30. That means the carrier will
probably be getting more complaints like these that have come
in written requests for refunds: "I don't like pizza in first
class," and "The flight attendant didn't offer to take my
coat until I mentioned it." Eastern gave those passengers
their money back, too.
   As of the original June 30 cutoff, Eastern had refunded
$43,425 to 126 people, most of whom registered the kinds of
complaints that usually inspire letters to airlines -- lost
luggage, late arrivals and the like. But an Atlanta passenger
wanted her money back because her only newspaper choice was
The Wall Street Journal. "We didn't turn down any requests,"
says a spokesman.
   Eastern counts the promotion as a huge success. "When you
think in terms of the traffic the offer may have generated,"
the refunds were worth it, the spokesman says. While he isn't
specific about how much business the guarantee brought in, he
does say Eastern has flown tens of thousands of passengers
since the program began May 7, but not all were full-fare
fliers.
   Airlines often mimic promotions started by competitors;
this one, however, isn't exactly spreading like wildfire. Pan
Am guaranteed its first-class service for a while on select
flights earlier this year. And the Trump Shuttle gave out
department-store gift certificates to passengers whose
flights didn't arrive on time, but stopped after
air-traffic-control problems and bad weather made too many
flights tardy. Now it gives frequent-flier miles.

   Johns Hopkins
   Hospital Accused
   In Medicare Probe

   WASHINGTON -- Senate investigators accused Johns Hopkins
Hospital, one of the nation's most prominent hospitals, of
having shoddy billing practices that apparently resulted in
excessive Medicare payments.
   The accusation came at a hearing by the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, which has asserted that
Medicare improperly pays up to $1 billion a year in medical
claims that should be covered by private insurance companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The hearing was an outgrowth of a Wall Street Journal
article last year that examined Medicare's Secondary Payer
program, under which private health plans -- not Medicare --
are supposed to provide primary insurance coverage for the
working aged.
   The subcommittee said it "uncovered failures at all levels
of the health care process . . . including instances of
waste, fraud and abuse." Despite more than two dozen
government investigations and reports since 1983, the
problems remain unsolved, witnesses said.
   One reason cited for the improper payments was that some
hospitals fail to fulfill their legal responsibility to
collect accurate insurance information from elderly patients.
"Hospitals, whether knowingly or as a result of carelessness,
submit claims to Medicare using improper codes in an attempt
to expedite payment," charged Sen. William Roth (R., Del.).
   According to Senate investigators, Johns Hopkins submitted
bills to Medicare using a billing code that stated patients
were unemployed -- and thus the responsibility of Medicare --
when in fact it hadn't bothered to learn whether they were
covered by other health plans. Johns Hopkins, which is in
Baltimore, was one of several hospitals committee
investigators looked at. The panel gave no specific figure
for the amount of Medicare overpayments it believes resulted
from the hospital's billing practices.
   Joanne Rodgers, a spokeswoman for the hospital, denied the
committee's allegations. "We are in compliance with all the
Medicare regulations as we understand them," she said. "We
don't believe we are guilty of anything, including shoddy
billing practices."
   Sen. Roth said insurance companies also contribute to the
billing problem by capitalizing "on what can be charitably
described as gross inefficiencies in the administration of
Medicare to evade their legal obligation to pay claims."

   Invisible Swayze; Satirical Bernhard

   "Ghost" isn't awful enough to be a great trash movie, but
it often comes close. The ingredients are there for no-brains
junky pleasure: the supernatural, a suspense story that's
also a comedy, mawkish sentimentality, Whoopi Goldberg, and
the wonderfully plastic Patrick Swayze.
   This is the second picture this summer to kill off its
main character quickly, then have him remain on Earth as part
spirit, part human in order to help his loved ones. The first
film of the season to do this was "Ghost Dad," the most
recent of Bill Cosby's attempts to make people pay for what
they get for free on "The Cosby Show." Both films use roughly
the same special effects to propel their human-looking ghosts
through cars and doors. "Ghost Dad," however, firmly
establishes itself as a comedy and proceeds to fail in a very
specific way (by not being funny).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The director of "Ghost," Jerry Zucker, never commits
himself to a particular vision. There's such a feeling of
uncertainty hanging over the whole enterprise that one half
expects Mr. Swayze, who is the ghost, to bump his head when
he tries to float through a door. Indeed, puzzlement is the
best way to describe the expression he wears throughout most
of the movie.
   Yet there is something goofily endearing about his waxy
look of wonder. He would have been so perfectly cast as the
lead in one of the "B" science fiction movies that were so
popular in the 1950s. For a man with such a lithe, athletic
body, Mr. Swayze always seems awkward and uncomfortable. The
disparity worked better in "Dirty Dancing," where Mr. Swayze,
who was a professional dancer, was able to express himself
through his body movements. In "Ghost" his gawkiness serves
no obvious dramatic purpose.
   Mr. Swayze plays Sam, a nervous young banker whose
cultural interests appear to be limited to Molly, the
ceramics artist he loves. The picture's rather tedious
opening sequences are meant to drive home the point that Sam
and Molly (Demi Moore) love each other with an intensity
matched in degree only by the intensity of their cuteness.
They aren't particularly clever or interesting; Sam tells a
friend that he and Molly are going to see "Macbeth" because,
"I think she likes the guys in tights, personally." The
director tries to compensate for Sam and Molly's
conversational deficiencies with a love scene shot with lewd
coyness.
   The movie gains momentum after Sam dies his terrible death
but doesn't disappear and remains an unseen presence to all
the humans in the films (yet perfectly visible to cats and to
the audience). Sam learns that his death wasn't accidental,
that he was murdered, and that Molly is in danger. He heads
for the nearest storefront spiritual adviser (since the film
is shot in New York City there is one very nearby) and finds
Ms. Goldberg, posing as Oda Mae Brown, psychic.
   Oda Mae is a charlatan who has taken in much money
pretending to hear voices from beyond. But for some reason
she really does hear Sam, who recruits her to help warn
Molly. As Oda Mae, Ms. Goldberg does some amusing bits of
business, though mainly she's a reminder that movie producers
simply haven't found a way to use Ms. Goldberg's talents. But
that's only one of the numerous questions left hanging in
"Ghost," which provides almost none of the internal logic
required of a supernatural story.
   ---
   I finally caught up with Sandra Bernhard's docudrama
"Without You I'm Nothing," another kind of supernatural story
whose internal logic is summed up very well by Ms. Bernhard:
"My father's a proctologist, my mother's an abstract artist.
That's how I view the world."
   Ms. Bernhard puts on an astonishing performance in this
bizarre, funny and prickly satire of pop culture. Director
John Boskovich and Ms. Bernhard, who co-authored the script,
have constructed their show as a nightclub act interrupted by
exposition from Ms. Bernhard's manager and an actor friend.
Periodically a beautiful black woman, who appears to be Ms.
Bernhard's alter ego, floats enigmatically across the screen;
she's seen in one of these interludes reading Harold Bloom's
"Kabbalah and Criticism" outside a kosher butcher shop.
   With her thick lips and nose and bulldog jaw, Ms. Bernhard
doesn't fit any mold of classic beauty. But she does have a
long, lean body that slides nicely into a slinky evening
gown, and Ms. Bernhard is obsessed with the definition of a
beauty that says she is one from the neck down and not one
from the neck up. The first time she appears in the film she
is sitting at a dressing table -- which she spritzes with
window cleaner -- wearing a sexy dressing gown and snipping
her split ends with small scissors. "I have one of those
really hard to believe faces," she muses.
   She is an energetic and unpredictable storyteller, whose
subjects range from a wryly sentimental recollection of the
1965 World's Fair to a straight man's memory of a wild night
in a gay bar. She's a Jewish girl from Flint who has
fantasies of being a black woman, especially Diana Ross, or a
white suburban Christian lady with a brother named Chip. This
"nightclub act" takes place in a black jazz club. Ms.
Bernhard sings a variety of pop songs with great passion,
then provides a hilarious commentary on the subtext of those
songs.
   Ms. Bernhard knows the boundaries and does her best to
test every one of them in outrageously inventive acts of
narcissism. "The critics are right," she says." I am a petty
bilious girl." She's also a great, eccentric talent.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Ms. Bernhard has never been cast better than
she was by Martin Scorsese in "King of Comedy," his
brilliantly bilious story about a would-be comic who decides
to make it by kidnapping a late-night talkshow host. This
underrated film has burning performances by Robert De Niro
and Jerry Lewis and, of course, Ms. Bernhard.
   Ms. Bernhard's is one of a number of exciting standup acts
you can watch sitting down at home. My favorites include
"Robin Williams Live"; "Richard Pryor Live in Concert" (the
1979 film, not the later, inferior sequels); and "Divine
Madness," shot before Bette Midler became a movie star.

   Here is an explanation of the rise to celebrity of a
Brazilian frontier union leader, Chico Mendes, engineered by
an indefatigable international team of environmental
activists. Mr. Mendes's work as organizer of a national
federation of wild rubber tappers had achieved only small
notice outside his home state of Acre, when he was brought to
the U.S. and England to lobby in behalf of the Amazon rain
forest, a worthy cause that had become the latest object of
radical chic. His local enemies, indifferent to his growing
global fame, had him murdered in December 1988.
   Martyrdom is a common fate of rural labor leaders, priests
and lawyers in Brazil. Mr. Mendes was only one of 300 killed
in Brazil that year. But in the months following his death,
hundreds of reporters, investigators, would-be film makers
and biographers descended from all over the world upon Acre
to capture the "true story" of Chico, the rustic ecologist.
In fact, Mr. Mendes chafed under the designation: His primary
interest was helping his people make a living.

<TEXT>
   Andrew Revkin's "The Burning Season: The Murder of Chico
Mendes and the Fight for the Amazon Rain Forest,"
(Houghton-Mifflin, 317 pages, $19.95) is the first to emerge
in the flood of Amazon books. It is undeniably partisan: Mr.
Revkin's heroes are Mr. Mendes and the environmentalists who
gained him his world audience. Yet he also offers detailed
closeups and honest and insightful commentary. "The Burning
Season" contains authentic voices of the Amazon's
inhabitants, villains as well as heroes, and sensible
judgments about their actions.
   Mr. Mendes's battle was against the land speculators who
were burning down immense stretches of rain forest. The
attack on the vast Amazon ecosystem, more than half of
Brazil's territory, accelerated in the 1970s as the
government built roads into the region. Migrants from
excessively subdivided small holdings and rapidly mechanizing
estates of the south swarmed in by the millions. Small
farmers account for only 30% of the clearing however. The
rest is the work of ranchers, some supported by subsidies,
who destroy immense tracts of forest for ridiculously small
numbers of cattle.
   Since wild rubber trees grow scattered in primary forest,
Mr. Mendes and his fellow tappers were its genuine protectors
and, since they enjoyed legally defensible squatters' rights,
they only could be dislodged by fraud and intimidation. This
is not a serious obstacle in Brazil, home to thousands of
highly professional claim jumpers and gunslingers, where
courts, police and politicians find bribery irresistible and
investigations exhausting and bewildering.
   For a brief period, Mr. Mendes found support in the
Communist Party, but as Mr. Revkin points out, his enduring
political connections were to the Workers Party, the
principal mainstream position in Brazil linked to the
Catholic left. Mr. Mendes's intelligence and dynamism were
displayed in adapting quickly to bargaining tables in
Brasilia and Washington, in forging links with tribal
Indians, and in refining nonviolent confrontational tactics
against the ranchers. Brazil needs more of his kind: honest
working-class leaders capable of resisting constant pressures
by an authoritarian elite that has engineered what may be the
world's most concentrated land holding.
   Indeed, the principal moral of Mr. Revkin's tale may be
the disastrous economic consequences of trampling civil
rights under foot. An entrepreneurial class that uses force
to acquire land and labor at bargain prices, and bribery to
gain credit from government banks at negative interest rates,
is not exactly what Schumpeter had in mind. These advantages
attenuate greatly the desirable concern for productivity. If
Brazilian ranchers were to expend as much effort in managing
their pastures as they do in intimidating their workers, they
could handily triple their output on existing acreage, and
the remaining Amazon could be left to slumber in peace for
another century.
   But it probably won't. Though Mr. Revkin hopes otherwise,
the rubber tappers, who struggle to have their groves
designated "extractive reserves," are very likely doomed by
competition. They require 700 acres to obtain an amount of
latex that can be gotten from a single acre of planted
rubber. Rubber farming also has the advantage of being
carried out in already deforested coastal areas that are much
nearer the tire factories. Wild rubber, furthermore, is
marketable only because Brazil imposes a 200% tariff on the
much superior Asian rubber and forces domestic tire companies
to buy the wild product.
   To assess the future is difficult. It is worth remembering
that, at this point, only about 10% of the forest has been
destroyed. Perhaps the ethnobotanists who now are rummaging
for potentially valuable plants will discover new wild
products, particularly medicines, that can be commercialized
to give the forests a lease on life.
   Whatever the eventual solution to the problem of saving
the rain forest, Mr. Revkin demonstrates how necessary it is
to establish an honest government in Brazil, responsible to
all its citizens for their irreplaceable patrimony.

   Ethnic Mix Gives
   California Its Youth

<TEXT>
   CALIFORNIA IS our most ethnically diverse state, meaning
its future is young.
   The Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy,
based in Palo Alto, estimates that 40% of the state's
population is black, Hispanic, or Asian. By 2000, this share
may rise to half.
   Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are younger than
non-Hispanic whites. As these groups gain share in the
state's population, California will age more slowly than the
rest of the country. In 2010, its median age will be 36
years, compared with 39 years for the U.S. The median ages
are nearly identical now.
   Youthful, ethnic populations are also more family-oriented
than non-Hispanic whites. Nearly half of Hispanic households
in California are married couples with children, compared
with only 24% of non-Hispanic white households. Nationwide,
the share of family households, which include single parents
and families without children, is expected to decline to 68%
in 2000 from 71% in 1990, while the share of nonfamily
households and singles rises. But in California, the share of
families could rise to 70% in 2000 from 68% in 1990.
   Hispanics have the largest households in California,
averaging 3.82 people, followed by 3.39 people in Asian
households and 2.72 in black. The shrinking group of
non-Hispanic whites has the smallest households of all, only
2.42 people. According to the center, "these trends should
intensify, and California should become a comparatively more
child-oriented market in the next decade."
                                                                                                       

   Health Coverage
   Often Marked by Gaps
                                                                                                       

   MOST AMERICANS have health insurance. But more than one
out of four don't have it all the time.
   A survey by the Census Bureau followed people over a
28-month period from 1986 to 1988. Four percent of the
population had no health insurance, public or private, for
the entire period. Another 24% had no coverage at least some
of the time.
   Men were more likely than women to lack health insurance
for one month or more, 30% vs. 27%. And although blacks and
Hispanics were more likely than whites to be covered by
Medicaid, they were more likely to lack health insurance.
Thirty-eight percent of blacks had no health insurance some
of the time, as did 52% of Hispanics.
   A majority of young adults had no health insurance at some
point over the two-year period, 52%, compared with less than
1% of people aged 65 and older.
   There are also differences in coverage by family status.
Only 23% of people who were in a married-couple family for
the entire survey period went without health insurance for
more than one month. Among those who were never in a
married-couple family, 34% went without health insurance for
at least a month. Those who changed their family status
during the survey period were most likely to go without
health insurance: 52% of those who spent just part of the
time in a married-couple family lacked health coverage for a
month or more.
                                                                                                       

   Japanese Goods Rank
   High With Students
                                                                                                       

   COLLEGE students have a higher opinion of many Japanese
products than they do of those made in the U.S.
   A Roper Campus Reports study found that college students
favor Japanese-made cars and home electronics over those made
in the U.S. About three-quarters of students surveyed think
that Japanese stereos and televisions are better than those
made in Europe or the U.S. Half think that Japanese cars are
the best (and 65% of students own cars).
   Europe rates second in car quality, with 26% of students
picking them over Japanese or American cars. Only 18% say
American cars are the best. Students also think that European
watches are superior to all others.
   The categories in which the U.S. wins big are sports and
apparel. Two-thirds of students surveyed rate American-made
casual clothes tops, and 70% say the U.S. makes the best
sports equipment and athletic shoes. (European bicycles,
however, are considered the best.)
   The U.S. and Europe tied in dress clothes, with each
garnering 44% of the surveyed students' preference. Only 2%
of students surveyed say the Japanese make the best dress
clothes.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   HAWAII may be the best place to be whether you're working
or not, according to 1989 data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. The state had the lowest unemployment rate in the
country last year, 2.6%. And many of those who were
unemployed chose to be -- almost 30% quit their previous
jobs. That is the highest rate of any state in a tie with
Connecticut. . . . According to the Census Bureau's March
1989 Current Population Survey, 82% of Hispanic households
have telephones, compared with 94% of non-Hispanic
households. The older and better educated Cuban subgroup is
much more likely to have telephones -- 92% of Cuban
households do, compared with only 76% of Puerto Ricans and
80% of Mexicans. . . . The median cost in the U.S. of a
2,400-square-foot suburban house with four bedrooms and 2 1/2
baths was $176,000 in the first quarter of this year. In San
Jose, Calif., the same type of house cost $497,800, based on
an analysis of recent home sales by Runzheimer International
of Rochester, Wis. That's more expensive than anywhere else
in the country. San Francisco came in second, followed by Los
Angeles, New York, Washington and Boston. The good news (for
buyers) is that in some cases, prices are down from 1989.

   The Issue Is Religious Intolerance

<LP>
   Dallin H. Oaks, a leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints (the Mormons), complains in his May 23
editorial-page article, "When `Freedom' Becomes Religious
Censorship," that current law is hostile toward religion in
that it prohibits all prayer in public schools. And he is
right that government oversteps the separation between church
and state when it rewrites prayers. However, in attempting to
instill Christianity in what should be a nonsectarian
ceremony, namely graduation, Mr. Oaks fails to see our entire
system at work.
   First, because governments pay the operating expenses of
public schools, they inherently sponsor and endorse any
prayer in a public school. Therefore, any discussion over the
language to be used in a school is irrelevant. No prayer
should exist. And though public schools should acknowledge
religious beliefs, teaching and honoring them differ
absolutely with teaching about them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Second, if all the people at a public-school graduation,
or for that matter in a classroom, wish to pray and are
religiously identical, nothing prevents them from engaging in
a prayer with the language of their denomination. And
government does nothing and can do nothing to prevent this
type of prayer, for no one would complain. Nonetheless, such
prayer should not exist in public schools. Public schools,
after all, serve to educate, not to further embed religious
beliefs.
   If Mr. Oaks does not like the system, I recommend he send
his children to a private school. I'm sure he'll have no
problem finding one willing to make his religious beliefs the
implicit assumptions of his children and eliminate any
thinking that would show his beliefs faulty. Because of this
nation's "religious plurality," however, its tax money must
go toward instilling objectiveness and free thought.

   Mr. Oaks wrote of a case last year where a Utah school
district resolved not to have prayers at high-school
graduations rather than agreeing to use "nondenominational"
prayers. He implied that the school board's decision was
honorable because it did not want to write or censor prayers.
I served as counsel for the students in that suit.
   Mr. Oaks mischaracterizes the response of that school
district. The suit was brought because every year for many
years every invocation and every benediction at the school's
graduations were exclusively prayers for and by members of
the Mormon Church. The suit sought to acknowledge the
diversity of religions.
   Rather than the noble response alleged by Mr. Oaks, the
district's response in reality was, "If we cannot have Mormon
prayers as we always have had, we will have no prayers."
   The issue in Utah is religious intolerance defended under
the guise of preventing censorship. Any attempt to remove
religion from schools in Utah is largely in response to
religious intolerance by a majority and not some sinister
plot by a minority.
   Mr. Oaks suggests that public prayers "honor the religious
plurality of our nation." That plurality is dishonored by the
religious monopoly and intolerance that led to the suit last
year.

   Prayers at public high-school graduations are nothing more
than government forcing religion down the throats of the
people. That's religious tyranny. The Founding Fathers were
not Christians, they were deists. They realized the horrors
and harm caused by religion. That's why they erected a wall
separating church and state, and to protect the people, free
from religion. Today they would be believers in the Big Bang
theory, and acknowledge that the make-believe god and bible
are merely a collection of myths and legends borrowed from
earlier superstitious cultures. Today, enlightened people
everywhere understand these superstitions were inventions of
the primitive mind to explain the unknown.

   I fully agree with Mr. Oaks's concluding remarks in his
article that religion should have a place in the public life
of our nation. But one must not confuse religion with deity.
Any prayer to a deity is a sectarian or denominational act.
It may be as unacceptable to a devoutly religious person as
the setting up of a golden calf for worship is to a devout
Jew.
   It is to be remembered that Siddhartha Gautama (the
Buddha, to those who choose to follow his way) did not advise
the worship of any deity, nor did he set himself up as one.
His last words to his followers were to "look to the light
within you."
   If I choose to go to a Catholic picnic or to a Jewish
feast I had better tolerate their form of religion during my
time there. But I find it quite unacceptable for the public
authorities to require that I kowtow to a deity in the course
of my ordinary activities as an American.
   If a school district is an Islamic or Mormon school
district, it should by all means prescribe or censor prayers
offered at official functions within the district, in keeping
with its doctrine and traditions.
   The lack of religion unquestionably (in my opinion) leads
to ruin, but at the same time no public organization in the
U.S. has any business requiring anyone to recognize any deity
in the course of one's normal activities.

   My education was the public schools of Detroit, and my
undergraduate degree was earned at the University of
Michigan. The time frame was 1940 through 1956.
   In none of those institutions was there any such thing as
prayer or devotional Bible reading in the classrooms or
anywhere else, and I would have been shocked if there was. In
fact, I never even heard of such a thing until after I had
graduated, moved to California and had a landlord who was
trying to get daily Bible readings incorporated into the
public-school routine. I was aghast at the suggestion, since
it impressed me as being improper on its face. The Supreme
Court reached the same obvious conclusion in 1962.
   The lack of religious observances in those classrooms did
not imply hostility toward religion. On the contrary, one of
the most interesting and culturally broadening courses I ever
had was one in which we studied the world's religions.
   I believe that those who went to school with me are no
less religious than the general population. I am active in my
synagogue, and the friends whom I know from that era are
active in their churches.
   The constant complaining that has followed the 1962
Supreme Court decision lacks scholastic rigor and contributes
nothing whatsoever to this country's domestic peace and
tranquility.

   NEW YORK -- Investors pushed stock prices sharply and
broadly higher, inspired by positive second-quarter earnings
reports and bullish news for oil stocks.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 41.83 points to
2932.67 in active trading, coming within a few points of the
record set June 15. Bond prices were essentially unchanged.
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the German mark
after Tuesday's sharp declines.

<TEXT>
   Traders said investors welcomed relatively positive
earnings announcements for big stocks. Favorable earnings
news from Motorola, which rose 7/8 to 86 3/8, helped spark
interest in other technology issues.
   Intel advanced 1 3/4 to 48, for example.
   Also helping to lift stock prices were strong earnings
reports from such companies as Federal National Mortgage
Association and Walgreen, along with positive analysts'
recommendations for stocks such as Humana. Finally, late in
the day, the market surge was extended by a wave of
futures-related program buying-purchases of baskets of stocks
with offsetting sales of futures contracts.
   "People are gaining confidence that the second quarter
wasn't a disaster," said money manager James Awad, president
of BMI Capital. Also boosting the stock market, he said, was
the successful completion Tuesday of a sale of
savings-and-loan bailout bonds.
   Abby Joseph Cohen, chief strategist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Research, said investors should continue to be
pleasantly surprised by earnings for the just-ended quarter,
noting that the level of write-offs by corporations should be
lower than in the first quarter. While she thinks that
earnings disappointments probably will hurt the market later
this year, that danger doesn't exist yet, she said.
   But right now, Ms. Cohen said, to achieve the consensus of
analysts' earnings estimates for the year on the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 Stock Index, corporate profits would have to jump
roughly 40% in the third and fourth quarters. "For that to
happen, we'd have to be in a robust economy, and that's not
the case," she said.
   Indeed, investors remain poised to punish stocks that
deliver bad profit reports.
   "The dark side of the whole picture is that if there is an
earnings disappointment, the stocks hit air pockets and down
they go," said Holly Stark, head of trading at Dalton,
Greiner, Hartman, Maher &amp; Co. Among stocks that fell on
earnings news were Hilton Hotels, down 1 1/2 to 51 1/2, and
Oracle Systems, which fell 2 1/2 to 19 7/8 on 9.4 million
shares.
   Some analysts said the stock market's broad move upward
supports the notion that investors are continuing to focus
attention on earnings and not on interest rates. In this
regard, the gain was encouraging, analysts said, because it
came in the absence of such artificial influences as
end-of-the-quarter portfolio window-dressing.
   A sign that institutions were more active is that trading
in large blocks of stock picked up. On the New York Stock
Exchange, 3,529 blocks of 10,000 shares or more traded,
compared with 3,013 the day before.
   The oil stocks added a boost to the market, rising on news
that suggested oil prices would continue to firm with the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries showing some
resolve to bolster prices. Also, there was a report that
crudeoil inventories are declining more sharply than
expected.
   Another positive influence on stock prices was the
peaceful conclusion of the economic summit in Houston, said
Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Economics.
   "It ended with the group making the same wonderful, very
anticipated points, all positive," Mr. Fabbri said, "so there
was no feeling of contention."
   Despite the rally, William Kufta, senior vice president at
Pitcairn Financial Management, said, "We would not go fully
invested at this point." He said inflation is still too high
to allow the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which
he said is needed to get stocks higher.
   As a hedge against inflation, Pitcairn has 18% of its $1
billion stock portfolio dedicated to energy stocks, Mr. Kufta
said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices soared in active trading. Volume was 162.2
million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Advancing
issues outnumbered decliners, 971 to 506.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were unchanged. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.56%.
   The dollar rose.
                                                                                                       

   In late New York trading, the currency was quoted at
1.6560 marks and 148.50 yen, up from 1.6425 marks and 148.30
yen Tuesday.

   ABBY JOSEPH COHEN, chief strategist at Barclays de Zoete

   MEXICO CITY -- A bid to privatize Mexico's largest mine,
Cia. Minera de Cananea S.A., has fallen apart for the third
time in the past three years.
   A Superior Court judge rejected a $468 million bid by the
Mexican construction concern Grupo ICA S.A. and its Canadian
and West German partners. The court and Grupo ICA differed on
whether the bidders would have to pay the Mexican sales tax
on the transaction, which would have added about $70 million
to the price.

   The government will open bidding again next month for the
copper mine, which is near the Arizona border.
   One previous effort to sell the mine failed when a
purchasing group's financing package collapsed, and another
failed when bids were rejected by the government as too low.
   The mine has been the center of political and labor
strife.

   SPAIN: EUROPE'S DRUG GATEWAY
                                                                                                       

   Spain tops a list of European drug seizures in 1989.
   Of the 171 tons of heroin, hashish and cocaine captured in
16 European nations last year, 39% was found in Spain,
according to a Spanish government report. The nation's
seizures accounted for 40% of all hashish taken in Europe,
32% of all cocaine and 15% of all heroin.
   The figures underscore the claims of international
drug-enforcement specialists that Spain is the main gateway
for cocaine entering Europe from Latin America; for heroin
from the Middle East, mainly Turkey; and for hashish from
North Africa, mainly Morocco.
   In the nations studied, heroin seizures rose 52% to 1,569
pounds last year from 1,034 pounds in 1988, the report said.
                                                                                                       

   HIGH-SPEED TRAIN FOR SOVIETS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's HSST Corp. has agreed in principle to sell the
Soviet Union technology for high-speed trains that float on a
magnetic cushion rather than run on wheels. The trains would
be used on a 20-mile line between central Moscow and
Sheremetyevo International Airport, said an official of HSST.
The memorandum calls for construction of the new rail system
to start next year and be completed by 1996, with costs
estimated at 90 billion yen ($607 million). HSST's trains can
move faster than 185 miles an hour.
                                                                                                       

   A TURKEY IN LONDON
                                                                                                       

   "Bernadette," a musical about the French peasant girl from
Lourdes who became a Roman Catholic saint, will close
Saturday, less than a month after it opened to scathing
reviews. The $2.25 million production, which was blessed by
Pope John Paul II, was dubbed "The People's Musical" after
its producer, William Fonfe, asked the general public to buy
shares in the enterprise. "I am very sad," Mr. Fonfe said.
"We had over 100 people on the payroll and they are going to
lose their jobs. We also have 2,000 investors who are
disappointed."
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMAN INVESTIGATION
                                                                                                       

   East German authorities have frozen a total of 56 bank
accounts that contained combined holdings of as much as 100
million marks ($61 million), a government spokesman said. The
accounts belong to 26 private persons and the holders are
suspected of attempted manipulation in conjunction with
monetary union with West Germany, the spokesman said. There
are at least 100,000 marks in each of the accounts, he said,
adding that there is a suspicion that the money was obtained
illegally.
                                                                                                       

   MEXICAN FINANCIER RELEASED
                                                                                                       

   Eduardo Legorreta Chauvet, the Mexican financier who was
arrested last year on stock-fraud charges, was released on
bail late Tuesday after 16 months in jail. The release
followed a district judge's decision to drop charges of fraud
and falsification of documents against Mr. Legorreta,
formerly president of the Operadora de Bolsa investment
house. The judge found Mr. Legorreta guilty of a lesser
stock-law violation and sentenced him to a three-year jail
term; that sentence was commuted for time already served and
future community service. Bail was imposed to ensure that
service.
                                                                                                       

   EXPERIMENTAL JAPANESE SHIP
                                                                                                       

   Japanese shipbuilders christened the world's first ship
that will use superconductivity to move through water. The
185-ton Yamato No. 1 is dry-docked in the Kobe shipyard of
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan's largest shipbuilder and
a member of a consortium developing the ship's new
technology. The ship's developers said they view the vessel,
which will use electromagnetic force instead of a
conventional screw propeller, as a prototype for high-speed
seacraft. The main purpose of their project, however, was to
demonstrate that superconductivity could be used to power a
ship, they said.
                                                                                                       

   WATERFORD STRIKE ENDS
                                                                                                       

   Workers at Ireland's Waterford Crystal glassworks ended a
14-week strike yesterday after agreeing on cost-cutting
proposals with management.
   The strike by 2,300 workers at Waterford's three plants
began over cost cuts, including the scrapping of bonuses for
500 glass cutters. Paddy Byrne, chief executive of the
crystal firm's parent company Waterford Wedgwood PLC,
welcomed the agreement but said: "It must be recognized that
we still have a long way to go in order to transform
Waterford Crystal into a robust and profitable part of the
Waterford Wedgwood group. Until this is achieved, the future
of the crystal division will not be secure."
   The company said unions and management agreed to refer
issues still in dispute to binding arbitration.
   Waterford has lost $64.2 million over the past three
years. Irish politicians had feared it might move production
of its crystalware to Czechoslovakia or East Germany if the
strike continued.

   Israeli legislator Yehoshua Matza invited a group of belly
dancers and legal and rabbinical officials to Parliament to
discuss a Supreme Court decision forbidding rabbis from
withholding kosher-food certificates from establishments that
allow belly dancers to perform. The rabbis say belly dancing
is provocative, but the dancers reject the claim as religious
intolerance. . . . The next generation of "green cards" --
the resident permits issued to aliens living in the U.S. --
will be made in France by Thomson-CSF.

   TOKYO -- Japan's economy will enter into a period of
gradual slowdown, but it will still expand at a respectable
4.1% pace in fiscal 1990 after inflation is taken into
account, a think tank predicted.
   Mitsubishi Research Institute said the Japanese economy,
following sustained expansion, will move on a "plateau" in
the fiscal year that began in April.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nevertheless, it said, personal consumption will go up
4.0% with the help of income growth and will underpin the
economy despite a lower rate of increase in corporate capital
spending and housing investment.
   Japan's economy has been expanding for 43 consecutive
months through June, the second longest postwar period of
expansion.
   In fiscal 1990, Mitsubishi said, wholesale prices will
edge up 1.7% and consumer prices 2.5%, and the Bank of Japan
will maintain a tight credit stance. However, the research
institute said, the central bank is unlikely to raise the
official discount rate during this fiscal year from its
present level of 5.25%.
   "As long as oil prices and other overseas conditions don't
show drastic changes," it said, "inflation, a source of most
serious concern in the process of economic growth in fiscal
1990 and 1991, won't worsen to the point where it could
seriously impede growth."

   Making `Rent-a-PC' a Household Name

<LP>
   The PC rental business is finally gaining a little
respect.
   Big personal computer makers and retailers are beginning
to take an interest in the ragtag network of rental outfits
that has quietly become, by some estimates, a $500
million-a-year industry growing at a 35% annual clip.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the rental industry hasn't really caught on with the
public yet. No big name springs to mind when it comes to
renting PCs. Many consumers and businesses don't even know
they can rent a PC to alleviate peak workloads, test new
hardware options and avoid the hassle of carrying a machine
on business trips, according to PC rental companies.
   That could change soon. Some big computer makers,
tantalized by the industry's growth, are taking steps to help
rental outlets become more visible. International Business
Machines Corp., for example, is experimenting with
authorizing companies to rent its PCs. Digital Equipment
Corp. also is moving ahead with an authorization program for
its desktop computers -- a program it says now extends to 18
U.S. outlets and has already proved a hit in Europe.
   At the same time, large computer retailers have stopped
ignoring the growing, wide-open market. Most notably,
Businessland Inc., the nation's largest PC retailer,
continues to roll out its Businessland Rents division, with
the East Coast as its next target. It already has rental
centers in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago
metropolitan areas, and says PC rental is one of its
fastest-growing sectors.
   No one is sure that these industry leaders can make a
dent, but established outfits say they're hopeful that the
aura and dollars of Businessland, IBM and Digital will
inspire even more rapid growth in the rental market -- even
if they also inspire increased competition.
   "Big companies like IBM can help educate people," says
Gail Ray, president of Simtec Computer Rentals, a Troy,
Mich., subsidiary of Inacomp Computer Centers Inc. "It will
have a major impact, if only because the industry's No. 1
problem is a lack of awareness."
   Simtec is one of three rental centers chosen by IBM for
its pilot authorization program. The other two are
Businessland Rents locations in California. At each center,
IBM will educate employees about its products and provide
marketing help. In return, IBM gets increased exposure for
its products and control over how they're serviced and
supported.
   Scott Stein, who follows the PC industry for International
Data Corp., thinks such programs will attract new customers.
"If IBM and other vendors decide to take this market
seriously, that ensures a good level of support. Suddenly,
renting a personal computer becomes a more attractive
option," he says.
   "The business will become more professional because of
this," agrees Simtec's Ms. Ray. "IBM's leadership will help
turn the industry into a Hertz, as opposed to a bunch of
small rental-car companies that you aren't sure will still be
there when you get to the airport," she says.
   For the moment, however, the industry is populated mostly
by mom-and-pop outlets that reach their customers through the
Yellow Pages. Although some larger firms operate nationwide,
such as GE Rent/Lease, an Atlanta-based division of General
Electric Co. and PCR Personal Computer Rentals Inc., a
franchiser based in Cranbury, N.J., analysts say most PC
rentals are handled by entrepreneurs working from single
locations. Rental rates typically run from $100 a month for
an old model to $100 a day for a powerful new machine.
   "This is the kind of business that can be, and often is,
run by a smart guy with a big garage," says Seymour Merrin, a
Palo Alto-based consultant who follows the PC retail market.
   But such entrepreneurs face three disadvantages that
analysts say may allow big players such as Businessland to
commandeer and expand the market -- especially if they gain
the lion's share of authorizations from major manufacturers.
   First, credibility. Yellow Page listings are an efficient
way to reach occasional renters, but they don't create demand
or establish a strong company image. Larger-scale advertising
isn't cost-effective for most entrepreneurs, however, and
outbound sales calls are tough sledding without an
established image.
   Second, financing. Computer renting, with its large
inventories, is a very capital-intensive business. Although
profit margins are generous -- much higher than in the
suffering PC retail market -- upfront investments are
prohibitive for anyone without deep pockets or a sympathetic
banker.
   Ms. Ray of Simtec, for example, found that her rental
operation blossomed when she sold it to Inacomp, a leading PC
retailer. "It was like marrying a rich man," she says. "They
had the money, they had the clout, they had the attention of
financial institutions. It was like night and day," she says.
   The third disadvantage entrepreneurs face is service.
Above all, people who rent PCs want assurances that they
won't have any problems. But such assurances are hard to make
without a large support staff and a big inventory of
replacements. "People need to know that if there's trouble,
someone will be right there to fix it," says Mr. Stein of
International Data.
   As a result, many small rental operations are girding for
a period of consolidation. And bigger operations, protected
for years by the relatively small size of the market, are
bracing for new competition.
   "We're obviously concerned," says Michael Meduri,
president of National Micro Rentals Inc., a franchisee and
majority shareholder of PCR. "Some of the large retailers
could put equipment out at very aggressive rates if they so
chose, and the margins are certainly attractive enough," he
says.
   Mr. Meduri says he's looking into getting IBM
authorization for the 54-franchisee PCR, to buttress its
position against newcomers to the rental market. Also
interested in authorization is GE Rental/Lease, which says
it's talking with several manufacturers and is confident it
can maintain its recent annual growth rate of about 40%, even
if competition tightens.
   Businessland, which is concentrating on renting to big
corporations, thinks there's plenty of room in the market for
everyone: "There's a legitimate need (for rented PCs), and a
growing realization that there is a solution available," says
Brian Leeland, vice president of Businessland Rents. "But
many people still have to make that realization, so the
market will keep growing," he says.
   "Rental is so much in its infancy that it has a long, long
way to grow," agrees Ted Books, marketing director for
Veritechnology Electronics Corp., a Cie. des Machines Bull
unit that operates 60 computer retail stores nationwide.
   Mr. Books says Veritechnology, which operates its stores
under the Heath/Zenith Business Centers banner, is seriously
considering catching the new rental wave. "It takes a big
investment," he says. "But it's companies that pay the ante
now that will get the big payoff in a couple of years."

   MILAN, Italy -- The financier Carlo De Benedetti regained
operating control of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., when
several of his aides and allies were appointed to pivotal
management positions at the company, Italy's largest
publisher.
   At the end of a five-hour board meeting, Mr. De
Benedetti's chief aide, Corrado Passera, was appointed
general manager of Mondadori. Mr. Passera said he will step
down as general manager of Mr. De Benedetti's Cie.
Industriale Riunite S.p.A.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Carlo Caracciolo, former president of Mondadori before he
was unseated temporarily by the television entrepeneur Silvio
Berlusconi, was appointed managing director.
   The new appointments sealed Mr. De Benedetti's recovery,
after a fierce eight-month battle with Mr. Berlusconi that
traversed courtroom and boardroom. Mr. Berlusconi was
unseated as Mondadori's chairman on June 29, and shareholders
appointed Giacinto Spizzico, a representative of the Milan
district court, to the post.
   Yet there are still no signs of a negotiated settlement
between Messrs. De Benedetti and Berlusconi, which most
analysts maintain is essential for a lasting resolution of
their conflict. Mr. Berlusconi still controls significant
stakes in both Mondadori and its parent company, AME
Finanziaria S.p.A. Without an accord, management of Mondadori
could still be troubled, analysts said.

   WASHINGTON -- Fraudulent international investment schemes
cost Americans $1.1 billion in 1988 and 1989, the North
American Securities Administrators Association said in a
report to be presented to Congress today.
   "International scams are now the fastest growing fraud
problem with which state securities agencies are dealing,"
said Kansas Securities Commissioner M. Douglas Mays. Fueling
the growth are poor international regulatory cooperation and
increased interest in overseas investing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Three out of four schemes involve U.S.-based promoters,
falsely claiming to be engaged in overseas investment
programs, which include precious metals, currency
speculation, bonds and foreign banking instruments, and
"norisk" high-yield certificates of deposit.
   In contrast, overseas-based scams usually involve
high-pressure telephone sales operations, based in Costa
Rica, Panama or bogus offshore banks in the South Pacific,
according to the 100-page study to be presented at a
subcommittee hearing on investment fraud, chaired by Rep.
Douglas Barnard Jr. (D., Ga.).
   International investment scams were the topic of a recent
Wall Street Journal column, Your Money Matters.

   "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord, but a just
weight is his delight." -- Proverbs 11:1

   GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- Richard Davis holds the weight of
America in his hands. It's a just weight, he believes. But he
isn't too sure about the one in France.
   Mr. Davis is the Keeper of the Kilo -- the one man in
America charged with making sure that this country's official
kilogram weighs exactly that. He stores the kilogram -- a 1
1/2-inch cylinder of platinum and iridium -- in his
laboratory safe here and studies it as if it were an Old
Master.
   This is the weight from which all other weights in the
U.S. are measured. If America's kilo is off, so is every
bathroom and butcher scale in the nation, not to mention
laboratory balance. (In 1959, the U.S. set the weight of one
pound at precisely 0.45359237 kilograms; one kilogram equals
about 2.2 pounds.)
   But the King of Kilos is the international kilogram, which
is locked away in France, and something weird is happening:
It is losing weight, threatening to mess up measurements
world-wide.
   The French have summoned Mr. Davis, a physicist at the
U.S. government's National Institute of Standards and
Technology, to investigate. "Every country has one mass guru,
and he's ours," says Barry Taylor, who edits the NIST Journal
of Research.
   According to international treaty, a kilogram is a weight
equal to a plug of platinum-iridium stored at the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures in the Parc de
Saint-Cloud outside Paris. The French call this kilo "Le Gran
K" and treat it rather grandly, too. Le Gran K is locked in a
safe that requires three keys to open, including one held by
the Archivist of France. It has its own script insignia -- a
special K -- that's used in laboratory literature. And it has
rarely been disturbed for weighings since it was made in
1878.
   But something has gone terribly wrong anyway, making for
Le Gran Mystere. The intrigue began last year, when George
Girard, a tall, balding measurement specialist at the
International Bureau, removed Le Gran K from its basement
safe, opened its glass-domed container and began comparing
the weight with seven other platinum kilos. He hoped to
recalibrate Le Gran K for the first time since shortly after
Paris was liberated from the Nazis.
   Instead of harmony among the weights, he found discord. Le
Gran K, he discovered, had gotten lighter than six of the
comparison weights, called "the Witnesses." Indeed, Le Gran K
had shed as much as 75 billionths of a kilogram over the past
century compared with one Witness. "There was a slight
suspicion that this was happening in 1946," says Mr. Girard
through an interpreter. "Now we know precisely that it's
happening, but no one has a clear idea why."
   For nearly any practical purpose -- weighing a bunch of
grapes in a supermarket, let's say -- that discovery won't
make a bit of difference. Seventy-five billionths of a
kilogram is lighter than a grain of sand. But in the precise
world of scientific measurements, a billionth of a kilogram
can seem as big as Jupiter. "If someone doesn't detect it,
differences get larger and larger and larger," frets William
Moore, who runs Los Angeles County's measurements laboratory.
"There's a word for this -- it's called chaos."
   A cool head was clearly called for, and Mr. Davis had
already demonstrated his aplomb. For the past 12 years, the
44-year-old scientist has devoted himself to making sure
America's kilo, known simply as K-20, is a just weight. In
1983, he carted K-20 to France, where Mr. Girard weighed it,
for the first time in 35 years, against some of the
International Bureau's kilos. (Not Le Gran K, however, which
is used for measurements only every 45 years or so.)
   Then Mr. Davis compared K-20 with the "working" weights,
made of stainless steel, that the U.S. laboratory uses to
calibrate weights sent to it by industrial and state labs. To
his dismay, he found that the working weights, and therefore
weights used all over the U.S., were off -- by 170 billionths
of a kilogram.
   So on Jan. 1 of this year, the institute instructed labs
everywhere in the nation to reduce the value of their weights
by that amount. The world of precision measurement --
metrology -- breathed a bit easier on New Year's Day. Without
Mr. Davis's work, says Jerry Everhart, a metrologist at a
nuclear weapons plant in Miamisburg, Ohio, "eventually you'd
get in trouble -- you'd be off in the Milky Way."
   A metrologist's life is a quiet one. Mr. Taylor, the NIST
journal editor and one of the field's few garrulous men,
boasts about "the romance of the next decimal point." But
that kind of talk embarrasses Mr. Davis, a modest man with a
brown mustache and a slight paunch. He walks quietly, talks
quietly, says he has no hobbies and spends his rare nights
out watching his wife, a violinist, play in baroque music
ensembles. He attempts a joke: " `Man is the measure of all
things' is a pun around here," he says of his laboratory,
where he is surrounded by metal weights that, of course, are
the real measure.
   But there is no time for such hilarity. A kilo crisis
calls. So Mr. Davis is now in France for the Third
Verification, when national weights are measured against
those at the International Bureau.
   Le Gran K was roused from its safe to be weighed against
the Witnesses for only the third time since 1878. Over the
next two years, two of the Witnesses will be weighed against
kilos from around the world, including K-20. After more than
four decades since the last time this happened, "the
uncertainty was becoming too large," says Terry Quinn, the
International Bureau's director.
   But overhanging this proceeding is the questionable
stability of Le Gran K. Mr. Davis says he will spend a year
in Paris investigating leads, but he has already ruled out
foul play.
   Only one person in the world, 62-year-old Mr. Girard, is
authorized to examine and weigh Le Gran K, and he has devoted
his life to keeping the kilo pristine. Metrologists study his
cleaning technique -- dirt could add mass to the kilo -- with
the awe of dance students watching Baryshnikov. The
International Bureau even plans to make an instructional
videotape of Mr. Girard rubbing kilos with chamois cloths.
   Some metrologists blame the manufacturer for the problems.
Le Gran K and two other kilos were made in one batch in 1878;
40 more kilos, including K-20, were made in another batch
four years later. Johnson, Matthey &amp; Co. of London made all
of them, plus a good many of a third batch of 23. The firm
may have made them slightly differently, the theory goes,
resulting in Le Gran K's batch getting lighter over time.
   But Mr. Davis says there's no evidence of that. (A
spokesman for Johnson Matthey says the firm "doesn't know
anything" about the kilo problem.)
   Mr. Davis thinks he knows the real culprit: polish. The
first 43 kilos were polished by the same person, A. Collot of
Paris, in the same way. But Mr. Davis believes that there may
be something in the emery-paste polish Mr. Collot used a
century ago that has affected how the kilos have kept up
their weight.
   To test his theory, Mr. Davis will study the newest kilos,
in which diamond cutting tools are used to shine the
platinum. If the diamond-cut kilos differ from the older
polished ones in the way they respond to humidity and
cleaning, he believes, he may be on his way to solving this
kilo caper.
   It's slow work, and frustrating, too. And although Mr.
Davis has made a name for himself as a kilo-sleuth, he says
he'd like to give it all up. He's cheering for his colleagues
who are studying phenomenally complicated ways to redefine
the kilos using measurements that don't depend on studying
the vagaries of a hunk of metal. "I don't worry about my
job," he says bravely. "That's like worrying about
blacksmiths when the automobile was invented."
   Nine groups throughout the world are working on a kilo
replacement, without much luck so far. A group in Germany is
trying to count the number of atoms in a kilogram of silicon,
but since there are 21,510,714,285,700,000,000,000,000 --
approximately -- that's pretty tough. The U.S. standards lab
in Gaithersburg gave up on that approach a decade ago.
   Instead, scientists here have constructed a two-story
contraption replete with lasers and superconducting magnets,
called the Absolute Volt, which measures the current and
voltage required to lift a kilogram. (A kilo then would
become a measure of electricity, not metal.) A group in
England has a similar experiment, but it is using
conventional magnets that weigh six tons and one ton instead
of superconducting magnets. Ed Williams, who's in charge of
the U.S. kilo-redefinition project, says he hopes to finish
his work by the year 2000 after spending $2.5 million.
   Mr. Williams may change the kilogram forever, but he
modestly notes that metal weights would live on, too. "It
would be kind of awkward to put one of these in a grocery
store," he says of his invention.

   Ex-Owner of Sunbelt Savings of Texas
   Is Indicted on Thrift-Fraud Charges

   DALLAS -- Edwin T. McBirney III, former owner of the
defunct Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas, was indicted by
a federal grand jury here, the second major indictment in the
past month by the Justice Department in its investigation
into thrift fraud.
   Mr. McBirney, whose life style and penchant for risky
business ventures earned him the nickname "Fast Eddie," is
one of a handful of former Texas thrift owners who have been
targets of the Justice Department's Dallas Bank Fraud Task
Force since the unit was formed three years ago. The
indictment came just four weeks after the indictment of
another flashy former thrift owner, Don R. Dixon, who owned
Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association. Mr. Dixon has pleaded
innocent to the charges against him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the Dixon case, which was based on the alleged use
of thrift funds to reimburse employees for political campaign
contributions and female escorts, the indictment against Mr.
McBirney is based on actual loan transactions. Those
transactions contributed about $160 million in losses to
Sunbelt's total losses of more than $2 billion, according to
federal thrift regulators.
   The 17-count indictment relates to Sunbelt's attempt to
finance a unit's 1984 purchase of about $700 million of real
estate in Southern California, including the Los Angeles
Airport Hilton and Anaheim Hilton at Disneyland hotels.
   "The indictment is a typical case of government overkill,
in which they have taken a single transaction that, before
all the hysteria, would have been a two or three count
indictment," said Mr. McBirney's defense lawyer, Paul Coggins
of Dallas. "I don't see anything in the indictment that says
Mr. McBirney personally profited or acted contrary to the
interests of Sunbelt."
   The indictment specifically alleges that Mr. McBirney
conspired with a vice president of the now-defunct Western
Savings Association of Dallas for Western to provide about
$30 million in financing for the California properties.
   In exchange for the loan from Western, Mr. McBirney
"offered to give Western a $6 million profit on any piece of
property Western wanted to sell," the indictment says.
   The property selected by Western was 708 acres on Lake
Lewisville, north of Dallas. Western lent a borrower $16.8
million to acquire the land from a Western unit; Sunbelt, at
the behest of Mr. McBirney, then lent the borrower $22.6
million to cover the principal of the Western loan, plus
interest, and a $6 million profit for Western, according to
the indictment.
   The indictment accuses Mr. McBirney of misapplying Sunbelt
funds to keep the land loan current and of lying to Sunbelt
officers and Texas thrift officials about the status of the
loan.
   The indictment further charges Mr. McBirney with fraud in
connection with Sunbelt's financing of a subsequent, interim
purchase of the Lake Lewisville land by Kenneth Hood, a
former Western vice president. Mr. Hood is one of 10 people
who have pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to
Sunbelt transactions and are cooperating in the ongoing fraud
investigation.
   If convicted of all charges in the indictment, Mr.
McBirney faces a maximum possible sentence of 85 years in
federal prison and a $4.25 million fine. He is scheduled to
surrender to federal authorities today.
   Mr. McBirney and five colleagues acquired Sunbelt Savings
in December 1982 and eventually merged it with four other
thrifts. During his ownership of Sunbelt, Mr. McBirney became
known for the expensive parties he gave for employees at
Halloween and Christmas.
   Thrift regulators took control of Sunbelt in October 1986,
but Mr. McBirney didn't resign from the thrift's board until
June 1987. Less than a year later, Sunbelt, with $2.2 billion
in assets, was merged with seven other thrifts to become
Sunbelt Savings FSB.
   Mr. McBirney currently is chairman and chief executive
officer of Dallas-based Oxidyne Group Inc., a troubled
holding company with interests in real estate and solid-waste
disposal technology.

   CHICAGO -- UAL Corp. said its United Airlines unit
regained the top position among airlines in June for revenue
passenger miles. UAL had lost the No. 1 position to AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines two years ago.
   Most of United's growth is coming from its Pacific routes,
where traffic rose 35.6% in June from a year ago.

   United's June revenue passenger miles increased 8.4%, to
6.91 billion, from 6.37 billion a year earlier. A revenue
passenger mile is the revenue from one passenger flown one
mile.
   American still isn't far behind United. American said its
June revenue passenger miles were 6.86 billion, compared with
6.88 billion last year, down 0.3%. An American spokesman
attributed the decline to a drop in traffic on American's
routes in the Caribbean and Mexico.
   American recently started serving several countries in
Latin America, which should increase its passenger traffic in
the coming months.

   HOBOKEN, N.J. -- Voters dealt a blow to development plans
on this Hudson River waterfront city, when they rejected a $2
billion real-estate complex by the narrow margin of 4,418 to
4,406.
   A coalition of anti-development groups forced the
referendum, following a Dec. 29 agreement between the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey and Hoboken officials to
develop the waterfront. Opponents said the plan would cause
congestion and destroy the city's small-town atmosphere.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As Hoboken's once-thriving port declined over the last
quarter century, city officials had hoped to replace
abandoned piers with a combination of offices and expensive
condominiums.
   Even as neighboring New Jersey waterfront towns grew,
Hoboken's ambitious plans had a number of fits and starts,
primarily because the city has gone through several
administrations.
   Among the issues still to be settled is the disposition of
a $7 million payment the Port Authority made to the city of
Hoboken early this year.
   The referendum bars development for at least the next
three years on the waterfront site.

   Copper Futures Rise Sharply on Metal Purchases
   In London, More Reports of Production Problems

   NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices rose sharply after large
purchases of the metal in London and continued reports of
production problems.
   The July contract, whose last trading day is July 27, rose
5.75 cents a pound to $1.2435, while the most-active
September contract was up 5.25 cents to $1.22.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There was active Japanese and German buying of copper in
London yesterday as well as German purchases of futures
contracts that had recently been sold short, analysts and
trade sources said.
   German buying of futures contracts in London was
associated with a rumor that a major German metals company
was covering its positions in connection with a failed
attempt to buy the Cananea copper mine in Mexico, analysts
said.
   According to the unconfirmed reports, the German company
sold copper contracts to lock in prices in case of a market
decline after it bought the Mexican mine. But the company's
bid was rejected by Mexican officials, and so it repurchased
its futures contracts, helping the copper price to rise,
analysts and trade sources said.
   The Mexican government took over the Compania Minera
Cananea last August, declared it bankrupt and fired its
workers just before they were to begin a strike. Cananea
produces about 140,000 tons of refined copper annually and is
Mexico's largest copper producer.
   The Mexican government has been trying to sell the mine,
which returned to production under government control in
November. According to one analyst, the mine has encountered
some production problems and is functioning at about 90% of
capacity.
   Late in the day, there was a report that workers at Minero
Peru, which accounts for about 75% of Peru's copper
production, had voted to strike Monday. Peru is the world's
sixth-largest copper producer.
   Analyst Richard Hirsch of Sharps Pixley Inc., New York,
noted that the big Bougainville copper mine in Papua New
Guinea remains out of operation. Workers for Asarco Inc., a
major U.S. producer, have been on strike for almost two
weeks, "and now it appears that Peru is about to be hit with
a strike. There are labor problems in Zambia as well and a
recent cave-in in a Chilean mine," he added.
   Coupled with those production problems, he said, has been
added demand. "Japan needs copper, and so does Germany,
because the economies of both countries are stronger than had
been expected," Mr. Hirsch said.
   Another analyst observed that while American demand for
copper has softened, demand world-wide has remained strong.
The market is also strong technically, he said, and this has
brought in computer-led funds whose buying has been a major
support for futures prices.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Good weather and a forecast of more
of the same forced grain futures prices lower in a
continuation of last week's price slide. Though farmers were
late planting corn and soybeans this year, analysts said
fears that the crop would be severely affected aren't
materializing. "The crop may be tight, it may be low, but
it's not going to be a disaster, and that's why we have a
price break," said Mickey Luth, analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in Chicago. Prices of corn, soybean and wheat
futures declined. Analysts said extremely low demand also is
a factor. "The demand for wheat is abysmal," said Katharina
Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. "The Soviets
are not expected to be in the market for another month or
two, the Chinese have bought what they need, and the
Egyptians have no money." A government crop report on wheat
is due today, and analysts said the wheat market may be
volatile in anticipation of the report.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices for gold and platinum
declined, while those for silver were slightly higher. August
delivery gold was off $1.50 an ounce at $355.60. October
platinum declined $7.60 an ounce to $481.30. September silver
was up 2.2 cents an ounce to $4.8970. According to one
analyst, the most significant development in gold was that
the price didn't continue to drop sharply following Tuesday's
declines, which were prompted by Middle Eastern selling of
the metal. Gold currently is a narrowly traded market because
there isn't any real incentive for traders to buy or sell
aggressively. Not only is there concern about further Middle
Eastern selling, but producers are poised to sell on any
rally, the analyst said. As for silver, he said, the price is
relatively very low, prompting little interest in selling the
metal. At the same time, there's no real demand for it
either, he said.
                                                                                                       

   COFFEE: Futures prices fell back from early advances and
ended lower. The September contract was off 0.50 cent at 88
cents a pound. Initial demand for contracts was prompted by
reports that a Colombian coffee official made an unexpected
visit to Brazil, which gave rise to speculation that
discussions on restoring global export quotas might be
renewed, said Judith Ganes, an analyst for Merrill Lynch. The
quotas were suspended a year ago. Brazil recently called for
a meeting of the member nations of the International Coffee
Agreement, which will be held July 23, the analyst noted.
"When the visit of the Colombian official was reported,
traders apparently felt that there might be more substance to
the speculation of reviving quotas," she said. However, Ms.
Ganes noted that the new Brazilian administration has been
moving more toward a free market, and it didn't seem in
character that it would press for coffee export quotas. "The
larger Brazilian exporters not only don't want export quotas,
they'd like to see the whole International Coffee Agreement
abolished," Ms. Ganes said. "Smaller exporters, however,
would like to see them restored because they have been hurt
by the plunge in prices that followed the suspension of
quotas."

   LOS ANGELES -- Ford Motor Co. said it is offering owners
of old gas guzzlers $700 a vehicle to scrap them. Ford said
it will buy 1,000 of the most heavily polluting cars here.
   The car company is piggy-backing on a program launched by
Unocal Corp. in April. Unocal offered to buy 7,000 cars made
before 1971 at a price of $700 a vehicle. More than 10,000
owners applied, leaving the company with a waiting list.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Unocal spokesman says Ford approached Unocal about
participating in the program. So far Unocal has scrapped
about 2,500 cars and plans to buy as many as 4,700 more, for
a total of 7,200, slightly more than the original plan.
   Ford is combining its environmental gesture with a sales
pitch. Ford said it is offering sellers an additional $700
toward the purchase or lease of a new, low-emission Ford
vehicle, such as a Ford Festiva, Ford Escort or Mercury
Tracer. Ford said it is also making that offer to those who
sell their cars to Unocal.

   This Is the Way the Cold War Ends, as a Hootenanny

   Okemah, Okla. -- You may think you've heard all the
collapse-of-the-cold-war stories there are to tell. Prague,
Lithuania, Budapest, Warsaw, Berlin. But what about Okemah?
Okemah? Yes, it's taken a spell for glasnost to reach this
small farming town. But come Saturday Okemah finally will
make its peace with the cold war too, as July 14 becomes an
official city holiday marking the birthday of its most mythic
native son, Woody Guthrie -- writer, balladeer, philosopher,
patron saint of the homeless, and antecedent to Bob Dylan and
the American folk song movement.
   Though his music is familiar to many ("Hard, Ain't It
Hard," "This Land Is Your Land"), Guthrie himself is not. His
recordings are kept respectably but quietly alive (the
Library of Congress recordings are on Rounder Records in all
formats; RCA and Smithsonian/Folkways also hold large
catalogs). Most listeners find his romantic legend easier to
take than his dour voice, which was flat, dry and airless.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Or his politics, which were communist.
   That's why there's recently been a little tiff in Okemah
over Woody, the latest of several over the years. The issue
is always the same. Some think the town ought to give
official honor to its most famous citizen -- and maybe
promote a little tourism on the side. Others say no. Guthrie
was a communist, they insist, and Okemah's got no business
honoring a Red. In 1990 it is a debate that seems to come
from some past age.
   So does Okemah, where Guthrie was born in 1912 and where
the clocks seem to have stopped sometime around 1940. A gas
station still flies the old Sinclair dinosaur. There are no
parking meters, only one telephone exchange, and the nearest
stoplight is in the next county. At 10 a.m. it's 97 degrees
and the main street of storefronts is deserted. A man is
vacuuming the lobby of the old Crystal Theater at 4th and
Broadway, where you can see "Opportunity Knocks" for $2. They
say Woody Guthrie used to sing here.
   If he came back today, he'd probably feel right at home.
His sister, Mary Jo, lives 20 miles southwest in Seminole.
The sidewalk at 510 Broadway still holds the inscription he
is said to have scratched into fresh cement at 15 ("1927
Woody"), and the Guthrie family plot lies in the cemetery
north of town.
   Cleda Brandon went to high school with Woody and still
lives in the house her grandmother bought in 1923. It sits on
concrete blocks over a crawl space on 5th Street. Ms.
Brandon, who has the pale, pudgy face of a Cabbage Patch Kid
with dark buttonlike eyes framed in a Brillo pad of gray
hair, likes talking about Woody, whom she hasn't seen since
1928.
   Was he a Communist? "Oh I don't know," she says in a
birdlike voice. "I just remember him as a poor little boy."
   Barton Webb, 62, doesn't see it that way. A former Marine
tech sergeant who served in World War II and Korea, he flies
the American flag 24 hours a day over the Webb Funeral Home
on the west edge of town. For 30 years he's made it his
business to stop any city council votes honoring Woody
Guthrie.
   When he was elected to the five-person council in 1985,
his views acquired the authority of public office. "A lot of
these ol' boys make Woody Guthrie out a hero," he said
recently while relaxing in his back yard. "He was no hero. He
was a damn communist bum who never even served in the armed
forces. That doesn't sit well with the majority here. But you
got a couple of new teachers, and they come in here and push
this hero stuff. They're dupes, ignorant fools. And hell,
none of them's ever been in the service."
   Last year Mike Hagy, 29, a former Okemah schoolteacher who
had turned to selling forklifts, got tired of Mr. Webb's
talk. "He's a good man, but I resented him walking around in
a pompous, flag-waving manner as if God had christened him
with special knowledge about Americanism."
   When he learned Mr. Webb was pushing the council to remove
the words "Home of Woody Guthrie" from the town water tower
facing I-40 from 8th Street, he decided to run for Mr. Webb's
seat in the next election.
   "Webb was making Okemah look stupid," he said. "Across the
country Woody Guthrie is a respected folk hero who's been
honored by presidents. And here we are in the town where he
was born squabbling over whether he was a communist or not.
How can anyone who wrote `This Land Is Your Land' be
un-American?"
   Mr. Webb can answer that one, thank you. "You know what
that song's about, don't you?" he says. "He resented big land
owners; thought land should all be redistributed and given
away. That's socialist, plain and simple. Wake up. He even
stole the tune from someone else. He's not even worth talking
about."
   During the years when the Great Guthrie Debate hung on
whether he was actually a communist or not, those who
supported the folk singer had one nasty problem. Mr. Webb was
substantially correct. Joe Klein's biography, "Woody Guthrie:
A Life" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1980), which both sides accept,
leaves no doubt that Guthrie was, if not a dues-paying party
drone, at least a communist by spirit and conviction. Maybe
he even was a bum by some definitions, though in the dogma of
the old left a bum was a kind of noble proletarian savage.
And, yes, the tune to "This Land" was indeed "stolen" from a
Baptist hymn called "Oh My Lovin' Brother," though such
borrowing was a common practice in folk music, where oral
traditions outweighed copyright legalisms.
   Yet, with most of the facts on Mr. Webb's side (Guthrie
did serve in the Army in 1945), his water-tower motion died
last year for lack of a second, and he lost his council seat
to Mr. Hagy, 672 to 230. But he insists the majority of
people still support him. "They just didn't want to get
involved."
   Mr. Hagy thinks something more fundamental has happened.
"After years of arguing over Woody's politics," he said
recently, "it suddenly didn't seem to make any difference any
more. Who really cares what he was at this point? It's his
music that counts."
   For an unreconstructed cold warrior like Mr. Webb, this
was an ill wind. One can fight a war without a god any time,
but never without a devil.
   Is any of this worth writing about today? I think yes.
Because historians with an eye for the arcane may one day
note that here on July 14, 1990, an age in America finally
went from a pin-light spot to black. As the East Germans sell
off chips of the Berlin Wall to tourists at a nice profit, we
may have witnessed in Okemah the final murmur of
international communism as a live issue in an American
election.
   Behind it lay a battlefield of cold-war artifacts --
Woodstocks, microfilms, pumpkins, loyalty oaths and a
yellowed thesaurus of campaign buzzwords: egghead, dupe,
fellow traveler, card carrying. Now in Okemah it all seems to
be sliding into history, not with a bang, but a hootenanny
this Saturday in the Crystal Theater with Larry Long and
Fiddlin' Pete.
   And when Mr. Hagy soon moves to rename Broadway Guthrie
Boulevard, odds are good the motion will pass.

   Enterprise:
   Cable Entrepreneurs Take On Entrenched Competitors

   Changes in Attitudes and Technology
   Play Role in Sacramento Fight

   Entrepreneurs eager to take on a highly entrenched
competitor might look at the cable TV business in Sacramento,
Calif.
   Several years ago, two businessmen there tried and failed
to get permission from local government to build a system to
compete with the officially anointed cable operator. So they
went to court, and the lawsuits flew. As one local regulator
put it, Sacramento became "the cable-television litigation
capital of the world."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two entrepreneurs now have their competing system
running, though with unexpected twists. For one thing, they
survived partly by switching technology. Today, their system
has very little cable; it relies, instead, on an over-the-air
microwave transmission system known as "wireless cable." And
local government, which fought so hard to keep them out, is
now cheering the entrepreneurs on.
   With much of the nation wired for cable television and
major markets dominated by media giants, the cable industry
would hardly seem to be a place for would-be entrepreneurs to
play. Yet as the Sacramento example illustrates, evolving
technology and changing attitudes by local governments may be
making the cable business a more hospitable and lucrative
place for the little guy to compete.
   Traditionally, local governments have given out exclusive
franchises to individual cable companies and fought fiercely
to protect those monopolies from would-be competitors.
Defenders of this approach argue that cable television, like
utility service, is a natural monopoly with capital costs too
great to support more than one system. They note that in a
number of competitive situations where a second cable system
was actually built, one company ended up buying the other.
   But local government support for competition in the cable
industry is growing, partly because of dissatisfaction with
rising prices and poor service. In Huntsville, Ala., for
instance, competition between two cable companies has driven
down the price for some program services to half of what is
being charged in surrounding communities and in some cases
below the wholesale cost of the service itself, says William
G. Jackson, president of Cable America Corp, one of the
competitors. As a result, adds Mr. Jackson, "we are getting
invited into a lot of other cities."
   By contrast, when Sacramento real-estate developers Joseph
Benvenuti and D. Bruce Fite formed Pacific West Cable in the
early 1980s, local government officials did all they could to
invite the two entrepreneurs out of the cable business. The
city and county gave an exclusive franchise to Sacramento
Cable Television Co., which is a subsidiary of
Cincinnati-based media giant E.W. Scripps Co.
   Up to 5% of Sacramento Cable is owned by several dozen
prominent local citizens, who each put up $2,000 for shares
that are worth many times that today, says Richard Esposto,
executive director of the Sacramento Metropolitan Cable
Television Commission, the local regulatory body. Giving
ownership chunks of a franchise for little or no money to
politically powerful local citizens has been a common
practice in the cable industry.
   Cable companies have often paid governments dearly for
exclusive franchises, which in recent years have also been
largely free of rate regulation. Besides annual franchise
fees, Sacramento Cable promised to financially support public
access channels to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars a
month. (It didn't have to keep the promise after competitors
were let in.)
   From the beginning, Pacific West refused to make such
offers, says Pacific West's chairman, James Kirschman. "We
felt the city was just using the franchise system to get
companies to pay for things they didn't have money for," he
says.
   After its application was turned down in 1983, Pacific
West filed suit in federal court in Sacramento, claiming,
among other things, that local government was abridging its
free-speech rights. In 1987, a jury agreed and found that the
government's arguments in favor of just one cable operator
were a "sham" designed to increase payments to local
government and campaign contributions to local politicians.
   After that, Pacific West was given a license to start
building a competing system, as was Cable America, which had
also filed an application. Then new problems started.
   Both companies say that as soon as they started installing
their cables, Sacramento Cable began cutting prices in those
areas, while maintaining them elsewhere. Mr. Jackson, the
Cable America president, recalls talking to one customer who
had just signed up for free service from Sacramento Cable.
"He said he would take free service from us, too, and then
cancel the first company that sent him a bill," recalls Mr.
Jackson.
   Cable America eventually sold its Sacramento system to the
Scripps subsidiary. "We couldn't compete," Mr. Jackson says.
   Pacific West says it couldn't compete either. In 1988 it
filed a suit, still pending, in Sacramento federal court that
charges Sacramento Cable with "predatory pricing." Besides
low prices, Sacramento Cable offered such sign-up inducements
as free television sets, says Pacific West's Mr. Kirschman.
   John Moorhead, an attorney for Sacramento Cable, says that
like other businesses his client has a right to set
competitive prices. He adds that all of Sacramento Cable's
pricing actions have been "fair and equitable" and that the
company plans to vigorously defend itself against the Pacific
West lawsuit. He says that at most a handful of free
television sets were offered.
   Besides going back to court, Pacific West turned to a
different technology by merging last year with an
Illinois-based wireless cable company. With wireless cable,
Pacific West simply puts up a small antenna at the customer's
home.
   Though Pacific West's customer base of 5,000 subscribers
is still dwarfed by the 180,000 signed up with Sacramento
Cable, Pacific West is beginning to have an impact, says Mr.
Esposto, the cable commission chairman. Consumers are using
the threat of switching cable companies to get better service
and prices, he says. "Pacific West has gone from being a foe
to a friend. Its presence has been very, very useful."

   Greenspan Supports Move
   Requiring Budget Balance

   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan told a House panel that America's fiscal problems
have become so severe that he reluctantly supports a
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget.
   In 1979, as a private economist, Mr. Greenspan testified
against a proposal for a balanced-budget amendment. "At the
time, I was skeptical it could work," he said. But now, he
told the House Judiciary Committee yesterday: "The crucial
issue that I think creates the desire for a balance-budget
amendment is the bias that clearly exists in our system
toward deficits."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The "very serious gridlock" Congress and administration
officials have encountered in trying to reduce the country's
massive budget deficit during the past few years, Mr.
Greenspan said, "suggests there is something in our system
that needs to be redressed, and I'd say regrettably by
constitutional means."
   Mr. Greenspan didn't endorse a specific amendment but did
recommend a provision requiring more than a majority vote in
Congress to pass spending bills. He emphasized that he was
expressing his personal views and not those of the Fed.

   Mainframes vs. PCs:

   Your May 23 page-one story "Data Switch: PC Networks Begin
to Oust Mainframes in Some Companies" is short on examples.
You begin with a discussion of an IBM 3090 system valued at
$3 million being replaced by PCs, make vague references to
$20 million mainframes (that apparently are not being
replaced by PCs), and immediately segue to an IBM 4300 and a
12-year-old Honeywell machine (the power of which probably
today resides in a single PC). In fact, you cite just four
companies that have replaced mainframes with PCs, and even
your references to such major corporations as AT&amp;T and Baxter
indicate that only "some" of the work performed by mainframes
is now being done by PCs. Moreover, despite acknowledgments
regarding the limitations of PCs, the article, of course,
still includes the usual "mainframe is dead" comments.
   Gulliver being felled by the Lilliputians may appeal to
the imagination, but it has little to do with what is
happening in the computer business. Although industries such
as airlines, insurance and banking are replete with examples
showing that large 3090 systems and the data bases that
reside on those systems have generated a need for thousands
of personal computers, there are few examples, if any, of PCs
having replaced the mainframes involved.

   Well, which is it? Are networked PCs going to vanquish
mainframes? Or are mainframes going to replace stock-fund
pros? Two of your stories on May 23 suggest both scenarios
are possible. In addition to the page-one story, there's
"Swapping Your Mutual Fund Manager for a Mainframe" in your
Money &amp; Investing section.
   Confusion over the role that mainframe computers are
playing in large corporations and institutions is evident.
The people with the clearest idea of what mainframes and, for
that matter, networked PCs will do in the future are
customers of such computing platforms.
   In our recent survey of more than 3,000 such customers in
North America, they indicate that most new applications of
information technology within their enterprises continue to
be implemented on mainframes. They do say, however, that a
growing number of office-related functions are, indeed, being
performed by networks of desktop systems. They also believe
that PCs are far more likely to increase the workload of
their mainframe systems than to decrease it.
   These customers, by the way, hardly feel threatened by
networked PCs. Most embrace them as a means of distributing
computer power throughout their organizations.

   Orange Day -- No Irish Should Be Celebrating

   In Ireland today the 300th anniversary of the Battle of
the Boyne is being celebrated. Orangemen in bright orange
sashes will march through Ulster, accompanied by drummerboys
beating drums with rattan canes. Paul Blanshard, an American
observer of Irish politics, noted 30 years ago that the
Orange drums "are often beaten so ardently by champion
drummers that blood from wounded wrists flows over the
surface."
   Violence between Catholic and Protestant Irish has often
marked the anniversary of the battle -- known as Orange Day
after William of Orange, its winner. Protestant Orangemen
used to celebrate the Boyne in New York City, but Irish
Catholic rowdies, with the acquiescence of passive
Irish-Catholic cops, brought the Protestant celebrations to a
stop. An Orange march in New York in 1870 was attacked by a
Catholic mob as police stood idly by. In 1871, 33 persons
were killed and 101 wounded on July 12. Since 1871, the only
Irish parade on Fifth Avenue has been St. Patrick's Day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though now forgotten in America, the Boyne is still
remembered in Ulster. Thousands of Orangemen march through
the streets during "marching season" to commemorate what they
imagine to have been their glorious victory. But the
Ulstermen are wrong -- the Boyne was no more their victory
than it was the Irish Catholics'. The truth of the Boyne, Alf
McCreary, a Northern Irish journalist, wrote in May, "like so
much else in Irish history, is buried in the myth. And the
tragedy of Ireland is that myths are much more dangerous and
potent than the truth."
   In the folklore of Protestant Ireland, July 12 is the day
"when William of Orange, and our immortal forefathers,
overthrew the Pope and Popery at the Boyne. Then began the
era of civil and religious liberty." Catholic Irish believe
exactly the opposite. But actually, the Boyne was a struggle
between two non-Irish chieftains for control of the English
throne: the Calvinist Dutchman, William of Orange, who had
been installed as king a year and a half before in the
Glorious Revolution of 1688 and his Catholic father-in-law,
James II, who had been deposed in that revolution.
   Nor were the armies that did the fighting any more Irish.
William assembled a strange coalition of Dutchmen, Danes,
Germans, Swiss, Italians, Norwegians and disaffected French
Hugenots. (He shrewdly brought very few English troops.)
William's only Irish soldiers were a few ragged, fierce,
independent regiments of Scottish settlers from Londonderry.
James's army, less polyglot, was made up of professional
French soldiers borrowed from Louis XIV and some southern
Irish recruits, many of whom scarcely knew how to load a
rifle, much less how to shoot.
   Foreign troops were involved because the Boyne was a
skirmish in the long, extensive war between Louis XIV's
France and the rest of Europe, a war that lasted -- with
pauses -- from 1689 until 1714. Behind William stood a
non-sectarian alliance of Catholic Austria and Spain and
Protestant Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Behind James,
stood Louis.
   So when news of William's victory reached Europe, the
Catholic states of Austria and Spain "went into wild
rejoicing for William's victory," according to Peter
Berresford Ellis's "The Boyne Water." Te Deums were sung in
cathedrals. It is even said that Pope Innocent XI helped to
finance William's army.
   Catholic Europe was celebrating William's victory because
it meant that England would enter the war on the side of the
anti-Louis coalition. Nobody imagined that the Boyne
represented the triumph of Ulster-style Protestantism in
Ireland -- because it didn't. True, the Catholic religion was
savagely persecuted after William's victory. But so was
Ulster's Presbyterianism. In the "new era of religious
freedom," a Presbyterian minister was subject to three months
in jail for delivering a sermon and a huge fine of 100 pounds
for celebrating the Lord's Supper. In 1704, an Act of
Parliament excluded Presbyterians from office in the law,
army, navy, customs or municipal employment. Presbyterian
ministers were prohibited from teaching children.
Intermarriage between Presbyterians and Anglicans was
illegal.
   Religious oppression caused large numbers of Scots-Irish
to emigrate to North America in the early 18th Century,
chiefly to New England and Virginia. Ulstermen played a
decisive role in American colonial revolt against British
rule. Irish Protestants, not Irish Catholics, began the Irish
diaspora. Presbyterian Scots-Irish pressed for the separation
of church and state in the U.S. Constitution, in part to
ensure that the Anglican Church not become the state religion
of the U.S.
   A victory by James would have been no more rewarding for
Irish Catholics. No love was lost between James and the
Irish. He abandoned the Irish troops who served under him at
the Boyne, and blamed them for his defeat. A tale circulated
that when he arrived in Dublin after the battle he grimly
greeted the wife of one of his Irish officers with the
remark, "Your countrymen, madam, can run well." She replied:
"Not so well as Your Majesty, for I see you won the race."
The Irish knew James had no interest in Ireland other than as
a way-station on his return to England. For months after
James fled with his French troops, Catholic Irish troops
resisted the Williamites. To those bold hold-outs, James
became known as Seamus an Chaca, James the Dunghead.
   The centuries-long agonies of Northern Ireland have long
puzzled outsiders. But today, as continental Europeans try to
forget their long, conflict-ridden past, the deep, abiding
hatreds between Irish Protestants and Catholics seem more
incongruous than ever. This 300th Orange Day could be an
occasion for the Irish to dispel the myths that fuel their
animosities.
   But this debunking probably won't happen. This year's
Orange Day will be celebrated with more than usual vigor. The
Orange Lodge wanted to hold a religious service on the
original battlesite in southern Ireland. The plan failed when
the farmers who own the field asked 50,000 pounds ($91,000)
in rent and parking fees, plus hefty insurance. The price was
denounced as extortion by the lodge, by the leftist Farmer
Workers' Party and by Brendan McMahon, a member of the Fine
Gael Anti-Communist League in Southern Ireland. But then, the
Boyne always has inspired strange political alliances.

   Liquidation Sought
   By 3 Bondholders

   HOUSTON -- General Homes Corp. said three bondholders
filed a petition with a Houston court to force the company
into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
   The home builder, which stopped making interest payments
on its 12% subordinated notes due in 1998 2 1/2 years ago,
said the bondholders are seeking to force the company to
liquidate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among the bondholders filing the petition in the Houston
federal Bankruptcy Court is veteran investor Stanford Phelps
of S.N. Phelps &amp; Co., a Greenwich, Conn., bond broker. In a
similar move last year, Mr. Phelps forced MCorp, a
Dallas-based bank holding company, into seeking the
protection of the court after he purchased $2 million of
MCorp's distressed debt at a hefty discount and threatened
the banking concern with an involuntary petition.
   In the General Homes petition, Mr. Phelps demanded that he
and a business associate be placed on the company's board. "I
don't think those boys know how to turn the company around,"
Mr. Phelps said, referring to General Homes' current
management team. "We're just trying to fix their mess."
   For more than two years, General Homes has been trying to
restructure about $250 million in senior debt and $140
million in subordinated debt. Offers to exchange two issues
of subordinated notes for convertible preferred stock failed
this spring. Since then, the company said it has been
negotiating with its lenders, including Citibank, to avoid
filing for protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws.
   W.A. Le Sage, General Homes president, said the company
plans to pursue an out-of-court settlement. "It is my
understanding that senior bank lenders and shareholders
prefer to work this out outside bankruptcy courts," he said.
   Analysts say that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing would be
costly and could scare off both customers and suppliers, a
move that could "wipe out the company," said analyst Kevin J.
McCabe of R.D. Smith &amp; Co. Under Chapter 11, the company
continues to operate under court protection while it devises
a plan to repay creditors.
   But Mr. Phelps isn't likely to go away quietly. "Stan
Phelps is very rigid," said analyst Kenneth Campbell of
Montvale, N.J.-based Audit Investments Inc. "His style is
simple: Buy cheap bonds and rattle the cage of management
until he makes a good profit. They either buy him out to shut
him up or put him on the board."
   Mr. Le Sage, meantime, insisted that the company wouldn't
give in to Mr. Phelps's demands. "This guy swoops into town
and threatens our company with all sorts of demands and
threatens to throw us in the can," Mr. Le Sage said. "We told
him our people don't react well to blackmail."

   Older Readers Prove Elusive as Magazines
   Rethink Strategies for the `Mature Market'

   Just three years from now, Mick Jagger will be 50, making
the rock star an eligible subject for the one magazine whose
cover he probably never expected to appear on: Modern
Maturity.
   As unlikely as that prospect may seem, it points up the
biggest miscalculation made by a raft of new magazines aimed
at the so-called mature market, ad industry jargon for people
over 50. The Rolling Stones and their generation may be
hitting the half-century mark, but that doesn't mean they are
ready to start reading magazines that remind them of it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Advertising Age magazine picked mature-market magazines
one of 10 top "categories to watch" in 1989. But after
several new entries stalled and some failed outright, the
prospects don't look bright for national magazines that
target older readers, particularly with the current
industrywide advertising slump. Moxie, a magazine for older
working women, was shelved just last week.
   There are success stories in the category, in particular
Modern Maturity, but its success is in part due to an unusual
subscription system that keeps circulation high.
   "The jury is out on whether we need magazines for the
mature market" at all, says Ken Dychtwald of Age Wave Inc.,
who has worked as a consultant to publishers.
   The demographics that first drew many publishers to the
category remain enticing. According to research from Age Wave
and major advertising agencies, people over 50 account for
26% of the population and will reach about 30% by the year
2000. The age group controls about 50% of U.S. discretionary
income and 77% of U.S. household financial assets. The group
will grow three times faster than the under-50 market through
the turn of the century, and will be the best educated and
most affluent generation in the country's history.
   Rather than abandon such a potentially lucrative market
altogether, publishers are rethinking their strategies for
tapping into it. There is no agreement on a sure-fire formula
for mature-market magazines, but two rules apply: keep the
editorial matter upbeat and never ever refer to age in the
title. There's good reason why magazine titles such as
"Grandparents" and "50 Plus" have been put to rest.
   Weider Health &amp; Fitness Corp.'s Moxie was shut down even
though it had met performance forecasts. Moxie, which
targeted older working women, was closed last week after only
10 months. The magazine was ahead of budget on advertising
pages, but Michael Carr, Weider executive vice president,
says it "strayed" from the company's focus of health and
fitness.
   Weider, publisher of Shape, Flex, and Men's Fitness, says
it will relaunch Moxie in six months with a focus on health
and fitness. The mature market is "still a great market with
lots of possibilities," Mr. Carr says.
   "Most of us look in the mirror and see someone 15 years
younger than our calendar years," said Richard Fontana,
publisher of Reader's Digest Association Inc.'s New Choices
magazine. "That's why this group needs to be sold more
aggressively then any group in the country today."
   So far, Reader's Digest is the largest group publisher to
step into the field with its acquisition of 50 Plus magazine
in 1988. Reader's Digest revamped the magazine and renamed it
New Choices. Circulation has grown to 600,000, an increase of
16.6% in 1989, but advertising pages are expected to be flat
this year.
   According to a 1990 Mediamark Research Inc. study,
magazines aimed at mature readers don't even make their lists
of priority reading. In the 55- to 59-year-old age range, for
example, computer magazines were the most often read,
followed by automotive, metropolitan/entertainment, science,
and men's categories. The 60- to 64-year-olds preferred
boating magazines, followed by women's fashions, crafts, and
airline magazines.
   One publisher, Family Media Inc., hopes it has found a
mature-market magazine that will make it onto the
reading-priority list by appealing to older readers
interested in health and science. This month, it launched
Breakthroughs in Health and Science, a revamping of the
defunct Science Digest.
   "People buy magazines that feed their interests rather
than to feed an age interest," says James A. Autry, magazine
group president of Meredith Corp. "We've done our research
and it doesn't lead to the compelling conclusion that we
should start our own magazine just for that group." The Des
Moines, Iowa, media company shut down Grandparents after just
a year, but now publishes Mature Outlook magazine for Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co. as part of a discount club.
   Mature-market magazines have been stymied by a seeming
lack of interest by advertisers and a dearth of new products
meant for an older audience. Manufacturers and national
advertisers still largely focus on young families, or
consumers in the 24- to 45-year-old range. "For now, the
marketing money is concentrated on the young households,"
says Beth Rockwood, media group planning director, Young &amp;
Rubicam. "There is lots of talk about the mature market as a
niche, but not a lot being done."
   Over the past few years, Second Wind (for older couples)
was stranded by investors after a single issue. Renaissance
(for "preferred" bank customers) and Lifewise (a health
magazine) never made it past the prototype stage.
   Even Lear's, the brainchild of Frances Lear, who pioneered
magazines for older women, is facing some trouble. After a
fast start in 1988, Ms. Lear in early June laid off 25
editorial staffers, and said, through a spokesman, that she
is looking for partners for her magazine company.
   With ad pages projected as flat for the year, the magazine
that once proudly billed itself "for the woman who wasn't
born yesterday" has revised its focus from women over 40 to
women over 35, reasoning that "the women seeking change are
now younger than before," according to Ms. Lear. To boost
newsstand sales, Lear's is redesigning its covers to feature
celebrities, such as Carol Burnett and Anne Bancroft.
   The heavyweight of the mature-market magazine field is
Modern Maturity, published by the American Association of
Retired Persons. With a paid circulation of 21.4 million, it
is the leading paid-circulation magazine in the country. But
the nonprofit AARP charges a mere $2.40 annual subscription
rate as part of its membership package, almost guaranteeing a
mammoth circulation.
   Modern Maturity has set the tone for virtually all
mature-market magazines. Its personality profiles and
features are relentlessly upbeat. It doesn't shy away from
dealing with the issues of age, but virtually all subjects
are portrayed as active, optimistic, and energetic. A recent
story on volunteers: "Everyday heroes; they're helping
reshape America."
   "We don't `down' anybody," says Robert E. Wood, publishing
director of Modern Maturity. The magazine turns away ads that
have "a downer attitude," says Mr. Wood: an ad for a pain
reliever that shows someone wincing in pain, for example, or
those for wheelchairs and crutches. Mr. Wood says that, were
the magazine to accept all these ads, revenue could increase
by a third.
   At least one other publication in the field, Golden Years,
also benefits from an unusual subscription system. Once a
small giveaway magazine for Florida's Brevard County, Golden
Years has expanded to national distribution. Published by
Golden Years Senior News Inc., Golden Years' circulation has
reached 450,000, of which 310,000 copies are paid
subscriptions. About 100,000 are "qualified requested,"
(targeted readers who have asked to receive the magazine but
don't pay for it). Another 40,000 copies go to waiting rooms
at doctors' offices.
   Some publishers are simply sitting out the senior
sweepstakes, relying on existing publications to draw an
ever-aging readership. At Time Warner Inc.'s magazine group,
for example, the average reader of In Health (a spinoff of
Hippocrates magazine) is 46.6 years old, while the average
ages of readers of Cooking Light, Sunset and Southern Living,
are all around 45.
   "There won't be one big magazine for this group," says S.
Christopher Meigher III, executive vice president of Time
Inc. Magazines. "There is fragmentation, and the biggest
mistake would be to treat their interests as being the same."
   But the day when marketers pay closer attention to the
older consumer is simply inevitable, according to some ad
agency executives and marketing consultants. "As the baby
boomers get older, they are taking the wealth with them,"
says Age Wave's Mr. Dychtwald. "And every single publication
will have to ask, `Do we track the boomers past 50, or do we
stick with the youth market?'"

   Five Persian Gulf oil ministers urged the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to freeze its output ceiling in
an effort to push the average price of its basket of crudes
to at least $18 a barrel from the current $14.
   Meeting in Saudi Arabia, the five Persian Gulf members of
OPEC said in a statement that the recent erosion of oil
prices necessitated a "strict, practical and immediate
commitment by all OPEC members to the production ceiling set
out in the November 1989 accord, which is to be maintained
until prices rise to an acceptable level."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some oil analysts promptly labeled the statement a
"blueprint" for the midyear OPEC conference beginning July 25
in Geneva. The statement also affected oil and stock markets.
Oil prices rose again, and prices of oil company shares
increased in trading on U.S. markets.
   The November agreement called for a production ceiling of
22.1 million barrels a day. But largely because of
overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, actual
output is running at least a million barrels a day more than
that. This has contributed to a world oil glut and helped
depress petroleum prices by one-third.
   Ministers from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
participated in the meeting along with their counterparts
from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Qatar. Without being more
specific, the joint statement suggested Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates would cooperate with OPEC output curbs.
   Although oil analysts credited some other factors besides
the Saudi meeting, prices of North Sea crudes reacted to the
news, rising 15 cents to 30 cents a barrel in European spot
markets. In heavy U.S. futures trading, crude oil for August
delivery closed higher for the third straight day, rising 53
cents a barrel to settle at $17.47. For the second day in a
row, several U.S. refiners increased field postings for West
Texas Intermediate crude by 50 cents a barrel.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Unocal Corp.
was particulary active among oil issues, rising $1.50 to
$27.75 on a volume of 1.6 million shares. Other advancing
issues included Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp., Texaco Inc.,
Mobil Corp. and Amoco Corp. Among oil field-services
concerns, Baker Hughes Inc., Schlumberger Ltd., Halliburton
Co. and Rowan Cos. all posted gains.
   The meeting of the five ministers followed a pattern. The
Persian Gulf group, holding most of the world's spare
oil-producing capacity, usually gets together just before an
OPEC conference. But oil economists saw this meeting as being
particularly significant, with President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia clearly taking a stronger
hand in OPEC affairs.
   "In my mind, the real OPEC meeting just concluded," said
Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   Whatever influence the group of five may have on the eight
other OPEC members, industry officials saw nothing
controversial in the proposals. "This is a very positive
development," said a senior OPEC delegate from a country
outside the Persian Gulf.
   Most of OPEC's 13 members, except for Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates, have kept higher petroleum prices
rather than expanded production as their top priority all
along. That is because many are already producing at
capacity, and the price declines this year have cut deeply
into their revenues. Yesterday, for example, Iraq officially
endorsed a proposal by Iran to cooperate with its former
enemy in pressing for an oil price of $25 a barrel.
   "For the first time now, all of them are singing the same
song," said Antonio M. Szabo, president of the management
science division of Bonner &amp; Moore Consultants.
   It wasn't immediately clear how the other Persian Gulf
countries would handle the situation with the United Arab
Emirates, which refuses to accept its OPEC quota of 1.1
million barrels a day. But there were hints that others could
reduce their quotas slightly to give more leeway to the
United Arab Emirates or raise the ceiling, if necessary.
   Oil analysts speculated that if the ceiling were raised by
400,000 barrels a day, to 22.5 million, the United Arab
Emirates would have a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day and
parity with Kuwait. The analysts suggested that in return the
United Arab Emirates would trim its actual output from two
million barrels a day to 1.8 million. Kuwait also would
reduce its production from the current 1.7 million. That
would mean total OPEC output could drop below 23 million.
   The statement from the ministers wasn't specific on this
matter, but it did say that the "forthcoming ministerial
meeting should not increase the current OPEC ceiling unless a
figure can be agreed that involves all 13 members, including
the United Arab Emirates." Also, the statement said, "a study
was undertaken to guarantee the UAE's return to the agreement
and {to ensure} that it abides by what it is allocated. It is
hoped that this issue will be resolved during the next few
days."

   Newspaper headlines and the evening news told daily
stories of extraordinary events as my wife and I drove south
toward home not long ago. Nelson Mandela strode triumphantly
across the United States. In Europe, where the train of
change is picking up speed at an almost geometrical rate,
NATO was refashioning itself and the Communist Party in the
Soviet Union was staring glumly at the results of its refusal
to do so.
   Along the way from northern Virginia to New Orleans, the
interstate highways took us through and around metropolitan
areas that are visible reminders of why Virginia, North
Carolina, Georgia and Florida will be gaining more
representation in Congress after the census figures come in.
There's no more need to predict a "New South" in those
places. The old debates are irrelevant, overtaken by events.
In virtually every way that matters, for good and for bad,
these are American centers of thriving commerce and industry
now, not idiosyncratic provincial curiosities. A stranger led
blindfolded into Charlotte, N.C., and then set free would be
hard pressed to say whether he was in the North, South, East
or West. What he would know was that he was in the middle of
a prosperous, attractive city where a person could make and
live a good life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the view from the interstates is, like the view of
Europe on the evening news, misleading. There is more to the
"New South" than what the Piedmont around Charlotte might
suggest, just as there is more to the prognosis for central
Europe than Vaclav Havel's prophetic moral grandeur, more to
the possibilities for peaceful transition in South Africa
than Mr. Mandela's resolute courage. We do not live in a
fairy-tale world, in which everyone lives happily ever after.
Nor is human behavior akin to a chemical reaction in which a
radically new thing is instantaneously produced from
combining disparate elements. Away from the interstates lie
complexity, difficulty, intractable legacies of the past and,
frequently, despair.
   All of which struck me with particular force when I
decided to take a one-day drive through my old home area, the
Mississippi-Yazoo Delta, after we had stopped in Jackson to
see our newest grandchild. It was a familiar drive, one I
must have taken hundreds of times before moving to Washington
in 1977, but it was a new experience just the same. For one
thing, many of the communities through which it was once
necessary to navigate are now bypassed, so that it is
possible to drive for seemingly endless miles through the
flat fields without actually seeing many buildings or people.
It is an eerie experience, particularly for the returning
native. It may help explain why so many still wave as they
pass by.
   For another, 13 years is 13 years, and memory plays
tricks. Which is why I decided that sticking to the highways,
none of which are interstates in the Delta, wasn't the way to
go. Attempting to recapture the past along the roads from
Jackson to Greenville, my hometown, I left the main
thoroughfares wherever possible and went into the towns and
hamlets sprinkled along U.S. Highways 49 and 61 and State
Highway 1. The names were familiar. Many of the sights were
not.
   It would not be true to say that what I saw there shocked
me, at least not intellectually. The Delta has always been a
place of immense poverty topped by a sprinkling of affluence.
What is more, much has been written recently about the
depressed state of the area's economy.
   It was profoundly depressing nonetheless. The picture was
almost unrelievedly dismal. What were small towns to begin
with are now nearly ghost towns, many of the old one- and
two-story commercial buildings on their main streets boarded
up and little activity of any kind to be seen. If there is
growth in any of their futures, if in the most literal sense
they have a future, it is hard to know how and from what
source. The region is one of the nation's poorest, its people
-- predominantly black -- among the nation's least educated,
its economy still tied to agricultural staples requiring
large-scale cultivation and heavy mechanization.
   The larger towns, such as Greenville and Greenwood,
obviously aren't going away, and there are signs of hope in
several other places as well, but overall this is a place
that makes a mockery of the concept of Sunbelt prosperity. A
new commission was recently created to study the multistate
Delta region's problems and recommend solutions, which is a
fine idea but hardly a new one. Its recommendations probably
won't be new either. Among the obvious, vastly improved
public education, diversified industry, better use of the
fertile land, a public welfare and health system that
actually reaches the needy.
   All of which would cost large sums of money, and money is
not something Mississippi has in large supply. Whether and
how to tap what it does have is an issue that has sharply
divided its aggressive governor, Ray Mabus, and a legislature
itself divided between Old Guard and New. The result recently
was legislative stalemate, at least temporarily blocking his
ambitious educational-reform program.
   But Mississippi and its Delta, while poor, are not unique
in the South. Rural poverty is the nation's worst poverty,
and the South even now ranks only behind the Rocky Mountain
States when it comes to the percentage of people living in
rural areas. The result is that there is not a single
Southern state that does not have pockets of severe
deprivation, reminders of the region-wide South that once
was. Just the other day, the New York Times rediscovered
eastern North Carolina's economic distress and the state's
split personality along class lines when it comes to the
delivery of education, health and housing. Louisiana, whose
legislature has spent several months trying to be as
retrograde as the ones that once fashioned massive resistance
to desegregation, is still in an economic black hole. New
Orleans, "the city care forgot," is a city that prosperity
long since abandoned.
   Get off the beaten track almost anywhere in the region and
you find the same thing. The communities you encounter are
clearly going nowhere. Life is a marginal experience for
many, if not most of their inhabitants. It's the way the
South once was for virtually everyone, back before World War
II. It's a reality that has nothing to do with the booming
South of tourist brochures and urban glitter.
   None of this is written to cause unhappiness or anger back
home, but as a reminder of unfinished business. There is a
temptation, which for most of the 1980s became policy in
Washington, to pretend that none of the old domestic problems
exist. Just as wildly premature triumphalism in the wake of
communism's collapse has led some Americans to advocate
withdrawal from overseas commitments, uneven prosperity and
"New South" imagery have led others to write off any sense of
obligation to the places and people left behind. But they
still exist, victims of forces over which they have little or
no control as surely as Americans were once victims of the
Great Depression. As with the central Europeans, there is
much that the people on the ground must do for themselves. As
with central Europe, few of the most critically depressed
areas have enough resources or expertise to do it alone.

   Taiwan's Brokerage Industry Faces
   A Shakeout as Stock Prices Plummet

   A five-month plunge in Taiwan's stock prices is putting
pressure on the country's securities companies, and brokers
say many of the firms could be out of business by year end.
   The first victim was Chao Chuen Securities Co., which
closed Tuesday. Brokers in Taipei say the small firm was
plagued by internal problems and its closure isn't likely in
itself to drag down other firms.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, Taiwan has fewer than 200 traded stocks and, with
the closing of Chao Chuen, 357 securities companies,
according to authorities in Taipei. With trading volume down
more than 50% from the high levels earlier this year, the
market can no longer support so many firms, brokers say.
   "Without a doubt, Chao Chuen is really the first of many
to come, but it's not the domino that will cause the others
to go," says Peter Kurz, head of the Taiwan office of Baring
Brothers &amp; Co.
   Taiwan has some of the lowest trading commissions in the
world and some of the highest overhead costs. As individual
investors have swarmed into the market in recent years, the
number of securities companies vying for customers also has
soared, rising to the current 357 from only 27 in May 1988,
when the government lifted a long freeze on new brokerage
houses.
   Customer defaults and trading losses already have taken a
toll on securities companies. And now, as volume continues to
shrink, some may call it quits and others may collapse.
   Still, Taiwan survived a shakeout in the securities
industry in the early 1970s. However difficult the coming
upheaval may be, brokers believe a loss of many firms would
leave the industry leaner and better able to cope with a
developing market.
   Taiwan's weighted stock index has dropped more than 60%
since its high point in February. It fell 6.3% yesterday.
   Government regulations requiring each company to have a
trading floor and special equipment, and to carry out its own
stock settlements, keep overhead sky-high. Those expenses may
be too much for some of the smaller firms.
   An additional complication is the fact that a large
percentage of stock transactions was funded by gray-market
margin lending, which isn't regulated by the government and
may not be backed by adequate capital.
   In addition, some securities firms did their own margin
lending for stock transactions. To compete for customers
during the run-up in prices last year, many companies offered
loans and held about 30% of the shares as collateral. When
the market was booming, the system worked. Now, prices for
most of those shares are far below the purchase price and
customers have little incentive to pay off the loan. That
apparently is one of the problems that brought down Chao
Chuen, brokers say.

   CBS Profit Rose
   By 16% to Record
   In Second Quarter

   NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. posted a 16% increase in
second-quarter net income, helped by broadcasting the
National Basketball Association playoff and championship
games and by a drop in programming costs from a year earlier.
   The profit was a second-quarter record, but CBS said the
prospect for continued growth for the balance of the year was
"uncertain" amid a sluggish economy and increased costs for
rights to major sports events.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Profit rose to $138 million, or $5.36 a share, from $118.8
million, or $4.62 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7% to
$828.8 million from $771.8 million.
   CBS, the No. 3-rated network in prime time for the third
consecutive year, is gambling $3.6 billion over the next few
years on broadcast rights to big sports events, including
four-year major league baseball and football packages that
will begin this year. Each four-year deal is priced at $1.06
billion.
   CBS Broadcast Group, which includes the network, TV and
radio stations and news and sports divisions and is CBS's
only major subsidiary, posted a 31% gain in pretax operating
profit to $180.9 million from $137.9 million.
   Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president and chief executive
officer, said in a statement that the gain was because of
"improved" results at each of the three broadcast divisions,
the television network, television stations and radio. The
earnings at the television network, he said, were "enhanced"
by an expanded number of NBA playoff and championship games
and decreased entertainment programming costs related mainly
to the writers' strike which pushed costs into the second
quarter of 1989."
   The 1989 second quarter was unusual because of the
writers' strike, which resulted in a delay of the 1988-89
prime-time season. As a result, programming costs increased
in that quarter because the networks broadcast more original
programming than usual. Traditionally, the networks begin
airing series repeats in the second quarter.
   CBS's earnings "were much better than I expected," said
Jessica Rief, an analyst at First Boston Corp. Nevertheless,
Ms. Rief said she did not expect third and fourth quarter
results would meet year-earlier levels.
   Commenting on the frenzied one-week period when
advertisers buy commercial time in advance of the 1990-91
prime time season, Ms. Rief said, "CBS took in $100 million
less in up-front advertising this year compared to last year
and, let's face it, they're getting increasing competition
from Fox" Broadcasting Co. Fox, a unit of News Corp., is
increasing the number of nights it programs to five from
three in September.
   Moreover, Ms. Rief noted, the NBA, which helped CBS in the
second quarter, recently signed a deal to be broadcast on
National Broadcasting Co.'s network. NBC is a unit of General
Electric Co.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CBS
stock closed at $198.50 a share, up 62.5 cents.

   Anti-Crime Bill
   Wins Passage

   Measure Includes Provisions
   Aimed at Invigorating
   Probes of Thrift Fraud

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved a
wide-ranging anti-crime bill that includes a partial ban on
semiautomatic "assault weapons" and numerous provisions aimed
at invigorating the investigation and prosecution of
savings-and-loan fraud.
   The omnibus bill, which passed 94-6, also would expand the
federal death penalty to cover 34 crimes, curb the
constitutional appeals process for death-row inmates, and
provide $900 million in federal assistance to local
law-enforcement agencies in the coming fiscal year -- twice
the amount proposed by the Bush administration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eager to appear tough on the widespread looting of S&amp;Ls,
senators increased penalties for financial fraud, including a
new statute that would provide up to life imprisonment for
high-level thrift executives who conspire with three or more
other violators and derive more than $5 million from their
crimes. Other provisions would provide prosecutors with
broader authorization to use civil seizure and forfeiture
laws in bank and S&amp;L fraud cases.
   The Senate also authorized new spending of $162.5 million
for each of the next three years to hire more federal
investigators and prosecutors devoted strictly to
financial-institution cases. That amount would be in addition
to $50 million appropriated for such cases for the current
fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. In addition, the Senate
authorized funds to hire 2,500 new federal agents and 480
prosecutors to deal with drug trafficking and other crimes.
   The House is considering omnibus crime legislation of its
own, including various S&amp;L enforcement provisions. But it
isn't clear when the full House will vote on these measures.
Equally unclear is whether President Bush would back a crime
package that includes the Senate's three-year ban on nine
types of assault weapons.
   The Senate's rush to provide new money for thrift-fraud
prosecutions by the Justice Department came as the House
Appropriations Committee voted to give the Treasury
Department's Secret Service expanded authority to initiate
its own investigations of S&amp;L-related crimes. The provision
is attached to a fiscal 1991 bill funding the Treasury
Department and is likely to touch off a turf war with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, an arm of the Justice
Department that has tried to stop efforts by the Secret
Service to become more involved in reducing the current
backlog of thousands of cases.
   Reflecting an apparent decision by the White House, the
Treasury officially opposes the expanded authority. But
behind the scenes, the Secret Service has promised allies in
Congress that it can make as many as 100 agents available
immediately, and 300 within the next fiscal year.
   The Senate's election-year anti-crime package, which
seemed dead only several weeks ago, jumped back to life with
a high-voltage shock of S&amp;L rhetoric. "We need to be cracking
down on the orgy of fraud and lawbreaking that occurred in
the savings-and-loan crisis," said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D.,
Vt.). The hefty batch of thrift-fraud provisions was added to
the omnibus bill at the last minute, with almost no partisan
bickering.
   Last month, a filibuster orchestrated by the National
Rifle Association had threatened to kill the entire package.
But the powerful NRA repeatedly was unable to muster a
majority to eliminate the prohibition on assault weapons.
Meanwhile, quiet negotiations led by Sens. Joseph Biden (D.,
Del.) and Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.) kept the bill alive until
the almost desperate desire by lawmakers to take action on
the S&amp;L issue assured its passage.
   Many of the S&amp;L-related provisions added to the Senate
bill, such as the provision for life imprisonment for "S&amp;L
kingpins," appeared to be largely symbolic. Others included
those that merely formalize special thrift-fraud task forces
already created by the Justice Department.
   The crime bill also would facilitate speedier restitution
to victims of S&amp;L fraud, allow for public disclosure of
regulatory enforcement actions, and permit the government to
undo fraudulent transactions made by thrift executives.
Another provision would encourage individuals to report S&amp;L
fraud to authorities by providing rewards for information
leading to convictions or civil recoveries. In civil cases,
the amount of such rewards would be tied to the value of
assets recovered and could total hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
   William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp.,
urged Congress to pass the crime bill, saying it would "prove
to be a formidable deterrent to financial institution fraud
and abuse."
   In a hearing before a House Judiciary subcommittee, Mr.
Seidman also defended the government's record in pursuing
crooked S&amp;L directors and officers. The agency recovered more
than $100 million last year in liability claims against S&amp;L
executives, he said, and an additional $200 million in
settlements and judgments in the first half of 1990.
   The Senate dropped from the crime package a provision that
would have allowed, under certain circumstances, the use of
illegally gathered evidence in criminal trials.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The semiconductor industry's leading
indicator dropped in June, reflecting seasonal factors and a
surge of orders earlier in the year that skewed June's index.
   The Semiconductor Industry Association's so-called
book-to-bill ratio for June fell to 1.06-to-1 from 1.14-to-1
in May. Both figures are preliminary. A book-to-bill rate of
1.06 means that for every $100 in products shipped, makers
received $106 in new orders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lower index shows that "we're headed for a normal
reasonable summer, not any kind of recession," said analyst
Erik Jansen of Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. Orders typically fall
in mid-June, he said. And a rash of memory-chip orders in
March translated into deliveries in June that drove the index
down because of lower bookings in the month, he said.
   The industry association late last year forecast a year of
no growth or slightly negative growth and June's index is
"right on target," said an association official.
   June billings were $1.30 billion, 5% lower than the $1.36
billion posted in June 1989. Average monthly bookings for the
three-month period ending in June were $1.27 billion, 1.3%
higher than the year-earlier average bookings of $1.25
billion.

   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- An Apple Computer Inc. software whiz
will quit to start a secretive spinoff company with two
former Apple employees.
   Bill Atkinson, who designed Apple's Hypercard software,
will leave Apple to form General Magic Inc. with former Apple
employees Andy Hertzfeld and Marc Porat, Apple said. General
Magic's founders and Apple won't say what the new company
plans to make, except that it will develop a product that
bears the trademark Personal Intelligent Communicator.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They have an idea that's under development," said an
Apple spokesman. "We can't tell you anything about it."
   Whatever the product is, the ideas come from concepts
created by an Apple development project code-named Paradigm,
Apple said. Apple said it spun out the technologies because
they don't fit the company's mainstream business. Apple will
retain ties with the technology by becoming a minority
investor and the largest corporate shareholder in General
Magic. Apple Chairman John Sculley will serve on General
Magic's board, and Apple has a license to make and market the
spinoff's technologies, Apple said.
   Mr. Hertzfeld was a chief developer of Apple's Macintosh
computer, but left the company about five years ago. Mr.
Porat, who left Apple to help start General Magic, was a
high-level engineering manager overseeing the Paradigm
project. Mr. Atkinson will maintain ties with Apple by
becoming an Apple Fellow Emeritus.

   CHICAGO -- Details of a study comparing the effectiveness
of three blood pressure drugs on black patients were released
prematurely, the American Medical Association said.
   Late last week, newspapers, including The Wall Street
Journal, and broadcast media around the U.S. ran accounts of
the study, conducted by researchers at the University of
Maryland and funded by Monsanto Co.'s G.D. Searle unit.
Contrary to the accounts, the study doesn't appear in the
July issue of the AMA publication, Archives of Internal
Medicine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The premature release "was the result of overzealousness"
by Burson-Marsteller, a public relations agency retained by
G.D. Searle and the University of Maryland, the AMA said.
Because of the breach, editors of the AMA publication
considered rescinding acceptance of the study, but later
decided to publish it in their August issue.
   Representatives for Burson-Marsteller, Searle and the
University of Maryland said they were embarrassed by the
foul-up, and regretted the early release of the data.

   P&amp;G's Success With Drug for Treating
   Osteoporosis Is Confirmed in Second Test

   A second study has confirmed that a Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
drug successfully treated osteoporosis, a bone-weakening
disease that affects about 20 million women, mostly over age
50.
   The latest finding produced compelling evidence that the
drug, marketed as Didronal, can strengthen bones that become
brittle after menopause and can reduce fractures that result
from the condition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "These are truly exciting results," said Nelson Watts, an
associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of
Medicine. "No other drug has established the level of safety
and effectiveness in treating osteoporosis, one reason why we
believe this drug might even be useful in preventing the
disease."
   Dr. Watts was the lead investigator in a multicenter study
that compared Didronal against a placebo drug in 429 women
over two years. In a report published prominently in this
week's New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Watts and his
colleagues said bone mass in the women's vertebrae increased
by 4.2% and 5.2% in two groups of women who took the drug as
compared to women given an inactive pill.
   Moreover, the women treated with Didronal had 50% less
fractures than those who took placebo. Current therapy for
the condition includes the use of the hormones estrogen and
calcitonin, each of which can cause annoying and potentially
troublesome side effects.
   Two months ago, another study of 66 women published in the
New England Journal found similar results. Norwich Eaton
Pharmaceuticals, the P&amp;G subsidiary that sells Didronal and
funded the latest study, said it expected to use the data
from the two reports in an application it will file soon with
the Food and Drug Administration to market the drug to
doctors as a treatment for osteoporosis.
   Didronal, known under the generic name etidronate, is
currently sold for use in treating a rare bone condition
called Paget's disease. Daily doses of the drug cost about
$2. In both research studies Didronal was administered in a
cyclical therapy in which patients took the drug for 14 days
out of every three months.
   The second study's positive finding is expected to spur
growing enthusiasm among doctors and scientists because
Didronal is one of a class of drugs being developed by
several drug makers. These drugs, called diphosphonates,
appear to work by coating bone cells and preventing loss of
bone tissue.
   The drugs also block the action of bone cells, called
osteoclasts, that normally break down bone material in a
natural process called bone remodeling. Women with
osteoporosis are unable to replace the bone material as
quickly as it is broken down.
   Merck &amp; Co. has said it is testing a similar drug called
alendronate sodium that it licensed from Istituto Gentili, an
Italian drug company. Other drug companies testing similar
products are Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. and Ciba-Geigy
Corp.
   Didronal was patented about 30 years ago as a chemical
thought useful as a detergent. In 1988, Norwich Eaton
received a new patent for the chemical for its use in
treating bone loss. Some analysts project the drug might
generate $500 million in annual sales if approved for the new
use by the FDA.
   Dr. Watts of Emory said proving the drug prevented the
onset of osteoporosis would require testing it in thousands
of women over many years, and comparing their rate of
fractures to women who took placebo, an expensive project he
didn't think would be undertaken easily.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Procter &amp; Gamble closed at $89.25, up 87.5 cents.

   Delta Air Asks U.S.
   To Mediate Its Talks
   For Pilots' Contract

   Delta Air Lines said it asked the National Mediation
Board, which oversees airline labor relations, to assign a
mediator to supervise contract talks. Delta's pilots are
represented by the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Atlanta-based Delta has been negotiating this proposed
contract with pilots for 18 months, and the main dispute is
over a lower wage rate in effect for newer pilots. Pilots say
they want an end to the scale, which is known as a "B-scale"
and has been in effect since 1985, when the airline industry
was racked by fare cuts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the pilots' contract was up for renegotiation in
March 1989, under airline labor law the provisions of a
contract are binding until a new one is signed. Delta had
asked for a mediator's help in negotiating the current
pilots' contract. "We're very optimistic it's going to be
resolved," said a Delta spokesman, adding: "We think having
outside help will help move things along."
   Officials of Delta's pilots' union disagreed. "We are
disappointed that management could not handle this family
issue privately without involving external parties," said
Capt. Jim Gray of the pilots' union.
   Under terms of a recent Delta proposal to its pilots, a
copy of which was obtained by this newspaper, the company is
offering wage increases of about 11% to pilots with six to 12
years' experience, and 34% to 51% to first officers with two
to five years at Delta. Although that would narrow the
discrepancy between what "A-scale" and "B-scale" pilots are
paid, it wouldn't eliminate the two-tiered system.
   Delta refused to comment on the details of any offers. A
pilots' spokesman said a more recent offer contained slightly
different numbers.
   The only union among Delta's employees is the pilots'
union; the airline has never been struck.

   Japan to Resume Lending Slowly
   To China After Lifting of Curbs

   HONG KONG -- Following Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu's announcement that his government will resume lending
to China, analysts calculate it could take several months to
secure funding for individual loan proposals.
   Of the total package of 810 billion yen ($5.36 billion),
about 120 billion yen for 17 projects is likely to be
approved by next March.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Commercial lending may be equally slow to pick up.
Japanese bankers remain cautious about committing new money
to projects in China because of the sharp slowdown in the
Chinese economy and the Beijing government's tight rein on
foreign borrowing, instituted as part of an austerity program
in late 1988.
   Since August, larger Japanese banks have been moving back
to China, finding ways to circumvent Tokyo's restrictions to
participate in the few loans available to high-quality
borrowers. Many of the loans have carried Chinese government
guarantees, other special guarantees, or were made to the
Hong Kong subsidiaries of Chinese companies. Japan accounts
for about half of China's more than $40 billion of foreign
debt.
   As Tokyo lifts the restrictions, smaller banks may begin
to join some China loans. When combined with the resumption
of official aid, that lending freedom may be positive for
China trade because more foreign exchange will be flowing
through the country, foreign bankers in Hong Kong say.
   In the past year, financing has been arranged for several
top-rated Chinese borrowers. Japanese banks have participated
in loans to mainland airlines, China International Trust &amp;
Investment Corp. and infrastructure-related projects. A
consortium of 67 Japanese banks also activated a $2 billion
standby credit approved in 1985. Other relatively big
projects for big-name borrowers may be funded this year, some
with Japanese participation, but owing to Beijing's austerity
program, small and midsize loans will remain few in number.
   "There is a common desire among Japanese banks for the
normalization of economic relations with China," said an
official at a large Japanese bank in Tokyo. But he stressed
that banks would take a conservative stance. That view was
underscored Tuesday, when a $30 million loan for China
Resources (Holdings) Co. was signed: No Japanese banks
participated.
   Japanese banks' caution, like that of most lenders to
China, stems largely from doubts about the ability of some
projects to produce returns and possible defaults by loan
guarantors.
   Poor economic conditions have only added to banks'
worries. China said in a report issued this week that the
country's financial situation is grim and that the government
must continue to tighten finance and credit.
   For Japanese banks, caution in China is a change of pace.
Until the killings in Beijing in June last year that
triggered the loan moratorium, they often undercut other
foreign banks on loans to China, according to bankers in Hong
Kong. These bankers say that if the Japanese return to their
old habits, the result would be lower interest rates on China
loans.
   "It's not wise for them to rush back in and flood the
market with cheap money," said an economist at a U.S. bank in
Hong Kong, adding that current rates "reflect the reality in
China right now."
   Interest rates on China loans rose about 50 basis points,
to about 75 basis points above the London interbank offered
rate, or Libor, soon after the June 1989 crackdown, and they
remain near that level. (A basis point is one hundredth of a
percentage point. Libor is the rate banks in London charge
one another for U.S. dollar loans.)

   Money-Fund Assets
   Rose $4.7 Billion
   In Latest Period

   Assets of money-market mutual funds rose by about $4.7
billion in the eight days ended Tuesday, reversing the
outflows of the previous period.
   Assets of 430 taxable funds now stand at $379.2 billion,
up from $374.6 billion on July 2, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report. The Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter did
its regular weekly survey a day early last week because of
the July Fourth holiday, reporting a $4.3 billion drop in
assets for the previous six-day period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yields on taxable funds dipped slightly in the latest
period. The seven-day compound yield of the funds, which
assumes reinvestment of dividends, slid to 7.95% from 7.97%,
Donoghue's reported. Average yields have been at or just
below 8% since early this year.
   "People may just be parking their cash," said Martha
Wittbrodt, editor of the newsletter. "The stock and bond
markets have been rather choppy" and yields on certificates
of deposit have softened in recent weeks, she noted.
   Average maturity of money-fund investments, such things as
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs), Treasury bills
and bank CDs, shortened by two days to 43 days. Shorter
maturities are often thought to indicate that portfolio
managers expect interest rates to rise, because they permit
funds to grab higher yields sooner. But the current average
is well within the range of the last few months. Average
maturity has been as short as 29 days and as long as 53 days
in recent years.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.65% from 7.68%. The average 30-day simple yield
remained at 7.67%, while the average 30-day compound yield
stayed at 7.97%.
   Assets of tax-exempt funds rose by about $3.2 billion in
the last eight days, Donoghue's said, while yields fell.
Assets increased to $78.9 billion; the average seven-day
compound yield of the 224 tax-free funds dropped to 5.30%
from 5.46%. The latest yield is equivalent to 7.36% for an
investor in the 28% tax bracket and 7.91% for someone paying
33%.
   Average maturity for the tax-free funds lengthened to 49
days from 48.

   Lupus Suit Opens Way to New Injury Cases

   A lawsuit linking an auto accident to the onset of a
chronic disease seems to open yet another new frontier in
personal-injury litigation.
   A New York appeals court has affirmed a jury's finding
that a car accident caused a woman sufficient stress to
trigger the symptoms of lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease
that weakens connective tissues and internal organs. The
woman, Corrie Collins, alleged that the accident "aggravated"
her lupus condition, which had previously been "quiescent."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The court also upheld $300,000 in damages awarded by the
jury for Ms. Collins' pain and suffering, although it denied
her an additional $600,000 for lost wages and loss of
enjoyment of life.
   Two of the five judges on the state Supreme Court
Appellate Division dissented from the decision, arguing that
"there is no medical proof that plaintiff's accident made her
alleged lupus any worse than it would have been from any
other precipitating cause."
   Ms. Collins was a passenger in a car driven by Matthew
McGinley, a defendant in the case, who failed to stop at an
intersection and collided with another vehicle. Ms. Collins,
a high school student in 1981 when the crash occurred,
testified that shortly afterward she developed a facial rash,
a symptom of lupus. She also developed swelling of the eyes.
But she wasn't diagnosed with a form of the disease, systemic
lupus erythematosas, until 1986.
   Thomas Leyden, a lawyer for Ms. Collins, said that
although previous cases have linked traumatic experiences to
the aggravation of other diseases -- such as arthritis and
Alzheimer's -- he knew of no other case suggesting that
stress caused a lupus flare-up. But, he said, "you should not
exclude lupus because it's not printed in the book up to
now."
   Personal injury lawyers praised the appeals court's
decision, saying that research on lupus increasingly reflects
a link with stress.
   Pamela Liapakis, a New York trial lawyer familiar with the
disease, said that the current state of research allows
doctors "to say on witness stands with a reasonable degree of
certainty that a stressful event could cause a flare-up."
   But Jay Tressler, president of the International
Association of Defense Counsel, said the case was an example
of the effectiveness of the plaintiff's bar "in trying to
create expanded theories of recovery." He added, "I wish we
could bring the scales of justice a little more into balance
in determining what should be recoverable and what should
not."
   And Arthur Lambert of New York's Lambert &amp; Weiss, a lawyer
for Mr. McGinley, called the court's decision "astonishing,"
saying there is no way to prove that Ms. Collins had a
quiescent condition of lupus at the time of the crash. "The
only thing that showed after the accident was a rash, and
from a rash we got a verdict of $900,000."
   Both sides say they may appeal the decision, since it
affirmed the jury's finding that stress caused the flare-up
but reduced Ms. Collins' damage award.

   UPS IS ACCUSED of bias against employees who have beards.
   United Parcel Service of America Inc., the world's largest
package-delivery company, prohibits all bearded employees
from working with the public. But in a civil lawsuit filed in
U.S. District Court in Chicago, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission said that under Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the Greenwich, Conn., company must exempt
workers who wear beards for sincere religious reasons.
   EEOC filed the complaint on behalf of Aiyub Patel, who
brought the case to the agency, and others who might be
affected by the UPS policy. A UPS spokesman declined to
comment on the suit.
   Mr. Patel, who left UPS in September 1989 after four
years, was an unloader, a post requiring no public contact.
When Mr. Patel, a Moslem, applied for a driver's position,
"he was informed of UPS's policy, which is to not have any
exceptions to their no-beard policy," said Zachary A. Tobin,
trial attorney at the EEOC district office in Chicago.
   Under Title VII, Mr. Tobin said, a company must reasonably
accommodate such religious exceptions unless it can prove
"undue hardship on the conduct" of its business.
   In Islam, beards are "purely a personal thing. Nothing in
the faith requires wearing the beard," said Charles L.
Geddes, professor of Islamic studies at the University of
Denver and director of the American Institute of Islamic
Studies there.
   But Mr. Tobin said that "we're not an arbiter of religious
beliefs. In this case, Mr. Patel said it is part of his
religious beliefs that he must wear the beard. That's what we
go on."
   EEOC has a similar case against UPS being litigated by its
Houston district office. That suit makes the religion claim
but also charges that the no-beard policy harms black males
because a number of them have a skin disorder,
pseudofolliculitis barbae, that makes shaving difficult.
   The EEOC process requires that the agency try to settle
the issue before it begins litigation. Such efforts proved
fruitless, Mr. Tobin said.

   ASBESTOS EMISSIONS prove costly in a New Jersey hotel-site
renovation.
   In Newark, N.J., U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said
Tzavah Urban Renewal Corp., based in Brooklyn, N.Y., and four
other defendants agreed to pay a total of $330,000 under a
consent decree filed in federal court. The five had been
among parties accused of being responsible for
asbestos-emission violations in the renovation of the former
Old Military Park Hotel in downtown Newark between October
1987 and last August. In the decree, the defendants made no
admission of liability for violations.
   The government alleged that Tzavah had ignored asbestos
rules at the renovation site, where it said
asbestos-insulated materials "were dry-stripped, dumped out
of upper-story windows and left exposed in huge refuse
piles." Airborne asbestos has been linked to diseases
including cancer.
   The defendants' attorney, Damon R. Sedita, was unavailable
for comment, his office said. Tzavah officials couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Earlier in the case, a $225,000 default judgment was
entered against Creer Industrial Corp., a demolition
contractor based in the Bronx, and its principal, William
Creer.

   LAWYERS' BILLING RATES and incomes are on the rise.
   Hourly billing rates for law-firm partners rose over the
past year, possibly reflecting law firms' efforts to cope
with escalating salaries for associates and the higher cost
of doing business.
   The median billing rate for partners in early 1990 was
$150 per hour, up 8% from last year's rate of $139. The rate
for associates jumped only 3%, from $97 to $100.
   The billing-rate figures appear in a survey of law-firm
economics conducted annually by Altman &amp; Weil, a management
consulting group based in Newtown Square, Pa. More than 650
law firms nationwide completed a questionnaire about their
billing practices, compensation levels and staffing patterns.
The survey excluded solo practitioners.
   Partners' median compensation rose 5%, to $141,203 from
$134,350. Associates' median salaries increased 8%, to
$60,270 from $55,635.
   Ward Bower of Altman &amp; Weil said, "The rise in billing
rates could be reflective of the fact that partners, who are
feeling the pinch in their incomes, are looking to make that
up by pushing billing rates upward."

   COURT PANEL CRITICIZES ban on filming "Bonfire" scene in
courtroom.
   A panel of judges, lawyers, media representatives and
state entertainment officials recommended that judges avoid
"content review" when deciding which films may be shot in New
Jersey's county courthouses.
   The panel was established at the request of New Jersey
Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz, who last May
banned the filming of a scene from "The Bonfire of the
Vanities" in an Essex County courthouse in Newark. The judge
complained that the scene, showing a group of black citizens
rioting, "could serve to seriously undermine the confidence
of black citizens in our court system."
   But in an 11-page report, the 12-member panel, headed by
New Jersey Superior Court Judge Ralph V. Martin, expressed
concern that judges would become embroiled in non-judicial
disputes. The panel said that judges can dissociate
themselves from a film's content by requiring that the film's
credits include disclaimers.
   Judge Wilentz's decision last May sparked widespread
protest from county administrators in New Jersey,
particularly in Essex County, where the movie's producers had
offered $250,000 for use of the courtroom.
   A suit filed by Essex County pending in federal court in
Newark contends that the decision amounts to illegal
censorship. Judge Wilentz declined to comment while he
reviews the panel's report.

Watkins. At Latham, a Los Angeles firm with 550 lawyers
nationwide, Mr. Rothenberg will be a senior litigation

Phelps, "It's a great loss to us professionally and

   FEAR OF FRAUD prompts more banks to nix credit card use
for new merchants.
   Banks get tougher about refusing new vendors' credit card
business as fraud involving direct marketers mounts. Industry
officials say illegal telemarketers alone cost the
credit-card banks about $200 million a year. Visa and
MasterCard recently cracked down on "boiler-room" telephone
pitchmen using high-pressure tactics to sell water purifiers,
security systems, vitamins and travel packages. They filed a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit over one such alleged scam that
netted at least $4 million.

   Start-up businesses, like Peter Hochberg's fledgling line
of riding clothes, are most hobbled. Mr. Hochberg, a Hickory,
N.C., management consultant, pressed six banks in an
unsuccessful attempt to establish a Visa and MasterCard
merchant account to get his direct-mail business off the
ground. Mr. Hochberg notes the cards account for 80% of
mail-order purchases. "If I can't accept them, I'm out of
business."
   Eventually, one of Mr. Hochberg's suppliers agreed to
process credit card purchases through his own account.
                                                                                                       

   LEMON AID comes from overseas as a puckered U.S. crop
propels juice prices.
   For the second month, lemon juice pops up on a
short-supply list from the nation's purchasing agents. Lemon
concentrate prices are at "historic highs, as far as I can
tell," says a buyer for Borden's ReaLemon. Price per gallon
is as high as $13, nearly double three years ago. Bad weather
in California cuts the crop to about 65% of normal, says
Sunkist Growers. The co-op members "are storing anything that
has any life in it rather than go to juice." Why? Fresh fruit
sells at a premium to processed.
   Juice users increasingly turn to Argentina (also a lean
crop), Italy, Spain and Mexico. "We're buying from five or
six sources so the bulk is coming from overseas," says Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up. Consumers don't feel the squeeze so badly,
but prices vary. Robert Libbin, owner of a Ben &amp; Jerry's in
Chicago, says some weeks his lemonade isn't profitable,
depending on the fruit's price. Recently it was $1.59 a
pound; on July 4, he sold a 16-ounce fresh lemonade for
$1.63.
                                                                                                       

   HOSPITAL CREDIT ratings recover a bit, but many are still
on the critical list.
   "Hospital bonds are probably the most volatile in the
municipal market," says Moody's William DeSante. Rankings
continue to erode, but at a reduced pace: Moody's downgraded
18 hospitals in both the first half of this year and the
first half of 1989, but upgrades rose to seven this year from
four in the 1989 half. At Standard &amp; Poor's, the downgrade
ratio narrowed to 2-to-1 in the second quarter from 3-to-1 in
the first period. But recent "alarming growth" in the
non-investment grade category is likely to continue, says
S&amp;P. Most at risk: hospitals with fewer than 100 beds.
   Part of the problem in gauging hospital creditworthiness
stems from outside regulation, since Medicare and large
insurers hold prices down. And, unlike cities and school
districts, most hospitals can't simply raise taxes to
generate funds. "They are competing in terribly restrictive
environments," says Mr. DeSante. Higher borrowing costs
"increase the cost of care" and curb investment, says Richard
Clarke, head of Healthcare Financial Management Association.
   In 1989, 5.7% of hospitals rated by S&amp;P were ranked below
investment grade, up from only 1.2% in 1983.
                                                                                                       

   BLASTED GOLFBALL] Canada's Whiteshell Nuclear Research
laboratories boost nuclear power with "atomic" golfballs that

in June and found no effect. But, as one tester says, golfers
"would sacrifice a live chicken if they thought it'd get them
10 more yards."
                                                                                                       

   CHOW PASSES DOW: Interstate/Johnson Lane, a Charlotte,
N.C., broker, says goods inflation outpaces stock gains.
Since 1961, prices in Charlotte jumped 638% for a pound of

   PARENTS KNEW THIS. The Conference Board says families with
kids accounted for two out of every five dollars spent in
1989.
                                                                                                       

   OUTWARD BOUND urbanites in search of jobs, housing may
foretell trend.
   People migrated into cities like New York during the
1980s. Now, with a waning economy, "our guess is we're having
net out-migration," says Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist
for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. This time,
the migration may go beyond the now high-priced suburbs. Ms.
Scanlon notes that Los Angelenos head to Seattle and Arizona.
Employers have sniffed the change. "Housing is the No. 1
criterion now for moving business," she says.
   Iowa, for one, makes hay on the trend. It stresses the
"American dream": affordable housing and good schools. A
recent media campaign target: New York. "The quality of life
thing's become more important," says an Iowa spokesman. The
Hawkeye State plays up its schools as a steady source of
educated workers. So far, government data don't reflect
migration from cities; the normal lag has widened while all
efforts focus on the 1990 Census.
   Iowa has its eye on insurance, food, biotechnology and
telecommunications industries.

   DeSoto Inc., which has been stalling a persistent hostile
suitor, New York investor group Sutton Holding Corp., said it
plans to sell off operations accounting for more than 80% of
its sales.
   The Des Plaines, Ill., maker of paints, chemical coatings
and detergents said it has already agreed to sell certain
assets for about $200 million, and it will distribute the net
proceeds from those sales -- expected to total $85 million,
or an indicated $20.94 a share -- to shareholders, in the
form of a special dividend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   DeSoto said it also plans to tap the excess funding of its
employee pension plans, and distribute an additional about
$28 million, or approximately $6.90 a share, to shareholders
a year from now.
   The plan to nearly liquidate the company, which calls for
further payouts if DeSoto succeeds in closing agreements for
the sale of other operations, is subject to shareholder
approval, as well as regulatory clearance of the sales.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
DeSoto shares jumped $5.50, to close at $45.
   DeSoto's fight against an unsolicited $50-a-share bid from
Sutton led both parties into Delaware Chancery Court. As a
result of that litigation, said a DeSoto official, the court
"ordered DeSoto to maximize shareholder value." In an
interview, William L. Lamey Jr., vice president, finance,
called the planned sell-off of most of the company DeSoto's
response to that order.
   The Sutton bid, which has been repeatedly extended since
it was launched in November, has been viewed by investors
with considerable skepticism, as evidenced by the price at
which DeSoto shares have been trading. Officials at Sutton,
which currently holds a 15% stake, couldn't be reached for
comment yesterday.
   Courtaulds PLC of London definitively agreed to buy
DeSoto's industrial coatings business, for $135 million. The
U.K. concern, in turn, agreed to sell substantial portions of
the coating operations to Valspar Corp. of Minneapolis and
DSM Resins B.V. of the Netherlands.
   In addition, DeSoto said Witco Corp. of New York has
agreed to purchase the company's surfactant and emulsifier
lines. While it didn't disclose terms, Courtauld's disclosure
of the price it was paying indicates Witco paid about $65
million.
   DeSoto is also "very close to signing a definitive
agreement" for the sale of its domestic consumer paint lines,
said Mr. Lamey. Sales for the domestic paint operation, which
has reported operating losses in recent quarters, have been
estimated at above $150 million in 1989, out of DeSoto's
overall sales of $408.2 million last year.
   DeSoto is also negotiating the sale of certain proprietary
technology it holds for thickening-agents, and is "nearing an
agreement there as well," the official said.
   If the paint and technology sales go through, net proceeds
would additionally be distributed to shareholders, the
company said.
   "For the present," DeSoto said it plans to retain its
household detergent business, which contributed about $72
million in revenues last year.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
it would move quickly to impose securities regulations on
banks if they are allowed to advertise trust department
investment funds to compete with mutual funds.
   The SEC said it plans to issue a mandate forcing the banks
to abide by securities laws if they are cleared to advertise
or market the funds, which like mutual funds, pool money into
a single investment vehicle. But even if the SEC took such a
step, agency officials concede that banks would be held to
more lax regulatory standards than mutual funds because the
SEC couldn't apply all its securities laws.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Top officials at the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, which issued the plan to allow such advertising,
said a decision on the proposal is at least two months off.
"No final decision has been made," said Frank Maguire, a top
aide at the office.
   The comptroller's plan set off a firestorm immediately
after it was proposed in February. While much of the proposal
contains technical changes to banking rules, one measure
would allow banks for the first time to advertise the
performance of their trust accounts.
   That brought strong criticism from the $1 trillion mutual
fund industry, which sees banks competing in its
almost-exclusive domain. Yesterday, Matthew Fink, general
counsel for the Investment Company Institute, said the mutual
fund trade group would sue the comptroller's office if the
rule is passed.
   Congress is jumping into the act too. Rep. Edward Markey
(D., Mass.), who heads the House telecommunications and
finance subcommittee, said he plans to hold hearings on the
proposal when Congress returns from its summer recess.
   Banks have long boasted that their 2,900 investment
trusts, which manage more than $100 billion belonging
primarily to wealthy individuals, on average outperform
mutual funds. They would love to compete with Fidelity
Investments and other mutual fund groups for the huge amount
of profitable investment business they can't now reach.
   The comptroller's proposal would appear to open the door.
The agency is simply trying to streamline existing
regulations that allow bank trust funds to be mentioned only
in general terms in advertising, said Deputy Comptroller Dean
Miller. Moreover, SEC rules cover much of the same territory.
   But the way the proposal was crafted, the mutual-fund
industry claims, would allow banks to compare performance
numbers with those of mutual funds. That would set the two
head to head, the Investment Company Institute contends.
   SEC rules would take some measures to prevent banks from
getting too much of an advantage. For example, the regulator
has made it clear that the banks immediately would be
required to register with the SEC under the Investment
Company Act, which covers mutual funds. "We would like to
make such an interpretive release available to banks prior to
the time that they may take steps that might result in
violation" of securities law, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden
wrote to Comptroller Robert Clarke.
   But banks are exempted from some securities statutes, so
the rules would be more lenient. For example, the SEC
wouldn't regulate the sales practices of banks as it now
monitors similar moves by mutual-fund salesmen, said an SEC
spokeswoman. "We couldn't have the hands-on regulatory
control," she said.
   Even if the proposal is approved by Mr. Clarke, it's tough
to determine how it might affect the mutual fund industry. "I
don't think anybody at the SEC has been able to sit down and
figure out who might win out from a competitive point of
view," said Kathryn McGrath, who until recently headed the
SEC's investment management division.
   Still, "it may shift the competitive advantage somewhat in
trying to attract pension plan money," said Ms. McGrath, who
is now with the law firm Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius. "That could
make life tougher competitively for mutual funds that go
after that end of the market."
   But banking industry officials argue that the whole issue
is overblown. "It's been blown way out of proportion," said
James McLaughlin, the American Banking Association's director
of trust and securities. "It doesn't mean the comptroller
would allow banks to go willy nilly to run around and sell
these funds."
   He said the comptroller may decide to hold back the
controversial advertising measure and move the other
technical provisions along.

   Poll Shows Americans Are Forgiving
   On Bush's Breaking of No-Tax Pledge

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. voters are well aware that President
Bush is breaking his no-tax pledge, but they don't much blame
him for it and are resigned to a tax increase.
   A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that, by a
margin of more than 2-to-1, voters believe the president is
breaking his campaign promise not to raise taxes. At the same
time, though, they said they would prefer higher taxes to
living with the current federal budget deficit, by 49% to
40%. And 88% of those polled think taxes are likely to rise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If President Bush does support a tax-increase bill, nearly
two-thirds of the voters said they wouldn't feel any
differently about him. And those who would change their view
are divided about which way they would go -- 18% would think
less of him, 14% would think more of him. Only 21% would
blame Mr. Bush's administration for a tax increase, fewer
than the 26% who would blame congressional Democrats and the
28% who would blame the administration of former President
Reagan.
   But when it comes to which taxes to raise, the respondents
were at odds with Mr. Bush and his fellow Republicans and far
more in tune with the Democrats. By overwhelming margins they
favored increasing the income tax rate for upper-income
individuals, raising the corporate tax rate and increasing
"sin" taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. They
disapproved of raising the gasoline tax, enacting a national
sales tax and increasing income tax rates on all Americans.
   The voters leaned toward a proposal being considered in
the Bush administration to assess a new levy on all stock and
bond sales, with 49% favoring the plan and 40% opposed.
   The survey was conducted for the Journal and NBC News by
the polling organizations of Peter Hart, a Democrat, and
Robert Teeter, a Republican, between July 6 and 10. The
margin of error for the nationwide survey of 1,555 registered
voters is 2.6 percentage points.
   The proposal to raise the top rate is one of the pivotal
issues of the current budget debate. Republicans are
vigorously resisting the change, while Democrats are
insisting on it if the tax on capital gains is reduced, as
Mr. Bush wants.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) told
reporters he would oppose any budget accord that cut capital
gains without at the same time raising the top rate for
individuals. He also insisted that the top rate be increased
to at least 33% from the current 28%.
   Voters in the survey sided with Sen. Mitchell. The poll
found that 76% of those surveyed favored increasing the
income tax rate for upper income individuals. The only
tax-increase choice that was better liked, at 78%, was a
proposal to increase taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic
beverages. Also, 70% of the voters said they favored raising
the corporate tax rate.
   Last month, President Bush acknowledged that tax increases
are needed to reduce the budget deficit, and, ever since,
Washington decision-makers have turned their attention to the
question of which taxes to raise. Increases in the top
individual tax rate and in excise taxes are high on their
list; selected corporate tax increases also are being
considered, though a boost in the corporate tax rate itself
hasn't been widely discussed.
   The Journal/NBC News poll showed that more and more voters
approved of this change in emphasis. For the first time, more
of those polled said President Bush should support a tax
increase than those who said he should stick to his
no-new-tax pledge. Fifty percent of those polled said he
should raise taxes and 46% said he shouldn't. Just eight
months ago, 55% said he shouldn't raise taxes.
   A big reason for that swing was the president's ability to
persuade generally anti-tax Republicans to view a tax
increase more favorably. As recently as April, long before
Mr. Bush's June 26 statement about the need for tax
increases, 61% of the Republicans polled said Mr. Bush should
oppose tax increases. In July, when the latest poll was
executed, 57% of the Republicans surveyed said he should back
a tax increase.
   Fully 67% of those polled said they believed that the
president was breaking his no-new-tax promise, and 57%
thought that a tax increase was very likely; 31% said it was
somewhat likely. But 65% of those polled said it wouldn't
make any difference in how they feel about him if he agrees
to go along with a budget plan that includes a tax increase.
   Overall, Mr. Bush's approval rating with voters fell to
67% from 72% in May and 75% in April. His new standing
matched the approval rating in September and November.

   Chip Maker
   Gets a Jump

   A tiny Silicon Valley start-up will get a jump on the
Japanese today when it unveils what is believed to be the
world's first factory dedicated to making superconducting
chips.
   The three-year-old company, Conductus Inc., has quietly
turned out experimental chips at its factory since March for
companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co., which bought a stake
in the closely held company in 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Conductus's factory flies in the face of warnings that
government-backed Japanese conglomerates, which have poured
hundreds of millions of dollars into superconductor research
since 1987, are winning the race to move the material from
the laboratory to the marketplace. The company said it
already has orders for prototype chips from seven U.S.
companies.
   Conductus "is moving very quickly from superconductors as
a material-science curiosity into developing them into
prototype devices," said Rod K. Quinn, director of Los Alamos
National Laboratory's exploratory research and development
center, who warned of a Japanese superconductivity juggernaut
after a visit to Japan last year. Conductus "is becoming a
flag carrier" for the U.S. in superconductivity, he said.
   Conductus was formed in September 1987 by venture
capitalists, soon after researchers in Zurich and later in
Texas shook the world with the discovery of superconductors
that work at much higher temperatures than originally thought
possible. The new "high-temperature" materials, which conduct
electricity with almost no resistance at around minus 250
degrees Fahrenheit, have the potential to be more
economically viable than older superconductors, which operate
at about minus 420 degrees, because it costs less to cool
them. They're considered ideal for use in extremely fast
computer chips.
   But the new materials, a type of ceramic, are hard to form
into usable shapes, such as the thin films of material needed
to create microscopic circuits on chips. Conductus tackled
that problem at its 4,000-square-foot factory by using mostly
secondhand semiconductor-making equipment, but "we had to
invent equipment for thin film deposition," said Vice
President Ora Smith. "That's where our secret black magic
lies."
   Mr. Quinn of Los Alamos concurred that Conductus's
technology is "remarkable." He attributed it to Conductus's
success in wooing researchers from around the U.S. Its top
executives are scientists and lab managers originally from
companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and
Rockwell International Corp. Its advisory board includes a
blue-ribbon roster of professors from schools such as
Stanford University and the University of California at
Berkeley.
   Conductus makes chips to customers' specifications using
either low-temperature or high-temperature superconductors.
The company said it will focus on electronic applications
rather than on "power" applications, such as electric cables
and magnetically levitating trains. Conductus said one
customer, for example, is designing Conductus-made chips into
equipment to detect objects in space. Superconducting chips
filter out extraneous signals better than conventional chips
do.
   The company also expects to make chips for super-fast
computers, telecommunications equipment, satellites' "eyes"
that can see stars better, and medical equipment that can
look into the human body more safely than X-rays. The company
said it's discussing with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration using chips in a Saturn mission to look at the
planet's clouds.
   A Hewlett-Packard official said the company has "great
expectations" for work done by Conductus. Forward-looking
research in superconductors is better done by small companies
such as Conductus, he said. "It's a very valuable
relationship for us," he added.
   Investors have plowed $11.5 million so far into Conductus,
which expects to be profitable by 1994. The company's factory
in Sunnyvale, Calif., can only make about 25,000 chips a
year, too few for mass commercialization, but the company
said it may increase its capacity.
   The company hasn't ruled out the Japanese threat. "We
think we're closer to commercialization than the Japanese
are," said Mr. Smith, the Conductus vice president. "But we
know that as soon as we look successful, Japanese companies
will be jumping in very actively."

   NEW YORK -- Unlisted stock prices advanced behind a late
surge of buying on the New York Stock Exchange, ignoring
another earnings disappointment by Oracle Systems.
   Traders say buyers flooded into OTC stocks near the end of
the day after watching prices climb steadily on the Big
Board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Investors have been waiting for prices to drop over
concerns about weak secondquarter earnings, but when prices
failed to fall, the buyers grew more brave, says Lance
Zipper, manager of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   "Even when {the market} sells off, it doesn't do so with
any gumption," Mr. Zipper says. "It just feels like a real
bull market."
   Losses in Oracle's stock made a dent in the OTC market's
gains, however. The stock dominated trading for most of the
day, dropping 2 1/2 points to 19 7/8 on volume of more than
9.3 million shares.
   The company disappointed Wall Street analysts and
investors for the second consecutive quarter by reporting
earnings below its estimates.
   Late Tuesday, the company said it earned 39 cents a share
in its fourth quarter ended in May, up from 25 cents a year
earlier. But many analysts had expected the company to earn
between 45 cents and 50 cents a share in the quarter.
   Those estimates were based on Oracle's projections, made
in May, that it would earn between 90 cents and $1 a share
for the latest fiscal year. Instead, Oracle earned 86 cents a
share for the year.
   Oracle's trouble may have put the brakes on the OTC
market's rise. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 2.93, or
0.64%, to 463.90. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
gained 1.2%.
   OTC advancers led decliners, 1,050 to 838. Volume grew to
159 million shares from 142.3 million shares Tuesday.
   While Oracle's latest earnings disappointment left more
than a few Wall Street analysts red in the face, it didn't
scare investors the way past disappointments have.
   In March, Oracle stunned investors by announcing that its
third-quarter profit would be flat with the 18 cents a share
it earned in the year-earlier third quarter. That news sent
the stock plunging more than 30% in a single session on
recordbreaking volume of nearly 21 million shares. The Nasdaq
Composite Index dropped 2.81 points that day as the selling
spread to other technology stocks.
   That wasn't the case yesterday. Second on the active list
was disk-drive maker Conner Peripherals, which gained 1 to 27
3/4 on volume of more than 4.5 million shares. Late
yesterday, Conner priced a 6.4 million-share secondary
offering at $26.75 a share. Also on the active list, Intel
rose 1 3/4 to 48, and Tandon rose 11/16 to 3 13/16. Microsoft
gained 1 3/4 to 75 1/2.
   Analysts expressed frustration over Oracle's reluctance to
be more conservative in its forecasts but were quick to point
out that the problems weren't fundamental.
   Chip Morris, a vice president and hightechnology analyst
at T. Rowe Price Associates, said his firm was a buyer of
Oracle shares yesterday.
   "They've won the open systems database game" and are now
the dominant player in the field, Mr. Morris said. "Oracle's
going to be one of the horses you'll want to ride in the
1990s."
   Oracle is one of the largest holdings in T. Rowe Price's
$1 billion New Horizons Fund as well as in its Science and
Technology Fund, Mr. Morris says.
   But Oracle's management has yet to adapt to the slower
growth of a maturing company, analysts say, and continues to
plan expenses according to revenue growth targets that are
too optimisitc.
   "Most shareholders would be happy to see Oracle plan
expenses for 35% to 40% revenue growth next year," says Mr.
Morris. "Then, if they grow at 50%, they could pass along the
excess to the shareholders."
   Mr. Morris concedes that Oracle didn't become a $1 billion
company in a few short years by being conservative. But, he
says that as a public company, Oracle has an obligation to
shareholders to plan more realistically.
   Dean Witter Reynolds and PrudentialBache Securities
yesterday lowered their estimates for the company's earnings
for the year ending in May 1991.
   Athletic footwear maker Nike gained 1 7/8 to 89 1/8. The
stock has been climbing since it released a strong earnings
report Monday.
   United Banks of Colorado gained 2 1/4 to 22 1/4 after
trading resumed from a halt imposed Tuesday. Norwest is in
talks with the company about a possible business combination.
   Oshkosh Truck jumped 2 to 11 3/4. The company said it has
been selected as the producer of the U.S. Army's new
generation of heavy-duty transport truck. The contract, which
Oshkosh expects to sign within 30 days, is worth more than $1
billion, the company said.

   Federal Regulators Order Banks to Take
   Write-Offs on Loans to Brazil, Argentina

   NEW YORK -- Federal bank regulators ordered U.S. banks to
write off an additional 20% of their $2.9 billion in loans to
Argentina and, for the first time, 20% of their $11.1 billion
to Brazil.
   Bankers privately confirmed that in recent days they have
received letters from the Interagency Country Exposure Review
Committee, consisting of the Federal Reserve Board, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Comptroller of the
Currency, ordering them to take the accounting actions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The surprise move by the committee isn't expected to
affect earnings of heavily reserved banks, such as J.P.
Morgan &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp. But at those
with lower reserve levels, especially Citicorp, the action is
expected to heighten pressure to increase reserves in coming
months. Citicorp, for instance, will have to charge off about
$650 million of Brazilian loans against its $3.3 billion
loan-loss reserve. However, it won't have to charge off any
more of its Argentine loans because it did so in the first
quarter. Citicorp's loss reserves could be boosted through a
combination of asset sales and new capital, but it said it
doesn't expect that to be necessary.
   For such low-reserve banks, the action comes at a
particularly sensitive time. They already are being buffeted
by problem real estate loans, stringent loan reviews by
regulators and weak corporate borrowing demand. Furthermore,
the write-down of Brazilian loans could make future debt
negotiations more rancorous between the banks and Brazil,
which is undergoing a wrenching economic restructuring and
had hoped for some forbearance while it sought firmer
economic footing. Neither Brazil nor Argentina is currently
paying principal or interest on its bank debt.
   James J. McDermott, research director at Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods Inc., said: "Candidly, the banks didn't need this. It
raises a question of whether a third round of reserves is in
store for some banks. The problem becomes one of market
perception about the adequacy of reserves and whether they
need to be replenished."
   Moreover, banks needing to bolster reserves face an uphill
battle raising new debt or equity. Many banks' stocks are
trading below their book values, and nearly 50 of the largest
bank organizations in recent months have seen their credit
ratings downgraded. Even high-quality banks are feeling the
effects. Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One Corp. recently faced
an unusually long and thorough 90-day review period for a new
equity issue.
   A Citicorp spokesman said, "While we can't comment on or
confirm" actions by the regulatory committee, "we can point
out that Citicorp disclosed in the first quarter that it had
written down 60% of its Argentine exposure" against its loss
reserve with no impact on earnings. "Any other write-downs,
voluntary or mandated, would likewise be charged to the
reserve without earnings impact," the spokesman added.
   Spokesmen for the Fed and FDIC declined to comment on the
committee's action.
   Analysts in the past have criticized Citicorp for what
they consider insufficient reserves, and the regulatory
action is likely to intensify those concerns.
   Carole Berger, an analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell Inc., said: "For some of these banks, this isn't
small potatoes. This is going to reinforce the
lesser-developed-country loan issue for banks like
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Chemical
Banking Corp. and Citicorp."
   H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner with the law firm Sullivan &amp;
Cromwell specializing in banking law, said: "This doesn't
reduce capital ratios, but it does lower the levels of
reserves as a percentage of nonperforming assets. The
reserves won't be as strong as they once were."
   The 20% write-off of Argentine debt, the third time a
reduction in valuation has been ordered, had been expected
and was less alarming to analysts because banks' Argentine
exposure ($2.9 billion owed the 36 largest banks) is
generally far lower than the amounts owed by Brazil ($11.1
billion for those same banks.)
   However, the Brazil write-off was unexpected. Under its
new president, Fernando Collor de Mello, Brazil is in the
midst of a major restructuring of its economy, and the new
administration has indicated an interest in reaching a new
bank debt agreement. Indeed, some bankers, including Citicorp
Chairman John S. Reed, have indicated that they expect talks
with Brazil to resume this fall or winter.
   Consequently, many have assumed that the regulatory
committee would give Brazil some breathing room before
declaring any of the Brazilian loans impaired. However, the
committee consists of bank examiners who may not be attuned
to the intricacies of international diplomacy, according to
regulatory sources.
   In fact, some analysts expect the committee's move to make
the Brazilian debt negotiations more difficult. As C.J.
Lawrence's Ms. Berger said: "All this puts the banks in a
terrible bargaining position."

   Five Senators Tied to S&amp;L Scandal Hit
   By More Criticism; Bush Defends His Son

   WASHINGTON -- Five senators came under renewed fire for
their involvement in the savings-and-loan scandal, while
President Bush voiced "great confidence" in the "honor and
integrity" of his son who also is under investigation for his
role in a thrift failure.
   Archibald Cox, chairman of the self-styled citizens' lobby
Common Cause and a onetime Watergate special prosecutor,
argued that the senators -- Alan Cranston (D., Calif.),
Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), John Glenn (D., Ohio), John
McCain (R., Ariz.), and Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) -- violated
the Code of Ethics for Government Service in 1987. The
senators accepted campaign contributions from Charles
Keating, the chairman of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's parent
company, and then met with regulators to ask about their
examination of Lincoln.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a brief filed with the Senate Ethics Committee, Mr. Cox
said the lawmakers created the "appearance" that they acted
"in an official capacity in response to gifts or other
benefits." Mr. Cox, who served as U.S. solicitor general in
the early 1960s, also asserted the senators violated
provisions of the ethics code that public officials should
"never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special
favors or privileges to anyone."
   The senators have denied any wrongdoing, arguing that they
were only looking into a constituent's problems, and that
they didn't delay the takeover of Lincoln. Lincoln, based in
Irvine, Calif., was seized by the government in April 1989.
Its failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   The ethics committee is investigating the actions of the
senators. Common Cause said it filed the brief "to address
arguments that Senate rules and standards do not explicitly
cover the actions involved."
   In a news release, Sen. McCain said Mr. Cox "is simply
saying people should be judged guilty by association." The
other senators couldn't be reached for comment.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Bush was asked if he agreed with his son,
Neil, who has suggested that savings-and-loan regulators are
conducting a vendetta against him because he is the
president's son. Neil Bush is being investigated by federal
regulators and lawmakers because of his past relationship
with the failed Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association
in Denver. Its losses from speculative loans and insider
transactions are expected to cost taxpayers as much as $1
billion.
   "As president, I'm determined to stay out of this and let
it {the system} work and let it work fairly," Mr. Bush said.
He added: "I have confidence in the honor and integrity of my
son. And if the system finds he's done something wrong, he
will be the first to step up and do what's right."

   Nynex Corp., which has had a lot of trouble this year, is
bracing for more.
   The telephone holding company was shocked by a record $1.4
million fine that the Federal Communications Commission
proposed in February after an FCC audit found $118.5 million
in alleged overcharges to its operating subsidiaries. Even
greater was the jolt in late May, when the company was
charged in a criminal indictment with violating the consent
decree that broke up the Bell System in 1984.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, another potential scandal is erupting at Nynex, one
that may do far more damage.
   As part of closed regulatory proceedings in a state rate
case for the company's New York Telephone unit, evidence has
surfaced about a series of bawdy gatherings at Florida
resorts. Nicknamed the "perverts' conventions" by
participants, the raucous, weeklong sessions were held
annually from 1984 to 1988. They allegedly involved improper,
if not illegal, business contacts between employees of
Nynex's purchasing unit, Materiel Enterprises Co., and about
30 Nynex suppliers, some of whom picked up much of the tab.
   According to rate-case documents, women were hired to
provide entertainment and sex for the attendees. Other
evidence being reviewed by state regulators draws a
correlation between suppliers' attendance at the conventions
and the volume of Nynex business steered to them. Questions
also have been raised about whether phone customers paid
higher rates because of deals cooked up by convention-goers.
   People familiar with the Florida meetings say one Nynex
employee won the "Procurement Award" for three consecutive
years, apparently for "arranging for women" for the
conventions. Others won the "Most Valuable Pervert Award" and
the "Moon Over Miami Award." A Nynex unit vice president,
dismissed for being the ringleader, eventually sued the
company. He won a $1 million settlement and gave the company
a pledge of silence.
   Nynex refuses to discuss the Florida meetings, citing its
policy against disclosing personnel matters. In arguments
presented in the New York rate case, the company contends
that such disclosures could strain marriages and hurt company
morale. Nynex also insists that the identities of those who
attended and the companies they represented, as well as the
alleged prostitution and other convention activities, are
"trade secrets" that needn't be disclosed.
   "We're not eager to try this thing in the press," a Nynex
spokesman says.
   But with all the revelations, a picture emerges of a
company that sometimes acted as if it wasn't subject to
certain regulatory rules or ethical standards. The record
also shows that Nynex officials hampered regulators by
holding back documents in the rate case and suggesting that
only people with dirty minds would pursue the Florida matter.
Moreover, Nynex has paid heavily for top-notch lawyers who
have kept a lid on public disclosures.
   The Nynex spokesman contends there was "never any
indication" that customers were harmed or that favoritism was
shown to suppliers. Once the company learned of
purchasing-unit problems, the spokesman says, Nynex "quickly
and efficiently took appropriate action." In rate-case
documents, Nynex representatives say that although suppliers
may have picked up hotel tabs for some Nynex employees, no
business was discussed at the conventions. In any event,
Nynex didn't knowingly pay any of the expenses.
   New York's attorney general is investigating allegations
of unusual transactions between company employees and certain
suppliers, possible insider trading in suppliers' stocks, and
suspected misallocations of lobbying expenses, charitable
donations and legal fees. In addition, the Manhattan district
attorney's office has been investigating alleged bid-rigging,
mostly on construction projects, by New York Telephone
employees.
   Under the cumulative weight of such developments, the New
York State Public Service Commission staff, the state's
Consumer Protection Board and other parties are preparing to
seek drastic reductions in the company's proposed $1.4
billion rate-increase request over three years.
   Another upshot is that Nynex has become the black sheep of
the Baby Bells. The federal indictment and proposed FCC fine
have not only hurt Nynex but also have tarred the six other
Bells trying to win credibility in their fight to get
Congress to lift all consent-decree restrictions. "We need
credibility to get our job done, and accusations like this
hurt all of us, because we are still viewed as the same,"
says Sam Ginn, the chief executive of Pacific Telesis Group.
   In fact, Sen. Daniel Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat and
chairman of the Senate Communications subcommittee, cites
Nynex's behavior in opposing a bill to allow the seven Bells
to make telephone equipment. The FCC overcharge case, which
regulators contend proves their ability to catch illegal
behavior, albeit five years after the fact, "is more an
example of regulation by good fortune, hardly a policy for
the long run," he says.
   In recent weeks, much of the drama has been unfolding in a
21st-floor conference room in an old New York Telephone
building overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. Public Service
Commission lawyers, members of the state attorney general's
staff and several men fired by Nynex -- all parties to the
rate case -- sit at a huge table cluttered with papers and
interrogate New York Telephone officials. The object: to
trace the sometimes-obscure ways money flows at the company.
   For five days, the lawyers deposed Guy Struve, a partner
at Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell whom Nynex retained in 1988 to
investigate the Florida meetings and other related
activities. After Mr. Struve's investigation, Nynex ended up
firing the alleged ringleader of the conventions, Lawrence
Friedman. Mr. Friedman had been Materiel Enterprises' vice
president for purchasing, reporting directly to the
subsidiary's president.
   Mr. Struve declines to comment about his work for Nynex.
Repeated attempts to reach Mr. Friedman were unsuccessful.
   After his dismissal, Mr. Friedman sued Nynex in state
court in Manhattan claiming religious discrimination -- he is
Jewish. Nynex has made at least one payment on the $1 million
settlement. A provision in the settlement tied future
payments over a 10-year period to Mr. Friedman's continuing
silence on the matter, but last month a New York Telephone
lawyer officially freed Mr. Friedman -- and others who had
signed similar settlements -- to talk to the PSC, the
attorney general's office and the Consumer Protection Board.
   One other employee, who assisted Mr. Friedman in planning
the conventions, was dismissed, and five more were
disciplined. People familiar with the company's security
procedures say the investigations left members of the Florida
convention group and other current employees spooked enough
to keep quiet.
   Mr. Struve's $500,000-plus investigation, supported by
Kroll Associates, a private investigative agency, produced
11,000 pages of documents and conclusions. A central
conclusion: The atmosphere at the conventions was "boys'
night out," with no serious talk of business.
   "One of the areas that we tried to question everybody
about was whether there was any discussion of business of any
sort at the conventions," Mr. Struve testified. "With two
exceptions, which I consider immaterial, the answer uniformly
was that there was absolutely no business discussion at any
of the conventions. Given the nature of the activities of the
conventions, that probably will not surprise you." Many of
the supplier employees, he added, weren't directly involved
in sales to Nynex.
   Just after the Florida investigation began, Mr. Struve
testified that he and a Davis Polk senior partner, Robert
Fiske, concluded that the conventions episode wasn't a matter
for prosecutors. When state and federal regulators arrived,
the company produced confidential files and studies that
indicated no favoritism was shown to suppliers who attended.
Regulators didn't investigate further.
   The 1988 investigation wasn't Mr. Friedman's first
go-round with Nynex; he was investigated by New York
Telephone security people in 1985 also involving the Florida
sessions. The company commissioned a follow-up review by the
New York law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy to see
whether it was missing something. The Nynex spokesman says
the investigation into unspecified allegations "came up with
nothing." That investigation and an earthy videotape for the
1987 convention that contained a brief appearance by another
Materiel Enterprises vice president poking fun at a
subordinate for attending the convention indicate that some
top officials at Materiel Enterprises knew about the
conventions.
   Some participants in the rate case strongly disagree with
the conclusion that there weren't any ties between sales to
Nynex and the cavorting with Materiel Enterprises officials
in Florida.
   "I don't know how Nynex's investigations could have missed
it, unless they really weren't looking," says Scott Rafferty,
a fired Nynex executive who initiated the Justice Department
investigations that led to Nynex's criminal indictment in
May. Mr. Rafferty took Nynex data that tracked the years that
each supplier had a representative at the Florida parties and
each supplier's sales to Nynex. Adjusting for companies that
didn't sell to Nynex, he ran the data through a computer to
find an average compounded annual growth rate.
   Mr. Rafferty found a strong correlation: For suppliers who
attended, sales grew an average of 67% over the years,
including later years when their employees may not have
attended. For suppliers not represented at the Florida
sessions, sales to Materiel Enterprises crept along with
about 3.5% growth.
   Mr. Rafferty was hired to direct the consulting operations
of Nynex's newly acquired Telco Research unit in the spring
of 1986. He said his salary was $110,000 a year. Then a
confident 30-year-old, he already had a solid resume:
Princeton undergrad, Yale law school, Rhodes scholar,
experience in telecommunications on Capitol Hill, and a stint
at McKinsey &amp; Co., the consulting firm.
   But Mr. Rafferty's vision of building a consulting
business at Nynex vanished quickly. In the fall of 1986, he
says, he questioned whether Telco's consulting activities
qualified under a waiver Nynex had received from the court
overseeing the Bell System consent decree. Shortly after
that, the consulting operation was disbanded, and he was
fired.
   Nynex maintains that the consent decree had nothing to do
with it. The company cites "business reasons" for disbanding
the unit and won't discuss the circumstances of Mr.
Rafferty's departure.
   Overnight, Mr. Rafferty became Nynex's worst nightmare: a
sharp, aggressive lawyer with abundant energy, intense
concern about his consulting clients and his reputation, and
a burning desire for vindication. Just after he was fired,
Barbara Morris, a Nynex lobbyist, passed along a suggestion
to Donald Reed, then head of Nynex's Washington office, from
a Nynex lawyer that "this guy should be neutralized fast . .
. before he goes over to DOJ {Department of Justice} and
suggests they look into Nynex operations for compliance" with
the consent decree. The Nynex spokesman says Ms. Morris was
trying "to find a way to defuse the tension."
   This spring, Mr. Rafferty and several other former Nynex
employees intervened in the New York rate case, and, in an
unusual twist, the parties to the case won the right to
depose New York Telephone witnesses.
   As a spinoff to that case, Mr. Rafferty recently filed a
complaint at the FCC alleging that Nynex improperly allocated
to New York Telephone and New England Telephone most of the
$7 million it paid to outside counsel, mostly Davis Polk, in
connection with a suit that he filed against Nynex and the
Justice Department investigations leading up to the
indictment.
   The legal fees are likely to keep piling up as Nynex gets
ready for trial in late autumn in federal court in Washington
on a charge of willfully providing prohibited information
services. Although the single charge that came out of the
two-year investigation seems small -- Nynex's Telco Research
unit provided certain computer services to MCI Communications
Corp. -- the trial is certain to draw considerable attention
as the first criminal case charging a violation in the
consent decree.
   In New York, the attorney general's office is also
investigating whether Nynex accounted improperly for
charitable donations and lobbying expenses. Already, the FCC
has excluded some lobbying expenses from interstate rates,
and the attorney general's office is investigating a long
roster of New York Telephone payments that may have gone to
charities but were listed under general and administrative
expenses. These include payments to such organizations as the
42nd Street Educational Theatre Culture, the Abraham Lincoln
Association and U.S. Olympic Committee.
   Regulators generally allow utilities to earn a set
percentage of profits on their rate base. So, if New York
Telephone's rate base was padded by improper accounting for
charitable donations and the like, or by inflating the cost
of goods that the phone company buys from another Nynex unit,
customers would wind up paying more for phone service the
next time rates are reset.
   Whether consumers have paid anything extra, or how much,
is uncertain because a rate moratorium has been in effect in
New York for the past few years. New York Telephone contends
that it has been making less than the 14% of its rate base it
is permitted to earn.
   In addition to the rate case, investigators at the New
York state attorney general's office are delving into company
documents and depositions that could shed light on special
ties between Materiel Enterprises personnel and suppliers.
   "Obviously, our first priority is the rate case, but there
are footprints all over the place," says Charles Donaldson, a
lawyer in the attorney general's office. "It is a question of
which trail to follow."

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)
CONGRESS (CNG)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Congress is spending so much energy on the
NEA squabble this season that it is failing to plug an arts
drain gurgling right here by the Potomac. The sum at issue in
the noisy NEA debate is $170 million. Meantime, a smaller but
significant flood of federal dollars -- $45 million -- seems
set to pass with little audible protest. The recipient: this
city's Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
   The funding of Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotica might not
seem to fall into the same category as the red-carpet sort of
arts activities -- symphony performances, inaugural balls --
that go on at Kennedy Center. But the National Endowment for
the Arts and the Kennedy Center are part of the same issue:
Does government owe the arts? To this question, the Kennedy
Center brings a second: Should government pay to make
Washington an arts capital?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To judge by some action behind doors here, Washington
thinks the answers are "yes." When Congress first created the
arts center as a "living memorial" to John F. Kennedy 25
years ago, it created an entity that today collects some $6
million in federal money annually. According to the center's
new chairman, James Wolfensohn, that amount is not enough.
"Bankrupt" was the first term he used to describe the
center's financial status when he took office this spring.
Before he even took his title, he collected promises from
congressmen and the White House for a onetime $45 million
rescue to pay off old debts and fix up the plant. Since he's
been chairman, he's busied himself sweet-talking
congressional committees in the name of deepening the
connection between government and the arts and making the
Kennedy Center into a national institution.
   Mr. Wolfensohn, of course, can't be blamed for a mess he
inherited. And it is hard to fault him for cutting a deal
before taking a job -- it shows the same kind of tactical
talent he displays in his main career, as a world-class
adviser to investors in New York. It's true, too, that the
Kennedy Center is in need of repair: Since architect Edward
Durrell Stone's large Kleenex box of a structure opened in
1971, more than 66 million visitors have worn down its six
stages. Its garage needs a $15 million fix-up. The humid air
of Foggy Bottom has warped its white Carrara marble walls.
Sculptor Robert Berks's oversized, unflattering bust of John
F. Kennedy -- modeled in dotted clay that gives the president
a far worse complexion than he ever suffered from in real
life -- might also be a candidate for replacement.
   Wolfensohn and Co. have a new arts agenda they hope will
put the Kennedy Center in the black -- and that, in future,
private funding will pay for all programming. For decades the
center's six theaters have featured a mishmash of programs --
some to packed audiences, some, like director Peter Sellars's
experimental projects, poorly attended. Packaging is the
Wolfensohn answer to this scattershot approach. A Texas
Festival is scheduled for next June, and the center is at
work planning a mega-festival in 1992 to honor Christopher
Columbus's discovery 500 years before.
   Four million Americans now converge on the Kennedy Center
each year. Mr. Wolfensohn wants to draw even more. He's also
setting up a new television project to broadcast Kennedy
Center performances nationally, creating a "seventh stage"
that would bring arts treasures to citizen homes.
   Under the Wolfensohn plan, though, this White (House)
Elephant may only grow larger. Some of the new-style projects
sound exciting, but they are contingent on an old-style
bailout. The Kennedy Center explains its troubles by pointing
out that the Center is a presidential monument -- and as such
is a legitimate recipient of federal monies. Much of the
fix-up money will go to the repair of that monument, whose
annual maintenance already costs more than that of the more
modest Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, Thomas
Jefferson Memorial and Vietnam Veterans Memorial combined.
   What, though, is wrong with going to citizens now for
private gifts for the fixup? Back in the early 1960s,
Washington felt government ought to help fund the culture
that would yield a more habitable town. If the argument was
suspect then, today it borders on ridiculous. This is the
city of the Beltway, the city that these days is advancing on
New York as the nation's culture capital. It is the capital
that now sustains a nine-screen cinema, an Ann Taylor, and a
pack of eateries in formerly grimy Union Station. Surely, its
citizens have pockets deep enough to subsidize a major arts
center through charity.
   The problem is in part one of sheer civic selfishness.
When other American towns have experienced booms like
Washington's they've built privately funded monuments to
public pride and responsibility. Parents from Bethesda may be
dragging their youngsters to Kennedy Center performances of
the National Symphony Orchestra, and White House staffers
certainly enjoy the perk of access to the White House's
Kennedy Center box. But when it comes to funding their
entertainment, these folks go where Washingtonians have
always gone: Capitol Hill.
   A glance at the balance sheet of another "presidential"
culture venue, New York City's Lincoln Center, provides a
damaging comparison. In some senses, the finances of the two
centers are similar. Putting aside Mr. Wolfensohn's $45
million request for the Kennedy Center and money that goes to
the upkeep of the Kennedy Center "as monument," government's
(including state and local government money in the case of
Lincoln Center) contribution to both centers is about 3% of
their budgets. The difference is that Lincoln Center receives
about $69 million a year in gifts from corporations,
foundations, members and individuals. These days, the Kennedy
Center gets about $14 million.
   Other models too exist for the Kennedy Center to copy. One
of them is New York's Carnegie Hall, whose admirable chairman
is Mr. Wolfensohn himself. Carnegie Hall does avail itself of
some government services -- the city of New York, for
example, is kind enough to cart away its garbage. But Mr.
Wolfensohn has kept Carnegie Hall out of deficit. That's
probably a good thing too, given New York's restrictions on
public spending and Mayor David Dinkins's obsession with
balancing the budget. Unlike Congress, the New York mayor
knows what he can't afford to fund.
   Beyond the balance-sheet questions here lies a deeper
issue: the role of a capital in a free country. Centralizing
culture at the taxpayers' cost is a fine tradition. Kings in
old Europe did it regularly, and produced many of the world's
most pleasurable cities -- witness Paris, or London, or Mr.
Wolfensohn's own example, Moscow. But the tradition is not
really an American one -- Americans like their culture
supplied where it grows, in small towns and cities.
   Seen in this light, the Kennedy Center is a more dubious
candidate for funding than even the much-beleaguered NEA
grantees. When NEA money goes to, say, the Dallas Opera, the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis or Chicago's Lyric Opera,
that money is going to true grass-roots projects, however
iffy the taste of some of those projects might be.
Nevertheless, NEA funding is likely to be the subject of more
windy battles in coming weeks, while the Kennedy Center --
tied in the same bit of legislation -- should pass without
comment.
   There are those, of course, who argue that the Kennedy
Center with all its troubles is an appropriate reminder of
the arrogant Kennedy era. The president lobbied the city for
a national culture center, and the Kennedy Center is a
living, tax-eating example of the costs of that kind of
commitment. You don't have to love John Kennedy, though, to
wish him a different sort of memorial. Take away Robert
Berks's pock-faced statue, and let Foggy Bottom's Kleenex box
earn its own keep. Then, it might conform to more citizens'
vision of an American Camelot.

   MANZANILLO, Mexico -- The gales that buffet this big
Pacific port never hindered exporters as much as the
dilapidated two-lane highway leading here from the produce
markets of Guadalajara. "When that road went out, meat and
vegetables would sit rotting in trucks," says Antonio Rivas,
a port official.
   The road to Manzanillo will soon be less toilsome.
Construction crews are finishing work on two additional
lanes, which should nearly halve the time of the five-hour
trip from Guadalajara. What makes the project really notable
-- a complete departure from Latin American traditions -- is
that much of the investment is coming from a private company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As Mexico accelerates its export-based growth plan by
seeking a free-trade pact with the U.S., the country's
decaying infrastructure has emerged as the "Achilles heel of
the economy," according to Ernesto Warnholtz, head of
Mexico's largest exporters association. To resolve the
problem, the government is pursuing an ambitious plan to cede
control of projects like roads, bridges and ports to the
private sector.
   Since President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office in
December of 1989, the government has awarded private
concessions for 1,600 miles of four-lane highways that will
be operated as toll roads. About 900 additional miles of
highways will be put up for bid soon. Officials in Mexico
City have called on private investors to bid on concessions
for bus routes. Private concerns are also being given a
greater hand in investments in ports and thermoelectric
plants.
   Above all, Mexico is counting heavily on foreign investors
to finance infrastructure. The government has designated
infrastructure projects and privatization of government-owned
enterprises as the only two areas that will be open to
investors participating in its revamped debt-for-equity swap
program. The first round of bidding on the swaps, in which
the government and its lenders transfer Mexican foreign debt
to investors in return for equity in investment projects, is
scheduled for this month.
   While not all businessmen are eager to sink their money
into such long-term, brick-and-mortar projects, the mere idea
of allowing private investment in infrastructure represents a
radical change in Mexico. In part, the government
stranglehold on infrastructure reflected statist economic
policies long prevalent in the developing world. Also,
pork-barrel projects like roads and bridges helped Mexico's
ruling political party achieve the longest-running reign in
the non-Communist world.
   But the money to support such projects dried up with the
emergence of the 1982 debt crisis. Since then, more than half
the Mexican budget has been directed toward service of its
domestic and foreign debts. Total public investment fell to
3.5% of gross domestic product last year from 12.5% of GDP in
1981. Infrastructure bore the brunt of the cuts.
   -- Public investment in roads has declined to 0.35% of GDP
last year from 0.75% of GDP in the late 1970s. Some 2,000
miles of highways and 5,000 miles of rural roads are needed,
beyond the 2,500 highway miles already up for bid, according
to Victor Mahbub, subsecretary of infrastructure in the
Mexican Transportation Ministry. Almost all the bridges in
the country, he adds, need to be refurbished.
   -- Public investment in rural development has fallen to
0.35% of GDP last year from 1.4% in 1981. Investment on
construction and maintenance of irrigation projects has
fallen by 90% in real terms since 1981, with a resulting 20%
decrease in total acreage under irrigation. Private farmers
have also cut expenditures. The number of new tractors
purchased fell to 5,800 last year from 18,600 in 1981.
   -- Public investment in electricity has fallen by 60% in
real terms since 1981, to its level of the mid-1970s,
according to a study by Mexico's major business lobby.
   How badly Mexico's infrastructure had deteriorated became
evident last year when the economy began growing at twice the
pace originally projected by the government. Suddenly,
bottlenecks attributable to shoddy infrastructure emerged in
nearly every sector of the economy.
   Indians in the mountains of southern Mexico were reduced
to bartering a pound of corn for a pound of coffee, which is
10 times more expensive. The reason: It was almost impossible
to transport corn up the mountains from the northern
farmbelt. Grupo Gutsa S.A., a leading conglomerate, couldn't
find any ships to import ingredients for a popular brandy it
produces.
   "Everyone in business here became aware that the lack of
infrastructure might stop Mexico from growing," says Juan
Diego Gutierrez Cortina, president of Gutsa.
   Since Gutsa also has a construction subsidiary, it has
been able to do something about the problem. The company will
soon finish work on a $30 million international bridge
between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, Texas. Border businessmen
are thrilled that the bridge will speed the flow of traffic
between assembly plants on the Mexican side of the border and
warehouses on the U.S. side. Gutsa and other construction
companies are also happy to have work again after seeing
business plummet because of the debt crisis.
   One big problem is financing. Interest rates in Mexico
have been prohibitively high since the economy soured. To
help finance the bridge, Gutsa's bank made the first issue of
infrastructure bonds in the local stock market. The Gutsa
issue was well received, but analysts say it will be
difficult weaning Mexican investors away from
higher-yielding, shorter-term investments such as government
treasury bills. "Almost nobody in Mexico knows what it is to
save over the long-term," says one government finance
official.
   Catching the eye of foreign investors, who would be
allowed up to 49% participation in most projects, is another
big challenge. So far, according to Mr. Mahbub, one foreign
group nibbled on a highway project, but finally backed off to
invest in a business that offerred a faster return. He says
inquiries from foreigners are increasing.
   Some businessmen say that the government has to do more to
make the investments appealing. With public investment in
railroads falling by 50% in real terms since 1985, the state
railroad monopoly recently began allowing private companies
to buy or lease their own boxcars. But business has reacted
coolly, because companies who buy their own boxcars don't
receive a discounted shipping rate. "Things are moving in the
right direction, but there's still not enough incentive for
the private sector," says Juan Manuel Correa, general manager
of the Union Pacific Railroad Co. office in Mexico.

   In More TV Ads,

   A recent 30-second spot for Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee
starts out as clear and concise as could be, with bold shots
of the vehicle and music swelling in the background. But all
of a sudden, things aren't so clear any more: In the next
several seconds, five different, often lengthy disclaimers
flash on the screen in tiny, eye-straining type.
   In rapid fire, viewers with exceptional vision may be able
to spot almost a dozen different warnings, from "see dealer
for details and guaranteed claim form" to "deductibles and
restrictions apply." Then again, maybe not.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Supers -- as the lines of minuscule type that are
superimposed on the bottom of ads are called -- are growing
out of control, critics charge. Faced with a growing number
of legal and network restrictions, advertisers have loaded up
their ads with so many tiny lines of type offering product
disclaimers that even TV addicts with photographic memories
couldn't decipher all of them. Network executives are
starting to wonder how to tackle the monster they've created
-- a monster sprung largely from their own tangle of rules
and regulations. Bleary-eyed consumers, meanwhile, are
beginning to get angry at the onslaught.
   Consumer advocates charge that advertisers are stuffing
their ads with supers only because they don't really want to
disclose the information in the first place. "Marketers try
to make this type as inconspicuous as possible," sniffs Alex
Markovich, a senior editor at Consumer Reports magazine.
"Consumer suspicions should rise in direct proportion to the
lack of legibility of the message on the screen."
   Clearly, supers are no longer limited just to aspirin
commercials warning "use only as directed." Federal
regulations have made car makers perhaps the worst offenders.
Other big guys like American Express and AT&amp;T also fill their
ads with supers.
   Network executives say they're policing such ads and are
cracking down. "We often require revisions to supers to
ensure that they're legible," says Matthew Margo, vice
president of program practices at CBS. Some commercials, he
says, are "so saturated and cluttered with supers that it's
impossible to read."
   Mr. Margo, though, says CBS takes into account the media
buy behind a heavily supered ad when deciding if it is
acceptable. If an ad will run many times, CBS may be more
lenient in giving it the green light. Like other networks,
CBS has policies regulating the number of seconds supers must
stay on the screen.
   But Mr. Markovich and other consumer watchdogs argue that
if the fine print in commercials is important enough to be
included, it should be read loud and clear, on equal footing
with the rest of the announcer's script. Print ads are filled
with supers, too, but "at least there's some chance with a
print ad that a consumer can finally get the message if he or
she is determined enough," Mr. Markovich says.
   Even some advertisers concede consumers aren't served
particularly well by ads loaded with supers. "I can't say
that the legal requirements always add to the clarity of the
ad," says Dennis Driscoll, senior vice president at Fidelity
Investments. Fidelity's TV ads are jam-packed with supers
giving information about the "fund adviser" and "transaction
expenses," among other things.
   So confusing was one recent Fidelity ad that Consumer
Reports chided it, singling it out as one of the worst
offenders of fine print in advertising. The ad, Consumer
Reports wrote, "had four separate messages in blurry
legalese. The only understandable message there," according
to the magazine, "is `beware.' "
   Mr. Driscoll acknowledges the Fidelity ad is packed with a
lot of information. "Balancing good communication with the
legal requirements is difficult," he says. "What you're after
is a good clear sense that the consumer knows what we're
offering. . . . I think our ads do that."
   Jeep says the recent ad for its Cherokee has more supers
than usual because the ad promotes both a rebate and a
"0%-financing" special. "There were more disclaimers on that
ad than we usually like to use," says Tom Peyton, Jeep's
advertising manager. "But there is absolutely no intention at
all to deceive anybody."
   Advertising executives, for their part, insist supers play
a positive role in advertising, by helping consumers get more
information about a product or service. "I am not suggesting
that the ad industry is saintly," says Elaine Reiss,
executive vice president and general counsel at Ogilvy &amp;
Mather. "But I don't think any responsible advertiser or
advertising agency wants to intentionally harm consumers."

   Last year Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley shamed his
colleagues into amending the Americans With Disabilities Act
so they would be covered by the same anti-discrimination
rules binding business. On Tuesday, the Senators retreated
into hypocrisy as usual when they voted 63 to 26 to amend the
ADA conference report to once again exempt the Senate. The
same vote also exempted them from full coverage of the Civil
Rights Bill. GOP Senator Warren Rudman claimed there was
already a brief in-house rule that simply asks Members not to
discriminate. Senator Grassley noted this doesn't give Senate
employees recourse to the courts. "If a 150-word rule is good
enough for us," he asked, "why don't we repeal the hundreds
of pages of civil-rights law and make do with a simple rule?"
No one replied, but by their action the Senators have shown
they can't be bothered to live by the same rules they force
the rest of us to follow.

   First Executive Seeks to Block Release
   Of Reports It Says Are Favorable to It

   First Executive Corp., in an unusual move, is attempting
to keep secret the details of two influential consultants'
reports that the insurance holding company publicly has
heralded as proof of its underlying financial strength.
   The wounded insurance holding company and its two main
units obtained a temporary restraining order blocking release
of the reports by the New York Department of Insurance. The
department was to turn over the studies to Joseph Belth, the
publisher of a monthly newsletter, "Insurance Forum." Mr.
Belth, a frequent critic of First Executive, had sought them
under a state freedom of information action. The restraining
order was obtained Friday from a state court in New York
City.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles-based First Executive argued in its court
filing that the reports contain a wide range of delicate
proprietary information which, if released, "would cause
substantial injury" to its insurance units if competitors
latched on to details of products, pricing and future
strategy.
   But First Executive's effort to hide details of studies it
has heralded presents a delicate dilemma for the troubled
company in a worried market: "It looks like they're
stonewalling," said James Ramenda, an analyst at Northington
Partners Inc. in Avon, Conn.
   Among other things, First Executive has ballyhooed the
studies to policyholders, investors, and even a committee of
Congress. More importantly, the reports have become a focus
of analysis by state insurance regulators across the country,
who apparently have relied on the projections to conclude
that First Executive's troubled units should be allowed to
continue operations.
   The reports, prepared by the Seattle-based actuarial firm
of Milliman &amp; Robertson, were commissioned by First Executive
and its Executive Life Insurance Co., based in Los Angeles,
and Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York units under
orders from California regulators.
   The studies assess possible impacts of certain
hypothetical rates of holders turning in policies and
declines in the value of the company's vast junk bond
holdings. Although only two reports have been cited, a
regulator with knowledge of the analysis said yesterday that
nearly a dozen studies have been prepared to date by Milliman
&amp; Robertson, exposing the company's financial structure to
wide range of scenarios.
   First Executive has said the reports are good news. "In
our view, these studies illustrate the capital strength and
resiliency of Executive Life Insurance Co. and Executive
Insurance Co. of New York." Fred Carr, chairman and chief
executive officer, wrote shareholders in First Executive's
recently mailed annual report.
   In a four-page digest, distributed to policyholders,
investors, and the press in April, First Executive said that,
despite severe adverse hypothetical assumptions, the studies
found that Executive Life Insurance Co.'s book value would
actually rise from the $936 million reported for the end of
1989 to at least $1.01 billion by the end of 1994 and could
go as high as $2.13 billion at the end of that period under
the range of assumptions.
   Despite this apparent good news, First Executive in its
court filing argued that to go beyond the digest version
would disclose a wide range of propriety information,
including pricing assumptions, commission structure,
investment strategy, and crediting of interest-rate costs.
   Mr. Belth, echoing skepticism about the report by some
within the industry, said, "I think it's only reasonable that
people be allowed to scrutinize a study that First Executive
asserts proves its financial soundness."
   Mr. Belth's lawyer, David C. Vladeck, of the
Washington-based Public Citizen Litigation Group, said Mr.
Belth will oppose First Executive's request for a permanent
injunction barring release of the reports. A hearing is
scheduled for Tuesday. Mr. Vladeck said First Executive's use
of the report to assert financial viability on one hand while
on the other declining to release its full contents "amounts
to a sophisticated game of hide-the-ball."
   Copies of the reports also are being sought by a
congressional committee. In testimony last month, First
Executive's chairman, Mr. Carr, told the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigation the reports were favorable to
the company and promised that a copy would be provided for
the committee record -- indicating public disclosure. John B.
Chesson, counsel to the subcommittee, said yesterday that,
despite "pursuing it with all due vigor," the committee has
yet to receive a copy of the reports.
   A spokesman for First Executive said the company would
provide a copy to the subcommittee, but only on a
confidential basis.

   PARIS -- The rise in consumer prices in the Western
industrialized countries slowed in May to the lowest monthly
rate this year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said, reporting that the average increase for its
24 member countries was 0.5%, down from 0.7% in both March
and April.
   Consumer price growth in the European Community was 0.4%
in May, down from 0.9% in April, partly reflecting Britain's
recent, so-called poll tax. Seasonal factors caused Japanese
price growth to remain at the high 0.8% level recorded in
April.

<TEXT>
   For the 12 months through May, the OECD inflation rate was
unchanged from April at 6%. Excluding Turkey, where consumer
prices rose 3.1% in May, the OECD year-to-year average was
4.6%.

   China Conditions

   The Houston summit got the China question out of the way
early on, essentially telling the Japanese it was their
business if they wanted to reactivate a $5.2 billion,
five-year line of credit to China. Beyond that, the
summiteers didn't have much to say about China. Still, one
could argue that the summit did set conditions for any
eventual help for China, namely the ones laid out for the
Soviet Union: "Introduce more radical steps toward a
free-market economy."
   We hope this is essentially the message given repeatedly
to the mayors of six big Chinese cities who've just been sent
off on a 20-day tour of seven American cities. Leading the
group is Shanghai's Mayor Zhu Rongji, who is here to seek
backers for his vision of a multibillion-dollar special
industrial zone near Shanghai.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Funding for the tour, set up by the private National
Committee on U.S.-China Relations, includes a $55,000 grant
from the U.S. Information Agency. It is a minor sum, but one
provided by U.S. taxpayers and it suggests a further thaw in
U.S. relations with Beijing's Communists.
   Yet Beijing has made no basic reforms since Tiananmen, or
actually since about 1986. To the contrary, it has tightened
economic and political control with a more active informer
network and has taken a backflop into deeper central
planning.
   Still, there are obviously strong tendencies in the West,
notably at the White House, to get on with the business of
"helping" China. We are asked to believe that "Realpolitik"
demands nothing less. There's the
China-must-not-sink-into-isolation argument. There's even the
Chinese government's line that in killing democrats it only
did what it had to do to preserve "stability."
   But Japan's Prime Minister Kaifu, President Bush and
private investors should take a closer look at China's
economic quicksand before entertaining thoughts of pouring in
fresh resources. The CIA's annual report on China's economy,
released June 28, predicts "continued weaknesses," and says
that "the growth rate of the once vibrant rural industrial
sector has dropped sharply, and the production of state-run
enterprises remains sluggish." The report adds that last year
more than one million local enterprises, mostly on the farms,
had to shut down for lack of credit and raw materials, which
had been diverted to big wasteful state enterprises.
   For all the rightly praised reforms of the early 1980s,
China remains a state-planned economy, with no system of
property rights or independent law. Uncertainty about the
likely upheavals in the "stable" government after the death
or fade-out of 85-year-old Deng Xiaoping is also taking its
toll. For the country's most creative people, it is safest
right now to do nothing.
   Private investors might also consider the recent report by
The Asian Wall Street Journal's Julia Leung, that China's
government "is dragging its feet in honoring loan guarantees
issued by troubled state enterprises." Better also to
remember that China's government wants to keep monopoly
control over raw materials while pursuing a parallel market
economy. This is precisely the recipe for arbitrage between
state and quasi-private enterprises that by early last year
had produced graft, wild state spending, soaring inflation --
and had many Chinese contractors reneging on agreements with
foreign businesses.
   Prior to Tiananmen, China would have been very much on the
menu of topics discussed at an economic summit such as that
in Houston. Today, sadly, it is barely a footnote to the
agenda.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Industrials Leap 41.83, End 3 Points
   From All-Time High; Oils Strong

   NEW YORK -- The stock market, propelled by an
across-the-board rally in oil issues and several waves of
futures-related buying, moved sharply higher in moderate
trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average scored its biggest gain
in about a month by climbing 41.83 to 2932.67 -- about three
points away from its all-time high of 2935.89, set June 15.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
jumped 4.74 to 361.23, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index gained 2.35 to 197.11 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index added 3.85 to 335.79. Advancers led decliners on the
New York Stock Exchange by 971 to 506.
   Big Board volume rose to 162,220,000 shares from
147,630,000 Tuesday, reflecting what several traders
described as only a modest increase in activity by
institutional investors despite the market's steep climb.
   "Certainly the volume doesn't show that institutions are
heavily involved," said W. Daniel Williams III, a vice
president of trading at Dillon, Read &amp; Co., adding that buy
programs linked to stock-index arbitrage "were floating
around, in and out, at different points of the day."
   The bulk of the arbitrage-related buying -- purchasing
baskets of stocks and selling futures contracts to lock in
profits from differences in price between them -- hit the
market from midday onward, traders said.
   Meanwhile, at least five major brokerage houses made
favorable comments on oil stocks following two developments
that pointed to a possible cutback in the world's oversupply
of petroleum:
   -- News that oil ministers of five Persian Gulf nations,
all members of OPEC, agreed that the cartel should maintain
its current output ceiling of 22 million barrels a day until
oil prices rise to an "acceptable" level.
   -- Statistics from the American Petroleum Institute that
showed that inventories of crude oil fell nearly 3.7 million
barrels last week, a sharper decline than expected.
   The futures price of crude oil for August delivery went up
53 cents a barrel in New York trading, to $17.47, after
climbing 36 cents a barrel Tuesday. By comparison, the five
OPEC oil ministers agreed that the current priority is to
restore oil prices to "at least" $18 a barrel.
   Bernard J. Picchi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said
both oil stocks and oil prices may continue to advance if the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets
July 25, can rein in overproduction among some of the
cartel's members. That possibility "is enough to make some
investors throw their hat in the ring" and buy the stocks, he
said.
   Activity was especially brisk in Unocal, which gained 1
1/2 to 27 3/4 in Big Board composite trading of 1.6 million
shares. Among other oil issues, Exxon advanced 1 1/8 to 47
7/8, Chevron climbed 1 5/8 to 71, Texaco went up 1 3/8 to 58,
Mobil rose 1 3/8 to 61 5/8 and Amoco rose 1 1/4 to 51 3/4. Du
Pont, which owns Conoco, rose 1 to 38 3/8.
   In the oil field-services sector, Baker Hughes rallied 1
3/8 to 27 3/4, Schlumberger gained 1 3/8 to 57 5/8,
Halliburton rose 1 3/4 to 47 3/4 and Rowan climbed 5/8 to 11
7/8.
   Shares of food and drug retailers rallied as the market
responded favorably to quarterly earnings reports from
Safeway, which gained 1/2 to 16 5/8, and Walgreen, which
climbed 2 1/2 to 52 7/8. Safeway's second-quarter earnings
more than tripled from the year-ago level; Walgreen reported
a 13% increase in net income for the fiscal quarter ended in
May.
   Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, a specialty retailer, added 1
1/2 to 24 7/8. The company said it is comfortable with Alex.
Brown &amp; Sons' second-quarter earnings estimate of 20 cents a
share, revised upward Tuesday from 17 cents.
   Investors also continued to favor other issues viewed as
most likely to deliver better quarterly earnings. Among blue
chips, Philip Morris added 1 1/8 to 49 1/4, Merck rose 1 7/8
to 88 1/4, Boeing advanced 1 1/2 to 61 1/2 and General
Electric rose 1 3/8 to 72 1/8.
   Earnings-related selling hurt Hilton Hotels, which dropped
1 1/2 to 51 1/2. The company reported that second-quarter net
fell 9% from a year earlier; analysts had generally expected
the company to report higher earnings.
   Systems Center, which estimated that it would report a
second-quarter loss of between 22 cents and 25 cents a share,
plummeted 4 1/8 to 17 7/8 on 586,900 shares -- more than 22
times its average daily volume. Also, John J. Barry resigned
as the company's president.
   DeSoto, whose board approved the sale of two subsidiaries
for $200 million, jumped 5 1/2 to 45. The company said it
plans to distribute proceeds from the sales, as well as
excess funds in its pension plans and proceeds from sales of
two other units currently on the block, to its shareholders
after setting aside reserves for taxes and repaying debt.
   American Cyanamid rose 1 to 60 7/8 as rumors circulated
that Warner-Lambert may be interested in acquiring the
company in a stock swap. Both companies declined to comment
on the rumors after they surfaced earlier this week.
WarnerLambert added 7/8 to 66.
   Ferro advanced 1 1/4 to 27 3/4. The State of Wisconsin
Investment Board disclosed that it has a 5.1% stake in the
company. A spokesman for investor Jon M. Huntsman, who has
clearance to purchase as much as 15% of Ferro's common stock,
said the board's purchase won't affect Mr. Huntsman's plans.
   Cray Research advanced 2 3/8 to 47 3/8 after Piper,
Jaffray &amp; Hopwood repeated a buy recommendation on the stock.
Analyst Roger W. Redmond said he expects the company to post
strong second-quarter earnings; his estimate for the period
is $1.20 a share, compared with 15 cents in the year-ago
period.
   Hartmarx, which said it plans to shut down 65 stores and
sell its minority interest in an affiliate as part of a
restructuring, rose 1 to 11 3/8. The company reported a
second-quarter loss of $2.80 a share, including restructuring
charges, and cut its quarterly dividend 50%, to 15 cents a
share.
   Sea Containers jumped 4 1/8 to 66. The company increased
its quarterly payout to 35 cents a share from 15 cents.
   Public Service of New Mexico jumped 2 to 11 3/4. The
company said it had received "a preliminary expression of
interest" about a possible takeover from Wheeler Peak
Capital, where Al Robison, a former chief financial officer
of PS New Mexico, currently works.
   Network Equipment Technologies fell 1/2 to 8 1/4 on 1.1
million shares, including a single block of 898,600 shares,
representing a 6.5% stake. The block was traded at 7 3/4.
   Berlitz International, spotlighted in yesterday's "Heard
on the Street" column in this newspaper, went down 1 to 21.
Before the setback, the stock was trading at 36 times its
earnings for the past 12 months; even fans of the company
acknowledge that the stock is pricey, the Journal reported.
   Amre rose 1 3/8 to 6 after reporting that continuing
operations recorded a profit in the fiscal quarter ended in
April, compared with a year-ago loss. Separately, its board
approved the buy-back of as many as one million common shares
-- about 7.1% of its shares outstanding.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.68
to 359.41. Volume totaled 13,500,000 shares.
   Sanifill gained 2 1/8 to 27 1/8. The company said it
signed letters of intent to acquire three disposal sites for
non-hazardous waste; the site locations weren't disclosed.
   Balfour Maclaine climbed 1 1/8 to 7 5/8 following news
that top money manager Mario J. Gabelli, a director, nearly
tripled his stake by purchasing 13,000 shares last month.

membership application yesterday.
   A trade official said that as a condition of joining the

liberalize world trade, Venezuela had agreed to limit import
tariff levels to 50%, and to reduce them to 40% within two
years.

   Venezuela is the first member of the Organization of

   The trade official said GATT's regular council meeting
also heard that agreement had been finalized on the opening
of South Korea's markets to imported beef.
   Under the agreement, Seoul has to import at least 58,000
tons of beef this year.

   Inmac Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., in an effort to stem
operating costs, said it will reduce its work force at the
company's San Jose, Calif., plant by 73 workers, about 60% of
its work force, effective Aug. 31.
   Inmac, which makes a variety of products for use with
computers,, has more than 1,300 employees in nine countries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The San Jose plant, the company's only U.S.-based
manufacturing site, will be kept open and used as the
company's product testing center, with jobs for about 50 of
its 120 employees, said a company spokesman. Three vice
president positions have also been eliminated and their
responsibilities combined into one position.
   The reorganization will cost the company about $500,000,
or three cents a share, charged to its operating costs for
its fiscal fourth-quarter, ending July 28.
   The company said it made the move because increased
manufacturing capabilities at facilities in East Kilbridle,
Scotland, and Tijuana, Mexico, along with outside vendors can
adequately supply the company production needs.

   World Markets:
   Tokyo Stocks End Firmer as Yen's Big Advance,
   Lower Interest Rates Fuel Domestic-Demand Issues

   Tokyo stocks finished firmer as domestic-demand related
shares bounced up on the yen's sharp advance and on lower
interest rates on the bond market.
   London shares, meanwhile, rallied at the close of moderate
trading, with dealers citing a weaker pound and a strong Wall
Street performance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 141.75 points to
32294.18.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose
230.07 points to 32524.25.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
400 million shares, up from 352 million shares Tuesday.
Advancers outnumbered decliners 546 to 385, while 193 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section rose 13.80 points, or 0.59%, to 2351.57.
   The second section index advanced 19.07 points, or 0.43%,
to 4406.74. Volume in the section was estimated at 39.7
million shares, in line with 40.1 million shares Tuesday.
   As the dollar remained below 149 yen yesterday morning in
Tokyo following its substantial fall over the past few days,
stock prices moved narrowly at higher levels, helped by
rebounds on domestic demand-related shares such as
shipbuilding, construction, electric utilities and mining
companies.
   As the dollar further weakened, falling below 148 yen, the
Nikkei Index climbed as high as 32456 points midafternoon,
pushed up by buying by investment trust funds and
arbitragers, before declining on profit-taking, traders said.
   The firmness of the stock market relieved some traders who
had anticipated that concern about an official discount rate
increase by the Bank of Japan would continue to hurt the
stock market.
   Local analysts denied a possibility of an immediate
increase of the discount rate, with domestic prices remaining
stable in recent months.
   The stock market used to react wildly to the strengthening
of the yen, as it prompted expectations for lower domestic
interest rates. But yesterday's gains were rather modest
compared with the past, traders said.
   Because participants are sharing a belief that domestic
interest rates will remain at a high plateau for the
foreseeable future, the yen's strength wasn't able to prompt
active buying yesterday, observers said.
   Higher bond prices helped reduce anxiety about a discount
rate increase, but weren't enough to recall sidelined
investors, traders noted.
   Unless the yield on the 10-year government bond drops one
percentage point from the current 7.2%, the stock market
won't gain real energy, said Naoya Ozawa, research director
at James Capel Pacific, adding that such a drop is unlikely.
   Hironobu Hagio, manager of equity division at Nippon Life
Insurance, said "investors are losing confidence because they
haven't made profits (on stocks this year). A great number of
investors are sitting back and just watching the developments
on the currency market."
   Yesterday's advancers included shipbuilding companies,
such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which was up 18 yen to
990 yen (12 cents to $6.68). Also, interest rate-sensitive
electric power companies rose, with Tokyo Electric Power
advancing 150 yen to 4270 yen, while Chubu Electric Power
increased 80 yen to 3330 yen.
   Among domestic demand-related shares, construction and
housing issues gained broadly. Shimizu rose 50 yen to 2080
yen, and Daiwa House was up 50 yen at 2570 yen.
   Kirin rose 70 yen to 1880 yen, as the company raised 1990
sales and profit projections in view of unexpectedly strong
demand. Kirin's pretax earnings are now seen at about 75
billion yen, up 28% from the prediction of 58.5 billion yen.
   Kirin's gain also prompted buying for other breweries,
traders said. Asahi Breweries gained 20 yen to 1800 yen.
Sapporo Breweries rose 30 yen to 1600 yen. The rise in U.S.
shares helped London sustain early gains caused by an easing
pound. This removed some of the pressure from those stocks
that are heavily exposed to currency-exchange rates, with
most of those companies' earnings from overseas markets.
   Despite the rally, profit downgradings continued. But
after the battering to the market caused by downgradings in
recent sessions, dealers chose to ignore the fresh signals.
However, traders noted that some of the firming has to be
ascribed to markups by brokers.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ended
up 33 points, at 2360.5, the day's high. The Financial Times
30 Share Index was up 22.7 points at 1877.7. Volume was 447.8
million shares, edging up from Tuesday's 442 million issues.
   Among the handful of shares to ease were Lonrho, down a
penny to 262 pence ($4.77), Hawker Siddeley, down 5 pence at
610 pence, and Carlton Communications, down 4 pence at 509
pence.
   Meanwhile, Dixons rose 4 pence to 143 pence; the company
disclosed a 2.2% gain in pretax profit for the year ended
April 28, ahead of market forecasts.
   Granada slumped 13 pence to 218 pence after reporting a
12% decline in pretax profit for the half-year ended April
14.
   Those benefiting from a weaker pound included Reuters, up
24 pence at #12.83; Glaxo, up 23 pence at 852 pence; and
British Airways, up 3 pence at 218 pence.
   Rothmans gained 25 pence to 825 pence.
   Meanwhile, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich and Amsterdam, lower in Brussels, Stockholm and
Madrid, and mixed in Milan. South African gold stocks closed
higher.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Sydney, Singapore and Hong
Kong, mixed in Wellington and Manila, and lower in Seoul and
Taipei.

   New, FDA-Approved Test
   For Chlamydia Introduced

   Abbott Laboratories said it has introduced a new male
urine test for detecting chlamydia, the most common sexually
transmitted disease in the U.S. The test received Federal
Drug Administration approval a few weeks ago.
   Previously, urethral swabs were used for chlamydia testing
in men. Because those tests were more difficult to perform
and more painful, relatively few at risk sought testing, the
company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Abbott, a health-care products maker based in Abbott Park,
Ill., said the tests are important because chlamydia is
asymptomatic in up to 50% of men and 70% of women infected.
   The company said the world-wide market for chlamydia tests
is about $70 million to $80 million in annual sales, with the
U.S. accounting for 60%. Testing is expected to increase
about 50% now that the new test is available. Abbott, the
only U.S. company currently marketing the urine test,
believes that it could boost annual sales to as much as $120
million.
   If chlamydia is detected early enough, Abbott said,
antibiotics are more than 95% effective in treating the
infection.

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp. said
its board boosted by 10% its quarterly dividend on common
stock and expanded a stock repurchase program by $500
million.
   The dividend was increased to 21 1/2 cents from 19 1/2
cents a share, payable Sept. 4 to stock of record Aug. 13.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell, an aerospace, electronics, automotive and
graphics concern, also said it would purchase shares of its
stock on the open market "from time to time." At current
prices, the company said the extended program would reduce
the its shares outstanding by about 7.5%. The company has
about 241.6 million shares outstanding.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Rockwell closed at $27.125, down 12.5 cents.
   Rockwell said its stock repurchase program was launched in
March 1986. Since then, the company has spent about $1.42
billion to repurchase 63.9 million shares.

   A former Warner Communications Inc. shareholder filed a
lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court against Time Warner Inc.
alleging the shareholders were deprived of appraisal rights
when Time Inc. acquired Warner earlier this year.
   The lawsuit, filed July 9, alleges that Time "misled
shareholders into believing they didn't have appraisal
rights," according to David Brower, an attorney representing
the shareholder, Howard S. Klotz.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Klotz, however, asserts that Warner shareholders
indeed have such rights and, Mr. Brower said, "if appraisal
rights were to take place, Warner shareholders would get more
money."
   Mr. Brower said Mr. Klotz was "acting on behalf of all
Warner shareholders," and that he would seek class-action
status for the suit.
   A spokeswoman for Time Warner said the company had not
seen the suit and couldn't comment.

   Wages Rise 10% in Malaysia

   KUALA LAMPUR, Malaysia -- Wages rose 10% in the second
quarter from a year earlier as Malaysia's economic expansion
continued to strain the labor market, according to the
Malaysian Institute of Economic Research.
   In its quarterly survey on business conditions, the
institute said 44% of roughly 500 businesses polled said they
had raised their wages in the second quarter, compared with
35% a year earlier. With companies' production demands
growing faster than the skilled labor pool, "more firms are
now willing to provide training for workers. Other firms have
resorted to personnel pinching by increasing wages," the
institute said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The institute, financed by the government but
independently organized, said the competition for workers is
stiff.
   Official government estimates put Malaysia's unemployment
rate at between 7.5% and 7.9% in 1989 and predict moderate
improvement to about 7% this year. But analysts note the rate
for skilled workers is much lower, and labor shortages have
been reported in certain regions.

   Japanese Quietly Expand Role
   In Chicago's Futures Markets

   CHICAGO -- Plenty of Americans know that Japanese
investors have gobbled up Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc. and New York's Rockefeller Center. But with less
fanfare, the Japanese are also pouring money into trading in
the booming U.S. financial futures markets.
   It was only three years ago that Japanese securities firms
began buying seats on Chicago's Board of Trade and Mercantile
Exchange, the two biggest U.S. futures markets. Since then,
Japanese trading here has increased sharply.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese may already account for as much as 40% of the
volume in the bustling Eurodollar pit at the Chicago Merc,
where financial futures based on the fluctuation of
short-term interest rates are traded. Leo Melamed, chairman
of the Chicago Merc's executive committee, has predicted that
by 1992 a third of the Merc's total volume will come from the
Japanese.
   Yet while financial markets in Japan at times are given to
speculation, Japanese tastes here tend toward futures based
on bonds and interest rates, contracts frequently used to
hedge the risk of relatively conservative fixed-income
investments like U.S. Treasury bonds.
   "Certainly, Japanese investors have invested heavily in
U.S. Treasury bonds and related futures, but not much in U.S.
equities or the corresponding futures," said Nobuaki Ohmura,
executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc., a
unit of one of the "Big Four" Japanese securities firms.
   And as a rule, Japanese trading strategies are more
methodical and patient than those employed by American
traders. John Mitchell, a veteran trader in Eurodollar
futures at the Merc, spent 18 months working the Merc floor
for Daiwa. "A few of the Japanese traders are gunslingers,
with what you'd call American aggressiveness, but the vast
majority pick a trend and ride it out, for better or worse,"
said Mr. Mitchell, now employed by Chicago-based O'Connor &amp;
Co. "They have more money, so they have more patience. They
are less likely to bail out of a position if the price drops
a little."
   One reason for the caution is Japanese inexperience with
futures and options, so-called derivative products whose
values are linked to the performance of other investments. In
Japan, futures markets, while extremely active, are nascent
compared with Chicago's exchanges. And until 1987, the
Japanese Ministry of Finance prohibited the country's
institutional investors -- banks, pension funds and insurance
companies -- from trading directly in U.S. futures markets.
   Another factor, analysts say, is that the big Japanese
investors tend to turn their money over to managers on the
basis of Japanese corporate relationships, rather than
performance. That's in contrast to the U.S., where
competition for returns has forced many money managers to
trade futures and options in ever more sophisticated and
aggressive investing strategies.
   "In Japan, the fund managers are still chosen more than
anything based on historical relationships," said Nicholas
Ronalds, deputy managing director of the Chicago Merc's Tokyo
office. "When selection is done on that basis, performance
can fall pretty low as a priority for the money manager."
   Many big Japanese investors have been reluctant to dabble
in more speculative and abstract instruments and slow to
master complicated program trades that include heavy use of
stock-index futures and stock options. That's changing,
albeit slowly. Some Japanese firms are now trying to learn
index-arbitrage strategies, forms of program trading
involving large, computer-assisted stock trades tied to
offsetting stock-index futures transactions.
   For instance, Nomura Securities International Inc., the
U.S. subsidiary of the world's largest securities firm,
recently hired two former Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. executives to
revamp its operations here. One of the goals of Max C.
Chapman Jr., the new president of Nomura's U.S. unit, and
Joseph R. Schmuckler, a program-trading specialist hired as
senior vice president, is to improve the capability of
Nomura's sleepy U.S. division to exploit futures and options
markets.
   A few Japanese institutional investors such as Nippon
Credit Bank also are dabbling in complicated stock-index
futures trades. "We started out a few years ago in a
straightforward manner, buying and selling futures, using
them primarily to hedge," said Atsushi Sato, a vice president
in Nippon Credit's New York branch. "Since then, we've been
adding the so-called arbitrage trades."
   Other big Japanese investors have sought to acquire
no-wait expertise by forming alliances with experienced U.S.
futures and options trading firms. This week, for example,
Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp., Japan's largest trust bank,
announced a joint venture with a major U.S. trading concern,
Chicago Research &amp; Trading Group Ltd. Chicago Research,
headed by Joseph Ritchie, uses sophisticated computer trading
systems to execute tens of thousands of trades a day. By
forming a joint venture, Mitsubishi gains access to Mr.
Ritchie's expertise, and Chicago Research benefits from
Mitsubishi's rich reserves of capital.
   And while the volume of business done in stock-index
futures and options by Japanese investors remains relatively
small, that's far less true in the pits where Treasury-bond
and Eurodollar futures are traded. Treasury bond futures are
commitments to buy U.S. government bonds for the prevailing
price at a given date in the future. Eurodollar futures,
whose name refers to dollars held by investors outside the
U.S., are based on interest rates.
   Japanese trading in these products, which big investors
use to manage risk, is increasing quickly, according to
Japanese Ministry of Finance data. Analysts say this trading
reflects more speculation in the futures and a growing
understanding among Japanese investors of the need to hedge
to protect their large holdings of U.S. bonds and their
dollar-denominated accounts.
   In the Eurodollar market, for instance, trading by
Japan-based financial institutions rose to a monthly average
of 875,000 contracts during the first quarter of 1990. That's
up 18% from a 1989 first-quarter average of 743,000 contracts
a month. About 90% of those contracts were traded on the
Chicago Merc.
   What's more, these figures don't include trading by U.S.
branches and subsidiaries of Japanese institutions, and
analysts estimate that on some days the U.S. branches can do
nearly as much trading as investors based in Japan.
   In Treasury bond futures, Japan-based investors are
trading an average of about 568,000 contracts a month, up 49%
from 380,000 during the first quarter of 1989. The Chicago
Board of Trade accounts for about 95% of all those contracts.

earnings more than doubled on strength in two divisions.
   The Melville, N.Y., company told analysts that per-share
earnings reached about 55 cents to 60 cents, compared with 27
cents the year earlier. The estimates translate to net income
of $5.5 million to $6 million versus $3.2 million.
</LP>

   In a news release, the company didn't estimate revenue.
For the year-ago period, Allen Group's revenue was $94
million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Allen Group shares rose 37.5 cents to $19.
   The company's chairman and chief executive officer, Philip
W. Coburn, cited Allen Testproducts, which makes automotive
diagnostic and emission-test equipment, and Antenna
Specialists, which sells equipment for cellular-telephone
systems, as particularly strong-performing divisions.

   Big Guns Drawn in Tombstone Territory

   NEW YORK -- Regulators' latest crackdown on Wall Street's
traditional "tombstone" advertisements will be headed for an
early grave, if a couple of giant securities firms have their
way.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers is trying
to stem a recent burst of creativity in tombstones, those
normally staid ads with heavy black borders that are Wall
Street's way of publicizing new securities offerings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But in the process of trying to eliminate confusion for
investors, the NASD, an industry self-regulatory group, has
disturbed industry giants such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and
American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. The firms
are fuming about a proposed NASD rule that would ban
brokerage firms from using "fictitious names" -- meaning any
name that isn't the official name of the brokerage firm -- in
their tombstone ads.
   If forcefully applied, the rule would ban Merrill Lynch
from using Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in its tombstones,
and ban Shearson from using Lehman Brothers, the newly
resurrected name of its investment banking division, in these
ads. Shearson has built a whole strategy around bringing back
the Lehman name and using it for marketing purposes. And
Merrill Lynch, which plans to drop Capital Markets as a
marketing gimmick, anyway, still wants the right to use any
Merrill Lynch derivative it wants.
   A Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit,
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., also might have a problem
under the proposal, as it uses the name Prudential-Bache
Capital Funding in its tombstones.
   Now the ball is in the court of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, where the NASD plan requires approval.
The proposed rule, Shearson complains in a letter to the SEC,
"represents an unnecessary intrusion into the business
practices of Shearson Lehman." Merrill Lynch, in a separate
letter, huffs: "The proposed changes . . . compromise our
ability to compete in the marketplace."
   Prudential-Bache hasn't yet sent a letter to the SEC, but
a spokeswoman says the firm "has participated in discussions"
with Shearson and Merrill Lynch on the issue.
   The NASD plan comes as regulators are accelerating their
scrutiny of what firms tell the public about securities. Two
years ago, the SEC imposed tough new rules limiting what
mutual funds can state in newspaper and magazine ads. The
NASD "is stepping up the same way we stepped up in mutual
funds a few years ago," says Robert Plaze, assistant director
of the SEC's division of investment management.
   NASD officials say their proposed rule is part of a
broader effort to rein in some smaller brokerage firms'
increasing use of different names in ways that can confuse
investors. Clark Hooper, director of advertising for the
NASD, says the association has targeted "a lot of different
areas where we were seeing abuses. . . . Certain of our
members were allowing different names to be used by
{brokers}, for example, or specific branch offices, that were
not the name of the broker-dealer."
   In one instance, an NASD official says, a brokerage firm
with 21 branches has been doing business under a different
name in each branch. "We're trying to make sure the public
knows with whom they're dealing," Ms. Hooper says.
   Tombstones are simply formal announcements that a
brokerage firm has issued securities to the public. Though
the ads have been used in various forms since the early days
of Wall Street, current SEC rules on tombstones have been in
effect only since 1955.
   Regulators adopted strict rules governing tombstones
because they didn't want firms to be able to tell investors
so much about an offering that customers didn't have to get a
prospectus before buying. The ads can include a company's
logo. Ads for bonds also can include the securities' yield.
   But a recent NASD notice sent to brokerage firms reminds
the firms that under federal securities law, tombstone ads
for stocks, bonds and products such as limited partnerships
can't discuss investment objectives or "economic conditions,"
or include photos or statistical graphics.
   Not all tombstones are created equal. For example,
tombstone ads for mutual funds allow far more extensive
descriptions of the company and its operations than brokerage
firms' ads for stocks, bonds and limited partnerships. (The
SEC has regulated mutual-fund tombstones since the early
1970s.)
   The NASD says it has noticed problems with ads that
include the names of both brokerage firms and non-brokers,
such as financial planners. In its proposed regulation, the
association wants a clearer sense in ads of who is offering a
particular security.
   Any reference to a division of a brokerage firm must
include the parent's name, too, according to the proposed
rule. This is the part that rankles Merrill Lynch and
Shearson.
   In its letter to the SEC, Shearson says banning
"well-recognized trade names in tombstone announcements of
securities offerings" wouldn't serve any public good and
would crimp Shearson's efforts to "create the desired public
image for the firm." Even though Merrill Lynch will soon stop
using the name Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in its tombstone
ads, the firm wants to be sure it can use any variation of
its name in all its advertising and communications. (Merrill
Lynch doesn't want to be locked into using the cumbersome
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., the name of its
broker-dealer unit.)
   A sticky problem for regulators: If they make an exception
for Shearson or Merrill Lynch, they may be flooded with
complaints from hundreds of much smaller brokerage firms
seeking equal treatment.
   The whole issue is expected to be thrashed out tomorrow,
when the NASD board is to meet. Officials won't say whether
they will change the rule. But Joseph Hardiman, NASD
president, appears somewhat sympathetic to the issues raised
by Shearson and Merrill Lynch.
   "We never intended to impact, in tombstone ads, the
Merrill Lynches, or Pru-Baches or Lehman Brothers," Mr.
Hardiman says. For example, he says that the NASD realizes
that Lehman Brothers isn't a "totally fictitious" name, even
though it isn't a brokerage firm on its own. "We're
addressing that issue," he says.

   Chicago Merc Allows 2 Convicted Felons
   To Continue Trading for Own Accounts

   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange will allow two
traders convicted on felony charges in federal court Monday
to continue trading futures contracts for their own accounts
at the Merc pending a hearing on exchange disciplinary
charges that could result in their being expelled from the
exchange.
   The decision reflects the widespread belief among Merc
members that the two traders in Swiss franc futures, Robert
D. Mosky and Danny L. Scheck, were found guilty of relatively
minor trading transgressions and were unjustly singled out
for prosecution by the government, the traders' attorneys
said. The Merc said the two couldn't handle customer orders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Merc's decision is a "reflection of their sense of the
nature of the charges" against the traders, said Harvey
Silets, Mr. Scheck's attorney.
   The two traders were found guilty in U.S. District Court
here Monday on a total of eight felony charges of violating
the Commodity Exchange Act. The traders -- along with fellow
trader David Zatz, who was acquitted of two felony charges --
had been charged with more than 100 felony counts in the
first trial to result from the government's sweeping
undercover probe of futures-trading fraud at the Merc and the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   The eight guilty counts, seven against Mr. Mosky and one
against Mr. Scheck, involved $200 in customer profits,
according to the traders' lawyers.
   The jury couldn't reach a verdict on more than two-thirds
of the charges, including a tough racketeering conspiracy
charge against Mr. Mosky. The government said its initial
decision is to retry the traders on the deadlocked charges.
   In filing disciplinary charges against Mr. Mosky and Mr.
Scheck late yesterday, the Merc board of governors said it
will "carefully consider the gravity of the offenses of which
the defendants were convicted." A Merc spokesman said there
is no exchange prohibition against convicted felons owning
exchange memberships or trading.
   Mr. Mosky, 34 years old, a broker in the Merc's Swiss
franc futures trading pit, and Mr. Scheck, 28, a so-called
local Swiss franc trader who didn't handle customer orders,
were each charged by the Merc with one major and one minor
violation of catchall exchange rules.
   The major offense, for committing an act that is
"substantially detrimental to the interest or welfare of the
exchange," carries a maximum penalty of expulsion, a $250,000
fine, or both. The minor offense, for "conduct which has a
manifest tendency to impair the dignity or the good name of
the exchange," has a maximum penalty of a one-year
suspension, a $25,000 fine, or both.
   The board of governors' hearing on the charges isn't
likely to be held for a month or two, the Merc spokesman
said.
   The traders could also be subject to sanctions from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission based on the guilty
findings, once they have been sentenced.

   WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators canceled a session
planned for today amid indications that the parties are
searching for a way to finally begin discussing the delicate
issue of which taxes to raise.
   Taxes have been conspicuously absent from the summit
discussions so far, and negotiators say they must begin
talking specifics soon if they are to have any hope of
reaching a fiscal 1991 deficit-reduction accord this summer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Staffers said today's session was canceled to allow
smaller private meetings among key players, who would discuss
not only taxes but also the best way to move the talks
forward. "This is supposed to be a sign of progress," said a
senior Republican aide. "After a while, you've got to get out
of the room and get some work done."
   "We need to see if we can't direct proposals into some
channel that will speed our effort," said Sen. Wyche Fowler
(D., Ga.).
   Outside the summit, Democratic and Republican maneuvering
on taxes is intensifying. Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell (D., Maine) told reporters yesterday that he won't
go along with a cut in the capital-gains tax unless the
marginal income-tax rate for the richest taxpayers is raised
to 33% from 28%.
   A group of moderate Democrats held a news conference just
outside the summit meeting to demand that any tax increases
be borne by the wealthy, not the middle class. "We can't let
Bush begin the '90s by raising taxes on the middle class,"
said Rep. Dave McCurdy (D., Okla.). The statement drew an
angry response inside the summit from White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu, according to participants.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Richard Armey (R. Texas) won permission
from House Republican leaders to put an anti-tax resolution
to a vote by the Republican rank-and-file next Wednesday. The
resolution opposes "new taxes and all tax rate increases,"
wording intended to cover not only income-tax increases but
higher federal taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. Oregon Sen.
Robert Packwood, the senior Republican on the Finance
Committee, told reporters that "Republicans still need to
agree amongst themselves" on taxes.
   Budget negotiators devoted yesterday's session to
reviewing proposals for money-saving changes to government
benefit programs. Republicans are insisting that the summit
produce at least $10 billion in savings from such programs in
the fiscal year starting Oct 1. Participants said yesterday's
discussion made abundantly clear that achieving that goal
will require politically unpalatable moves such as charging
the elderly more for Medicare or trimming Social Security
cost-of-living adjustments.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury said it will run out of cash in
mid-August unless Congress lifts the current $3.123 trillion
ceiling on federal borrowing. Treasury Undersecretary Robert
Glauber asked that the House Ways and Means Committee
consider increasing the limit to $4.053 trillion, high enough
to cover borrowing expected through fiscal 1993.
   Because an increase in the debt ceiling is considered a
must-pass bill, it often attracts unrelated and controversial
amendments. With budget talks under way, the Ways and Means
Committee is likely to approve increasing the ceiling to
permit borrowing for a few months. The ceiling then would
have to be raised again this fall, presumably after the
budget talks are completed.

   Shorewood Packaging Corp. directors authorized the New

one million, or 7.6%, of its 13.2 million common shares
outstanding, in open-market transactions.
   The authorization will be 1.5 million shares after a
3-for-2 stock split, payable about Aug. 6. After the split,
Shorewood will have 19.8 million shares outstanding.

   Chairman Paul B. Shore said the company has completed a
capital spending program. "Absent a major acquisition, which
we have not identified at this time, we believe that the
optimum use of the free cash flow currently being generated
by Shorewood is to repurchase our shares," he said.
   The company's packaging is used in diverse industries,
including music, home video, tobacco, film and cosmetics.

   HAMILTON, Bermuda -- Sea Containers Ltd. more than doubled
its quarterly common stock dividend to 35 cents a share from
15 cents.
   The shipping concern, which announced the move at its
annual meeting, said the increased dividend would be payable
Aug. 12 to stock of record Aug. 6.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sea Containers also said its board, before year end, will
consider paying a stock dividend and retiring the company's
highest dividend preferred stocks. Sea Containers has four
sets of preferred. Its convertible cumulative preferred, with
about 176,000 shares outstanding, pays the highest dividend
at $4.125 a share per year.
   Sea Containers said that decisions regarding the stock
dividend and the retiring of some preferred stocks have been
delayed because of "technical and tax considerations." The
company didn't elaborate.
   Sea Containers' president, James B. Sherwood, said the
company's ferry and port revenues were slightly below
predicted levels for the year to date. But he added that
those figures were offset by a drop in fuel prices and the
strength of the British pound, which will translate into
greater dollar profits.
   Mr. Sherwood also said that container lease revenues are
roughly in line with expectations, with weak demand for some
older refrigerated containers being compensated by
higher-than-expected demand for other types.
   Mr. Sherwood didn't provide any specific figures for
expected revenue or earnings.

   The Federal National Mortgage Association's net income

   Roger Birk, Fannie Mae president and chief operating

increase in the average investment balance, an increase of
four basis points in the net interest margin and growth of
$8.3 million in mortgage-backed security guaranty fees.
   Mr. Birk also said the government-sponsored agency
acquired 2,315 properties through foreclosure in the second
quarter, down from 2,455 a year ago. At the same time,
charge-offs to Fannie Mae's allowance for loan losses were
$59.4 million, virtually unchanged from $59.1 million in the
first quarter of 1990 and down from $71.4 million a year ago.

   WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved
a $20.7 billion Treasury and Postal Service spending bill
that would increase Internal Revenue Service funding by 11.5%
in fiscal 1991 and mandate stepped-up tax enforcement against
foreign-owned U.S. companies.
   More than $6.13 billion would be provided for the IRS in
the new budget year beginning Oct. 1. By a 19-12 margin, the
committee approved language requiring the agency to use at
least $10 million of the new money to crack down on
foreign-owned businesses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The added money represents an increase of more than 25%
from current expenditures for such tax compliance cases,
according to Treasury estimates cited by the chief sponsor,
Rep. Frank Wolf (R., Va.). It comes amid increased pressure
to strengthen IRS enforcement powers as well. House Ways and
Means Committee investigators testified this week that their
own inquiry found a pattern of foreign-owned subsidiaries
often paying little or no U.S. taxes. The amendment yesterday
drew support from both conservatives and liberals.
   The action came as a House appropriations subcommittee
separately approved an estimated $8.3 billion military
construction bill, making deep cuts from the Pentagon's
requests for overseas facilities and freezing any new U.S.
obligations for the Air Force's costly new NATO base in
Crotone, Italy.
   Funding for NATO infrastructure accounts would be cut to
an estimated $250 million, or $170.4 million below the
administration's request. The freeze on funds for Crotone
would run through Dec. 31 to allow time for the House and
Senate Armed Services Committees to decide on the future of
the facility, which is intended to serve 72 F-16s in southern
Italy. Gen. John Galvin, chief of allied forces in Europe,
lobbied for the money in telephone calls to senior members,
and though Republicans agreed that the current plans are in
jeopardy, the final provision represents at least a tactical
victory for the military, which avoided an outright
termination of funds.
   More broadly, Pentagon requests for foreign facilities
were cut by more than half. And while lawmakers maneuvered to
protect favored projects at home, all of an estimated $254
million for three MX missile sites and two depots was
deferred, including funding for one base in the home district
of House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington.
   The $20.7 billion bill yesterday is the sixth of the 13
annual appropriations measures to clear the full committee,
which is expected to act today on legislation allocating an
estimated $170.4 billion for the Departments of Labor,
Education, and Health and Human Services. This massive bill
includes billions of dollars in funding increases for public
schools and health research, but after a period of rapid
growth, the ambitious program within the National Institutes
of Health to map the human gene would receive $66.1 million,
or just two-thirds of the administration's request.
   James Watson, the Nobel Prize winner who is director of
the Center for Human Genome Research at NIH, had lobbied
aggressively for a larger increase, but within the scientific
community there remain divisions over the merits and design
of the costly program. In this light, the committee proposal
appears designed to slow the growth of the project until the
appointment of a new NIH director this summer. Though few
expect full funding of the administration's request,
appropriations could be restored then after a re-evaluation
of the program.
   The ambitious goals -- and costs -- of the gene-mapping
project contrast with the more mundane and parochial
provisions attached to yesterday's bill. Soybean interests
succeeded in specifying that the Bureau of Engraving must
design a test of inks based on soybean oil. And within the
"federal buildings fund" the bill adds more than $43 million
to the president's budget for an assortment of hospital,
university, and social-service grants for projects that are
neither federal nor, in some cases, even buildings. "The
rationale?" said Rep. Edward Roybal (D., Calif.), the
subcommittee chairman. "The rationale is, your colleagues ask
you to do it."
   Elsewhere, Postal Service subsidies would grow by 6.8% to
$484.6 million. Almost $330 million would be provided for the
White House's own operations, including an 11.2% increase for
the Office of Management and Budget -- one of the fastest
growing accounts. Apart from the IRS, the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms within the Treasury would receive a
significant increase. The bill adds $21 million to the
department's request to fund a program targeted at tracking
and apprehending armed career criminals.

9% to $58.5 million, or 93 cents a share, from $64.3 million,
or $1.02 a share, a year earlier.
   The results were an improvement from the first quarter,

75%, to $15.5 million, or 25 cents a share.

   Barnett, along with many major banks in the Southeast, has
increased reserves for problem loans in recent months in the
wake of special examinations by the comptroller of the
currency. In the second quarter, Barnett added $16 million to
its loan-loss reserve, giving the Jacksonville, Fla.-based
banking company a total reserve of $332.3 million. That
compares with $230.7 million a year earlier.
   The company, which has more than $31 billion in assets,
said nonperforming assets totaled $467 million as of June 30,
compared with $456 million at the end of the first quarter
and $324 million a year ago.
   In the first half, net fell 42% to $74 million, or $1.18 a

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.,
citing soft market conditions, said it will temporarily close
its biggest pulp mill for for the third time since March.
   MacMillan Bloedel, British Columbia's largest forest
products concern, said the planned two-week shutdown of its
Harmac pulp mill, near Nanaimo, British Columbia, will begin
Aug. 27 and will reduce its inventories of bleached pulp by
about 16,000 metric tons. A metric ton is equal to about
2,204.62 pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last year, the mill produced 370,000 metric tons of market
pulp, or about 75% of MacMillan Bloedel's total market pulp
output. Market pulp is wood pulp that is sold on the open
market to producers of paper and other products.
   The shutdown will affect about 600 of Harmac's 1,300
employees, the company said, and it is encouraging workers to
take their annual paid vacation during the closure.
   MacMillan Bloedel is 49.9%-owned by Toronto-based Noranda
Forest Inc., itself a unit of the Toronto resource giant
Noranda Inc.

   NEW YORK -- The dollar regained some ground as foreign
exchange traders took some profits. The greenback also was
aided by a modest sell-off of the British pound and other
currencies supported by high interest rates.
   Currency traders groped for fundamental economic reasons
to buy and sell but found few. The consolidating tone of the
global session was set in Asia. Dealings were thin and --
prior to a late New York surge by the dollar against the mark
-- prices were bound by technical ranges.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "People are simply too tired after all the movements the
past two days. They were pooped," said Paul Kazuo Okura, a
senior customer dealer in New York for Bank of Tokyo.
"{Tuesday} our dealers {in Tokyo} were staying up into the
wee hours of the night. {Wednesday} people were going home
early."
   The one unknown that had overhung the early session was
the contents of the final communique from the Group of Seven
industrial nations. But when the G-7 leaders broke up their 2
1/2-day meeting in Houston, they issued no news for the
foreign exchange market.
   Ever since a French newspaper reported last week that a
draft communique said the yen's "current {low} levels could
have undesirable consequences for the process of global
adjustment," currency-market participants had been expecting
a G-7 statement supporting the yen.
   The concluding comment didn't mention the yen, or any
other currency. It did reiterate that inflation requires
"continued vigilance."
   Afterward, Horst Koehler, state secretary in the West
German Finance Ministry, said: "The yen has appreciated in
the right direction. We're happy about that. There's no need
to comment on it."
   Shortly before the close of the Tokyo Wednesday morning
session, rumors that a Houston summit source said the
communique would call for a stronger yen pushed the dollar to
its intraday low of 147.55 yen.
   The rumors "triggered the market to go really short on
dollars," according to Mahiko Nagai, a trader with
Manufacturers Hanover Trust in Tokyo.
   Mr. Nagai and other Japanese dealers had warned that if
the economic communique disappointed dollar bears, the U.S.
currency could rebound to 149 yen.
   No rebound occurred. The greenback weakened against the
yen for most of the latter half of the North American session
and ended with its most paltry gains on the day against the
Japanese currency.
   Mr. Okura of Bank of Tokyo explained: "Most people in the
market do believe that the G-7 thinks that a stronger yen
would be good for correcting the {U.S.-Japan} trade
imbalance, so {the national leaders} don't have to say it."
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6560 marks, above 1.6425 marks late Tuesday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 148.50 yen, up
from 148.30 yen in New York Tuesday. Sterling was trading at
$1.7990, well below $1.8230 Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading at 148.90 yen
soon after the opening, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
148.10 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at
1.6580 marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.6418
marks.
   On Wednesday, Alexis Egan, corporate foreign-exchange
trader for Banque Indosuez, described the day as slow with
bursts of activity. She said the global session saw many
quick movements on cross rates, such as yen-mark and
yen-swiss, that suggested speculative rather than corporate
activity.
   Ms. Egan said the dollar-yen and dollar-mark movements, on
the other hand, were easy to call. For example, against the
West German currency, she said, the dollar had technical
resistance and support points at 1.6520 marks and 1.6380
marks, respectively.
   The British pound moved consistently lower throughout the
day. This wasn't the day of reckoning long predicted for
sterling speculators. Instead, several large sell orders in
Asia kicked off a round of across-the-board consolidation for
the high-flying currency.
   The pound ended global trading in New York at 2.9791 marks
and 267.15 yen, well below 2.9943 marks and 270.35 yen late
Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $354.10 an ounce, down $1.40. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.7 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$353.15 an ounce.

   Stations that sign affiliation agreements will be given
eight hours of television programs a day, consisting of
movies, game shows and series like "Life of Riley," "The
Invaders" and "Richard Diamond," Mr. Lang said.
   In exchange for the programs, the stations must run at
least four hours a day of direct-response programs, also
called "infomercials." These are program-length commercials
in which a marketer typically demonstrates a product and
invites viewers to call in to order.
   Mr. Lang said Star Television and the producers of the
infomercials would share revenue from sales of the products
or services with affiliate stations.
   A spokeswoman for Mr. Lang couldn't say how much was being
invested in the new network. The network will be transmitted
to member stations via satellite.
   Mr. Lang also heads Lang Communications, a New York-based
media company that publishes Working Woman, Working Mother,
Sassy and Success magazines.

   DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. should sue its former auditing
firm, Grant Thornton, for negligence, and its former top
officers, Gene E. Phillips and William Friedman, for
mismanagement, a court-appointed examiner recommended in his
final report to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   Characterizing his 500-page report as "a story . . . of
unsound acquisitions, overvalued assets, illusory sales,
phantom profits, hidden liabilities, insider dealing and
outsider cronyism," examiner Neal Batson also recommended
that the company further investigate the roles of Arthur
Weiss, current chairman, and certain directors in the
collapse of the real-estate conglomerate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Southmark expanded aggressively as a full service
real-estate broker, management firm, syndicator and lender
until the market for real estate limited partnerships
collapsed in 1987. In obvious distress by 1988, the company
ousted Messrs. Phillips and Friedman in January 1989, and
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six months later.
Southmark attorneys don't believe Mr. Batson's report will
affect the confirmation of the company's plan of
reorganization, expected tomorrow.
   In a prepared statement, Grant Thornton "emphatically
disagreed" with Mr. Batson's report. The accounting firm
asserted that "Southmark didn't fail because of its auditor.
Grant will not allow itself to be made a scapegoat."
   An attorney for Mr. Friedman, Southmark's former vice
chairman, called the charges against his client unfounded.
Mr. Phillips, the company's former chairman, and current
Southmark officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Batson, who concluded that Southmark was insolvent by
late 1987 despite the apparent health of its financial
statements, identified $750 million in subsequent
transactions that could be challenged as preferential or
fraudulent transfers of assets.
   Among the instances of "outsider cronyism" he cited was a
$2.2 million payment in 1988 to entities partially controlled
by Edwin T. McBirney III, the flamboyant former thrift
executive who was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury
in Dallas in an unrelated case. The potential claims, the
examiner notes, represent "a significant opportunity" to
increase the payout to Southmark's creditors.
   In hearings to confirm a plan of reorganization, Southmark
attorneys showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the largest
of those potential claims -- $481 million transferred by
Southmark to its wholly owned San Jacinto Savings Association
at the demand of thrift regulators.
   Pursuing claims against the thrift, said R. Paul Wickes,
an attorney for Southmark, could lead to seizure of San
Jacinto by the Office of Thrift Supervision and "litigation
that never ends."
   Southmark hopes to rebuild around its Houston-based
thrift. Its reorganization plan, which has been approved by
unsecured creditors and preferred shareholders, contemplates
a contribution of $100 million in capital to the thrift and
an orderly sale of its remaining assets. While the Office of
Thrift Supervision has agreed to the plan, it hasn't offered
any assurances that it won't seize the thrift subsequently.
As of March 31, San Jacinto had a negative net worth of $50.8
million.
   Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission
challenged clauses in the reorganization plan that would
shield current Southmark management from lawsuits. "The SEC
is raising it as an issue of legal significance to investors
generally" and to the regulators, said Gordon Robinson, an
SEC staff attorney.

   HOUSTON -- The leaders of the world's major industrial
nations agreed to a compromise statement on agricultural
trade that U.S. officials said would bolster American efforts
to reduce trade-distorting farm subsidies and could end a
logjam in current international trade talks.
   The statement came at the conclusion of the nations' 16th
annual economic summit, at which the U.S. and its allies also
decided to take divergent approaches on such issues as
providing aid to the Soviet Union and preserving the
environment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   President Bush cast the summit's results in a positive
light. He said the summit nations had pledged to take
"difficult steps" to conclude a new world trade treaty. And
he said the meeting should please Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, whom he contacted immediately after the final
session to outline the results. In an ironic sign of the
West's growing stake in Mr. Gorbachev's political survival,
Mr. Bush also congratulated the Soviet leader on his
"landslide" re-election this week as head of the Soviet
Communist Party.
   The agreement on agriculture came after more than seven
hours of negotiations concluding early yesterday morning.
Officials from the U.S., Canada, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy, Japan and the European Community agreed to
assert in part that a future pact on agricultural trade
"should contain specific assurances that . . . participants
would reduce not only internal support but also export
subsidies and import protection in a related way."
   "If it's not a breakthrough, it's progress," said U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills. She especially cited the
language specifically calling for reduction in the three
types of farm subsidies, internal, export subidies and import
protection. The U.S. has sought a commitment, particularly
from European Community nations, that each of these three
types of subsidy be reduced.
   But the language didn't call for the elimination of export
subsidies, something the U.S. has sought. As a result, some
European participants claimed victory.
   The president of the European Community, Jacques Delors,
said, "There's no victory, there's only a good compromise."
He said that the EC now is negotiating on all the aspects of
agricultural policy, while the U.S. and others now understand
that agriculture has a special social and political role in
Europe.
   President Bush suggested the summit accord will improve
the prospects for a successful conclusion to the current
round of world trade talks being held under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "Each of us recognizes that
reaching this goal {of successfully concluding the trade
talks} will require difficult steps by all participants," Mr.
Bush said. "We won't hesitate to take them. This is
especially true for agriculture. We are committed by this
declaration to provide the strong political leadership
necessary to ensure a strong and enduring result."
   U.S. officials, though, made it clear that much bargaining
lies ahead. "We're going to have a very tough negotiation,"
said Mrs. Hills. "It doesn't mean they've leapt into our
laps."
   The world trade talks, which began in Uruguay in 1986, are
set to wind up this December. They are an attempt to extend
the GATT treaty to cover agriculture and textiles and to
address new issues, including intellectual property rights,
services and trade-related investments.
   The U.S. side also was pleased that the summiteers
commended to their negotiators a recent text put forward by
the chairman of the GATT agriculture negotiating group, Aart
de Zeeuw.
   Some European nations have been leery of that proposal
because it differentiates between various types of
agricultural subsidy. The EC has generally favored grouping
all agricultural subsidies together before reducing them.
Farm-exporting nations such as the U.S., Canada, Argentina
and many other developing countries fear that would lead to a
failure to address export subsidies and price supports, which
many economists believe most distort trade.
   On many issues, the summit leaders glossed over
differences they brought to the meeting. Though they spent
much time discussing conditions in the Soviet Union, they
were unable to agree on a common strategy for aiding Mr.
Gorbachev's beleaguered economy, except to applaud his
restructuring program and to continue to offer him "technical
assistance" in moving toward a market-oriented economy.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady characterized the
discussions about assistance to the Soviet Union as "very
positive."
   The group resisted West Germany's request to join now in a
united package of direct aid to the Soviets. On Tuesday, the
group agreed to commission a study of the Soviet economy by a
group of international financial institutions. That study,
which probably will be led by the International Monetary
Fund, would provide "the criteria for any assistance, so long
as we can ensure it's properly targeted," said British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   In a meeting with reporters, President Bush forcefully
ruled out direct aid until the Soviets restructure their
economy, scale back their military arsenal and reduce their
support for left-wing dictatorships.
   "We're going to try in every way to facilitate that reform
because we are in a different age," the president said. "But
we have some problems. I'm not particularly enthusiastic
about the {Soviet} intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed
at U.S. cities. I find it a little contradictory to think
that they will continue to spend $5 billion a year for Cuba."
   Several leaders said their differences reflect that the
world has become more secure. "With the threat from the
Soviet world considerably reduced, because of that Europe is
more able to assert its personality," said French President
Francois Mitterrand. But he added: "We don't want a situation
in which the EC exercises a sort of competitive leadership
with the U.S."
   The other leading topic at the summit was the environment.
The summit leaders, as they did on Soviet aid, agreed to
several minimum common goals while opting to pursue their own
domestic strategies for curbing pollution and preserving the
environment.
   The final communique singled out global climate change as
a subject of "key importance" and committed the nations to
"undertake common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse
gases such as carbon dioxide." Many scientists believe that
the buildup of such gases in the atmosphere is causing an
increase in the Earth's temperature. West Germany has
committed itself to a 25% reduction in the level of carbon
dioxide emissions by the year 2000. But the other summit
countries won't adopt such stringent goals without additional
research, and the communique didn't set a specific target for
the group.
   The communique also called for additional research on
climate change and for a phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons,
which are believed to reduce the earth's protective ozone
layer, by the year 2000. The leaders also pledged to help
developing nations preserve tropical rain forests and to
develop strategies for reforestation. And they promised to
launch negotiations aimed at a world agreement by 1992 to
preserve forest land.
   U.S. environmentalists complained that the leaders
deliberately had played down environmental issues. Mr. Bush
dismissed the accusation, saying, "On the environmental
extreme, they don't want this country to grow." But even some
summit leaders acknowledged that there is much left to do.
Commenting on greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions,
Mrs. Thatcher said: "That's the part we haven't really
tackled yet, that's the part that's difficult."
   The 17-page communique commended the movement toward
free-market democracies in Eastern Europe and toward greater
European integration. It also welcomed a unified Germany and
advocated more discipline to curb trade-distorting
export-credit subsidies.
   The summit praised the current system of international
economic policy coordination, endorsed current international
debt strategy and commended the recently announced U.S.
initiative to help Latin American countries. The U.S. expects
other nations will support the initiative, but they need time
to study it, Mr. Brady noted. As a gesture to debtor
countries making strong economic reform efforts, the summit
also encouraged the Paris Club, a group of western creditor
nations, to lengthen the repayment period on government
credits.
   And in a nod to Japan, the summit took note of the
importance to that country of "a peaceful resolution of its
dispute with the Soviet Union over the northern territories,"
some small islands seized by the Russians in 1945.

   Heard on the Street:
   Embattled PS of New Mexico Gets Just Whiff
   Of an Offer, Stock Spurts Two Points to 11 3/4

   A suitor's "expression of interest" in Public Service Co.
of New Mexico yesterday gave Wall Street one more reason to
believe that this battered stock may finally be worth
investors' notice.
   The utility's shares surged after it disclosed that
Wheeler Peak Capital Corp., a local venture-capital concern,
has floated the idea of acquiring PS New Mexico for $12 a
share, plus a sliver of equity in the continuing company. The
stock closed at 11 3/4, up 2.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wheeler Peak appears to be a one-man operation. That man
is Albert J. Robison, a former senior vice president and
chief financial officer for PS New Mexico, which like Wheeler
Peak is based in Albuquerque.
   The 49-year-old Mr. Robison, who retired two years ago,
was traveling and couldn't be reached. He has, however, been
in touch with Southwestern Public Service Co. in Amarillo and
other potential investors about PS New Mexico. A Southwestern
PS official late yesterday confirmed that company's talks
with Wheeler Peak and its interest in certain PS New Mexico
assets.
   After a trading halt for the early afternoon news, the
utility's stock resumed trading at 11, up one point from the
previous trade, but the shares posted further gains later.
Wheeler Peak's overture was seen as likely to flush out other
interested buyers, and PS New Mexico is more than ready to
consider offers.
   The down-in-the-dumps company previously hired Morgan
Stanley to help it decide by summer's end whether to sell any
or all of its operations, said John Ackerman, PS New Mexico's
chief executive officer. "I told my work force that my own
personal direction is not to pursue a purchase," he said.
   Public Service Co. of Colorado is often thought of as a
natural to acquire PS New Mexico. The Colorado utility needs
extra power and already is connected with PS New Mexico's
system. A spokesman for PS Colorado said company policy
doesn't allow comment on mergers and acquisitions.
   PS New Mexico, pummeled by an ill-fated diversification
move and excess capacity, has suspended common dividends, cut
its staff by 20% and has sold off nonutility assets. A major
customer didn't renew a $110 million-a-year contract and
regulators ordered the already reeling company to reduce its
rates. PS New Mexico's common stock, which peaked three years
ago at 39 1/4 a share, has been languishing at about 10
recently.
   But there's growing sentiment on Wall Street that PS New
Mexico may be through the worst. For investors willing to
hold on for a while, the utility's belt-tightening combined
with moderate but steady growth in electricity demand in its
service area may breathe life back into the moribund stock,
some analysts say.
   "All the damage has been done," says Ed Tirello of Smith
Barney. He cites as a turning point the recent changes in top
management at the utility. Former chairman, president and
chief executive officer Jerry D. Geist, who had been
intimately associated with PS New Mexico's troublesome extra
capacity and diversification, resigned last month. Mr.
Ackerman, former head of the utility's gas company unit,
became president and chief executive.
   "The prior manager had alienated the political machine in
the state," says Mr. Tirello, adding: "The new management has
the opportunity to mend that."
   The New Mexico Public Service Commission has been wholly
unsympathetic to the utility's excess power problems,
refusing to let rate payers bear the cost of unneeded energy,
particularly the utility's $1.2 billion investment in the
Palo Verde nuclear project in Arizona.
   Mr. Tirello says a turnaround hinges on the company's
ability to sell its excess electricity at a profit, which he
projects will happen by 1995 as the Southwest grows and power
becomes tighter. Right now, the company loses 1.5 cents to
three cents on every wholesale 1,000 kilowatts sold,
according to analysts' estimates.
   Alan Berro, utility analyst with the mutual-fund giant
Fidelity Investments, is betting on a much quicker rebound,
even without a buy-out. Fidelity has bought 1,350,000 shares
on the theory that PS New Mexico will be out of the hole in
two years. "If the stock doubles at that time, I'm a hero,"
says Mr. Berro. He won't say how much the stock cost but
indicated it wasn't too far from $10 a share.
   The two-year projection, Mr. Berro concedes, is his
best-case outlook. He's willing to sit tight even if it takes
longer. "I have a long-time horizon," he says.
   A few analysts are ready to throw in the towel now. Barry
Abramson with Prudential-Bache says PS New Mexico's woes are
intractable. "Their financial progress is stuck and can't go
forward until the market conditions improve," says Mr.
Abramson, who recommends selling. He doesn't see a
stock-price improvement until 1993.
   That's too long to wait in his opinion. "I just don't see
the light at the end of the tunnel," he says, "because the
tunnel is such a long tunnel."

   $51 Million Charge

   CHICAGO -- Hartmarx Corp., hurt by a long slump in men's
suit sales, halved its dividend and took a charge of $51
million, primarily for closing 65 specialty stores.
   The charge, which also covers Hartmarx's plan to sell its
minority interest in its Mexican affiliate, brought the
company's net loss for the fiscal second quarter ended May 31
to $55.1 million, or $2.80 a share. In the year-ago period,
the apparel maker and retailer earned $3.1 million, or 16
cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales slipped slightly to $303.9 million from $304.5
million.
   Hartmarx cut its quarterly dividend to 15 cents a share,
payable Aug. 15 to stock of record Aug. 1. The company had
paid a dividend of 30 cents a share.
   Wall Street nevertheless reacted favorably. Hartmarx
stock, which has lost nearly half its value in recent months,
rose $1 to close at $11.375 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday. "It's something they needed to
do," Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. analyst Josie Esquivel said
of the restructuring.
   Harvey A. Weinberg, Hartmarx's chairman and chief
executive officer, said the moves were positive steps that
would help position the company for a recovery in menswear
sales.
   Like other companies specializing in tailored clothing,
Hartmarx has been hurt by sluggish consumer demand and rising
wool prices that have pushed up the price of men's suits by
30% over the past two years. "It's been a pretty dismal
market," Mr. Weinberg said. But, he added: "I think that's
coming to an end and I'm encouraged" by spring 1991 orders
received by the company's manufacturing units. He said those
orders are running as much as 3% ahead of year-earlier
figures, compared with fall 1990 orders.
   Hartmarx operates stores under such names as Wallachs,
Raleighs, Silverwoods and Baskin.
   The stores slated for closing -- about 13% of Hartmarx's
retail operations -- are either unprofitable or marginally
profitable, Mr. Weinberg said. Hartmarx also plans to cut
costs by eliminating jobs in both the field and headquarters
organizations of its specialty store division. Mr. Weinberg
declined to say how many employees would be affected. The
company said that 15 of the 65 stores scheduled for closing
are Old Mill women's sportswear stores operated by its
Country Miss unit.
   The 65 stores accounted for about $40 million in sales in
the latest fiscal year. But Mr. Weinberg said the company
hopes to transfer about 40% of the volume of shuttered stores
in major markets to other Hartmarx stores.
   Hartmarx said it also intends to strengthen its specialty
store division by hiring two outsiders to fill senior posts
in marketing and merchandising.
   Hartmarx's earnings from operations in the second quarter
were hurt by slack demand and markdowns, as well as deep
discounting by retail competitors that have held
going-out-of-business sales.
   For the six months, Hartmarx said it had a net loss of
$52.8 million, or $2.68 a share, compared with a gain of
$12.9 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
were $646.1 million, compared with $631.8 million.

   U.S. Agency Finds
   Mexican Companies
   Are Dumping Cement

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department ruled that Mexican
shipments of gray Portland cement and clinker are being
dumped, or sold in the U.S. at less than their production
costs or home-market prices.
   The department's final determination will result in stiff
anti-dumping duties on imports from Cemex S.A., Mexico's
largest cement producer, and other Mexican suppliers if the
International Trade Commission affirms that such shipments
are injuring U.S. producers. The ITC has to rule on the
injury question within 45 days.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department found dumping margins of 57.96% on
Cemex shipments, 53.26% on those from Apasco S.A. de C.V.,
3.69% on Cementos Hidalgos S.C.L., and 57.66% on those from
all other Mexican suppliers. These findings are likely to
nudge overall cement prices higher in the Southwestern
states, Florida and California, where the Mexican products
have been in increasing demand.
   The department acted on a petition from a group of cement
producers in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Florida. The
petitioners claim that rising Mexican shipments have
depressed prices in the Southwest and displaced U.S.
supplies. Gray Portland cement is widely used for public
works and business construction. Clinker is an intermediate
material that is ground into cement.
   "Those are extremely large margins for a fungible
commodity that's sold solely on the basis of price," said
Joseph Dorn, a lawyer for the U.S. producers.
   The Commerce Department estimated the value of last year's
Mexican shipments at $111 million.

   NEW MILFORD, N.J. -- At Polifly Financial Corp., the torch
may be passing to a new generation.
   Earlier this month, Polifly announced the appointment of
42-year-old Joseph S. Paparatto as its new president and
chief executive officer. As president, he succeeds Gregg B.
Van Dam, who had left the firm in March in connection with a
consent agreement with federal regulators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And yesterday, three directors resigned, including
72-year-old Chairman Frederick T. Muller, who had been acting
chief executive officer prior to Mr. Paparatto's appointment.
Mr. Muller said, "It is an opportune time for us to resign
and enable Mr. Paparatto to nominate some individuals less
senior in years."
   Resigning with Mr. Muller were John R. Speich Jr., 99
years old next month, and Herbert Hoexter, 90.
   Polifly, the parent of Polifly Savings &amp; Loan Association,
has reported heavy losses recently, the result of "high
levels of non-performing assets caused by a deterioration in
the New Jersey real estate market," according to the company.
Among other problems, the company has suspended dividends and
is the target of a civil class-action suit alleging
securities-law violations.
   Recently, Polifly Financial &amp; Polifly Savings entered into
the consent agreement restricting their activities. Any
default on the agreement could result in legal action against
the troubled thrift and its holding company.

   NEW YORK -- Returns on capital for the 46 specialist firms
at the New York Stock Exchange in the first quarter dropped
to a 4.4% annual rate after taxes, the Big Board said.
   Specialists are firms that use their own capital to ensure
an orderly market in certain assigned stocks for which they
are responsible. Their job is to facilitate speedy trading,
stepping in to buy shares when too many sell orders pile up
and selling some when investors rush to buy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   First-quarter returns were down from an 8.6% annualized
rate in the first quarter of 1989, but better than the
negative 1.7% return posted for the fourth quarter.
   The exchange said specialists' profits amounted to $9
million after taxes in the first quarter, down 57% from $21
million in the year-earlier period.
   Meanwhile, the Big Board confirmed industry projections
that its 342 member brokerage firms that deal with the public
had a $486 million pretax loss in the first quarter, compared
with a $200 million pretax profit a year earlier. The loss
reflects $459 million in one-time retrenchment expenses at
certain member broker-dealers, including Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   The exchange said about 59% of the 342 firms reporting for
the quarter were profitable.
   Member brokerage firms' expenses for the quarter rose 2.5%
to $14 billion, their fourth-highest level ever. Revenue fell
2.5% to $13.52 billion, their seventh-highest level.

   The Oakland, Calif.-based company, which owns a chain of

expenses declined. Gains in operating profit came from
improved buying, inventory control and mix of products, said
Safeway Vice President David Domeier. "Our ability to buy
better has a big impact on the bottom line," he said,
although he noted the net is a small percentage of sales.

   Schering AG said it expects to boost its per-share
earnings to 40 deutsche marks ($24.39) or 41 marks this year
from 39 marks in 1989.
   The West Berlin-based pharmaceutical and chemical company
added that the rise could be achieved despite the diluting
impact of a 5% stock dividend and the exercise of stock
options.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman said, however, Schering hasn't altered its
previous forecast that net income for the year will about
match 1989's 225 million marks. Schering had 5.85 billion
marks in sales last year.
   The discrepancy between the outlook for higher per-share
earnings and flat profit can be explained by the fact that
per-share earnings reported by West German companies aren't
equivalent to profit.
   Instead, they are calculated according to guidelines set
by the German Association of Securities Analysts, which
eliminate extraordinary items and allocations to reserves
from per-share earnings. Profit data reported by West German
concerns can be misleading because the companies usually make
overly generous allocations to nontaxable reserves.

   Granada Group PLC reported a 12% slide in pretax profit

unlikely to abate before the end of the year.
   Pretax profit totaled #63.3 million ($115.4 million), down

   Profit after taxes and minority interests eased 7.7% to

   With no extraordinary gains or losses in the period, net
profit attributable to shareholders also stood at #41.7
million, less than half the year-earlier total of #86.1
million. Last year Granada reported a #40.9 million
extraordinary gain, largely on the sale of its majority stake

   The group also reported a 13% decline in sales to #763
million from #874 million. The slump had been forecasted by

   NEW YORK -- The alleged leader of a tax-fraud scheme that
created $140 million in phony tax deductions was sentenced to
two years in prison.
   Jeffrey Feldman, 42 years old, of Skillman, N.J., pleaded
guilty in April to conspiring to defraud the U.S. The scheme
involved $4 billion in U.S. government securities
transactions that were rigged to create the fictitious tax
losses in 1981. The transactions were marketed to investors
for tax benefits through a series of limited partnerships
called the Cralin partnerships. Mr. Feldman was an owner and
promoter of Cralin.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In sentencing Mr. Feldman, federal Judge Charles S. Haight
said he wouldn't impose a fine or order restitution because
the defendant has no assets. Mr. Feldman could be eligible
for parole after serving a third of his two-year sentence.
   Last month, Paul Foont, formerly head securities trader at
Cralin, was sentenced to one year in prison for his role in
the scheme. Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary told Judge
Haight that because Mr. Foont acted as Mr. Feldman's "hired
gun" in the scheme, Mr. Feldman should receive a harsher
sentence.
   "Mr. Feldman was the motivating force behind these
transactions," Mr. Cleary said. "He's the one who profited so
handsomely from his fraud." Mr. Cleary said the transactions
generated a total of $1.2 million in tax-free income for Mr.
Feldman in 1981 and 1982.
   Mr. Feldman's attorney, Michael Feldberg, urged that his
client not be sentenced to prison, arguing that other people
involved with Cralin were more responsible. Mr. Cleary,
however, said there was no evidence that the other owners of
Cralin were aware of the scheme.

   Wife's Estate Sues
   Armand Hammer
   For $400 Million

   Suit, Also Naming Occidental,
   Says Industrialist Didn't

   LOS ANGELES -- Where would Armand Hammer be today without
the financial backing of Frances, his late wife?
   The answer may not seem to have much interest outside of
the Hammer family, except that it could affect the future of
a museum planned by Dr. Hammer to house hundreds of millions
of dollars of art works in his vast collection.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Frances Hammer's estate filed a $400 million lawsuit
against the 91-year-old industrialist and Occidental
Petroleum Corp., the oil and chemical company he heads,
charging them and other defendants with breach of fiduciary
duty and fraud. Joan Weiss, the daughter of Frances Hammer's
sister, is Mrs. Hammer's heir, the suit says. Her husband,
Robert S. Weiss, is the estate executor and plaintiff.
   A spokesman for Occidental and Dr. Hammer declined to make
any comment on the suit, filed yesterday in state court here.
   The suit traces certain financial aspects of the couple's
33-year marriage and suggests that Dr. Hammer's huge wealth,
including his art collection and Occidental stock, were
amassed using separate property Frances brought into the
marriage. Mrs. Hammer died in December.
   Dr. Hammer allegedly exercised complete control over the
fortune he and Frances acquired during their marriage. Almost
all of their Occidental stock, with a market value of more
than $34 million as of Dec. 1, was allegedly held in Dr.
Hammer's name. Dr. Hammer treated the art works he had
purchased using his and Frances Hammer's property as his own,
according to the suit.
   "Frances Hammer's . . . rights with respect to their
community property were inconsistent with Armand Hammer's
desire to use and control their fortune for his own selfish
purposes. Accordingly, Armand Hammer embarked upon a scheme
designed to take from Frances Hammer his interests in their
fortune," the suit says.
   The estate's interest in the art collection, which has
been valued at as much as $400 million, surfaced this spring
at a Wilmington, Del., court hearing. The proceeding was
related to litigation brought by certain Occidental
shareholders who are trying to block the oil company's $95
million plan for a museum to house the art collection. The
plaintiffs argue that the museum, under construction in Los
Angeles, won't benefit shareholders and is Dr. Hammer's pet
project.
   Alan R. Kahn, a New York investment adviser who sued
Occidental over the museum last year, said that the estate's
suit throws another wrench into the planned museum. "If the
title and transferability of much of the Hammer art
collection is under a cloud, then expenditures to build a
museum are even less justifiable."
   Also named as defendants were the Armand Hammer Museum of
Art and Cultural Center, the Armand Hammer Foundation, and
Lewis, Overbeck &amp; Furman, a Chicago law firm, and two
partners.

   Centaur Partners Group, New York, said it has filed a
lawsuit against National Intergroup Inc.'s directors for
adopting an amendment to the company's shareholder rights
plan.
   Centaur Partners, which owns 16.5% of National Intergroup,
is waging a proxy fight against the Pittsburgh oil
transportation and aluminum and steel fabrication concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lawsuit, filed in New York state court, seeks
compensatory and punitive damages from the directors. The
amendment provides that National Intergroup's "poison pill"
would take effect if any single shareholder acquired more
than 10% of its common stock.
   The poison pill previously took effect only after a
shareholder acquired 20% or more of the company.
   Last week, the Delaware Chancery Court ruled that the
amendment wasn't valid because it was adopted without
shareholder approval. National Intergroup has said it would
appeal the court's ruling.
   National Intergroup called the lawsuit without basis and
said it would "seek sanctions" against Centaur Partners
because of the "frivolous nature of the action."
   The company said the amendment was necessary to protect
shareholders from Centaur's attempt to acquire control of the
company without paying a premium for control.

   Dixons Group PLC of Britain, a consumer electronics
retailer, said pretax profit for the year ended April 28 rose
2.2% to #80.1 million ($145.9 million) from #78.4 million a
year earlier, as advances in British retailing offset a
decline in U.S. earnings.
   The results, slightly exceeding market expectations and
Dixons' own estimate, are the first since the government in
May blocked a #461 million bid for Dixons by Kingfisher PLC,
a British retailer, on the ground that the acquisition would
have been anti-competitive.

<TEXT>
   Profit after taxes and minority interests and before
extraordinary items rose 7.4% to #57.7 million from #53.7
million. Per-share earnings increased 8.6% to 12.6 pence from
11.6 pence. An extraordinary loss of #9.8 million represented
the costs of the defense against the Kingfisher bid;
year-earlier results hadn't any extraordinary items. Profit
attributable to shareholders, after taxes and special items,
fell 11% to #47.9 million from #53.7 million.
   Sales rose 1% to #1.77 billion from #1.75 billion.

   Suedzucker AG of West Germany, a sugar company, said
profit for the year ended Feb. 28 rose 48% to 86.2 million
marks ($52.4 million), or 40 marks a share, from 58.2 million
marks, or 28.20 marks a share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose 33% to 3.6 billion marks from 2.7 billion
marks. Suedzucker said its 1.35 billion-mark acquisition of
the Belgian sugar company Raffinerie Tirlemontois S.A. last
year, which made Suedzucker Europe's largest sugar producer,
boosted sales in the last five months of fiscal 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company plans to raise its dividend 27% to 14 marks a
share from 11 marks.
   Analysts had criticized the high price paid for
Tirlemontois, saying Suedzucker was primarily interested in
acquiring the company's sugar production quotas. Each
European Community country has a production quota, and the EC
support price is well above the market level. Last November,
Suedzucker officials conceded the price was high, citing the
quotas. The company will eventually lower its holding in
wholly owned Tirlemontois to about 60%.

   TORONTO -- Magna International Inc. said it is in the
final stages of negotiations to sell its automotive
electric-motors division to a unit of Siemens AG of West
Germany.
   The sale would represent Magna's first significant
disposal of an operating unit since March, when the company
announced plans to sell various assets as part of a program
to restructure 1.09 billion Canadian dollars (U.S.$941.4
million) in debt.

   Magna, an auto-parts manufacturer plagued by overcapacity,
didn't disclose an asking price for the Maci Group division,
a unit of Magna's Atoma International Inc. subsidiary. Some
analysts estimate the unit could sell for about C$70 million.
   aul Klapproth, a spokesman for Siemens Automotive LP, said
"a number of points have to be resolved" before the deal is
finalized. The transaction also would require Canadian
regulatory approval.
   Toronto-based Magna said the Maci Group, with five plants
in Ontario and a distribution center in Michigan, generates
annual sales of about C$120 million and has 1,200 employees.
   Siemens Automotive, based in Troy, Mich., manufactures
electronic components for automobiles out of facilities in
Ontario and Virgina. Mr. Klapproth said the proposed
acquisition would fit with Siemens Automotive's strategy of
expanding in North America.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Democrats Face `Scary' Prospect of Agreeing
   To Siphon Benefits From Social Security Pot

   WASHINGTON -- George Bush has finally bitten the bullet on
taxes. Now it may be the Democrats' turn to chew some lead.
   The question is Social Security, an issue that over the
years has been as politically potent for the Democrats as
no-new-taxes was for the GOP. Now, with the president willing
to put taxes on the table, Democratic budget negotiators may
have little choice but to risk the wrath of the elderly and
agree to pare back benefits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The numbers make a compelling case. Social Security
accounts for $1 of every $5 the U.S. government spends, and
it's hard to see how the participants in the budget summit
can meet their goal of an honest $50 billion reduction in the
federal deficit without making some savings in the program.
   At the moment, two benefit-reduction ideas are being
floated. One is the direct approach: a reduction in
cost-of-living adjustments. The other is indirect: increasing
the income tax on Social Security benefits.
   Either way, many Democrats remain terrified at the
prospect. "It's just one of those political givens that it's
scary" to touch Social Security, says Robert Strauss, a
former Democratic National Committee chairman. Both within
and outside the budget summit, though, it's widely believed
that Congress and the public will back a deficit-reduction
plan only if everyone sacrifices -- including the elderly.
   Some observers already detect subtle changes in how the
once-sacrosanct program is being viewed today. "Go back and
look how the media portrayal of the elderly has changed,"
says Fay Cook, a Northwestern University professor of social
policy. "Articles talk about how active they are, how
well-to-do." For years, economists have been pointing out
that children may be more deserving of government aid than
older people -- and some members of Congress are listening.
After all, nearly 20% of all children live in poverty,
compared with 12% of the aged.
   Even some older people's lobbyists sound conciliatory --
up to a point. "We are explicitly saying that old people need
to be part of the solution. We don't need to be exempted,"
says John Rother, director of public policy for the American
Association of Retired Persons. But he adds that the "special
character" of the Social Security trust fund must be
"respected." That's a polite way of saying: Keep your mitts
off Social Security.
   The only obvious alternative is to charge the elderly more
for Medicare, the federal health-care program. But budget
negotiators are talking about getting at least $3 billion
from benefit programs for the elderly in the first year-in
addition to whatever savings the government gets by squeezing
doctors and hospitals -- and as much as $50 billion over five
years. Congressional analysts say it would be tough to get
that much money from Medicare beneficiaries in the first year
without very sharp increases in the $383 annual premium and
$75 annual deductible for doctors' services.
   When the budget summit turns to Social Security, cutting
cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, is appealing because it
saves so much money, and because a COLA freeze can spread the
pain of deficit-reduction across a wide array of programs. A
three-month delay in making the adjustments for all
government benefits except those exclusively for the poor
would cut the deficit by more than $3 billion next year. It
would cost the average retiree about $85 next year.
   One rub is that trimming COLAs hurts those who depend on
Social Security checks for survival as well as those who
don't need the money. Although programs aimed exclusively at
helping the elderly poor could be increased to cushion the
blow, congressional analysts say that wouldn't protect all
the low-income elderly. Two-thirds of all Social Security
benefits paid to the elderly go to those well above the
poverty line. But Census Bureau surveys show that Social
Security is the only source of income for millions of poor
elderly Americans.
   The bigger problem with cutting COLAs is political. No
sooner did House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D.,
Calif.) put the idea on the table than Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.) and Sen. Pete
Domenici (R., N.M.) predicted it would die on the table. The
only reason to even mention it is to make other money-saving
proposals look more appealing, Sen. Domenici says.
   Sen. Domenici and others were seared by a 1985 vote by the
Republican-controlled Senate to cut COLAs. The plan died when
President Reagan pulled the rug out from under them.
Democrats turned the vote into a campaign issue, and some
Republicans say it cost them control of the Senate.
   Already, the National Committee to Preserve Social
Security and Medicare has sent out mass mailings urging the
elderly "to stop a cut in your Social Security benefits which
would cost the average retired couple $2,820 over five
years." (The estimate refers to a proposal to suspend COLAs
for one year.)
   All this is nudging the summit toward an increase in the
tax on Social Security benefits. Couples with incomes above
$32,000 and individuals with incomes above $25,000 now pay
tax on 50% of their benefits. About one-fifth of all Social
Security recipients pay; the revenue goes back into the
Social Security trust fund. Subjecting 85% of the benefits to
taxes would cost a well-off retired couple with annual income
of $60,000, including $10,000 in Social Security benefits,
about $1,000 a year in higher taxes.
   The appeal of this approach is that it doesn't hurt the
poorest of the elderly. "Obviously, the case for taxing
benefits is much stronger" than for cutting COLAs, says
AARP's Mr. Rother. It also would raise lots of money. Rep.
Panetta has offered a plan to tax 85% of the benefits paid to
couples with incomes of $18,000 and individuals with incomes
of $12,000; it would bring in $3 billion next year.
   It does have two political liabilities. Unlike a COLA
freeze that could be applied to civil service and military
pensions and, therefore, could be sold as an across-the-board
money saver, the tax change would single out Social Security.
And the tax increase would hit the well-organized
middle-income and upper-income elderly who led the campaign
for repeal of Medicare's catastrophic-illness coverage. But
neither of these liabilities appears to frighten the summit
negotiators much.
   Complicating the summit's discussions of Social Security
is Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.), who loudly points out
that the government is collecting billions more in Social
Security payroll taxes than it spends in benefits -- and is
using the money to make up the deficit in the rest of the
government.
   "Social Security didn't put us in the situation we're in
with the deficit," says Max Richtman, director of
governmental affairs for the National Committee to Preserve
Social Security. "It's running at a huge surplus."
   To deflect criticism, the budget summit is almost certain
to redefine the deficit to exclude the Social Security
surplus. Then trimming Social Security benefits wouldn't make
the deficit look any smaller. But, in fact, no matter how
Congress decides to rewrite the accounting rules, all
government receipts go into one big pot. If the pot is
inadequate, the Treasury borrows money. Cutting benefits
would still reduce the government's need for borrowed money,
and that's the point of the budget summit.
   So in the end, Congress would probably count Social
Security cuts, if it makes them, toward its deficit-reduction
goal even as it takes the program out of the deficit
calculation. "Emerson said consistency is the hobgoblin of
small minds," says summit negotiator Rep. Bill Frenzel (R.,
Minn.). "We do not have small minds."
   Confronted with the same issue, Rep. Panetta, pretending
to be a magician, opens the left side of his jacket and says,
"Goes in here . . . ," then opens the right side and says, ".
. . comes out here."

   BAGHDAD -- When opportunity knocks here in the Middle
East, the one thing you can count on is that no one will
answer.
   The Arabs and Israelis seem like youngsters forever on a
see-saw, incapable of finding the point of equilibrium that
could permit them to dismount from their precarious perches.
When one side is up, it merely revels in the advantage, and
assumes it will last; when one side is down it merely pushes
that much harder to regain the heights. In the Mideast there
is no concept of balance of power; the only shared value is
search for advantage.

<TEXT>
   The most remarkable statement by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, in the course of a recent 3 1/2-hour interview
replete with bellicose talk of the increasing inevitability
of war with Israel, was his admission that the Arabs made a
mistake passing up Israel's 1967 offer of land in exchange
for peace. Under that proposal Israel would have returned to
the Arabs most of the West Bank and Gaza, captured in the
June 1967 war, in exchange for Arab recognition of Israel.
   "The Arabs have made their mistakes," he said. So, here we
have the Arab world's most radical ruler musing about missed
opportunities for peace -- but nearly a quarter-century too
late.
   Meanwhile, in an Israel increasingly dominated by
political hardliners, that West Bank, once seen as a
bargaining chip for peace, is now considered an integral part
of the divinely demarcated Land of Israel. "The eternal right
of the Jewish people to Eretz Yisrael is not subject to
question," say the new government's policy guidelines. Just
as the Arabs say they are ready to offer peace for land,
Israel is no longer willing to accept it. The prospect for
peace talks is dimmer now than at any time. Threats of war
are louder.
   There is every reason to believe Israel is repeating the
mistake the Arabs made -- missing a genuine opportunity. It
is however by no means certain that, if the West Bank were
back on the bargaining table, Saddam Hussein and his Arab
brethren indeed would trade land for peace.
   The last clear opportunity was 1983. Then, Egypt was
sidelined by the Camp David peace accord, Iraq was enmeshed
in war with Iran, Syria was ensnared in Lebanese strife, the
West was well past its oil fright and, most important, Israel
had Ronald Reagan, a committed ally, in the White House. The
problem: Arabs felt too weak while Israel believed itself too
strong.
   Since then, the see-saw has begun to tip again. The start
of the 1990s finds Iraq freed of its war with Iran but left
with a million-man army. Israeli-Egyptian relations have
soured. Radicalized Palestinians are creating continuing
turmoil in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. A
dispassionate President Bush and disgruntled James Baker have
replaced the pro-Israeli team of Ronald Reagan and George
Shultz. With the Soviet threat diminishing and U.S. budget
pressures growing, the rationale for spending $3 billion a
year in aid to Israel as a "forward base" in the global
anti-communist struggle seems less sustainable. Before the
decade is out, the West is likely to find itself needing more
Arab oil -- and thus listening more to Arab views.
   Finally, U.S. opinion polls are showing a tilt away from
unquestioning U.S. support for Israel. A recent New York
Times/CBS poll found support for a Palestinian homeland
rising to 47%, compared with 40% two years ago. And, while
61% of Americans favored high levels of aid to Israel, the
figure was 72% a year ago.
   The logical opportunity to strike a deal for peace? Not in
the endlessly illogical Middle East. The Israelis, who less
than a decade earlier felt themselves too strong to need
peace, now appear unaware of the degree to which the see-saw
is swinging to their long-term disadvantage. The Arabs, as
reflected by Saddam Hussein's staunch militancy, are probably
exaggerating how much it has swung in their favor.
   In the decade since Egypt signed a peace treaty with
Israel, Arabs have come slowly to realize there is no
military option to regain the occupied territories; only a
political one. Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, has minimally done what Israel and
the world demanded -- accepted Israel's right to exist.
Nearly two years ago, in a speech in Geneva that paved the
way for the first-ever PLO-U.S. dialogue, Mr. Arafat said
that the PLO accepts the "right of all parties concerned in
the Middle East conflict to exist in peace and security . . .
including the state of Palestine, Israel and other
neighbors."
   While Saddam Hussein blusters about retaliating against an
Israeli attack with chemical weapons, it's hard to conclude
that he seeks to initiate war. He and his key advisers appear
to recognize that Iran, not Israel, will continue to be
Iraq's major strategic threat. Beyond that, Iraq remains a
bitter enemy of Syria's Hafez al-Assad. Syria and Iran are
enough to preoccupy Iraq without war with Israel.
   The saber-rattling reverberating from Baghdad appears
largely intended to maintain Arab political and financial
support for Iraq. Most important, Iraq aims to keep the PLO
under its control rather than tolerate Syrian or Egyptian
influence, on the theory that the Arab nation controlling the
PLO and Palestinians wins Arab hearts and wallets.
   So, the most immediate threat to Israel's security is the
internal Palestinian uprising. The use of force hasn't calmed
Palestinians, who continue to insist on human rights and a
homeland. But neither the uprising, nor the longer trends
working against Israel, has so shifted the balance that
Israel ought to fear negotiating now. Israel remains far and
away the region's most powerful military power and continues
to enjoy strong U.S. support. The equilibrium is sufficient
to allow both Israelis and Palestinians to talk, to take a
chance that they can climb off the seesaw.

   NEW YORK -- A feud between Wall Street and the government
exploded yesterday, as a few big bond dealers deluged the
Treasury Department with what amounted to bogus bids at
yesterday's auction of seven-year U.S. notes.
   The result: The government received a huge $47 billion in
bids for only $8 billion of notes. The number of bids was
more than double the $19.44 billion of tenders received at
the previous seven-year note auction in April.

   In flooding the Treasury with bids dealers knew couldn't
be fulfilled, analysts said, one or more of the biggest bond
dealers were retaliating for a last-minute change in bidding
rules by the Treasury. The rule change, announced just hours
before yesterday's auction, limited the maximum bid by any
one dealer at any one price to 35% of the size of the
government auction. (Dealers can, however, place multiple
bids at different prices.)
   The Treasury said the 35% limit was aimed at preventing
big dealers from "squeezing" out their smaller rivals at
government auctions. That has been a problem, off and on, in
Treasury bond auctions for years.
   But, "one or two dealers were aggravated at the Treasury's
rule, and they put in a large number of bids out of spite to
distort the auction results," said one person with knowledge
of the Treasury auction. Practically, the huge bids had
little effect on the price the Treasury paid to sell the $8
billion of notes, traders said.
   Analysts said the surge in bids for the seven-year notes
wasn't a signal that investors were rushing to buy the notes
believing that interest rates are headed lower. Indeed, bond
prices fell and yields rose shortly after the auction's 1
p.m. EDT bidding deadline.
   Defending the decision to change the Treasury's bidding
rules, Michael Basham, deputy assistant Treasury secretary of
federal finance, said, "We want to maintain the competitive
nature of the auction process for the taxpayer as well as the
investment community."
   The Treasury auctions billions of dollars of government
securities each week to fund government spending and the
federal debt. For Wall Street, the auctions are a high-stakes
game; bond dealers don't hesitate to play hardball as they
compete to buy government securities and later resell them.
   Traders charge that on June 27, Salomon Brothers Inc., one
of Wall Street's biggest and most aggressive firms, tried to
effectively "corner" the auction for new four-year U.S.
notes. It allegedly did this by bidding for more than 10
times the amount of bonds it could reasonably expect to be
awarded under then-existing Treasury rules.
   Bids at that auction totaled $44.78 billion for $8.31
billion of notes, the highest ever at a four-year auction.
   In order to prevent one firm from cornering the market on
a new Treasury bill, note or bond issue, the Treasury has a
longtime rule limiting any dealer from purchasing more than
35% of the securities sold at an auction. Typically, the
government receives far more bids for bonds than it accepts,
and it rations them among dealers.
   A dealer, by bidding far in excess of the 35% limit, can
make it possible for himself to be awarded a relatively large
amount of bonds, while other dealers that are also rationed
end up with smaller amounts than they need.
   Traders allege that Salomon repeated the tactic,
submitting a huge bid at Tuesday's $5 billion sale of
Resolution Funding Corp. bonds sale, and that the Treasury
rejected all or most of that bid. That's when the Treasury
decided to change its bidding rules. The Treasury has the
right to reject bids submitted at its auctions.
   The Treasury's Mr. Basham wouldn't comment on whether
there had been abuses in the bidding process at the Refcorp
sale or any recent Treasury auctions. However, bids at the
Refcorp sale totaled $15.48 billion, well above the $5
billion of bonds sold.
   Paul Mozer, a managing director in charge of government
bond trading at Salomon Brothers, wouldn't comment on the
Refcorp rumors, but he was highly critical of the change in
auction procedures.
   "The Treasury made a rash decision without consulting the
dealer community about this change," Mr. Mozer told Dow Jones
Capital Markets Report.
   "Potentially, this ties the hands of the larger dealers,
who, time in and time out, buy the bulk of the debt," Mr.
Mozer said.
   He said the same six to eight dealers buy the largest
amount of securities sold at Treasury auctions every year and
are likely to continue to do so.
   Mr. Mozer said that curbing the ability of the biggest
bond brokerage firms to take larger positions at auctions
will hamper "our ability to provide liquidity" in the bond
market.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices ended little changed from Tuesday.
   At the seven-year auction, the Treasury sold $8 billion of
securities at an average yield of 8.57%. The yield was down
from 8.62% at the previous seven-year note auction April 11.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
                                                                                                       

   Applications ........................... $47,015,398,000
   Accepted bids ..........................  $8,000,188,000
   Accepted at low price ..................            100%
   Accepted noncompetitively ..............    $524,000,000
   Average price (Rate) ...................  99.637 (8.57%)
   High price (Rate) ......................  99.741 (8.55%)
   Low price (Rate) .......................  99.586 (8.58%)
   Interest rate ..........................          8 1/2%
                                                                                                       

   The notes are dated July 16 and mature July 15, 1997.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended a subdued session with slim
price gains.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues all advanced 3/32, to prices of 99
3/32, 98 3/8 and 98 29/32, respectively.
   News that Fannie Mae's earnings in the second quarter were
$1.10 per share, fully diluted, up from 75 cents per share in
the second quarter of 1989 and from $1.06 per share in the
first quarter of 1990 had little impact in the secondary
market for Fannie Mae mortgage securities.
   It was Fannie Mae's 10th consecutive quarter of record
earnings.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Investment-grade corporate bond prices rose slightly
yesterday while junk bonds were 3/8 to 1/2 higher.
   Junk bonds issued to supermarket chains were boosted by
news that sales at Safeway Inc. stores open more than a year
were up 4.1% in the latest quarter, traders say.
   Safeway Stores Holding Corp.'s 11.75% senior subordinated
notes, due in 1996, ended 1/2 point higher at 102. Kroger
Co.'s 11 1/8% senior notes, maturing in 1998, also rose 1/2
point to trade at 100.
   Junk bonds issued to Donald Trump's Atlantic City, N.J.,
casino, Trump Taj Mahal, slipped after a report that the
Trump Organization has begun negotiations with contractors
who claim they are owed $70 million for work on the resort
and hotel development.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc.'s 14% first mortgage bonds,
due in 1998, ended 3/8 point lower at 51 1/2. Traders say
trading in the issues was heavy. Other Trump issues were
generally unaffected by the news.
   Among new issues, the first offering of subordinated debt
in the U.S. market by a Japanese bank was warmly received by
investors. Sumitomo Bank International Finance N.V., a unit
of Sumitomo Bank Ltd., offered $500 million of 10-year
subordinated notes at a yield of 9.554%.
   Sumitomo is expected to offer an additional $700 million
in floating rate notes in the European market today.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended 1/8 point higher to 1/4 point
higher.
   In the primary market, Phoenix, Arizona, issued $118
million of general-obligation bonds and street and highway
user revenue bonds.
   An underwriting group led by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
is offering the $72.63 million general-obligation bond
portion of the issue. Those bonds were priced for reoffering
to yield from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.05% in 2014.
   Clayton Brown &amp; Associates Inc. is the lead underwriter
for the remainder of the deal, $45 million of street and
highway user revenue bonds. Those bonds were priced to yield
from 6% in 1991 to 7.20% in 2010.
   In secondary dealings, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 ended 1/8 higher at 99 to yield
7.24%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese government bonds ended firmer on reports that the
Bank of Japan moved in the middle of the afternoon to cap the
incipient rise in short-term interest rates.
   The Bank of Japan lent 200 billion yen ($1.35 billion) to
banks near the market's close. The central bank lent 300
billion Tuesday. The central bank intends the successive
rounds of lending to soothe the market's renewed speculation
that the Bank of Japan is going to push up interest rates
further.
   On Tuesday, Washington, D.C.-based Smick Medley
International reported that the Bank of Japan is going to
boost its discount rate "in the next several months." Smick
Medley's report stirred Japan's financial markets, which
already had been looking for the Bank of Japan to tighten
sometime after September.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange the
benchmark 10-year bond was quoted at a price of 86.95, up
0.21, erasing the decline of the previous day. The issue's
yield fell to 7.205%.
   (Foreign bond yields are quoted here in local terms and
therefore differ somewhat from yields calculated for these
markets by U.S. investment firms, which tend to use the
semiannual compound measure to compare yields across
markets.)
