   WASHINGTON -- A senior executive of Freedlander Inc., the
Mortgage People, pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining
more than $200 million from the Federal National Mortgage
Association and other investors, the Justice Department said.
   Eve Freedlander, a member of the family that founded the
Richmond, Va.-based second-mortgage lender and that continues
to control it, filed the guilty plea yesterday in federal
court in Richmond, according to the Justice Department.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Neither Ms. Freedlander nor the other members of her
family who run Freedlander Inc. could be reached for comment
yesterday. Freedlander Inc. is the nation's fourth-largest
second-mortgage lender, the Justice Department said. It made
second-mortgage loans and packaged them into securities,
which it sold to institutional and private investors. The
company also serviced these loans on behalf of the investors
by collecting monthly payments and foreclosing on loans that
weren't repaid.
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said that the
scheme involved the submission of false loan-performance
information to the Federal National Mortgage Association,
also known as Fannie Mae, and other buyers to induce them to
purchase the loans originated by Freedlander. He said the
company hid "the nonperforming nature of many of the loans
which it sold to encourage investors to continue to purchase
those loans."
   Fannie Mae has filed a civil lawsuit against Freedlander
Inc., seeking more than $20 million in damages. Fannie Mae,
which runs a secondary market in home loans, purchased more
than $200 million of these loans from Freedlander Inc. from
November 1982 through August 1985. The suit is still pending,
Fannie Mae said.
   Ms. Freedlander faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in
prison and $750,000 in fines.

   The Latest Crime Figures Indicate
   Staying at Home Isn't Much Safer

   SEOUL, South Korea -- Boy Scouts should "Be Prepared," but
need they pack riot gear for the 17th World Scout Jamboree in
Korea next year?
   A lot of U.S. moms and dads seem to think so. They believe
Korea is just too dangerous, even though their Scouts have
probably already survived subzero camping, undercooked food
and rope-bridge crossings. The parents have seen coverage of
bomb-throwing anti-U.S. student protesters and don't want
their teen-agers earning merit badges in riot control.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So organizers of the giant camping trip, held roughly
every four years, are having trouble persuading U.S. Scouts
to camp in the shadow of Mount Sorak. During the Aug. 8-16,
1991, event, Scouts from European socialist countries may
make their first appearance at a world jamboree. Scouts from
121 other countries will be there, with Japanese Scouts in
record numbers. And some Girl Scouts will brave it.
   But so far only about 2,000 U.S. Scouts have asked for
applications. That compares with 3,000 -- at least -- that
jamboree officials in Seoul were hoping to get, and the
7,000-strong contingent the U.S. sent to Japan in 1971.
"There is still a perception of Korea that it is not a garden
spot," says Terry R. Hanna, a prominent Oklahoma City
attorney and Scout leader who is drumming up interest in the
jamboree.
   So supporters have made a video showing Korea at its best,
sent letters to Scout councils around the nation and asked
businessmen who have visited Korea to assure parents about
its safety and hospitality. They point out that Korea isn't
another Iran, where the 1979 world jamboree had to be
canceled when Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah.
"It's not a life or death matter, but I want the Boy Scouts
of America to be represented here," says Kim Kyu Young,
secretary general of the Boy Scouts of Korea.
   The U.S. news media are being blamed for the fears about
safety, because isolated incidents have at times made it
appear that the entire country was in flames. In reality,
protests -- small and almost always contained on college
campuses by riot police -- are dwindling, and no American has
ever been attacked by Korean protesters.
   In Korea, Doug Smith, a 19-year-old Eagle Scout from
Portland, Ore., and volunteer worker for the jamboree,
concedes that his parents initially were worried about his
safety. "But they came out and visited and saw it was OK," he
says.

   PHILADELPHIA -- Consolidated Rail Corp. increased its
quarterly dividend 14%, as a big reduction in shares
outstanding improved its per-share net income.
   The freight railroad boosted the payout to 40 cents a
share from 35 cents, payable Sept. 14 to stock of record Aug.
31.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though Conrail posted a 9.8% decline in second-quarter net
income to $74 million from $82 million a year earlier,
earnings per share increased 35% to $1.61 from $1.19. Profit
on a fully diluted basis was $1.46 a share in the latest
period.
   Revenue declined 2.3% to $861 million from $881 million.
   The company said the number of common shares outstanding
as of June 30 was 38% lower than that of a year earlier,
accounting for the improvement in quarterly earnings per
share.
   Graeme Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston Corp., said:
"Conrail is generating substantial cash flow in excess of its
capital spending requirements. In addition, the company is
paying dividends on fewer shares outstanding, which makes
additional cash available to boost the dividend rate."
   Conrail said it had an after-tax gain of about $9 million
in the latest quarter, resulting from its previously reported
sale of the Cockeysville, Md., industrial track to the
Maryland Mass Transit Administration. But the company said
the gain was more than offset by a $15 million reduction in
net owing to the financing of the first quarter's $1.1
billion tender offer.
   James Hagen, Conrail's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said that overall traffic levels in the
second quarter were "essentially flat," and that the company
continued to be subject to pricing pressure and an
unfavorable traffic mix. For example, Conrail hauled
relatively higher volumes of low-rated commodities, such as
coal, and lower volumes of high-rated freight, such as autos.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Conrail shares closed at $50.25, down 75 cents.

   Junk Central Europe's Factories and Start Over

   Everybody in the fall of 1989 -- a few short months ago --
was sure that German unification would take years. Similarly,
the current common wisdom is that liquidating the Stalinist
economies of Central Europe -- East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary (all areas that before World War II were
economically fully developed) -- will take many years.
Actually, the changes are coming with lightning speed, and
there is no slowing or stopping them. For the goods turned
out by Central Europe's plants have become unsalable.
   By 1995, Volkswagen expects to make 250,000 Rabbits in a
plant in Zwickau, East Germany, that last year turned out
50,000 of the tiny, expensive and chronically malfunctioning
Trabant cars. But what is that plant going to make during
these next five years? Not a single Trabant can be sold now
that East Germans can buy, for less money, bigger and
infinitely better Western-made Fords, Volkswagens, Opels or
Fiats. Central European-made textiles, appliances, toys, hand
tools, processed foods and shoes have all become similarly
unsalable and are, indeed, no longer on the store shelves in
Berlin, Budapest and Prague. And even the lushest government
subsidy could not make a Western manufacturer put into its
automobile bodies the heavy and pockmarked sheet steel that
Central European rolling mills turn out.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For Central Europe to regain a modicum of prosperity, let
alone enjoy social and political stability, its industries
must become productive and competitive in no time at all.
This requires, however, that industrial employment be slashed
more drastically than it has ever been slashed, even in a
severe depression. East Germany's total labor force numbers
nine million (out of a total population of 16.5 million).
West German economists, including those of the trade unions,
estimate that between three million and four million workers
will have to be laid off if East German industry is to
survive in a competitive market. This, although East Germany
has the most efficient industries of the entire Soviet Bloc.
   A rapid economic turnaround has to be Central Europe's top
priority. Without it there will be neither social nor
political stability. But the region's fragile democracies,
with their tremendous social and political tensions, could
not stand prolonged mass unemployment. They need something
unprecedented: radical job cuts coupled with employment
maintenance or, at least, income maintenance. This is the
turnaround challenge of Central Europe.
   And it is the prosperity and stability not just of Central
Europe that is at stake, but that of Western Europe as well.
A successful turnaround of Central Europe offers
unprecedented opportunities to Western Europe, and above all
to West Germany. It promises a long investment-led boom that
would make Europe the world's economic leader.
   But failure to turn around the economies of Central
Europe, and fast, would surely trigger a mass exodus of
despairing people from the East -- a larger-scale repetition
of the flight of 3,000 East Germans a day that inundated West
Germany before the Berlin Wall crumbled last autumn. And if
prolonged mass unemployment were the price for the
turnaround, it would evoke the same response. "I am
optimistic," said a West German publisher when he told me of
his buying a number of East German newspapers. "But it's a
high-low poker game with the biggest stakes ever."
   To produce 250,000 cars a year in Zwickau, Volkswagen
expects to employ no more people than had been employed in
the same plant to build 50,000 Trabants. In other words, four
out of every five Trabant workers should never have been on
the payroll.
   Central Europe's most efficient steel mill, Witkowice in
Czechoslovakia, produces about the same tonnage it did in
1938, but with a substantially larger work force. In the
West, even an inefficent steel mill turns out 2 1/2 times the
tonnage per worker it did 50 years ago, or about three times
what Witkowice does.
   Even the plants in Central Europe that have kept abreast
of technology are overstaffed. The Tungsram works outside of
Budapest, of which General Electric recently acquired
control, make a first-rate light bulb. But they employ almost
50% more people, proportionately, than do GE, Siemens and
Philips in their light-bulb plants in the West.
   These are not isolated examples. In a Stalinist economy,
over-staffing is not mismanagement; it is a virtue and built
into the system. All incentives reward putting more people on
the payroll: capital available for investment in the plant;
raw materials allocated to the plant; managerial pay and
managerial perks. As a political system too, Stalinism pushes
over-staffing. Large plants are expected to create jobs to
reward the party faithful.
   A Stalinist economy also misemploys. All its emphasis is
on the heavy industries of the 1920s: coal mining, steel,
commodity chemicals. As a result, employment in Central
Europe is concentrated in the "smokestack" industries in
which there is over-capacity world-wide. A good many, some
very big employers among them, will shut down. A likely
candidate for the padlock is the large chemical complex in
Bitterfeld, East Germany, probably Europe's biggest. Because
its raw material is lignite -- a sulfur-laden, ash-rich, soft
coal -- its costs are double those of its petroleum-using
competitors across the border in West Germany. And reducing
lignite's life-threatening pollution to the minimum
acceptable level would drive up costs by an added two-fifths
or so.
   Yet, typically there is little alternative employment
available in the areas in which these over-manned or obsolete
plants are located. Stalinism deliberately organized its
political control around one big plant or industry that
dominates its region. Zwickau, Witkowice and Bitterfeld are
all single-employer towns. It is precisely there, however,
that jobs will have to be cut the most.
   There are substantial employment opportunities in Central
Europe. Many workers will be needed, for instance, to rebuild
the obsolescent, dilapidated factories that are Stalinism's
legacy. To convert Zwickau into an efficient Volkswagen plant
should keep one-third of its present work force busy.
Rebuilding Central Europe's industry could provide jobs for
something like 5% of the total industrial work force, it is
estimated. It won't come cheap, though. Volkswagen, for
instance, plans to invest $3 billion in Zwickau -- more than
it should cost to build such a plant from scratch. In East
Germany capital will not be much of a problem, however; West
Germany has deep pockets. In Hungary and Czechoslovakia, too,
capital to rebuild the plants seems to be available from the
West.
   Another substantial employment opportunity -- perhaps for
as much as another 5% of the work force -- lies in rebuilding
the run-down infrastructure of Central Europe. East Germany,
for instance, has fewer telephones now than it had before
World War II; its railroads and highways also have fallen
well below prewar standards. The biggest infrastructure need
in all of Central Europe is housing; communist regimes always
treat it as a stepchild. What is needed is not public housing
but housing that gives privacy, is privately financed and
privately owned. "If only," a Czech friend said, "we could
find someone like your Mr. Levitt who built the Levittowns in
Long Island and around Philadelphia after World War II."
   But the biggest employment opportunities lie in services.
Communist regimes consider them "bourgeois" and are hostile
to them. There is, therefore, tremendous demand all over
Central Europe for every kind of service: retail and
wholesale distribution; repair and maintenance; banking and
insurance; restaurants, laundries, dry cleaners and so on.
Services, as we know, can come into being practically
overnight and without much investment. All they require is a
local entrepreneur. And since factory workers in Central
Europe have been badly paid, shifting into service work often
means making more money. Europe's best chance for a
successful turnaround may then lie in rapidly building a
thriving service sector.
   The biggest question regarding Central Europe's turnaround
is a political one. Will governments refrain from doing the
wrong things, however popular they might be?
   The worst thing Europe's governments could do -- and the
one they are, alas, most likely to do -- is subsidize
continuing industrial over-staffing. Unless Central Europe's
manufacturing plants become competitive very fast, there will
be no turnaround. Cutting piecemeal is the wrong move in a
turnaround, and the most expensive move in the end. One must
be able to tell people, "We're done with cutting. Let's start
building." Otherwise no one does any work.
   Any financial assistance given -- and quite a bit will be
needed -- should be aimed at creating new, productive jobs.
There might also be a need to provide income maintenance --
e.g., following early retirement. But subsidizing
unproductive and redundant jobs can only obstruct economic
recovery. It ultimately endangers social stability.
   Equally dangerous would be protecting Central European
industries from competition within Europe. There will be high
barriers in Europe against Japan and South Korea. But rapid
European economic integration must not be sacrificed to the
short-term problems of Central Europe.
   Finally, there is the legacy of 40 years of Stalinism: the
hostility in Central Europe to services and especially to the
independent entrepreneur. "We need 500 house painters in
Prague alone," my Czech friend said, "and there'd be more
than enough work for them. But the government monopolies
wouldn't sell them ladders or paint brushes or paint. They'd
consider them antisocial and parasites." In the last
analysis, Central Europe's turnaround may therefore well be
as much a matter of political courage and political will as
of investments and of economics.
   Market economics and free enterprise, it is now being
said, have won over communism. This is not really true.
Communism collapsed from within, economically, politically
and, above all, morally: It defeated itself. Free enterprise
and market economics -- and democracy as well -- will have
won only when they have turned around Central Europe.

   Your June 18 page-one story about Plum Creek Timber
("Unkindest Cut: Timber Firm Stirs Ire Felling Forests Faster
Than They Regenerate") is a rehash that all but ignores the
significant environmental and financial strides we've been
making over a number of years. You left the reader with no
sense of our direction and commitment. There clearly was no
effort to balance the positions of our critics with Plum
Creek's record on the ground.
   You leave the mistaken impression that Plum Creek is
financially unsound. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Our debt-to-capital ratio is average for our industry and we
have no junk-bond financing. Moreover, we have a strong
balance sheet with excellent cash reserves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At Plum Creek, profitability and environmental
responsibility go hand in hand because we are committed to
being in the timber business long-term. Plum Creek is a
leader in developing alternatives to clear cutting and
implementing "new forestry" practices that better preserve
wildlife and the forest ecosystem while allowing reasonable
timber harvests.
   At a time when it makes economic sense to have 200-plus
acre harvests, we have voluntarily limited ours in Washington
state's Cascades to 90 acres. While several of our
longstanding critics cited in the article allege that Plum
Creek is overcutting its land in response to overseas
markets, the numbers tell a different story altogether. We
have scaled back our Cascade harvest by 45% since 1986
despite near-record prices for timber. We expect further
reductions in our harvest firm-wide as we move to managed
stands. These initiatives demonstrate our sensitivity to the
environment, our communities and our commitment to the
long-term.
   Your reporter completely neglected our positive record on
threatened and endangered species, on habitat preservation
and water quality, one that is second to none. Our wildlife
biologist and hydrologist play an integral role in our
planning and harvest decisions.
   In Washington state, Plum Creek has adjusted plans and
harvest schedules as a result of spotted-owl surveys it has
conducted. It is deferring harvests and is involved in road
management and cooperative research to protect elk migration
and calving. In Montana, we sponsor research and implement
management plans to protect bald-eagle and grizzly habitats.
In all our states, we monitor water quality and conduct
studies of aquatic insects and sediment samples in
cooperation with state, federal and tribal organizations.
   I am proud of our loggers, foresters and scientists and
their forestry practices. Their record is a good one and it's
getting better. Our employees, unit holders and customers are
angry that your article missed so much.

   You fail to explain what most grade-school kids out here
in Montana know: Mature forests generate negligible growth.
If growing more timber is a desired goal, the only way is for
firms to manage a transition to second-growth forests, where
the mean annual-growth increment per acre is significantly
higher. To chastise Plum Creek on the one hand for harvesting
more than it grows and on the other for cutting mature timber
reflects a misunderstanding of forest management.
   The controversies facing the forest-products industry in
the Pacific Northwest are technically complex and emotionally
charged. Prudent policy responses must be rooted in keen
understanding of economic processes as opposed to knee-jerk
reactions to environmentalists whose voices, in your words,
are "tight with emotion."

   It's clear that the 19th-century robber baron of the
Burlington Northern is alive and well today. The barony
remains intact, but the times have changed.
   There's something terribly wrong with our values and
concepts of ownership when a bunch of vandals like this are
allowed to destroy irreplaceable natural resources in search
of short-term profit.
   It's particularly grating to hear this kind of
self-justification from a company that has enjoyed a generous
bounty from our citizenry in past generations. It's time for
a "giveback."

   It is disturbing to me that while Eastern Europe is

   Rep. Dingell Assails Air Force on Decision
   By U.S. Not to Pursue Northrop Lawsuit

   A congressional panel charged that a Justice Department
decision not to pursue civil charges against Northrop Corp.
for alleged B-2 Stealth bomber mischarges stemmed from a
finding that "the Air Force was fully aware that Northrop's
reports were false" but did nothing about it.
   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, asserted in a
letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that the Air Force
"abandoned its fiduciary responsibilities to protect the
interests of the taxpayers while making the single largest
investment in a weapons system in this country's history."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, Northrop confirmed it lost a South Korean
arbitrator's decision in a dispute over a $6,250,000 payment
it made to some Seoul businessmen. The company said it will
appeal the decision by the Korean Commercial Arbitration
Board. Northrop, which said it's pursuing other attempts to
recover the money, insists the money was earmarked for a
hotel venture and that the company was bilked out of all of
it.
   Mr. Dingell's investigators and two federal grand juries,
though, are trying to determine whether Northrop executives
instead intended the money as a bribe so that Korean
officials would buy F-20 jet fighters, in violation of the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company and its
executives, including Chairman Thomas V. Jones, deny any
wrongdoing.
   Both the B-2 and F-20 controversies are sure to surface
during a Dingell subcommittee hearing, possibly this month,
into Northrop's business activities.
   Citing a 1988 memorandum prepared by Howard Daniels, civil
division chief of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles,
Mr. Dingell noted that the Justice Department concluded that
Northrop "did, in fact, present inaccurate cost and
scheduling data . . . and earned-value estimates" on the
Stealth bomber project. The Daniels memo called Northrop's
scheduling system "essentially a farce."
   Mr. Dingell's staff said the government attorney's memo,
still unreleased by the Justice Department, didn't allege the
amount of the overcharging. A private lawsuit brought by
several former employees contends the fraud totaled more than
$20 billion.
   A Northrop spokesman in Los Angeles and an Air Force
spokesman both declined to comment; Mr. Daniels couldn't be
reached for comment.
   The allegations of B-2 mischarges first were raised two
years ago by some former Northrop managers and auditors.
Under the federal False Claims Act, the U.S. reviews
whistle-blower cases to decide if it wants to join as a
co-plaintiff.
   "Just because the government knows of fraud does not
eliminate its obligation to take action against it," said
Herbert Hafif, a Claremont, Calif., attorney representing the
whistle-blowers.
   In his letter, Mr. Dingell asked Mr. Cheney to "convene a
court of inquiry" analyzing the Justice Department findings.
   The Daniels memo, according to the congressman, said that
while some whistle-blower allegations were essentially
accurate, "the Air Force has known of these facts for some
time but has chosen to take no remedial action." The memo
said: "Accordingly, there is no provable fraud because there
is no detrimental reliance on false representations."
   Noting that the memo claimed only two government auditors
were checking on the B-2 through the early 1980s, Mr. Dingell
fumed: "That breaks down to about $10 billion per auditor.
Using that ratio, we could oversee the entire $300 billion
defense budget with 30 auditors." He called the situation
"nothing short of criminally negligent," adding that the memo
suggests "a conspiracy between the Air Force and Northrop to
mislead" the defense secretary and Congress on a "pet
program" carrying a $65 billion-plus price tag. He called the
concerns "cause enough to terminate this program."

   NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. restructured
its board so that outsiders now officially run what remains
of the once-powerful securities firm.
   Drexel said its new chairman will be current board member
Ralph S. Saul, formerly chairman of Cigna Corp., head of
First Boston Corp.'s management committee and president of
the American Stock Exchange. He succeeds John Shad, who
remains a director.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   John F. Sorte remains chief executive officer, and was
elected to the additional post of president, succeeding
Frederick Joseph, who was Drexel's longtime leader and who
becomes vice chairman. Mr. Sorte will also be chairman of the
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. brokerage unit, succeeding Edwin
Kantor, who becomes a senior executive vice president.
   Drexel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in
February. Although most of the firm and its units have been
liquidated, Drexel has said that it plans to emerge from
bankruptcy proceedings as a going concern.
   Three new outside directors were elected to the Drexel
board: Fletcher L. Byrom, former chairman of Koppers Co.;
Deborah Hicks Midanek, a managing director at Solon Asset
Management Corp. and former Drexel employee, and Frederick W.
Zuckerman, vice president and treasurer of Chrysler Corp. who
has announced plans to leave the auto maker.
   The board now includes eight members, five from outside
the firm.
   Mr. Sorte said the board's restructuring reflects "our
determination to protect the creditors and preserve equity
values."
   Mr. Hills, a former SEC chairman, resigned from Drexel's
board, citing a conflict of interest with his law firm.
   The only three Drexel employees who remain on the Drexel
board are Mr. Joseph, Mr. Sorte and Richard J. Wright, chief
financial officer. Others leaving the Drexel board include
Joseph Vitanza, Howard Brenner and Robert Linton.

   American Home
   Net Gained 13%
   In Second Period
   ---
   But Earnings Declined 18%
   Without Special Items;
   Other Drug Firms Rose

   NEW YORK -- American Home Products Corp. said
second-quarter net income advanced 13%, but excluding the net
effect of a gain on the sale of its household-products unit
and a charge for a number of expenses, net dropped 18%.
   The charge surprised analysts and traders, who knocked a
couple of dollars off American Home's stock price.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, three other major pharmaceutical makers
reported increases in net: Merck &amp; Co., 19%; Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., 21%; and Warner-Lambert Co., 20%.
   Late last month, American Home closed the $1.25 billion
sale of its Boyle-Midway division to Britain's Reckitt &amp;
Colman PLC. American Home, which sold the assets to further
focus on pharmaceuticals, posted a $1 billion pretax gain on
the sale.
   But the company also charged $697 million for a number of
items; the effect of the gain and the charge added $73
million to net income. Sales inched up 1.1% to $1.61 billion
from $1.59 billion.
   "Part of (the surprise) is related to the fact that
American Home is somewhat uncommunicative in terms of their
dealings with the financial community," said Ronald M.
Nordmann, analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc.
   But Mr. Nordmann also said the company carefully manages
its books, and despite the special items, American Home's
per-share net came in as expected. The company hasn't had a
down quarter for earnings in 37 1/2 years. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Home fell
$2.125 to $52.25.
   A spokesman for American Home said results were held back
by softer sales of over-the-counter medicines; retailers
found that the cost of carrying larger inventories exceeded
the benefits of buying larger quantities of items at
discount. Introductions of some competitive products also
were a negative factor, he said.
   A major issue, the spokesman said, was that sales of the
pain reliever Advil were hit by a study at Johns Hopkins
University, linking ibuprofen, Advil's key ingredient, with
side effects in kidney patients. "Sales have come back, and
we've recovered 60% of the drop," the spokesman said.
   American Home took the $697 million charge, the spokesman
said, in part to write off good will from two acquisitions: a
hospital-supply business from Chesebrough-Pond's in 1986; and
VLI Corp., a maker of contraceptive sponges, in 1987.
   The charge also covers costs to reorganize and consolidate
European operations when the European Community drops its
trade barriers in 1992. Certain hospital-supply unit plants
also will be closed; the move won't require substantial job
cuts, the spokesman said.
   Also, American Home booked what it expects will be the
costs of providing medical benefits for its current retirees.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board is considering a
proposal to require companies to account for such costs by
1993.
   And like others in the pharmaceutical industry, American
Home boosted its reserves for costs of possible product
liabilities and environmental cleanup.
   As for the other drug companies, sales at Merck, Rahway
N.J., grew 20% to $1.9 billion from $1.59 billion, and many
of the same new products that drove the first quarter
continued into the second. Second-period sales climbed 30%
for Vasotec, which reduces high blood pressure and treats
congestive heart failure, and 39% for Mevacor, which cuts
cholesterol levels, Mr. Nordmann said.
   In foreign markets, Zocor added $70 million in sales, up
from $15 million a year ago, Mr. Nordmann said. Zocor, which
also cuts cholesterol, isn't approved for sale in the U.S.
   The analyst expects Losec, which posted sales of $20
million in the second quarter, to make "a huge contribution"
in the future; the drug wasn't on the market last year's
second period. The drug has been approved to treat
inflammations of the windpipe, but a Food and Drug
Administration panel has urged approval of the drug's use for
short-term treatment of certain ulcers, a potentially much
wider group of patients. Merck licenses the drug for U.S.
marketing from AB Astra, a Swedish research firm.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb said in a brief statement that U.S.
sales grew 7%, international sales added 17%, drug sales
growth was "particularly strong," and currency-exchange rates
added 1% to sales. A spokesman wouldn't elaborate, but
analysts said that one product driving results is Capoten,
which treats heart disease. The company's sales grew 11% to
$2.48 billion from $2.24 billion.
   Warner-Lambert, where sales climbed 13% to $1.15 billion,
saw "particularly good growth" -- 27% higher sales -- from
its Lopid cholesterol regulator, Mr. Nordmann said. As a
group, sales of prescription drugs at the Morris Plains,
N.J., company were up 17%, while sales of over-the-counter
products, led by Listerine mouthwash and Halls cough drops,
among others, advanced 14%. "The mix of business was very
favorable," emphasizing higher-profit-margin items, Mr.
Nordmann said.
   In Big Board composite trading yesterday, Merck rose 12.5
cents to $90.125, Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 50 cents to
$64.25, and Warner-Lambert dropped $1.875 to $67.25.

   WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission member
Mary Schapiro offered mild support for proposed legislation
that would beef up regulation of the financial-planning
industry.
   The bill, proposed by Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), would
force better disclosure by people calling themselves
investment advisers and toughen penalties the SEC could
impose on wrongdoers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The legislation won't be considered seriously in this
legislative session, particularly because Republicans on the
House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance oppose
several of the bill's provisions. For example, Rep. Matthew
Rinaldo (R., N.J.) expressed concern that the bill would put
burdensome additional rules on already regulated insurance
agents, securities professionals, accountants and lawyers.
   Ms. Schapiro, representing the SEC in testimony before the
subcommittee, also expressed concern about regulatory
overkill, but offered the agency's backing for stepped-up
oversight of financial planners. She said the agency needs to
raise fees charged on planners so that the SEC can afford to
do more inspections.
   A recent GAO report criticized SEC oversight of the
financial-planning industry, contending that registering
planners may be doing "more harm than good." Ms. Schapiro
argued that the SEC does what it can given the relatively
small amount of money allocated, a point the GAO report also
made.

remain executive vice president.
   Emil Martini spent "all of his working life" at Bergen
Brunswig or its predecessor, Bergen Drug Co., which was
founded by the brothers' father, the spokesman said. Bergen
Brunswig's sales have jumped to more than $4 billion from

exchange rate of 148 yen to the dollar, that equals a range
of about $44 to $57.

   Suzuki said that U.S. law bars U.S. residents or

   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Pier 1 Imports said that sales rose
almost 12% in June but that sales for those at stores open
more than a year fell 2.6%.
   The company attributed the slip in sales at older stores
to a decline in furniture sales. "The consumer has lost a
little confidence in the economy and is buying less
furniture," said Robert G. Herndon, chief financial officer
for the home-furnishing retailer. Mr. Herndon said the
company's sales of soft goods remain strong.

   In June, Pier 1 had sales of $56.9 million, up from $50.9

   FINDLAY, Ohio -- Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. directors voted
a 2-for-1 split of the common stock and raised the dividend
by 33%.
   The producer of replacement auto and truck tires also
reported a 9.2% rise in second-quarter net, in spite of tire
price discounting. Net was $16.4 million, or 80 cents a share
on current shares, up from $15.1 million, or 74 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose 2.3% to $234.7 million from
$229.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dividend on the new shares will be six cents
quarterly, equal to 12 cents on current stock, an increase
from the nine cents paid in each of the past four quarters.
   Additional shares will be distributed on Aug. 20 to shares
of record July 30. The initial dividend on the split stock
will be paid Sept. 30 to stock of record Sept. 7.
   Cooper directors think there will be a better market for
the stock at the lower price resulting from the split, said
Ivan W. Gorr, chairman and chief executive officer. The
company last split the stock, also 2-for-1, two years ago,
and has raised the dividend every year since 1979. Cooper
stock close yesterday at $36.625, up 37.5 cents.
   Second-quarter net was in line with analysts'
expectations, said Harry W. Millis, tire and rubber analyst
with McDonald &amp; Co., Cleveland. He expects the company to
earn about $3.25 a share on current shares for the full year,
up from $2.84 in 1989.
   Tire producers slashed prices last spring because of
excess inventories arising from the first-quarter plunge in
auto and truck production. Although Cooper doesn't sell tires
to the auto makers, it was affected because other tire makers
dumped into the replacement market tires that they had
produced for the auto plants.
   The worst of the discounting appears to be over, Mr.
Millis said. Also, most tire producers have announced
increases in list prices for replacement tires averaging
about 3.5%, effective during August and September.
   Profit for the first half rose 19% to $30.2 million, or
$1.47 a share, from $25.4 million, or $1.24 a share. Sales
increased 4.3% to $443.3 million from $425 million.

   El Salvador Talks With Insurgents Are Clouded
   By Lingering Questions About Civil-War Deaths

   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Leafing through yet another
autopsy report as he prepared to meet the Swiss ambassador,
President Alfredo Cristiani appeared haunted by ghosts.
   This particular ghost was of a Swiss national who fought
with the nation's insurgent Marxist guerrillas. Judging from
the forensic report, the young Swiss may have been captured,
tortured and executed by the Salvadoran army 19 months ago --
months before Mr. Cristiani assumed the presidency. Mr.
Cristiani was ready for the Swiss ambassador to bring up the
death. Diplomats from several nations had brought similar
cases to him, he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They blame 70,000 deaths on me," said Mr. Cristiani,
throwing up his arms in exasperation. "This is a constant
problem."
   As the government and the guerrillas grope toward a
negotiated solution to El Salvador's 10-year-old civil war,
the ghosts of the victims of that war -- in particular those
of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter,
allegedly murdered by Salvadoran soldiers in November -- cast
a shadow on the future.
   Nine soldiers, including Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides,
who at the time of the killings was head of the military
academy here, have been arrested on murder charges. But since
their arrest, the investigation into the killings of the
Jesuits appears to have stalled. The priests were professors
at San Salvador's Central American University and key members
of the nation's intelligentsia.
   Evidence that could implicate other high-ranking officers
has been destroyed or lost. The missing evidence includes
Col. Benavides's personal notebooks and a logbook recording
comings and goings at the military school on the night of the
murder. (The Salvadoran government says the case is moving
forward, pointing to the recent detention by the military of
the officer who destroyed the logbook. "There have been
advances," says Ernesto Altschul, vice minister of the
presidency.)
   In Mexico, Miguel Saenz, a representative of the Farabundo
Marti Liberation Front, the guerrillas' umbrella group that
is negotiating a cease-fire with the government, says that if
the government can't clear up the case of the Jesuits, among
others, then it won't be able to guarantee the guerrillas'
physical safety if they put down arms and return to civilian
political life. "How do you convince the guerrillas they
won't become the ghosts of the future?" asks William
Leogrande, a Latin American expert at American University in
Washington.
   Outrage at the murders -- which many in Congress thought
made a mockery of the U.S. effort to turn the Salvadoran
military into a professional force -- and the slow pace of
the inquiry were the main reasons that the House of
Representatives voted in May to cut this year's military aid
to El Salvador 50%. U.S. aid to El Salvador is $315.4 million
this year, of which $85 million is military aid.
   Last month, the House approved the same level of military
aid cuts for fiscal year 1991. The final aid cuts will be
subject to negotiations between the administration and
congressional leaders, but opponents of military aid say they
count on a solid majority to cut back aid as part of a plan
to encourage a negotiated solution to the war. "The Jesuit
case is the straw that broke the camel's back," says a House
staffer.
   Mr. Cristiani worries that such an aid reduction would
jeopardize the current United Nations-sponsored peace
negotiations with the FMLN. For different reasons, both sides
think the negotiations have a real chance of ending the
country's bitter civil war.
   "What the {U.S.} Congress is doing is to pose the
possibility that the FMLN will take the military route," says
Mr. Cristiani, as he drives a 10,000-pound armored jeep
across town.
   Since the first round of negotiations in Caracas in May,
the guerrillas have continued their attacks, even knocking
out electricity in part of the capital on the anniversary of
Mr. Cristiani's first year in office. Recently, unidentified
gunmen killed an army major in the capital.
   But even as the attacks continue, enormous pressures exist
on both sides to reach a negotiated peace. Internationally,
the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, and the
electoral defeat of their Sandinista allies in next-door
Nicaragua, have greatly isolated the guerrillas, challenging
some of their fundamental assumptions, although not their
ability to wage war.
   Conversely, the new era of U.S.-Soviet cooperation means
that for the U.S., El Salvador has lost whatever strategic
importance it had. In an era of tight budgets, it becomes
difficult to justify continued U.S. involvement. "The only
problem left is El Salvador," says Mr. Cristiani to a
visiting diplomat. "It's possible that the U.S. has grown
bored with it."
   Analysts say last year's bloody November guerrilla
offensive may have convinced both sides that the only way out
is through negotiations, which are expected to resume
sometime later this month. For, while the guerrillas failed
to spark a mass insurrection, they nevertheless demonstrated
impressive military capacity and brought the war to the
capital's wealthy suburbs. "The armed forces now sees that a
military defeat is impossible, that it's better to
negotiate," says the FMLN's Mr. Saenz. "The military
offensive opened up a political space for a negotiated
solution."
   But since the offensive the guerrillas have also softened
their demands. Both sides agreed to reach a mid-September
cease-fire contingent on first reaching agreement on ways to
"demilitarize" the country and instituting political and
military reforms. A second round of negotiations in Mexico
City failed to bring about agreement on those reforms, but
both sides say that tough issues were aired and progress was
made. "We see things with some optimism," says Mr. Altschul.
"We want to stop the armed encounters as quickly as
possible."
   Analysts say Mr. Cristiani may not be able to deliver on
that, given strong opposition from hard-liners in the armed
forces and in the ruling right-wing Arena party, where former
Maj. Roberto D'Abuisson, a charismatic politician with
alleged links to death squads, holds sway. Mr. Cristiani
insists both the party and the military are ready to
negotiate in good faith. "There are many people who have
criticized the armed forces," he says. "They will be
pleasantly surprised."

   Japan, the world's largest donor of official foreign aid
last year, should improve the quality and the quantity of its
aid to developing nations, a Japanese government Economic
Planning Agency advisory panel said in a report.
   The nation should increase the number of grants it gives
developing countries as a proportion of overall official aid,
the report said. In 1988, grants made up 46.6% of Japan's
official development assistance, compared with an average
78.4% among 18 other donor nations in the same period, an
agency official said. The other nations included the U.S.,
Australia and European Community nations.
   The agency report also urged Japan to increase
technological aid, which made up only 12% of Japan's total
development aid in 1988 against an average 21.3% among other
donor states. In addition, the report recommended sending
more engineering consultants abroad and inviting more
engineers to Japan for training.
   Japan is now in the middle of a five-year plan to boost
aid to more than $50 billion in 1988-1992 from $24.9 billion
in 1983-1987, an agency official said.
                                                                                                       

   GERMAN HEALTH-CARE PROBLEM
                                                                                                       

   Tens of thousands of West German youths choose each year
to work with the sick, the old and the handicapped as an
alternative to military service. But as the East-West
confrontation has eased, Bonn has reduced the conscription
period for those doing the civilian tasks from 20 months to
16, and hospitals and homes for the elderly or disabled fear
the loss of a crucial source of inexpensive labor. "We are
facing a serious problem," said Gerhard Wagner of the German
Red Cross, where 25% of the work is done by conscripts. The
number of youths choosing social service over military
training rose to 87,000 in 1989 from 6,000 in 1967.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREAN ROUNDUP
                                                                                                       

   South Korean prosecutors said about 5,000 real-estate
speculators had been rounded up in a crackdown that began
early in March. Of those detained, 540 people were arrested
and formally charged, and about 4,000 suspects booked for
investigations, prosecutors said. The government ordered the
crackdown mainly to check inflation, but land and housing
prices continue to rise.
                                                                                                       

   LAYOFFS IN SUDAN
                                                                                                       

   Sudan, struggling to fight a huge budget deficit and move
toward a market economy, said it will lay off about 50,000
government workers within a month. The move, which will
reduce the government work force by 10%, is part of a
three-year economic-reform program launched last month. Sudan
owes about $13 billion to foreign creditors.
                                                                                                       

   SAS STRIKE OVER
                                                                                                       

   Scandinavian Airlines System reached an agreement with its
Swedish pilots, whose one-day walkouts led to cancellations
of many SAS flights. SAS said it agreed to a 7% wage increase
for the pilots, who in turn pledged to raise productivity
through more flying time. The airline's Swedish pilots walked
off their jobs July 12 and 16. The pilots now average about
32,000 kronor a month ($5,370); top salaries are about 55,000
kronor.
                                                                                                       

   A JAPANESE RECORD
                                                                                                       

   The nine major electric-power companies on Japan's main
islands set a new record for output in a one-hour period
yesterday, according to Japan's Federation of Electric Power
Companies. At 0600 Greenwich Mean Time, the utilities
recorded a one-hour output of 137,946 megawatts. Japan has
been experiencing unusually hot weather, which puts a higher
call on electric power for cooling. Japan's utilities are now
working at near full capacity, a federation spokesman said.
                                                                                                       

   BONN'S ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY
                                                                                                       

   West Germany has embarked on an extensive study of the
environmental costs and benefits related to overall economic
output.
   The study, conducted by the Federal Statistics Office,
will attempt to measure and quantify the environmental
aspects of economic production, which now aren't included in
data compiled on the nation's gross national product.
   "There's doubt, whether in the long-term, GNP can still be
used as a measure of economic output," said Bonn Environment
Minister Klaus Toepfer. He said the statistics-office model
should make clear what links exist between economic and
environmental developments.
   The statistics office won't have a complete picture of the
environmental economics ready for another two years, but Mr.
Toepfer said that next January, when preliminary data on 1990
economic growth are presented, the agency should be able to
at least give some indications on how water and air pollution
have developed during the year.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   South Korea accused North Korea of "a betrayal" after the
latter postponed an inter-Korea parliamentary meeting. After
a six-month suspension, lawmakers of the two nations were
scheduled to reopen talks at the border village of Panmunjom
on Friday. North Korea said the split in the South Korean
parliament would make the scheduled talks fruitless. . . .
The State Department advised U.S. citizens to take caution
when traveling in Nepal. It said that although violent
incidents in Katmandu during the spring have diminished,
strikes and anti-government demonstrations continue.

   Your July 16 editorial "The Price of Silence" makes a very
valid point that "the essential cause of the S&amp;L debacle is
in danger of being lost amid the political name-calling."
Unfortunately, you revive and give currency to a grossly
inaccurate bit of name-calling in which I was the unhappy
target.
   You cite a singularly contemptible charge "that Mr. Wright
threatened to expose one S&amp;L regulator as a homosexual and
browbeat others to go easy on Democratic campaign
contributors."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That charge is untrue. To make a threat of that kind would
be totally alien to my character. I did not do anything of
that sort and I would not. Nobody who knows me well at all
would believe that I had ever been so crude as that.
   My judgment, like that of other mortals, is imperfect. I
have made my share of mistakes, no doubt. But I do not want
that particular bit of calumny left unanswered in the public
record.

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission sued to block
Arco Chemical Co.'s $220 million acquisition of certain
business lines from Union Carbide Corp.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, seeks an
injunction stopping the sale and rescinding the agreement on
antitrust grounds. The agreement provided for the sale to
Arco Chemical of two Carbide chemical lines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The FTC authorized its staff to file the suit last month.
But at the time Arco Chemical held out hope that antitrust
issues could still be resolved through negotiation. The
company, based in Newton Square, Pa., has already made full
payment to Carbide, and both companies say the payment is
nonrefundable under the terms of their agreement.
   The FTC has declined to comment on whether the
court-ordered rescission it is seeking would entail the
return of Arco's payment.
   In any case, the agreement provides that Arco Chemical has
rights to proceeds from a subsequent sale of the Carbide
assets to a third party. Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn.,
still operates the businesses at issue.
   Arco Chemical is 83% owned by Atlantic Richfield Co., Los
Angeles, although Arco Chemical's stock trades separately.
   Both companies issued statements saying they believe their
positions will be upheld in court. An FTC spokeswoman
declined to comment.

   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Stable imports and slipping exports
caused Brazil's trade surplus to shrink 32% to $1.15 billion
in June from a year earlier, the Federal Trade Bureau said.
   Exports totaled $2.5 billion f.o.b., which means the
seller agrees to put an item on a transportation vehicle at
no charge, but the buyer pays the actual transportation
costs. The figure was down from $3.23 billion in May. Imports
were $1.35 billion f.o.b., down from $1.5 billion last month.

<TEXT>
   The trade surplus accumulated over the past 12 months
reached $13.26 billion f.o.b., down from $19.52 billion
f.o.b. registered in the previous 12 months.

   Citicorp Plans to Reduce
   Its North American Costs

   NEW YORK -- Citicorp said it will soon disclose details of
a plan to curb out-of-line expenses in its North American
corporate banking operations.
   The nation's largest bank didn't provide any further
information, but analysts said it is almost certain that such
expense reductions will result in layoffs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Jones, executive vice president for financial
control, told analysts that "expenses are going up too much
for the level of business" in North America. "We'll be
bringing that in line."
   Mr. Jones said the problems in Citicorp's North American
business stem mostly from the reduced level of corporate
mergers and acquisitions and from the cost of credit.
   James McDermott, a banking analyst and executive vice
president of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., said that any
effort to significantly reduce expense growth would almost
certainly involve layoffs. "The thing is, I have no idea what
dimension they're talking about."
   He said that a comprehensive expense control effort
presumably would also involve "a review of business lines and
decisions about where they want to operate and in what
fashion."
   Other money center banks already have announced plans to
restructure their corporate business to reflect the lower
volume of business since the leveraged buy-out and merger and
acquisition binge of the late 1980s dried up.

   Law:
   Lawyers Who Switch Sides
   Draw Ire With Big Checks

LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)

   For lawyers, switching sides is easy -- and almost always
profitable.
   Nearly every day, a crime-busting prosecutor changes
allegiances and starts raking in big bucks representing
accused criminals. Often, too, a civil rights lawyer shows up
defending an alleged violator of civil rights, or an
environmental crusader is hired to fight back against the
environmentalists.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Changing sides is perfectly legal, of course, and many
lawyers say it's also morally defensible in a legal system in
which lawyers are trained to argue any side of an issue with
equal fervor.
   But public-interest lawyers complain that their former
colleagues are unfairly exploiting what they learned on one
side of the fence to benefit clients on the other side. And
the phenomenon is starting to worry some lawyers who are
concerned about the legal profession's already shaky image.
They say lawyers who switch sides generate cynicism about
their commitment to their clients and lend credence to the
derisive label "hired gun."
   Jerry Jackson, for one, doesn't think the label fits. He
left the National Wildlife Federation in 1988, worked briefly
in government and then landed at one of the nation's largest
and most profitable law firms, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
&amp; Flom. There, demand was increasing among corporate clients
for lawyers who could guide them through an increasingly
dense thicket of environmental laws and regulations. Mr.
Jackson says he believed that helping those corporations
could also benefit the environment.
   Only two months later, Mr. Jackson found himself pitted
against none other than the National Wildlife Federation in a
Florida case charging his client, a state water management
agency, with polluting the Everglades and a nearby wildlife
refuge. Mr. Jackson says he thinks even this role is
consistent with a commitment to the environment: "I don't
feel like my client's got a different goal from the National
Wildlife Federation as far as the Everglades are concerned,"
he says.
   Not surprisingly, Mr. Jackson's former compatriots at the
Wildlife Federation disagree. "The only way we could force
them to initiate cleanup and to start taking some positive
actions was to file a lawsuit," says David White, the
federation lawyer assigned to the case.
   Mr. Jackson won't say how much money he has made by
switching to the private sector, but he concedes it is a
substantial sum. A lawyer on the staff of the National
Wildlife Federation makes about $45,000 annually; at a firm
the size of Skadden Arps, a starting associate with a few
years' public-sector experience can earn $150,000 or more.
Says Brad Hildebrandt of the legal consulting firm
Hildebrandt Inc., "It's quite easy to double or triple or
more your compensation by making that move if you are going
to a firm of any size."
   Mr. Jackson is hardly alone in failing to generate
understanding among his former colleagues. Charles Morgan,
former head of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Washington office, enraged many in the ACLU by building a
private practice defending clients like Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
against race and sex discrimination charges, and the New York
Power Authority in its effort to continue operating a nuclear
power plant near New York City.
   Mr. Morgan maintains that his change in clientele didn't
reflect any change in values; even at the ACLU, he says, he
never considered himself an "issues" lawyer. Instead, he
says, he took the view that a lawyer is the advocate for
whatever client comes his way.
   It's a philosophy that angers cause-oriented advocates --
and one that some public-interest lawyers claim is
disingenuous. Recalling Mr. Morgan's days as a civil rights
lawyer in the South, consumer activist Ralph Nader says,
"Nobody could have gone through what he went through and not
been a cause lawyer."
   Other lawyers who move into the private sector readily
acknowledge that their philosophies have, indeed, changed
over time. James Neal, a Nashville lawyer who prosecuted
Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa and Nixon Attorney General John
Mitchell, says he has had a change of heart since his days as
a federal prosecutor. "I was a zealot," he says, adding that
if he were ever to take on prosecution work again he would be
"more tempered."
   "I thought we would rid the world of all of its ills if we
put Jimmy Hoffa in jail," Mr. Neal says. But since then, he
laments, "the Teamster chieftains have gone from bad to
worse."
   To still-zealous prosecutors, Mr. Neal's list of clients
probably looks as though it has gone from bad to worse. He
took on Ford Motor Co.'s defense in the highly publicized
criminal trial over lethally defective Ford Pintos, and he is
defending Exxon from criminal charges tied to the Exxon
Valdez oil spill.
   Barbara Brown, who worked for a women's rights advocacy
group before joining the law firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp;
Walker in Washington, D.C., says she has acquired a better
appreciation for corporations and their needs since she made
her move. Ms. Brown, who now defends companies faced with sex
discrimination charges, is unabashed about her new-felt
sympathies toward management. "I'm uncomfortable with a lot
of what I see as plaintiffs not willing to take
responsibility for their own careers," she says.
   Not all erstwhile public interest lawyers are quite as
happy with their decisions to head into the private sector.
Harrison Wellford, a former executive director of the Center
for Responsive Law who is now with a Washington, D.C., law
firm, says private practice can be frustrating because the
client's objectives set the parameters of the lawyer's work.
He says that means he often can't attack defects in the law
even when the problem adversely affects his client.
   But for most public interest lawyers who go behind enemy
lines, the decision to switch sides -- however agonizing
initially -- seems to bring few regrets. Indeed, many of
these lawyers argue that the public interest is in fact
better served when a lawyer's practice includes clients on
more than one side of a particular issue. "Cause" lawyers,
they say, often lack an adequate understanding of their
adversaries' positions, forcing the parties into rancorous,
costly lawsuits when more amicable resolutions might be
possible.
   Mr. Neal argues, for example, that lawyers who remain
prosecutors for too long often "become absolutely insensitive
to people in trouble." In an adversarial system, he says,
"it's unhealthy to become an issues lawyer."

   Monday, July 23, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and
times vary, so check local listings): "Lost Man's River: An
Everglades Journey With Peter Matthiessen." A trip through
crocodile country with the aging but still springy novelist,
naturalist and student of Zen. The natural lore of island and
swampland is fascinating, a good deal more so than Mr.
Matthiessen's philosophic reflections on life. Indeed, our
guide's many admonitions on living in the present, the
importance of seizing the moment, and various sub-Buddhist
babblings make something of a swamp all by themselves. Still,
it is worth paddling through to get to the reptiles, and to
gather potentially useful information such as how best to
kill a large alligator -- plug him dead in the eye.

   Monday, July 23, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on TNT: "Rising Son." A
grim saga assaying an assault on the ever-fashionable theme
of corporate greed. Set in the early '80s, it deals with
joblessness and factory closings, and, with equal grimness, a
conflict between an overambitious father and his son. Thick
with denunciations of slimy corporate types in suits who are
selling out the honest workers, and also the nation's future,
this talky enterprise is rescued by Brian Dennehy in the role
of the Willy Loman-like father. The naked steals from "Death
of a Salesman" are hard to miss and also hard to take, as is
the relentless propagandizing. Still, thanks mostly to Mr.
Dennehy, there are long, absorbing patches between the
preachments.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, July 23, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "You're the Top:
The Cole Porter Story." This "American Masters" segment is a
treat for lovers of Porter songs and musicals. It's also a
far cry from Hollywood's version of the Cole Porter story, in
which Cary Grant played the songwriter. Anything but Cary
Grant-like in appearance, Porter was a small, pop-eyed man
from a rich family whose taste for luxurious living was
legendary among his friends. The treat includes some
first-class stories about the making of "Kiss Me Kate" and
anecdotes by Bob Hope, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Cyd
Charisse. You also get to hear Fred Astaire singing "I Want
All of You" and Alfred Drake doing "Where Is the Life That
Once I Led," along with others belting standards such as
"Night and Day" and "I Get a Kick Out of You," in between
historical segments about how they were composed. The music
is wonderful, the personal data tragic. Who could ask for
anything more?
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, July 24, 10-11:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Salesman."
Albert Maysles's classic documentary about four door-to-door
Bible salesmen. This black-and-white film from the early '60s
is airing on television for the first time and it is an event
not to be missed. The unobtrusive camera and microphones
record everything -- the bullying and pep talks of the sales
manager, who tells his troops, "the best seller in the world
is the Bible . . . the money is out there"; the anxiety
etched in the salesmen's faces; the motel rooms; the awful
conviviality of the sales pitch. It is the drama of ordinary
life such as it is rarely seen on American television or for
that matter the movies.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, July 25, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on Fox: "Glory Days." A
new six-week series about the coming of age of four young men
with varying neurotic and spiritual problems. Here too, we
have a father-son conflict, at least in this first episode,
along with a rich assortment of platitudes about false
values, etc. But some of the characters are sharply drawn,
and the dialogue often is quirkily interesting.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, July 25, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on U.S.A.: "Snow-Kill"
is about five business executives who run afoul of murderous
outlaws while on a jaunt to the wintry mountains of the
Pacific Northwest. In the spirit of those "Outward Bound"
expeditions conceived by management psychologists as a means
of helping to build corporate teamwork, the executives go
forth to the wilderness to find their true selves. Alas,
while they are out hunting themselves up, they also find
mayhem and gore. This made-for-TV movie is not going to
enhance the status of those wilderness seminars. It does,
however, deserve credit for a fair approximation of the kind
of psychobabble being dished out in the corporate world. The
excellent David Dukes is happily almost unrecognizable under
mustache and hair as the murderous stalker.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, July 29, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on Arts &amp; Entertainment:
"No Time to Say Goodbye." A distinguished BBC import,
haunting and elegiac, but also hard-edged in its probing. In
1938, England allowed the entry of 10,000 Jewish children
fleeing the Nazis. For nearly all, the farewells at the
station were the last the children would ever see of their
parents. Its forthrightness and its psychological complexity
are unrivaled among television war memoirs of this kind.

   TEMPEST IN A TAPE DECK: Controversial Sony DAT sales hum,
for now.
   A music publishers' lawsuit to ban digital audio tape
players, charging they abet copyright piracy, hasn't hurt
early demand for the first consumer models. But a severe DAT
shortage and the $900 price may cut popularity later. "The
public is laughing at the suit," says Michael Kay of Lyric
High Fidelity, New York. He says he could easily sell 50 to
70 units this month but notes Sony can only deliver 10. In
Berkeley, Calif., Greg Badie of The Good Guys says it got 50
DATs for all 22 stores. "We sold out two days after we got
them."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Enthusiasm isn't universal. "People won't be interested
until the product is well under $500," says Herbert
Schmutzler of Sounds Deluxe in Clarendon Hills, Ill.
"Basically, it's a high-end tape deck," adds Mark Sloan, of
the Media Room, Morton Grove, Ill. Edward Murphy of the
National Music Publishers Association, thinks otherwise. His
group argues that DATs make "perfect clones" that deprive
songwriters and publishers of royalties.
   Sony expects industrywide, first-year sales of 80,000 to
100,000 DAT units.
                                                                                                       

   KEEP BAILING] Summer finds many boat owners, dealers still
adrift.
   Boats languish for months, even years as softness
continues. Melchor Garcia cut the asking price on his 55-foot
motor yacht on Long Island to $660,000 from $790,000 during
the two years it's been on the market. Mort Sussman, who's
been trying to sell his boat on the island for months, says
"several people are interested, but seem very over-extended"
and can't get financing.
   "There are loans we should be able to approve that we
aren't able to place," says Jeffrey Stith, of Yegen Marine,
who brokers loans. Yachting Magazine's "yacht of the month"
for July isn't immune. Asking price on the 80-foot
motorsailer: $2.1 million -- 16% below cost. Another sign of
the times: Newport International Sailboat Show considered
allowing used boats at its September show, but shelves the
idea until 1991.
                                                                                                       

   CHICKENS LOSE APPETITE when it's hot; weather affects
others, too.
   Mother Nature obviously determines crop size and food
prices. Economists say poultry prices may rise because
chickens are off their feed. But the weather's influence is
being felt in other data, too. The latest: consumer spending.
DRI/McGraw-Hill's Roger Brinner says that worries over a
pending consumer crash are over-rated, since recent retail
sales reports look bad only in comparison to weather-induced
sales during winter. "People went out and shopped, creating
an artificially high base" that made April, May and June look
worse, he says. Sanford Bernstein's Giulio Martini concurs,
noting five of the past seven months' data have been
influenced by abnormal weather.
   Mr. Martini says GNP could "accelerate substantially" in
coming months as spending patterns adjust. But no one expects
the kind of wallop the drought gave GNP last year. In fact,
economists like Georgia State's Donald Ratajczak expect tamer
1990 food inflation of around 4%. There will be isolated
problems, like those chickens who are suffering the
Southeast's dry heat wave, eating poorly and growing thinner.
But there's a silver lining in the "watermelon belt": Mr.
Ratajczak notes that dryness means smaller, but sweeter
melons. "So, they'll actually taste better."
   Weather accounts for 15% to 50% of mood, a study of park
rangers by a University of Wisconsin professor finds.
                                                                                                       

   GARBO AT GAVEL: The actress's Impressionist paintings,
books and furnishings go on the block at Sotheby's in
November; they're expected to fetch $20 million.
                                                                                                       

   DUMP AND BE DUMPED. About 25% of New York State consumers
polled in June said they stopped buying from firms they think
pollute, says Century Research.
                                                                                                       

   HOLD THE OLIVE: One-pound "Water Weights" carry liquid in
plastic bottles for exercise now and refreshment later. Price
per pair: $9.95.
                                                                                                       

   "SUMMER MELT" in tuition deposits deepens; schools
struggle with shortfall.
   A demographic turn shrinks the number of available college
freshmen, putting the choosy student on top. Many Ivy League
schools called back "second string" prospects in May and
June, sparking a chain reaction of backing and filling among
institutions. "People are still jockeying around. It's a
buyer's market," says Joe Foulke of Iona College, in New
Rochelle, N.Y. "It puts a kink in planning." With hiring and
spending plans at stake, it's smart to run a tight shop. This
summer, if a question arises on a student form, Iona phones
the student rather than writes. And the school recently fired
up its television ads.
   At Fairleigh Dickinson in Rutherford, N.J., deposits are
currently down 8%, says William DiBrienza. But he notes
that's well ahead of mid-May's 25% shortfall, adding: "The
financial aid situation very much determines who attends here
and who doesn't." York College in Pennsylvania says it was
flooded with deposits in April and May. The school attributes
at least part of its good fortune to its below-average cost.
One notable bright spot in the college crunch: enrollment at
black colleges soars.
   A new guide, "Barron's 300: Best Buys in College
Education," is due out in mid-August. Price: $12.95.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Dallas-based Auto Critic checks out used cars for

   DeSoto Agrees to Sell
   U.S. Paint Operation

   DES PLAINES, Ill. -- DeSoto Inc. said it agreed to sell
its domestic consumer paint business to Sherwin-Williams Co.
for about $80 million.
   The Sherwin-Williams pact is the latest in a series of
agreements which, taken together, represent a near-total
liquidation, with proceeds to be distributed to shareholders.
DeSoto, a maker of paints, chemical coatings and detergents,
has since last November been fighting off a hostile
$50-a-share tender offer from Sutton Holding Corp., a New
York investor group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week DeSoto announced that it had agreed to sell its
industrial coatings business and its surfactant and
emulsifier lines for about $200 million. The company
disclosed then that it was "very close" to an agreement on
the sale of its paint operation.
   The paint unit's operations have been estimated at more
than $150 million in 1989, but competitive pressures have
generated operating losses in recent quarters.
   As with the earlier unit-sale agreements, the planned sale
of the paint operation is subject to approval by shareholders
and regulators. DeSoto said it will distribute the net
proceeds -- expected to be around $60 million, or about
$14.97 a share -- to shareholders. Combined with the $27.84
the company has said it expects to distribute from proceeds
of the agreements announced earlier, DeSoto holders stand to
receive about $42.81 a share from the agreements so far.
   Still unsold is certain proprietary technology, which is
on the block but not expected to garner a significant price,
and the company's household-detergent business, which had
revenue last year of about $72 million. DeSoto has said it
will "for the present" retain the detergent operation.
   DeSoto undertook the sale of the company's principal lines
after a Delaware court, in the course of the company's legal
dispute with Sutton, ordered it to take steps to maximize
shareholder value.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, DeSoto
shares closed at $46, up 12.5 cents.

   All the Lies Fit to Print

<LP>
   Journalists who lie in their news reports -- and who do so
knowingly, deliberately, programmatically -- are not,
perhaps, as uncommon as the folklore of their trade would
sometimes have us believe. A comprehensive history of
reporters' prevarications about the major events of the
present century would make a fat and melancholy book. So
would a history of the rewards and acclaim that have often
been lavished on the most outrageous perpetrators of such
journalistic falsehood.
   Yet in any chronicle of calculated mendacity, a special
chapter would have to be reserved for Walter Duranty, the
infamous Moscow correspondent of the New York Times during
the height of Stalin's terror. He was said by Malcolm
Muggeridge, who knew Duranty in Moscow at the time, to be the
"greatest liar of any journalist I have met in 50 years of
journalism." Joseph Alsop concurred in this judgment --
"lying was his stock in trade," he said. History has amply
confirmed the truth of these charges, and now an excellent
biography of Duranty -- "Stalin's Apologist" (Oxford, 404
pages, $24.95) by S.J. Taylor -- recounts in lurid detail the
story of the writer who, against some very stiff competition,
won the distinction of lying the most, and most effectively,
about the worst of Stalin's crimes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He lied about the enforced famine in the Ukraine that
accompanied Stalin's collectivization of the peasants -- a
program that caused more deaths than Hitler's war against the
Jews. He lied about the Moscow Trials. He lied about the
terror, about the gulag, and about virtually every aspect of
Stalin's consolidation of power. And he did much of this
lying on the front pages of the New York Times, which
rewarded him for his efforts by making him one of the
highest-paid correspondents in the world. For this record of
lies, moreover, Duranty was given the Pulitzer Prize. As Ms.
Taylor -- an American writer now living in London --
correctly observes, in Duranty "the Western establishment
that feted him, no less than the Kremlin, had found their
man."
   To appreciate the enormity of Duranty's performance, it
has to be understood that he was neither the victim of
misinformation nor the dupe of some deeply held political
conviction. Not a communist himself -- nor, indeed, a
believer in much of anything but his own career, his
pleasures and his privileges -- Duranty simply held Stalin in
high esteem, and systematically withheld from his readers the
kind of information that would have cast doubt on the Soviet
dictator's benign objectives. "You can't make omelets without
cracking eggs," he liked to say.
   The man who harbored these views seems always to have
lived a dissolute and disorderly life. He was born in
Liverpool in 1884 into a middle-class family that lost its
money when Duranty was 15. He nonetheless managed to get to
Cambridge and then to Paris, where he soon fell in with
Aleister Crowley, a professional occultist known as "the
Beast," who specialized in organizing mystical orgies and
smoking opium. With Jane Cheron, Crowley's favorite Scarlet
Woman (as he called her), who also was an opium addict,
Duranty quickly formed what Ms. Taylor describes as "an
affable menage a trois: sex with one partner, drugs with the
other, a little magic on the side." Duranty later married
Cheron, with whom he established yet another menage a trois
with his Russian mistress in Moscow.
   It was in Paris, on the eve of World War I, that Duranty
made his first contributions to the Times, and by the end of
the war he was an important part of the paper's European
coverage, even though the Times had been warned that Duranty
was a shady character. His boss in the Paris bureau had
described him as "unreliable and tricky," and other judgments
were harsher.
   Yet the Times stuck with him for nearly two decades. His
energy, drive and intelligence -- for Duranty was a very
clever man -- made him seem a formidable journalistic talent,
and his sheer ruthlessness was a professional asset in an era
of fierce journalistic competition. In the '20s he had
guessed correctly that Stalin would be Lenin's successor, and
this gave him an authority that defeated every effort to
dislodge him from his post. He is even credited with coining
the term "Stalinism" (in 1931). For Duranty, it would remain
a term of praise to the end.
   As far as the Times was concerned, however, the end came
in 1940 when the paper shut down its Moscow bureau and fired
Duranty, who was at long last seen to be an embarrassment. He
was 56 and virtually penniless. None of his efforts to earn a
living as a writer or lecturer succeeded. Years of high
living and heavy drinking had ruined his health, and he was
soon existing on handouts from other journalists. When Stalin
died in 1953, he made the front page for the last time -- but
this time it was the front page of the Morning Sentinel in
Orlando, Fla., where he was living in penury. It was his last
opportunity to pay tribute to Stalin's "strength and
influence."
   Four years later he wrote to the Times begging for a
pension of $155 a month. Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the
publisher, responded by writing a personal check for $2,500.
A month later Duranty died in the Orlando hospital. He was
73. About this despicable character Ms. Taylor has written a
book that is splendid in every respect but one: We never do
discover how it was that the Times tolerated this record of
mendacity for as long as it did. Perhaps she should make that
the subject of her next book.

   Asset-Backed Plan
   For Allied Stores

   NEW YORK -- Chemical Banking Corp. said it structured an
asset-backed commercial-paper program for Allied Stores
Corp., the big retailer that is operating under protection of
the bankruptcy court.
   Chemical said it marks the first time that a company
operating under Chapter 11 would be able to sell commercial
paper. Investors usually buy commercial paper, or short-term
IOUs, only from the most credit-worthy corporations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chemical said Allied's commercial paper will be
securitized by the credit-card receivables of various Allied
retail stores, which along with Federated Department Stores
Inc. filed for protection against creditors in January. They
are both units of Canada's Campeau Corp., which is headed by
Robert Campeau.
   The offering must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Cincinnati, which will meet to discuss the proposed
transaction on July 26, according to a Chemical Bank
spokeswoman.
   Chemical said the new arrangement will replace Allied's
existing $700 million receivables loan facility with
Citibank, which was scheduled to expire July 31, and will
result in an annual cost savings to Allied of about $10
million.
   Although Chemical is structuring the deal, it won't be
issuing the commercial paper. Mason Funding Corp., an
independent special-purpose corporation, authorized an
initial three-year program of $650 million in commercial
paper, which may be increased to $721 million.
   The commercial paper will be backed by a surety bond
issued by Financial Guaranty Insurance Corp., a unit of
General Electric Co., and a 15% letter of credit from
Chemical Bank and a consortium of other institutions. Because
of these "credit enhancement" features, Allied's commercial
paper is expected to be rated A-1 plus by Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. and P-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc.

   AMR Earnings
   Plunged 27%

   AMR Corp. said second-quarter earnings plunged 27% because
of soft traffic and higher costs at its American Airlines
unit, a harbinger of things to come for the industry.
   Net income for the company, based in Fort Worth, Texas,
fell to $129.2 million, or $2.05 a share, compared with
$177.9 million, or $2.83 a share, a year earlier. Revenue,
however, was up 9.5%, to $2.97 billion from $2.72 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a statement, AMR Chairman Robert L. Crandall attributed
the lower earnings to rising costs, such as for fuel,
maintenance and facilities rentals, while "domestic traffic
is weaker than we had hoped it would be."
   In addition, the airline restructured its European routes
and incurred start-up costs associated with its acquisition
of Latin American routes from Eastern Airlines.
   As the pacesetter for the airline industry, American
usually reports larger profits and narrower losses than its
rivals. Most airline stocks fell yesterday after AMR released
its results. AMR's stock fell $2.875 to $61.625 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   First-half earnings fell 60.6%, to $109.9 million, or
$1.75 a share, from $278.9 million, or $4.43 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 9.6%, to $5.66 billion from $5.16
billion.
   Industry analyst Timothy Pettee of Merrill Lynch said most
airlines will report results along the same lines. "It's the
bellwether airline, so when its operating earnings are down
20%, the industry's is likely to be down 20% to 30%."
   In the most recent quarter, the villain was excess
capacity, said analyst Samuel Buttrick of Kidder Peabody.
"You have too many seats chasing too few people," he said.
   Separately, American said it would acquire two new Boeing
Co. 747-400s from Canadian Airlines International for $330
million. The airline, which is expanding its international
service at a fast clip, has been seeking to acquire the
wide-body jets for some time.
   The agreement also includes the purchase of four General
Electric Co. CF680C2B1F engines for each of the jets, and
spare parts. American said the purchase is contingent upon
securing authority from the Department of Transportation's
chief administrative law judge to fly a Chicago-Tokyo route;
American has already received preliminary approval from the
department.

   Film: Deadly Spiders; A Larcenous Clown
   ----
   By Julie Salamon
</HL>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A8
</SO>
<LP>
   "Arachnophobia" could be thought of as the movie
equivalent of "lite beer": pleasant enough, not nearly as
enervating as the real thing, but not as satisfying either.
   This picture about deadly spiders taking over a peaceful
California town marks the directing debut of Frank Marshall,
who for the past decade has worked as a producer at Steven
Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. Mr. Marshall also has
directed action sequences for several Spielberg projects,
including two of the Indiana Jones films and "Back to the
Future."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So it isn't surprising that many of Mr. Marshall's tricks
have been pulled out of Mr. Spielberg's cabinet. There are
many familiar elements in this story of an ordinary man who
has to overcome the mysterious, fearsome forces of nature.
   Here, instead of an omnipotent shark, the menace arrives
in the form of large, ultra-poisonous spiders, unwittingly
imported from South America by an obsessive scientist. Having
set up this conceit, Mr. Marshall and screenwriters Don
Jakoby and Wesley Strick proceeded to figure out variations
on the spiders killing or threatening to kill the
townspeople. It's all laid out like a package tour; the film
moves from one destination to the next without the
troublesome detours that can result in either disaster or
something unexpectedly wonderful.
   Mr. Marshall has done an impressive job with much of the
creepy-crawly stuff. The picture builds nicely from the
portentous opening sequence, shot in Venezuela, that
introduces the long-hidden species of spider whose excavation
sets the story in motion. The British actor Julian Sands,
with his narrow-lipped aristocratic bearing and intensity, is
well cast as the scientist who leads the fateful expedition.
   The film takes on a lighter tone when the action moves to
Canaima, the fictional gingerbread-house town where the
spiders land, following an amusing series of coincidences.
The spiders arrive almost simultaneously with a new doctor
and his family, who have moved to Canaima from San Francisco
to escape the rigors of city living.
   Jeff Daniels endows the young doctor, Ross Jennings, with
the actor's trademark characteristic: the conventional man
who slyly mocks his own conventionality. His ordinariness
becomes comic when he's put in an extraordinary situation, as
he was in "Something Wild," and as he is here. Yet there's
something a little off-kilter with the way the film makers
casually kill off various characters without obvious satiric
purpose. For example, they take a nasty, sneering attitude
toward the old town doctor who spoils Ross's plans by
deciding not to retire, because his work keeps him alive.
When the spiders get him anyway, the Jennings family takes
over the dead doc's practice a bit too cheerily.
   In general, this efficiently made production cleverly
pushes the right buttons on cue. Yet its flippant tone blunts
any real sense of terror, and some of the more obvious comic
stunts seem mechanical. John Goodman appears in yet another
variation on his beer-guzzling fatso, this time as a somewhat
metaphysical exterminator. Not much thought seems to have
gone into this character. It's as though the film makers
figured it's enough to have Mr. Goodman show up looking
cutely porky. And perhaps they figured it exactly right, from
a commercial point of view: The preview audience I saw the
movie with yowled the instant Mr. Goodman appeared on screen.
   ---
   One of the most dangerous phrases to drop from an actor's
lips may be the words: "I'd like to direct." Luckily only a
powerful few are allowed to discover for themselves that
pulling a picture together isn't as simple as it might seem.
   The directorial training school of hard knocks for comedy
star Bill Murray was "Quick Change." He couldn't have picked
trickier territory than this wry comedy whose loose-limbed
deadpan humor would have challenged the most experienced
director. Mr. Murray and his co-director, Howard Franklin,
who adapted Jay Cronley's novel for the screen, succeed
mainly in illuminating what made them want to direct the
material. At least this picture struggles to emit a few gasps
of fresh air as it goes down.
   Mr. Murray, who also co-produced, plays Grimm, a
disillusioned city planner. He decides to abandon New York
with his girlfriend (Geena Davis), his slow-witted pal (Randy
Quaid) and the million dollars they plan to rob from a bank.
The robbery is successful (and involves an ingenious escape
ruse); the escape is not. As the novice criminals attempt to
flee the city, they are beset by every imaginable obstacle:
thieves, angry apartment sublessees, unhelpful construction
workers, the mob, and taxi drivers who don't speak English.
Few of these exaggerated cameos make the leap from script to
screen. The co-directors find their way only with Philip
Bosco's marvelous transformation of a rule-obsessed bus
driver into a comic gem.
   Mostly the film makers founder as they try to meld their
wayward humor with inane convention. Jason Robards gamely
marches through the role of the police chief pursuing the
robbers, looking less and less enthused as he trudges ahead.
Nothing exemplifies the picture's failings more than the
music, the forced energy of which brings to mind a certain
kind of television cop show -- "Mannix," not "Hill Street
Blues."
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Messrs. Murray and Franklin may have benefited
from watching, and watching again, "After Hours," Martin
Scorsese's vision of all the things that can go wrong in a
single night in New York. Mr. Scorsese's tale of a yuppie
stranded in SoHo was a wisp of a story blown up into
something wild and exciting by a director who knew what he
was doing.

   Four Banks Post Lower 2nd-Quarter Net;
   Continental Reports a $56.7 Million Loss

   Loan problems continue to dog the banking industry, as
four big banks reported lower second-quarter profit and
Continental Bank Corp. posted a $56.7 million loss.
   The depressed earnings at PNC Financial Corp., Shawmut
National Corp., Fleet/Norstar Financial Group and First
Interstate Bancorp are all the result of big portfolios of
problem loans. Continental's troubled loans to highly
leveraged borrowers, meanwhile, tripled during the quarter
while income from corporate lending plunged 25%, reflecting
the current doldrums in the commercial banking business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Where earnings go from here is a function of when we get
out of this funk," said Robert Albertson, a bank stock
analyst at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. in New York.
   Continental's second-quarter loss also includes a $48
million pretax charge to cover the cost of cutting 900 jobs
and retreating from some businesses, as well as some other
one-time losses and a gain. But a spokeswoman said that,
omitting such special items, Continental was essentially at
"break-even" for the quarter.
   The loss, which had been expected, was a steep slide from
last's year second-quarter profit and illustrates the
potential pitfalls of the Chicago-based company's strategy
under Thomas C. Theobald of being a purely commercial bank.
Continental's presence remains small in some commercial areas
-- foreign exchange and bond trading, and equity investments
-- that help sustain its competitors during periods of weak
loan demand. And it has no consumer business.
   Mr. Theobald said he remains committed to the strategy and
blamed the "general slowdown in demand" for the poor quarter.
The job and other cost cutting is expected to save $75
million a year, beginning next year, Continental has
estimated.
   Meanwhile, the financial bleeding from Continental's First
Options of Chicago unit continued. For sale since last year,
First Options' value was marked down another $9 million
during the second quarter. That brings to well over a quarter
billion dollars the losses from the options and futures
clearing firm since Continental bought in it late 1986.
   First Options had big losses during the 1987 stock market
crash and its revenue has dwindled since.
   Continental's nonperforming loans to highly leveraged
borrowers, such as in leveraged buy-outs, tripled to $251
million at June 30 from $83 million at the beginning of the
quarter. The bank wouldn't elaborate on the borrowers or
their problems or say how leveraged loans are expected to
perform in coming quarters.
   While Continental's total nonperforming loans, at $673
million, are relatively low, it has a big highly leveraged
portfolio, $2.9 billion at year-end 1989, in comparison to
its shareholders equity of about $1.7 billion.
   Continental's income from commercial lending and other
corporate finance transactions fell 25% to $111 million in
the second quarter, vs. $148 million a year ago. That
reflects the smaller number of acquisitions and refinancings,
as well as the fact that today's more conservative lending
environment also makes deals less lucrative for banks. "The
deals aren't yielding as much," a spokeswoman said.
                                                                                                       

   PNC Financial Corp.
                                                                                                       

   PNC Financial, based in Pittsburgh, as expected, said
second-quarter profit fell 13% as domestic loans continued to
deteriorate. It was the third consecutive quarter that PNC,
known for years by its steady earnings growth, has seen
profit fall.
   The bank took a huge $168.3 million in net charge-offs,
mostly foreign loans and domestic real estate loans. But new
problem loans replaced the old ones charged off; since March
nonperforming domestic loans have surged 16%, to $560
million.
   "When you charge off that much and nonperformers don't go
down, it shows how sticky the problem is," said Dennis F.
Shea, analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   PNC increased its provisions for loan losses 88%, to $73.8
million, compared with the year-ago quarter. The jump follows
an even bigger increase in provisions last quarter, but PNC
said the moves are simply a sign of the times. "We have
eliminated LCD debt and are aggressively writing down real
estate values to dispose of these properties as quickly as
possible," said Thomas H. O'Brien, PNC's chairman and chief
exeuctive officer.
                                                                                                       

   First Interstate Bancorp
                                                                                                       

   First Interstate said profit would have been flat absent a
special tax credit in the 1989 quarter. The company cited
improved credit quality: nonperforming assets declined to
$1.88 billion at June 30 from $2.24 billion a year earlier.
Its provision for loan losses in the quarter declined to
$117.7 million from $166.5 million.
   Much of the credit turnaround reflects a nearly tripling
of profit in operations at its Texas bank over the first
quarter. "We continue to make steady progress in improving
key areas of our business," said Edward Carson, chairman and
chief executive officer.
   Nonetheless, the Los Angeles-based banking concern still
reported several sore spots in its interstate network. Its
Arizona bank continued in the red. The company said its banks
in California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada continue to
"perform well," although profit from consumer and
middle-market lending operations at those banks was
essentially flat from the first-quarter level.
   And profit at its other 17 banks, primarily in the Rocky
Mountains, tumbled to $1.5 million from $16.8 million a year
earlier, reflecting increased loan-loss reserves at its
Denver bank.
   Per-share net income fell more significantly because of a
major stock offering in February.
                                                                                                       

   Shawmut National Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Shawmut National's results were hurt by the continuing
slump in the New England economy, and its troubled real
estate sector. Nonperforming loans were up, and earning
assets were down.
   Nonperforming loans and foreclosed property rose to $1.31
billion, or 7.72% of the total, from $1.16 billion, or 6.76%,
as of March 31. Shawmut's reserves for possible loan losses
were $748.3 million at the end of the second quarter compared
with $287 million at the end of the year-ago period.
   The latest second-quarter's profit included an
extraordinary credit of $5.1 million from a tax loss
carry-forward. Total assets were $26.6 billion at the end of
the quarter, down 4.8% from the year-earlier period.
                                                                                                       

   Fleet/Norstar Financial
                                                                                                       

   Fleet/Norstar's nonperforming loans rose to $756 million
from $653 million at the end of the first quarter.
   Fleet's loan-loss provision for the second quarter was $90
million, nearly three times the year-ago provision. Its total
loan-loss reserve rose to $618 million.
   The second quarter neverthless was a rebound from a $98
million loss in the first quarter due to a big increase in
the loan loss reserves. Fleet said its overall performance
was aided by a 31% increase in net income of its financial
services group to $31.2 million or more than half the bank
holding company's net income.

   Economy:
   Fina's Profit Rose
   By 29% to Record
   In Second Quarter

   American Petrofina Inc. registered record earnings for the
second quarter, suggesting that major oil companies with
large exposure to gasoline refining will also post gains but
that overall industry profits will be mixed.
   A roughly $3-a-barrel drop in the price of crude last
quarter from a year earlier depressed exploration and
production results across the board. Natural-gas prices and
sales were also down. But that same decline in crude prices
boosted refining and marketing profits because oil is the
primary feedstock for gasoline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With many refineries shut down for maintenance last
quarter, demand was strong enough to keep gasoline prices
fairly steady, said Warren Shimmerlik, a securities analyst
with County NatWest USA in New York. As a result, he
estimated that refinery margins on gasoline were about $4.60
a barrel, more than $1 greater than the 1989 second period.
   Fina, based in Dallas, said net income rose 29% to $53.8
million, or $3.48 a share, from $41.8 million, or $2.71 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue declined 1.7% to $832.6
million from $847.4 million. "Lower crude-oil prices, only
partially offset by lower product prices, contributed to
higher refining margins," said Ron W. Haddock, chief
executive officer.
   Of the nation's largest oil companies, Chevron Corp. and
Texaco Inc. could post record refining and marketing results
and year-to-year increases in overall net income, said Bryan
Jacoboski, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York. For
the industry, "it's going to be a mixed bag," he said.
   Fina said results for petrochemicals, which also use crude
as their primary feedstock, were flat. However, analysts
expect most large oil companies to report declines in
petrochemical earnings. Through the first half of 1989
chemical profits and prices were at or near record highs but
have since fallen because of increased supplies.
   Early in the third quarter it appears that exploration and
production profits will strengthen because crude prices have
recovered in recent weeks. But the quarter may be weaker than
the second, analysts said, because oil prices may not have
recovered enough to offset the expected declines in refining
and marketing.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading, American
Petrofina closed at $76, down 62.5 cents.

   Halting New Funds
   For Crop Insurance

   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $50.35 billion
agriculture bill that would deny funding for new federal
crop-insurance policies in fiscal 1991 and tighten spending
limits on export-promotion programs favored by the Bush
administration.
   Operating funds for the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. would
be cut by more than half to $101.6 million. While money is
provided to meet current commitments, the measure calls for
the government to issue no new crop-insurance policies after
Sept. 30.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The action adds to the pressure on House and Senate
Agriculture Committees to revise the troubled program. More
broadly, the underlying bill reflects the determination of
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten to
remain a major player in farm policy. Long impatient with the
administration's export policies, the Mississippi Democrat
was also a force behind a proposed $500 million cap for
spending on commodities provided under the Export Enhancement
Program -- or $400 million below President Bush's proposal.
   Among major nutrition programs, food stamp expenditures
would grow to more than $19 billion, or 12% above current
levels, and an estimated $2.35 billion is provided for the
so-called WIC nutrition program aimed at low-income pregnant
women and their infants. The new WIC appropriations represent
a 10% increase from fiscal 1990, but $25 million would be
held indefinitely as a reserve against higher-than-expected
prices and a shortfall of funds at the state level, such as
those seen earlier this year.
   Among regulatory agencies, $688.7 million is provided for
the Food and Drug Administration, or more than 30% above the
administration's budget.
   But in a major blow to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the bill would effectively freeze the agency's
funding at $39.7 million, or almost $5.3 million below the
president's request. The lower level is based on pending
legislation that would shift oversight of stock-index futures
from the CFTC to securities regulators.
   Adopted 335-86, the overall measure is the seventh of the
annual spending bills to clear the House in recent weeks. The
action comes as the Senate Appropriations Committee has begun
to draft its own legislation under what amounts to a shotgun
budget resolution for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
Domestic programs, including agriculture, face cuts from
House-passed levels. But in a striking study of power, the
Senate committee leadership has used its position to protect
energy and water accounts that have been a longstanding
preserve for senior members from the South and West.
   An estimated $20.9 billion energy and water bill reported
from subcommittee yesterday represents a 13% increase from
current appropriations. Within these limits, tens of millions
of dollars are earmarked for projects favored by those
senators who have been instrumental in helping the Senate
appropriations leadership resolve its budget hurdles.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee, preserved $20.6 million -- which was cut by
the House -- for special nuclear-material research at the Los
Alamos laboratory in his home state of New Mexico. Meanwhile,
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole would secure at least $4
million for a new physical-science center at Fort Hays State
University near his home town of Russell, Kan.
   The Appalachian Regional Commission would receive $180
million, or more than triple the administration's request,
with $45 million slated for road projects in southern West
Virginia, home of Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert
Byrd. Mr. Byrd, a Democrat, separately secured $6 million in
additional funds for the Tug Forks dam project in West
Virginia, and $10 million is earmarked for a medical research
facility at West Virginia University.
   The chairman and ranking Republican on the energy and
water subcommittee, Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.) and Sen.
Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.), split $25 million in university
funds for two projects in their home states, and Mr. Johnston
added $30 million for the Red River waterway to Shreveport
within accounts for the Corps of Engineers.
   Overall totals for the bills follow the patterns set in
the House. Construction funding for the Corps of Engineers
would grow to more than $1.3 billion, with another $641
million provided for Bureau of Reclamation construction. An
estimated $10.98 billion is allocated for atomic-energy
defense activities, and though marginally less than the
House, the Senate bill provides $2.68 billion for cleaning up
nuclear weapons plants, or $318.9 million more than the
administration's request.
   Among major research priorities, the measure provides
almost $318 million for the massive superconducting
supercollider, which is an atom smasher, to be built in
Texas. Solar-energy funding would increase by more than 40%
to $129.6 million, including $46.9 million for photovoltaic
energy systems.

   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said
it placed about $566 million of Central Illinois Public
Service Co.'s long-term debt and preferred stock under review
for a ratings downgrade.
   The rating concern said it will examine "whether a recent
weakening in debt protection measures, continuing regulatory
delays, as well as growing business and operating risks in
the electric utility, will permit CIPS to maintain Moody's
highest rating."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moody's said it will look at a revenue-refund order the
company faces. It also noted that current industry and
regulatory trends mean "the ability of any electric utility
to maintain financial indicators supportive of the Aaa rating
may be in doubt."
   Under review are Central Illinois PS's first mortgage
bonds and secured pollution-control bonds, rated triple-A;
unsecured pollution-control bonds and preferred stock, rated
double-A-1. The utility's commercial paper, rated prime-1,
isn't under review.
   A Central Illinois PS official said that "within the last
two months, three of the five triple-A-rated utilities have
been downgraded," leaving only Central Illinois PS and
Citizens Utilities Co. of Stamford, Conn., with Moody's
highest rating.
   "We're certainly concerned" about the possible downgrading
and the "uncertainty" it creates for shareholders, the
official said. At the same time, he said, "We also understand
Moody's interest in examining the entire electric utility
industry to determine if present-day business risks endanger
the triple-A rating of any company."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Central Illinois PS shares closed at $21.125, down 25 cents.

   Kubota Forges Ahead on High-Tech Push

   Despite Stardent Snag,
   Firm Plans to Persevere

   OSAKA -- Can a Japanese farm-equipment maker harvest
riches in Silicon Valley? Kubota Corp. hopes so. Since 1986,
the maker of tractors and iron pipes has plowed $158.1
million into eight U.S. technology companies. The portfolio
includes minority stakes in such firms as Mips Computer
Systems Inc., one of the most successful new microprocessor
companies, and Mycogen Corp., a developer of microbial
pesticides.
   Many old-line Japanese industrial companies in recent
years have bought into technologies that hold the promise of
greater growth. Steelmakers, cement producers and textile
manufacturers are working on everything from computer chips
to optical fibers. But few have moved as broadly or briskly
as Kubota, a company that started out 100 years ago making
cast iron for machinery used in Japan's headlong rush toward
industrialization.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With the company about to embark on its second century,
"our conventional business fields' future growth was not good
enough," explains Masahiro Yoshida, a managing director and
chief strategist of the company's diversification into high
technology.
   So, instead of relying on rice harvesters and water pipes
to keep sales growing, the company decided to learn to make
the computers that increasingly are used to design such
equipment.
   With its mature businesses throwing off cash and its
extensive Japanese landholdings and securities providing a
massive asset base, the company went shopping for promising
talent in the U.S. "In Japan, it's much more difficult to
hire people who have such knowledge," Mr. Yoshida says.
   Kubota's high-tech push hit a snag late last week. Two
founders of a company that eventually became Stardent
Computer Inc. alleged that Kubota -- which owns 22% of the
mini-supercomputer company -- conspired to fraudulently
obtain the American company's technology and transfer it to a
wholly owned Kubota subsidiary. The executives, Allen Michels
and Matthew Sanders, sued for $25 million in damages.
   Kubota executives deny the charges, and contend their
support has kept the struggling computer company on its feet.
Mr. Yoshida claims the two Stardent executives "are trying to
cover their failure in business and blame it on somebody
else."
   Messrs. Michels and Sanders, aren't involved in daily
operations of Stardent. In Newton, Mass., Stardent's
president and chief executive, John William Poduska, said
"our relationship {with Kubota} has been and continues to be
excellent. . . . We have no knowledge of any facts that would
give rise to the basis of a legal claim." A spokeswoman said
that directors will discuss the suit and the role of Messrs.
Michels and Sanders with the company at a directors meeting
today.
   Stardent was created last fall when Ardent Computer Corp.,
a Sunnyvale, Calif., firm founded by Messrs. Michels and
Sanders and funded largely by Kubota, was merged with Stellar
Computer Inc. a Newton,. Mass., company started by Mr.
Poduska. Both companies had been started at the same time to
make graphics supercomputers, and the competition between the
two was so ruthless that both lost money freely.
   Whatever the truth, the dispute is an indication of the
difficulty in meshing an oldline industrial company --
especially one from a country where corporate loyalty is
considered a paramount virtue -- with the often brash,
freewheeling cultures of U.S. high-tech ventures. "We have to
concede," says Mr. Yoshida, that Kubota's initial assessment
of Stardent's "business plan and the people responsible for
carrying out the business . . . was incorrect."
   But Kubota isn't about to stop sowing capital overeas.
And, despite worries in some quarters that U.S. companies are
selling too much technology to potential foreign competitors,
capital-starved American companies aren't about to stop
accepting help. Indeed, Kubota also made news earlier this
week with an investment more in line with its traditional
operations. The Japanese manufacturer joined Ford Motor Co.
and Tenneco Inc. of the U.S. in agreeing to buy a 27% stake
in Cummins Engine Co., a Columbus, Ind., maker of engines for
trucks and tractors. Kubota's stake would come to 5.4%,
valued at $50 million.
   The Cummins tie-up illustrates how companies increasingly
are turning to so-called global alliances to strengthen their
presence in overseas markets. Kubota, which has had a
business relationship with a Cummins subsidiary in the U.S.
for several years, was approached by Cummins in May 1989,
according to Yutaka Murata, an executive in Kubota's engine
division.
   The proposed tie-up closely resembled so-called stable
shareholder relationships among Japanese concerns. It was
attractive to Kubota because of Cummins' extensive business
network in Europe, where Kubota hopes to strengthen its
presence before the market is unified in 1992. The two
companies already are looking into joint manufacturing of
15-to-100 horsepower diesel engines in the United Kingdom or
in Spain, partly to supply the tractors Kubota now builds in
Spain and the small construction equipment it makes in West
Germany, according to Mr. Murata.
   Despite the attention attracted by Kubota's high-tech
foray, its less-glamorous industrial lines continue to
account for the vast bulk of its revenue and its earnings. On
a consolidated basis, Kubota's revenue rose to 839 billion
yen (about $5.67 billion) for its fiscal year that ended
March 31, from 736.8 billion a year earlier. Net income,
meanwhile, fell to 7.6 billion yen from 18.4 billion yen --
partly because of costs associated with its U.S. investments.
   Kubota's computer subsidiary outside of Tokyo, which
builds graphics supercomputers designed by Stardent and
minicomputers for Mips, hopes this year to double the 7
billion yen in revenue achieved last year. The unit,
established in 1987, also aims to turn a profit for the first
time this year, according to a Kubota spokesman. The company
says it hopes to increase total revenue from high-technology
businesses to 10% to 15% of overall revenue by the year 2000,
from less than 5% now.
   In the near future, securities analysts say, Kubota is
likely to reap more benefits from increased spending on
Japan's infrastructure, which lags well behind that of most
developed countries. The company is a major supplier of pipes
for waterworks and sewage systems. And its 4.95 million
square meters in landholdings includes a large tract in Osaka
that is scheduled for redevelopment in connection with the
new Kansai airport.
   But Kubota is determined to remake its image as it heads
into its second century. The company in April shortened its
Japanese name to K.K. Kubota from Kubota Iron Works K.K., and
hired a New York firm to design a new logo -- in Roman
letters.

   General Dynamics Has Loss;

   Reports $57 Million Net

   General Dynamics Corp. posted a second-quarter loss of
$240 million after taking a $450 million charge on the
delayed A-12 attack plane program.
   But its teammate on the Navy project, McDonnell Douglas
Corp., avoided taking such a charge and posted a $57 million
profit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Had McDonnell Douglas taken a charge plus an adjustment
for upgrades it's making on the T-45 Navy trainer jet, the
embattled defense contractor would have had a net loss of
$109 million. The company is filing claims against the
government for reimbursements it believes are due on those
programs; it included an estimate of the value of those
claims in its earnings report.
   General Dynamics is joining in the claims against the
Navy, but didn't include a provision for any possible
recoveries.
   Industry observers say McDonnell Douglas's more optimistic
approach, while an acceptable method of accounting, could
come back to haunt the nation's No. 1 defense contractor. "If
Douglas were truly honest, they'd know they're not going to
get a 100% adjustment from the Navy," said First Boston
Corp.'s Peter Aseritis. "Will they get half of that?
Possibly. Sixty percent? Possibly, but not likely."
   A Navy spokesman in Washington said the service "does
believe that the A-12 contract is solid and doesn't require
revision."
   Pentagon officials familiar with the issue said that
ultimately, Navy brass may agree to cover at least part of
the companies' claims because the A-12 is one of the
service's top-priority programs. "But the final shape of any
agreement is still hard to see," said one official.
   John McDonnell, McDonnell Douglas's chairman, said that
"at this point, we do not believe we have losses inherent on
the program." He noted that the company chose its tack after
consulting with numerous outside auditing and legal experts.
   But the fact that General Dynamics chose a more
conservative outlook for the financial fate of the A-12
raises a question for investors: Whose vision of the future
is correct?
   Part of the difference between the methodologies used by
the firms, both based in St. Louis, reflects several factors:
General Dynamics has used a higher cost estimate for what it
will take to complete its portion of the plane; McDonnell
Douglas, which recently launched a cost-cutting drive, thinks
it can complete its share of the A-12 more cheaply than
General Dynamics has given it credit for; General Dynamics
has to reverse $24 million of earnings it had recorded on the
A-12 program, while McDonnell Douglas never booked any
expected profits; and McDonnell Douglas doesn't write down
any general and administrative expenses until they occur.
   General Dynamics's $450 million pretax charge on the A-12
included 50% of the company's current estimate of the team's
anticipated overruns from the $4.8 billion contract ceiling
and the fixed price of the initial production lot of planes.
McDonnell Douglas said its loss on the A-12, had it
registered one, would have been $89 million.
   Some analysts noted that McDonnell Douglas can ill-afford
to post a poor quarter now. The company, which earlier this
week said it will eliminate as many as 17,000 jobs this year,
recently negotiated an estimated $4 billion line of credit
whose terms are tied to the company's net worth. "If they'd
taken a similar write-off to what General Dynamics did, that
would have reduced the line of credit by about $600 million,"
said Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   McDonnell Douglas's $57 million net income was equal to
$1.49 a share, and included $16 million from the sale of the
company's computer-servicing business. A year earlier, the
company had a net loss of $48 million, or $1.25 a share.
Revenue rose 22% to $4.12 billion from $3.37 billion.
   Operating losses at the company's transport aircraft
segment in Long Beach, Calif., narrowed to $33 million from
$152 million, when the company took a stunning $93 million in
write-offs on its C-17 military cargo and KC-10 tanker
programs. The company is still dogged by high development
expenditures on the MD-11 tri-jet as it gets ready for
federal certification by year end.
   There were some bright spots. Mr. McDonnell noted that the
company's MD-80 line posted a small profit, compared with an
operating loss of $34 million a year ago. Most importantly,
the company delivered an impressive 34 of the narrow-body
jetliners in the latest quarter. "From an-ability-to-deliver
point of view, the worst is over," Mr. McDonnell said.
   The chairman added that he has been frustrated by Wall
Street's reaction to the company's job-reduction plan,
insisting that the cutbacks "are going to contribute
substantially to our future strength."
   He implored the financial community to "look at the
potential" at McDonnell Douglas, noting that if the company
achieves merely half its goal of paring $700 million a year
from the cost structure, that would add nearly $6 a share to
earnings. "The message I'd like to get across is look at the
opportunity," Mr. McDonnell said, promising "fairly quick
results" from the cost-savings program. He noted, too, that
backlog continued to swell in the latest quarter.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
McDonnell Douglas closed at $43, up $1.75. Also on the Big
Board, General Dynamics finished at $31.50, off 12.5 cents.
   In addition to the A-12 charge, General Dynamics's $240
million loss, or $5.75 a share, included a separate $50
million write-down for estimated overruns on the Army
single-channel ground and airborne radio system, or Sincgars.
A year ago, net was $58.4 million, or $1.39 a share. Sales
rose 3.7% to $2.62 billion from $2.53 billion.
   The quarter included improvement in the projected recovery
schedule for F-16 deliveries by the company's Fort Worth,
Texas, division and a continued strong performance by Cessna
Aircraft, which makes business jets.
   Separately, Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp. posted
second-quarter net of $29.3 million, or 63 cents a share. It
had a loss of $78.1 million, or $1.67 a share, a year earlier
after a $150 million loss provision on a classified research
and development contract in its missiles and unmanned vehicle
systems business segment. Sales inched up to $1.41 billion
from $1.4 billion.

   Homefed Reports
   $108.2 Million Loss
   For Second Quarter

   HomeFed Corp., stung by a surprisingly large increase in
bad assets turned up by a special credit review, reported a
second-quarter loss of $108.2 million, or $5.04 a share.
   San Diego-based HomeFed, which until recently had been
considered fairly healthy, earned $28.1 million, or $1.30 a
share, a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   HomeFed said it added $234 million to its reserve for loan
losses in the quarter, increasing its reserves to $338
million at June 30, compared with $161 million at March 31.
The swelling reserves reflected a leap in nonperforming
assets, mainly bad loans and repossessed real estate, which
totaled $708 million at June 30, or 3.38% of assets.
HomeFed's nonperforming assets as of March 31 totaled $454
million, or 2.5% of assets.
   HomeFed has been announcing surprise increases in bad
assets on a monthly basis since April, when the thrift's
nonperforming assets rose by $44 million. In May, HomeFed's
bad assets jumped an additional $81 million, and last month
it announced a special credit review it said was likely to
turn up more bad assets. However, the size of the latest
increase, $129 million, surprised even HomeFed management.
"Sure it's a bit surprising," said Robert Adelizzi, president
and chief executive officer. "The whole thing is a surprise,
starting with April."
   The bulk of HomeFed bad assets are outside of California
and underscore how even relatively strong thrifts are being
hammered by troubled real estate markets in Texas, Arizona
and other states. They represent the apparent failure of
HomeFed's strategy of expanding outside its California turf.
"Normally, it's believed that geographic expansion reduces
risk, but it didn't work for us," Mr. Adelizzi said. As a
result, he said the thrift has halted almost all loan
originations outside of California and Nevada.
   Though most of the problems are in other states, some 37%
of HomeFed's bad assets are in California, a level which
raised the specter that the heretofore powerhouse California
market may be beginning to sour. But Mr. Adelizzi said that
market, while slowing, remains strong.
   HomeFed's announcement came after the market closed.
Still, rumors that the thrift might have bad news to report
drilled its stock earlier in the day and reflected what
management conceded was a loss of investor confidence. In New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, HomeFed
closed at $19, down $1.75.
   HomeFed remains fairly well-capitalized, although the
quarterly results trimmed its tangible capital to assets
ratio to 3.68% from about over 5% as of early June.
   Mr. Adelizzi said the special credit review that led to
the big boost in reserves was HomeFed's idea and wasn't a
response to any regulatory pressure. He said HomeFed feels
comfortable with the current level of reserves but said the
thrift couldn't guarantee that further additions might not be
forthcoming.

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices sagged in response to news that
inflation is by no means whipped, helping drag stocks lower.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell nearly one point,
or about $10 for each $1,000 of face amount. Trading was
frenzied in the morning but quieter in the afternoon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stocks also were hit by profit-taking and earnings
disappointments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average backed away
from its flirtation with 3000, dropping 18.07 to 2981.68. The
dollar ended mixed, reflecting currency traders' less-certain
interpretation of the inflation news.
   The bond market was jarred early by news that the consumer
price index for June rose 0.5%, compared with an expected
increase of 0.3%. Later in the morning came comments from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said, among
other things, that he is now slightly more concerned about
the risk of recession than about the risk of rising
inflation.
   The remarks set bond investors to worrying that Mr.
Greenspan is responding to political pressure to ease
interest rates instead of sticking to his goal of reducing
inflation. While bond investors like to see interest rates
come down, which boosts bond prices commensurately, they fear
creeping inflation even more because it erodes real returns
on their investments.
   Bond traders were puzzled that the CPI came in as high as
it did and a few hours later Mr. Greenspan suggested
inflation fell a notch on his priority list.
   Though "the CPI report took a half-point {off bond prices}
right away," said Stephen Slifer, economist at Shearson
Lehman Hutton, traders also were concerned about a news
report that House Republican budget conferees decided to
oppose any tax increases as part of a deficit-reduction
accord.
   "That could be a monkey wrench in the budget talks," Mr.
Slifer said. Hopes for further credit-easing moves by the Fed
have been tied to a successful deficit-cutting effort.
   But anything that prevents further Fed easing is good news
for the dollar. Currency traders say falling U.S. interest
rates are a greater immediate threat to the dollar's strength
than inflation fears.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell in active trading, with 168.8 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, where
decliners swamped advancers, 1,030 to 483.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond
rose to 8.54%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6480 marks and 147.75 yen, compared
with 1.6440 marks and 147.80 yen Tuesday.

   SEATTLE -- Cathy Nolan has a difficult job: Teaching her
neighbors the often-puzzling rituals of curbside recycling.
   "The toughest part is having the courage to knock on the
doors of people you don't know and talk to them about
changing their behavior without seeming nosy," she says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   She tells them that cereal boxes, minus plastic liners,
can be recycled, but microwave food containers, though also
paper, can't. She explains why the city won't pick up plastic
yogurt containers and milk jugs deposited at the curb; they
are made of the wrong kind of plastic. She gives tips: How
she composts cardboard meat trays in her backyard bin and
recycles plastic bottles at dropoff centers. Instead of
finger-pointing, she talks about her own recycling mistakes:
How she used to mix rubber-lined tops and lids with metal
cans.
   "I haven't had anybody slam the door in my face," Ms.
Nolan says. "Recycling has drawn us closer as a
neighborhood."
   In the war against waste, Cathy Nolan is a recycling block
captain, a foot soldier in a small army of eager volunteers
who have helped Seattle achieve the highest recycling rate of
any major U.S. city. Seattle already recycles 37% of its
waste and is ahead of schedule in its campaign to reach 60%
by 1998.
   The volunteers, by teaching, cajoling and trying to set
strong examples, seek to reduce the trash going to landfills,
which often cause pollution. Their tactics are critical to
the success of a drive that doesn't compel participation.
   They are helped by peer pressure, especially among
retirees unaccustomed to recycling. After talking to
neighbors, Dorothy Wiggins, a 69-year-old widow, reduced her
garbage by more than half. "They figure it's helpful, so I go
along with it. But I'm also saving money" through lower
trash-collection bills, she says.
   Ms. Nolan, armed with a two-inch-thick recycling manual
issued by the city, casually checks up on 25 households on
her block. So far, all but one have signed up for recycling.
   Her low-key suasion recently worked with one holdout. Jim
Green, 43, says he became a refusenik when the city's
contractor wouldn't pick up his garbage in the old metal
cans. Despite his numerous phone calls, he says, the
contractor failed to deliver special plastic containers
required under the city's new pay-by-the-can system.
   "I threatened to dump trash in the middle of the street,"
Mr. Green says. New containers suddenly appeared. Fearing
another "bureaucratic shuffle," he threw out forms for
ordering recycling bins. Although he wouldn't call the city,
he was receptive when Ms. Nolan stopped by to chat. "She's
someone we know, and she made it easy," he says.
   Although the program isn't yet saving the city money,
Seattle offers the first large-scale, practical demonstration
that recycling can be a cost-effective alternative to
incinerating or landfilling most waste. By providing a model
and an answer to skeptics, Seattle's experience is expected
to lend force to proposals to double federal, state and local
recycling goals to the 40% to 60% range. Those targets, in
turn, are likely to reduce the size and number of new
incinerators.
   "What Seattle is doing could be replicated in almost any
major city," contends Bruce Weddle, the Environmental
Protection Agency's solid-waste director. But the nation now
recycles only about 17% of its waste, and many communities
are struggling to meet the federal goal of 25% by 1993.
   One key to Seattle's success is garbage rates that, in
effect, pay people to recycle. Residents pay a separate bill
based on how much garbage they produce. Monthly charges
increase steeply from $10.70 for a 19-gallon "mini-can" to
$31.75 for three full-size, 32-gallon cans. Recycling of
plastic soda bottles, glass, cans, newspaper and mixed waste
paper, including junk mail, is free. The result: Almost nine
out of 10 households have reduced their garbage to one can or
less per week, cutting tonnage going to landfills by nearly
30% since 1987. Four out of five Seattle households now
recycle.
   Innovative programs have helped. The city requires
residents to separate yard clippings from other trash but
charges only $2 a month for collection. It is distributing
10,000 free bins to encourage backyard composting and offers
opportunities to recycle some plastic bottles, mattresses,
motor oil and even lawnmowers. Old latex paint is collected,
and light colors are blended and sold for $5 a gallon as
"Seattle beige." In all, the city spends $7 million a year
for recycling, including collection and $500,000 for
advertising.
   But Seattle's success "may not be entirely transferable to
other parts of the country," warns Allen Moore, president of
the National Solid Wastes Management Association, an industry
trade group. Surrounded by the natural beauty of Puget Sound,
old-growth forests and snow-clad Mount Rainier, Seattle
residents are imbued with environmental fervor. The city was
already recycling 24% of its waste before curbside service
began in 1988. Moreover, Seattle's ready access to the huge
Asian market has made recycling more economic.
   To reach its own ambitious goal, Seattle must persuade
residents to separate 85% of what is recyclable. Instructions
stuffed into utility bills aren't enough to prompt the
necessary life-style changes; so neighborhood volunteers
teach by example.
   The family of one volunteer, Toni Reineke, loves chocolate
syrup, but she won't buy it in nonrecyclable squeeze bottles.
Instead, she makes her own from ingredients packaged in paper
and glass. "It's cheaper and tastes better," she adds. The
Reinekes still send out for pizza, but Mrs. Reineke's
husband, Robert, rips the cardboard box in two, saves the
clean part for recycling and burns the rest in the fireplace.
Their eight-year-old daughter, Robin, won't buy toys in
excessive packaging. "It's not kind to Mother Earth," she
says.
   Norma Davidson, a 65-year-old volunteer, practices a
waste-reducing life style that she calls "living lightly."
She brushes her teeth with baking soda to avoid disposable
toothpaste tubes, reuses tinfoil and sandwich bags and heats
her home with discarded lumber. Her 60-by-120-foot city lot
is a laboratory of natural recycling. Food scraps and yard
waste are composted into fertilizer for "edible landscaping,"
such as the brilliant yellow calendula flowers that go in her
salads.
   Obstacles remain, however. The recycled latex paint hasn't
sold well because beige isn't popular, and some contractors
worry that it might not hold up well. Some miscreants think
"yard waste" includes things like engine blocks and tires.
Fewer than half the households in some poor neighborhoods
recycle; the city is hiring a minority consultant to help
reach blacks and Asians.
   More significantly, Seattle's two recycling contractors
are sustaining losses because newsprint and mixed-paper
prices have collapsed. That could lead to higher garbage
rates unless the paper industry adds enough recycled-paper --
using capacity to shore up the markets. Furthermore,
businesses and apartment buildings aren't served by the
city's program, and commercial garbage rates, set by the
state, don't provide strong incentives to recycle. Only a
third of Seattle's public schools recycle paper because costs
are high, although officials plan to extend recycling to more
schools.
   Nonetheless, employees accustomed to recycling at home are
demanding to do it at work. Allen Daniel, who manages the
Pioneer Building, got many requests from his business
tenants, but he didn't have the time or know-how to organize
a program for 85 offices. "Recycling isn't my priority," Mr.
Daniel says.
   He turned to Carol Olsen, a consultant hired by the city.
She contacted more than 50 tenants, distributed fliers and
found a contractor willing to pick up mixed waste paper free
of charge. The contractor, the nonprofit Seattle Drug and
Narcotic Program, teaches recovering addicts new work skills
by recycling paper for 400 businesses.
   With nearly all tenants recycling paper, aluminum cans and
bottles, the Pioneer Building has cut trash by a third and
saved $300 a month. But there have been tradeoffs. Now,
garbage is picked up from offices every other day, prompting
minor complaints about odors.
   Of 50 businesses assisted through the city's pilot
program, however, 30 didn't start recycling, mostly because
they were too small to get pickup service or couldn't
organize their buildings.
   However, the city must make "significant strides" in
commercial and apartment recycling to achieve its interim
goal of recycling 50% of all waste by 1993, says Diana Gale,
director of Seattle's Solid Waste Utility. Using government
funds, the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce is hiring two
full-time employees to promote recycling and use of products
such as 100%-recycled office paper. One reason: "Business
people aren't comfortable with the city coming in to tell
them what to do," says Susan Fife, who heads the chamber's
recycling committee.
   Bureaucracy has also been a problem. Ruth Hardy, who
manages two adjacent four-unit apartment buildings, is
begging to recycle. Her dumpster is overflowing. But for
three months, the city declined to deliver bins, contending
her operation actually is eight units; only buildings of up
to four units are eligible. Eventually, the city relented,
and it promised to deliver the bins.
   Although recycling has become a way of life in most
Seattle neighborhoods, David Chamberlain, another block
captain, says he did have a problem -- his two teenagers. It
took a year to hit upon a system requiring only minimal
cooperation: recycling containers strategically located
throughout his house.
   Tearing himself away from Nintendo, Andrew, 14, points to
the large box in his bedroom with a sign admonishing:
"Recycle Paper." Says he: "When my room fills up with junk,
that's where I throw my magazines, school papers and pop
cans."
   His brother, John, 19, is a strapping softball player who
consumes cases of soda pop, boxes of pizza and gallons of
milk from his bedroom refrigerator. "He's getting better" at
recycling, his mother says, although he forgets to remove the
plastic liner from his four-pound Grape Nuts boxes. His
recycling container is overflowing, but he admits he is
usually too lazy to carry it downstairs. "I just don't see
getting all hyped up about it," he says.
   His parents are perfectionists: They separate everything.
Plastic milk, detergent and shampoo bottles go to a dropoff
at the local supermarket. Glass, separated by color to
increase its value, helps support local charities. Andrew
hoards aluminum, including printing plates from his father's
business, and sells them privately to help support his video
mania.
   Mr. Chamberlain also deals with midnight dumpers cruising
back alleys. Determined to avoid the $5 charge for every bag
of garbage that won't fit in prepaid cans, they have stashed
trash and heaps of cigarette butts in his recycling bin. Now,
Mr. Chamberlain rolls out the container only on pickup day.
   Ms. Nolan, the North Seattle block captain, computer
analyst and mother of three-year-old Tyler, avoids packaging
wherever possible. She stuffs a canvas bag with grocery
sacks, produce bags and plastic containers before driving to
a Puget Consumers' Co-Op, which sells everything from honey
and spices to peanut butter and shampoo in bulk. Using
gravity-fed bins and barrels fitted with pumps and spigots,
she fills her reusable packaging. Milk comes in returnable
glass bottles.
   But what to do with all the corn cobs, husks, chicken
bones and other remains from summer barbecues? Ms. Nolan
relies on a 4-foot-by-2-foot plywood box in her back yard
that looks vaguely like a coffin. It is her worm composting
bin, home to a one-pound, writhing ball of red manure worms
that digest almost any organic matter, even paper plates.
Opening the lid, her husband digs into the waste, which is
steaming hot from decomposition. On the left side, he buries
barbecue waste, moldy pita bread, orange peels and coffee
grounds. On the right, he scoops out a soil-like material
that fertilizes the garden.
   His wife doesn't consider herself an environmental nut.
"What motivates me more is saving money," she says. Growing
up in an Irish-American family of 12, she says she learned
the "value of reusing."
   The environmental use of worms is catching on among the
neighborhood's young families. Debra Revere, 36, a family
therapist, got her first worm box recently at a birthday
party. Neighbors pitched in to build her a deluxe model,
designed as a garden bench and painted in beige and red to
match her house.
   But some choices aren't easy. Ms. Nolan and her husband
disagree on how to stain the exterior trim of their bungalow.
He says solvent-based stain will last longer, but she prefers
a less-polluting latex. Convenience, too, is a factor: They
use an electric dishwasher. Says Ms. Nolan: "I have a debate
going on in my head at all times: What's the lesser evil?"

   We Wuz Robbed] (That's Only My Opinion, Of Course)

   There's an old joke that goes something like this:
   A burly fellow walks into the doctor's office and says he
feels terrible and wonders why.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You're fat," says the doctor.
   The fellow is outraged. "I want a second opinion," he
says.
   "OK," says the doctor, "you're ugly, too."
   That was funny when you first heard it 10 years ago.
Today, it isn't. At least it isn't to that little band of
lawyers and newsmen who keep a close eye on the health of the
First Amendment. To them, what was funny 10 years ago is
frightening today.
   For as of last month, a person has to keep his opinions to
himself -- or risk being sued.
   Historically in this country, there has been no such thing
as a false opinion. Without fear, I could write an editorial
that said you were the worst mayor in the history of my city.
You could write a sports column that likened my tennis game
to your aunt's butterfly chasing. A cartoonist could depict a
politician as sinister and evil. A critic could compare a
singer's performance to the baying of my otter hound.
   And you and I and the cartoonist and the critic would be
quite safe in saying what we said. The politician, the
athlete, the performer -- or your aunt and my otter hound --
just had to grin and bear it. A person's opinions were all
part of the uninhibited, robust and wide-open debate that
characterizes free speech in this country.
   At first, it was the common law that protected us and our
opinions. Later, it was some state supreme courts. Finally,
it was the Supreme Court itself. "Under the First Amendment
there is no such thing as a false idea," the court said.
"However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its
correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on
the competition of other ideas."
   That was in 1974, and the only problem left was trying to
determine what was an opinion and what was a fact. But courts
developed guidelines for that, too, saying you had to look at
the language, the context, the social environment, and the
like. That was a problem, but not one that really threatened
free speech. The rules were pretty clear, the lines well
drawn.
   It was in 1974, too, that the Maple Heights High School
Mustangs and the Mentor High Cardinals squared off in an Ohio
wrestling match that led to a melee of sorts. Michael
Milkovich was the coach of the Maple Heights team, the home
team, and Ted Diadiun was a sports writer for the News-Herald
in Lorain. Mr. Diadiun thinks Mr. Milkovich ranted and raved
and egged on the crowd.
   Mr. Milkovich was called before a high school sports
governing body, which put him on probation. He appealed to a
court, which overturned the board's ruling. Mr. Diadiun was
even less impressed with Mr. Milkovich's performance during
the proceedings than he was with the performance at the
wrestling meet. So Mr. Diadiun wrote a column -- it was
labeled "TD Says" -- that said the sad lesson of the whole
incident was this: "If you get in a jam, lie your way out."
The headline on the column said:
                                                                                                       

   Maple beat the law
   with the `big lie'
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Milkovich sued Mr. Diadiun and his newspaper, and thus
began what the Supreme Court called "an odyssey of litigation
spanning nearly 15 years."
   The odyssey ended, sort of, June 21. The court unanimously
said that it never really meant there was no such thing as a
wrong opinion. What it really meant, the court said, was that
there was no such thing as a wrong idea. If an opinion
contains or implies a fact, the court said, the opinion has
to be defensible in court.
   How's that again?
   "If a speaker says, `In my opinion John Jones is a liar,'
he implies a knowledge of facts which lead to the conclusion
that Jones told an untruth," the court said in explaining
that opinions based on facts are litigable. "Even if the
speaker states the facts upon which he bases his opinion, if
those facts are either incorrect or incomplete, or if his
assessment of them is erroneous, the statement may still
imply a false assertion of fact. Simply couching such
statements in terms of opinion does not dispel these
implications; and the statement, `In my opinion Jones is a
liar,' can cause as much damage to reputation as the
statement, `Jones is a liar.'" Thus, Jones can sue and maybe
win.
   However, the court went on, "the statement, `In my opinion
Mayor Jones shows his abysmal ignorance by accepting the
teachings of Marx and Lenin' would not be actionable. . . . A
statement of opinion relating to matters of public concern
which does not contain a provably false factual connotation
will receive full constitutional protection." So Jones can't
win that one.
   Huh?
   What this means, apparently, is this: If I state my
opinion clearly and succinctly, you can sue me. I can't get
the suit dismissed on the ground that it was merely an
opinion. We'll go to trial to determine whether my opinion
was based on facts, which, indeed, is what Messrs. Milkovich
and Diadiun may now have to do. If you can prove the facts
were wrong or incomplete, you can win a lot of money from me.
   What this will lead to, once it sinks in in newsrooms and
law offices around the country, is mealy-mouthed editorials,
wishy-washy sports columns, punch-pulling cartoons and
namby-pamby reviews. It will lead to sentences like, "In my
opinion Mayor Jones shows his abysmal ignorance by accepting
the teachings of Marx and Lenin," and away from sentences
like, "Mayor Jones is a dumb Red."
   To be sure, this dumb decision -- excuse me, this
decision, which appears to be based on a historical
perspective that some might find misguided or troubling or
based on abysmal ignorance -- won't topple democracy. But
neither will it enhance that "free flow of ideas and
opinions" that the court just two years ago said was "at the
heart of the First Amendment."
   "Permitting people to express their emotions as well as
their thoughts is . . . a central purpose of the First
Amendment," Robert Sack, a lawyer who represents this
newspaper, among others, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief
that the big media companies (including my employer, NBC)
entered on behalf of Mr. Diadiun.
   Mr. Sack is old enough to have been a fan of the Brooklyn
Dodgers, and he says that Mr. Diadiun's column brought back
memories of Ebbets Field and the Dodger fans yelling "We wuz
robbed."
   "We wuz robbed," he says, "is not so different from what
sports columnist Diadiun was saying. It cannot be put to a
true/false test without endangering the ability of reporters
and fans to get mad, to participate fully in the tumult and
shouting of American spectator sports."
   That was written before the Supreme Court ruled, of
course. But the analogy is apt. For if there's one thing
that's clear from the decision, it's this:
   We wuz robbed.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Polaroid `Art': Master Paintings for Under $2,000

   Boston -- In a small, windowless room somewhere inside
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), two men in pale blue lab
coats and plastic gloves hoisted a 3.4-foot roll of film onto
an oversized steel roller. An infrared light shone from the
black ceiling, and the accordion-like pleats of an immense
bellows folded out from one of the black walls.
   "You're inside the bellows of a camera," said Peter Bass,
Polaroid senior technical specialist, as he reached for the
light switch.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An image of peasants walking on a country road amid fields
and swaying poplars flashed across the darkened room, hitting
the long sheet of film the technicians had lowered in the
dark. Whirring rollers sandwiched the exposed negative
against a sheet of printing paper, bursting a long
aluminum-coated tube of processing chemicals. And just 105
seconds later, Mr. Bass pulled back the top sheet of a
life-size snapshot of Ivan Shishkin's "Midday in Moscow
Countryside."
   Mr. Shishkin's painting is hidden from public view in
Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery. But its photographic replica,
which duplicates every dab of color, brush stroke and crack,
soon will grace a select number of museum gift shops and
retail stores. With a handsome gilt-embossed frame and a
coyly calculated retail price of $998, this oversized
snapshot is being touted as the next best thing to owning a
real artwork.
   Invented in 1976 as a show-stopper for an annual
shareholders' meeting, Polaroid's room-sized camera has long
been used to record conservation work on rare paintings and
tapestries. Now the camera is being teamed with computer
imaging technology to mass produce replicas of popular
masterpieces.
   "Imagine having the opportunity to own and actually live
with works of proven importance by artists such as Monet,
Cezanne, Sargent, Homer and more," Polaroid's "Museum Replica
Collection" catalog enthuses, amid pages of photo
reproductions priced from $110 to $1,955. "Chosen . . . for
their ability to fit comfortably into your home or office
environment."
   The process works like this: Take your Monet or your Homer
and photograph it with a large-format camera. Run that
photograph through a computer scanner, which digitizes the
image into microscopic points called pixels (1.5 millionth of
an inch) that are color-coded to create a new image that will
translate accurately on Polaroid film. A digital record of
this image is stored on a 20-inch, 300-megabyte computer
disc. Meanwhile, an 8-by-10 transparency of the new
color-calibrated image is whisked off to the room-sized
camera, framed in front of the lens and snapped, with any
color discrepancies corrected by tinted gels. The final
product -- life-size, provided the original picture is no
larger than the camera's 40-by-80-inch focal plane -- is
sprayed with a "protectant" that also cuts the glossiness of
the print, which is then mounted and framed. The result: a
photograph that reproduces the colors and textures of a
painting so closely that it almost looks three-dimensional.
   Of course, some paintings "replicate" better than others.
Van Gogh's "The Sea at Saintes-Maries" ($480) looks a lot
like the painting it pretends to be, thanks to heavy brush
strokes and thick applications of paint that created shadows
when the painting was photographed. But Renoir's "The Actress
Jeanne Samary" ($495), with its delicate pastels, is flat and
unconvincing.
   The models for the more than 100 replicas available in
this country are almost exclusively from the collection of
the Museum of Fine Arts, with recent additions from Moscow's
Tretyakov Gallery and Pushkin Museum. The museums receive a
royalty fee, and the MFA also sells many of the replicas in
its own gift shop. Francois Poulet, general manager of the
museum's retail operations, said the shop netted nearly
$50,000 from replicas sold in conjunction with the museum's
Monet exhibition last winter.
   Other American museums are slowly following suit.
Replicated images from the Pushkin Museum now are on sale at
New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. And the Art Institute
of Chicago recently allowed some of its paintings to be
replicated -- on the condition that the replicas be sold
outside the country only.
   But not every museum director is eager to hawk these
framed facsimiles. Kirk Varnedoe of New York's Museum of
Modern Art balked at the idea. "We sell slides for
educational purposes, we sell books . . . (but) the market
for decorative replicas; we haven't felt that it was our
business to get into," he said. "It's one of the tough jobs
that a museum has in front of it, to value the original
object, to insist on discrimination between that which almost
is and that which really is. The risk here is that the museum
seems to be the agent of blurring that distinction."
   In a move that may further blur that distinction, Polaroid
now is inviting museums to move the replicas right into their
own galleries. Norma Pasekoff of Polaroid Corp.'s replica
division recently visited the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C., to promote the "potential uses" of replicas
in "traveling exhibitions, for broadening exhibitions, {as
substitutes for} works that are missing," she said.
   "With today's technology, it is the closest to the real
thing you can get," said Ms. Pasekoff. "When you think you
can see every brush stroke and every crack, yes, it's art.
It's not original, but it's art."
   She makes a passionate case, but Mr. Varnedoe isn't having
any of it. "Oil on canvas takes light differently than does
Polaroid die on coated paper," he said. "The painted surface
is composed of matte and glossy, dry and oily . . . they are
the vocabulary in which the artist worked, and they don't
translate when everything comes down to a coat of
photographic emulsion on paper."
   But Polaroid is betting that for art lovers intent on
owning a dandy copy of their favorite Picasso or Degas, such
considerations may not matter. The camera and film company
now is taking special requests for replicas, provided that
the owner or museum in question agrees. Mike Murray, a
general manager for Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, Wash., has
been hooked on Leon Augustin L'Hermitte's "Friend of the
Humble" ever since he saw a copy of the 1892 religious
painting hanging in a friend's house in 1975. Fortunately for
Mr. Murray, the real thing -- which he has never actually
seen -- is in the MFA's storage room.
   "It had personal significance to me, and I've always
thought it would be nice to have a copy of that print in my
home someday," Mr. Murray said. "What I may do is have
smaller prints made for my children."
   For G. Peabody Gardner Jr., former director of development
at the Museum of Fine Arts, the replica process seemed a good
way of filling in a few gaps in the family picture gallery.
In one case, the gap was left by a portrait of Mr. Gardner's
great grandfather, George P. Gardner, by Swedish artist
Anders Zorn, which had been donated to the museum years ago.
   "You don't pretend it's an original painting by Zorn; it
nevertheless does meet you halfway," Mr. Gardner said. "It
doesn't really look cheap, if you put it in a nice frame."
   Perhaps Mr. Zorn, who died in 1920, would have liked the
idea of such machine-generated replicas of his work.
Certainly it appealed to Mario Fernandez. This artist, known
for his sweeping paintings of nature and wildlife, sees the
photos as a colorful -- and lucrative -- new art form. He
recently ordered up 30 replicas of one of his paintings, and
plans to enhance each one with a different painted detail.
Every "unique" will cost $6,500.
   "At a certain point in the market, pricewise, people are
looking for something more exclusive . . . than off-set
lithography," Mr. Fernandez said. "If you only have 10 copies
of {an artwork}, you know it's going to be priced at a level
that is going to increase your presence in the market, your
reputation, everything else."
   But for artist Larry Rivers, photo replicas are just the
latest twist in art reproduction. "It's nothing that Polaroid
dreamt up, they're just reproductions and maybe they're
pretty good," Mr. Rivers said. Besides, Polaroid replicas may
be just the thing for some art lovers, he conceded: "Some
people can buy Mercedes Benzes -- but a lot of people buy
Chevrolets. They're not unhappy."

   Economy:
   Housing Starts Dropped 2.3% in June;
   Consumer Prices Increased by 0.5%

   WASHINGTON -- New government figures suggest the housing
industry is suffering from a slump that rivals the 1982
recession.
   Housing starts dropped for the fifth consecutive month
during June, according to the Commerce Department, falling a
steep 2.3% to an annual rate of 1,177,000. That's the lowest
level since the 1,173,000 rate in October 1982, near the
bottom of the most recent recession.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The multifamily market is in a genuine recession, if not
depression," said David Seiders, chief economist of the
National Association of Homebuilders. "The outlook there is
very dim indeed." Mr. Seiders said a survey conducted by the
homebuilders group shows increasing pessimism for
single-family home construction as well.
   Separately, the Labor Department reported consumer prices
jumped 0.5% last month, signaling that inflation continues to
be a problem. Prices for food and housing led the way,
posting their largest increases since January.
   Economists expressed disappointment over the inflation
figures, worrying that the rise in prices, particularly in
the cost of services, could damp consumer confidence. The
June price increase "is higher than the wage increase,"
commented Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic
forecasting project at Georgia State University, "so the
average American worker found that their standard of living
fell, and that cannot be good for the economic expansion."
   The new figures illustrate the dilemma that faces Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. Economic growth is
very slow, and in some sectors such as housing a full-fledged
recession is clearly under way. But inflation remains a
threat, leaving the central bank with little room to ease
credit. Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee
yesterday that the inflation figures are "higher than we
would like to see." But he added that "the core of inflation
in consumer prices . . . has moderated in recent months."
   The biggest factors in the jump in consumer prices were
increases of 0.7% in the cost of food and beverages and 0.6%
in housing. Food and beverages account for nearly 18% of the
Labor Department's consumer price index, and housing for more
than 40%. Medical care costs, which account for about 6% of
the index, rose 0.7%.
   Medical care costs have risen 9% over the 12 months ended
in June, faster than any other category in the index. Meat
and poultry products rose 1.5% for the month, as did fruits
and vegetables. Gasoline prices also rose sharply, up 2.5%.
   The continued decline in housing starts gave analysts
little evidence that the housing industry will snap out of
its slump in the near future. Tighter lending by banks and
high interest rates helped to keep starts down, with last
month's housing down 16.8% from the level of a year earlier.
   "The revision last month and the numbers this month are
really very low numbers and are certainly not heartening to
us," remarked Martin Regalia, chief economist at the National
Council of Savings Institutions. "Poor consumer confidence,
higher-than-desired interest rates, and lower income growth
-- the combination makes housing less affordable than we
would like to see."
   Mr. Regalia said he found a glimmer of hope in the rise in
building permits in June, up 3.9% from May for an annual rate
of 1,107,000 permits. "It tells me that we have fallen off
the cliff and are still able to crawl away from the
situation."
   Figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal
variations.

   Board of National
   Intergroup Seeks
   To Appease Group

   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc., trying to defuse a
heated proxy battle, said it would expand its board to 13
from 10 and give a seat to dissident shareholder Centaur
Partners.
   But there's a catch. The offer is contingent on the
company winning the proxy fight next week against Centaur.
Moreover, the Centaur director would be named only to a
one-year term.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   National Intergroup directors voted the plan at a special
meeting yesterday. One new director would be chosen from
Centaur's slate and a second director would be selected from
a list compiled with the advice of the company's
institutional stockholders. The third seat would go to Robert
King, president of FoxMeyer Drug, the company's wholesale
drug-distribution unit. Mr. King has been tapped to succeed
Howard M. Love, National Intergroup's chairman, when Mr. Love
steps down early next year.
   While Centaur's director would have only a one-year term,
Mr. King would be a director for three years and the
institutional representative for two years.
   Centaur, in a statement, said it views National
Intergroup's move as "a blatant, last-minute attempt to buy
institutional support for their nominees."
   Centaur rebuffed another board seat offer about a month
ago, according to a National Intergroup executive. Centaur
Partners, along with another dissident group, Walker Street
Associates, owns 25% of National Intergroup and is seeking to
elect three directors at the shareholder meeting on
Wednesday.
   This marks the second major move by National Intergroup to
appease investors who have grown steadily impatient with the
company's poor performance. Last month, the company said Mr.
Love would step down as top executive and all operations,
except FoxMeyer, would be sold.
   While radical, those moves failed to appease Centaur. The
group, urging a complete liquidation, noted that National
Intergroup has had losses from continuing operations for
seven years in a row. It also has questioned whether the
company's proposed restructuring would result in shareholder
dividends and why the board awarded Mr. Love a $300,000 bonus
in 1990 and granted him options to buy 325,000 shares of
stock at $16.80 each.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, National Intergroup closed at $17.625, off 50
cents, on volume of 93,600 shares.
   The two sides have been fighting since January. Centaur
wanted to increase the size of the board to 15 and elect
eight directors, effectively seizing control of the company.
Although 54% of stockholders, including Centaur, backed the
plan, it was defeated because an 80% majority is needed to
amend bylaws.

   Simon to Re-Enter Buy-Out Arena in Fund With Tokio Marine

   NEW YORK -- Simon says buy-outs are back.
   After four years of sitting on the sidelines of the
leveraged buy-out field that made him millions, William E.
Simon is getting ready to re-enter the game. This time, he
will do it with a money chest provided by a Japanese
insurance company and what he expects will be a "club" of
other big investors from the U.S., Asia and Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Simon and partner Gerald L. Parsky said that Tokio
Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co. of Tokyo has invested $100
million in a partnership formed to take over all of the
Simon-Parsky investment projects, except those involving
savings and loan associations.
   In turn, the new partnership, WSGP Partners, hopes to
raise a pool of at least an additional $300 million from a
group of no more than 10 pension funds, insurers and other
institutions world-wide. This fund will target medium-sized
companies for friendly takeovers, including some overseas. It
also will invest in real estate ventures.
   The investment by Tokio Marine, the world's largest
property and casualty insurer, reflects the continuing hunger
of Japanese financial institutions for U.S. deal-making and
money-management skills. Most big Japanese brokerage firms,
insurers and commercial banks have formed links with U.S.
investment firms, either by buying stakes or setting up joint
ventures.
   Tokio Marine itself paid $42 million last year for a 10%
stake in Delaware Management Holdings Inc., a
Philadelphia-based money management firm. Wilshire Associates
of Santa Monica, Calif., served as investment adviser to
Tokio Marine in taking both the Delaware Management and
Simon-Parsky stakes.
   For Mr. Simon, a former Treasury secretary, the new
partnership ends an absence from the leveraged buy-out arena,
when he and Mr. Parsky concentrated on S&amp;L and real estate
investments for several years. Mr. Simon helped spark the
buy-out boom of the 1980s with his hugely profitable buy-out
and resale of Gibson Greetings Cards Inc. in 1982-83. He
dropped out of the field when he believed skyrocketing deal
prices no longer made buy-outs attractive.
   This may change, with the demise of the high-yield,
below-investment-grade "junk" bond market and companies'
running into trouble because of debt-heavy balance sheets,
according to Messrs. Parsky and Simon. "We both believe that
realistic prices are coming and that there will be
opportunity for acquisitions from some of the overleveraged
{buy-out} transactions" done by others, Mr. Parsky said.
   Deals financed by the WSGP buy-out fund will probably
involve as much as 30% equity, compared with as little as 5%
or 10% in the heyday of the highly leveraged buy-outs. The
fund itself might provide 10% of the equity for a particular
investment, while fund investors would get the option to
supply the remainder directly, as well as get first crack at
financing the debt for the deal, Mr. Parsky said.
   Tokio Marine declined to disclose terms of its investment
pact with Messrs. Simon and Parsky. Mr. Parsky said the
insurer received a minority stake and won't be involved in
running the partnership, though the company will be active in
helping set investment strategies.
   At $300 million, the WSGP Partners buy-out fund would be
tiny, compared with such behemoths as the $5.6 billion
leveraged buy-out pool raised by Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Roberts &amp;
Co. But the "investment club" approach for the new fund would
greatly expand its buying power because participants could
elect to invest more money on a deal-by-deal basis.
   This added degree of control could appeal to big pension
funds, which were criticized by politicians during the
buy-out boom for getting locked into controversial takeovers.
   Mr. Parsky said the fund will target companies and
divisions with purchase prices of $300 million to $2 billion.
He said the fund isn't aimed at investing in troubled
companies but will be in the market for operations being
divested by cash-strapped companies.
   In real estate, the fund will shun downtown "trophy"
buildings in favor of buying less-visible properties, perhaps
from banks and thrifts paring their portfolios. About $800
million in commercial and residential properties, mostly in
Southern California and assembled by Messrs. Parsky and Simon
through earlier partnerships, won't be transferred to WSGP
Partners. But all new real estate purchases will be made
through the new partnership, Mr. Parsky said.
   He said that while the buy-out fund will be WSGP's main
focus, the partnership with Tokio Marine hopes to raise a
series of investment funds. Another one aimed at attracting
pension funds as investors will put money into companies
owned or being taken over by minority executives.
   The new buy-out fund won't invest in S&amp;Ls, an area in
which Messrs. Parsky and Simon remain active and for which
they continue to try to attract pension funds as investors
for a separate investment pool. Mr. Parsky said Tokio Marine
"wasn't interested" in getting involved in S&amp;L investments.
   The Simon-Parsky group, as previously reported, last year
made a proposal to the Los Angeles County Employees
Retirement Association and other big pension systems to form
an S&amp;L acquisition fund. This plan stalled, but Mr. Parsky
said he and Mr. Simon recently presented a new proposal to
potential investors, including the Los Angeles County fund
and the California Public Employees Retirement System.
   The new plan involves setting up the proposed fund using
Marina Del Rey, Calif.-based Western Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association, owned by the Simon-Parsky group, as a vehicle to
buy other thrifts. The initial plan called for the fund to
start buying thrifts from scratch. Mr. Parsky said the
pension funds and their consultants haven't responded to the
revised proposal yet.

   Industrials Drop 18.07 as Jitters
   Over Inflation Unsettle Investors

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices moved broadly lower as inflation
jitters further unsettled a market already pressured by
disappointments in second-quarter earnings reports.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surpassed 3000
during each of the previous three sessions and ended both
Monday and Tuesday at 2999.75, headed lower at the opening
and never mounted a serious challenge to that level. The
average closed 18.07 lower at 2981.68.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Declining stocks topped advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange by 1,030 to 483, and broader market indexes fared
substantially worse than the industrial average for the
second consecutive session.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index, for example, recorded
the equivalent of a 24-point loss in the 30-stock average by
falling 3.30 to 364.22. The Dow Jones Equity Market Index
lost 3.16 to 338.19, while the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index dropped 1.66 to 198.83.
   The market's initial setback followed news that consumer
prices went up 0.5% in June, a sharper rise than generally
expected. Analysts said the increase reduced the chances that
the Federal Reserve would ease monetary policy further; in
testimony before Congress, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said
the rise was "higher than we would like to see."
   Although prices rebounded briefly as Mr. Greenspan held
out the possibility that the central bank would nonetheless
consider taking additional steps to loosen credit, the
rebound was thwarted by a wave of sell programs linked to the
Chicago Board of Trade's futures on the Major Market Index.
   Index-arbitrage buying that involved the MMI, a 20-stock
measure designed to mirror the Dow industrials, had spurred a
late recovery in the market Tuesday. Following the reversal
of that move, stocks spent the rest of the session at lower
levels.
   Big Board volume totaled 168,760,000 shares, down from
176,790,000 Tuesday, as the flow of companies' second-quarter
results continued to dictate a large chunk of market
activity.
   "People are intolerant of bad (earnings) reports, but by
and large they're not leaving the market," said Peter Canelo,
an investment strategist at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Instead, he
said, investors are moving out of stocks where earnings
aren't meeting forecasts and putting their assets to work in
other issues.
   With the industrial average having jumped about 3.8% in
four sessions before stalling close to 3000, Mr. Canelo said
the downturn didn't appear to be a sign of serious difficulty
ahead for the market. The 3000 mark represents "a
psychologically treacherous level, and it's to be expected
after a good rally that people would take some profits," he
said.
   Polaroid, which plummeted 3 1/4 to 36 on Big Board
composite volume of 1.3 million shares, became the latest
major casualty of an earnings disappointment. Its
second-quarter net income dropped 23% from a year ago, and
the company said it expects operating profit for the full
year to be flat to slightly lower.
   Other recent victims of earnings-related selling also fell
in active trading, including United Telecommunications, the
Big Board's most active issue for the second consecutive
session. The stock, which plunged 8 3/4 Tuesday as 11.8
million shares changed hands, went down another 2 1/4 to 27
1/4 on 10 million shares.
   GTE, second on the most-active list, slid 3/8 to 27 7/8 as
3.5 million shares were traded, while Lowe's fell 3 1/4 to 38
1/8 on 1.2 million shares and Computer Associates
International was unchanged at 9 1/2 on 1.8 million shares.
   Investors also bailed out of a number of growth stocks,
which have been strong performers for some time. Wal-Mart
Stores dropped 1 3/4 to 33 3/4 on 2.9 million shares, Waste
Management tumbled 1 1/4 to 42 3/4 on 1.6 million shares,
Procter &amp; Gamble lost 3/4 to 89, Boeing fell 3/4 to 59 1/2
and Home Depot dropped 2 to 39 5/8.
   AMR, whose second-quarter net income fell 27% from a year
ago, retreated 2 7/8 to 61 5/8. First Boston lowered its 1990
and 1991 earnings projections on the parent of American Air
and several other airline companies; Delta Air Lines dropped
2 3/8 to 73 and USAir Group lost 5/8 to 24 3/4.
   But UAL, which owns United Airlines, rose 1/2 to 162 1/2.
Nonunion workers at United decided to support the $4.38
billion buy-out proposed by the unions representing pilots,
machinists and flight attendants.
   Upjohn climbed 2 3/8 to 43 7/8 on 2.2 million shares amid
renewed takeover rumors, focusing on a possible bid from
American Home Products, which fell 2 1/8 to 52 1/4. Upjohn,
which has previously said it isn't for sale, declined to
comment on the latest speculation. American Home and
Britain's Glaxo Holdings, another rumored suitor, also
declined to comment.
   Eli Lilly skidded 3 7/8 to 85 on 1.6 million shares as a
lawsuit filed Tuesday in New York drew attention to
accusations that the anti-depressant drug Prozac, which the
company markets, induces thoughts of suicide in some users.
   Pfizer rose 2 to 71 1/4 as 1.3 million shares changed
hands. PaineWebber upgraded its investment rating on the
stock to "attractive" from "neutral" and increased its 1990
and 1991 earnings estimates; analyst Ronald Nordmann said the
"excellent quality" of the company's second-quarter earnings,
released Tuesday, prompted those moves.
   Reebok International dropped 5/8 to 15 3/4 on 2.3 million
shares. Although second-quarter earnings rose 6.5% from a
year ago, earnings per share of 38 cents were on the lower
end of analysts' expectations; Montgomery Securities

   The Empire State Strikes Out

   As Gov. Mario Cuomo prepares to campaign for a third term,
and ponders a run for the White House in 1992, his role in
New York's fiscal deterioration is under increased scrutiny.
   Earlier this year, while unexpectedly slow revenue growth
was forcing the governor's budget office to increase its
deficit estimate by $2 billion, Mr. Cuomo called for a
double-digit rise in state spending. As a result, New Yorkers
-- already the highest-taxed people in the country -- will
pay an additional $1.8 billion in state taxes and fees this
year, including $400 million in higher income taxes. Despite
the state's pledge to reform future fiscal operations,
Moody's lowered its rating on the state's long-term debt.
Only the bonds of Massachusetts and Louisiana are rated
lower.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far the governor has successfully side-stepped
questions about his fiscal competency. He insists that the
state's problems stem from the economic slowdown in the
Northeast, and many New Yorkers accept this view. But New
York state has incurred deficits for eight of the past 10
years. During most of that period, the state's economy
performed better than the most Polyannish futurist would have
dared to predict in 1980.
   Population, after declining by 683,000 between 1970 and
1980, rose 2.2% between 1980 and 1989. Real income rebounded
from no growth to average annual increases of more than 3%
since 1980. Although it lagged neighboring states, New York
grew faster than the nation, with per-capita income rising
from 8.1% above the national average in 1980 to 16.9% above
in 1989. There are 1.2 million more New Yorkers working today
than when Mr. Cuomo took office in 1983, and the state
jobless rate has been cut to below 5% from 8.6%.
   Had state spending merely kept pace with personal income,
Albany would be dispensing a multibillion-dollar surplus
today. But this opportunity was squandered: Spending rose
from 14.7% of personal income in 1983 to 16% in 1988.
   Paying for this profligacy is fairly painless when
personal income taxes, business taxes and taxes on real
estate transfers automatically rise relative to personal
income. Comes an economic slowdown and the process is
reversed -- last year business taxes fell 3.1% and
real-property gains taxes were off 28.6% even as personal
income continued to grow. But old spending habits die hard.
The fiscal 1991 budget, hammered out after the longest, most
contentious budget debate in state history, compromised on a
7.5% spending increase. The governor had requested a 10.9%
rise.
   Assessing the true size or even the direction of state
spending is not easy. The state's affairs are tangled in a
network of trust accounts, special funds and off-budget
enterprises expressly designed to confuse outsiders. Thus the
governor can claim to have "cut" school aid by $400 million
this year simply by waiving the state's annual pension
contribution to the teacher retirement fund. Similarly,
revenues will be "increased" by selling a state office
building to the state-run Urban Development Corp.
   These shenanigans are reminiscent of New York City before
the financial community shut it out of the credit markets in
1975. Ironically, part of the legacy of that crisis is that
New York state now requires the city to balance its budget on
the basis of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The
fiscal discipline imposed by GAAP forced the city to lay off
workers and reduce essential services to close its budget gap
this year. In contrast, the state simply sold short-term
notes (a record $4.1 billion this spring) to cover its
shortfall, thereby avoiding unpleasant spending choices
during this election year.
   Is New York's deficit due to circumstances beyond its
control? Hardly. The state's payroll, for example, ballooned
from $3 billion in 1983 to $6.9 billion in 1988, a 130%
increase during a period when consumer prices rose 19%. In
1988 New York had 158 full-time employees for every 10,000
residents, compared with 107 in California, 124 in Texas, 114
in Florida and 104 in Pennsylvania. Over-staffing is obvious:
The newly established New York State Grace Commission might
explore why the Highway Department employs more than twice as
many workers per lane mile as the national average, and why
there are only 1.5 inmates per corrections worker here vs.
two per worker nationwide.
   The big money -- more than 50% of state spending -- goes
to education and social services. The Aid to Families with
Dependent Children grant has been increased four times in the
past six years, most recently a 15% rise that took effect
Jan. 1. It's politically untouchable. But why should the
state Department of Social Services, a $150 million agency
that does not issue a single welfare benefit check, be
allowed a 22% increase in its operating budget this year?
Medicaid costs three times more per recipient here than in
California, yet Albany shows no inclination to try the
market-oriented reforms that have successfully controlled
costs in that state.
   The highest per-pupil expenditure in the country has not
prevented New York's average SAT scores from sinking below
the national average. The school bureaucracy has flourished,
however. According to Albert Shanker, president of the
American Federation of Teachers, there are more school
administrators in New York than in all of Western Europe.
   New York City (which receives 34% of state education aid
and 60% of total state welfare allotments) is arguably in
worse fiscal shape than the state. Although state money to
bail out the city may be lacking, Albany's power to do so is
not.
   The state has imposed rent control on certain New York
City buildings since World War II. Decontrolling high-rent
apartments would increase city property taxes by more than
$370 million each year, according to Peat Marwick. A
capital-gains tax cut would increase the value of New York
real estate and breathe life into a securities industry that
has cut its New York City work force by 21,000 employees. The
privatization of state assets, ranging from airports to the
World Trade Center, could raise funds to restore the city's
crumbling infrastructure. Unfortunately, the political
establishment in both Albany and City Hall rejects these
policies.
   Many New Yorkers are encouraged by the apparent end of the
tax revolt in California. Few know that this flip-flop comes
after stringent spending limitations pushed that state's
spending down relative to personal income. (At one point Gov.
George Deukmejian actually rebated $1.1 billion of excess
revenues to state residents.) More important, few New Yorkers
know that their own governor wields both a line-item veto and
a broad impoundment authority -- powers for spending control
that President Bush can only dream about. Gov. Hugh Carey
used these weapons to reduce spending as a percentage of
personal income. It can be done again.

   House Republicans have sent a message to both the White
House and the Democrats that a budget-summit deal that
includes any new taxes won't have their support. Yesterday,
by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, they passed a resolution by
Texas Rep. Dick Armey opposing the use of "new taxes, and all
tax rate increases" to reduce the deficit. To make sure
everyone can read their lips, they defined tax rate increases
as "all rates on all existing taxes under federal
jurisdiction." The Armey resolution makes it difficult to
pass another TEFRA-like sham budget agreement. With a
majority of House Republicans on record against higher taxes,
Democrats may have to give up more than they bargained for on
budget-process reform and spending if they want an agreement.

   JOHN NEU, A MAJOR DEVELOPER of New Jersey real estate, is
taking direct action to help the homeless -- he is giving
them homes. Five of his prefabricated townhouses, installed
two blocks from the New Jersey end of the Holland Tunnel on
land donated by Newark's Roman Catholic Archdiocese, are now
transitional housing for single parents and their children in
Jersey City. In a second project, he will give away 25 more
of these $50,000 three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath prefabs to
low-income families.
   The developer's wife, Wendy, who is a former prison social
worker, literally brought the problem home to her husband. In
February 1989, she found a homeless woman on a street corner
and took her to the couple's Hoboken home. During the woman's
six-weeks' stay, John Neu learned firsthand the plight of the
homeless.
   Searching for a home for their new charge, the Neus became
acquainted with the Newark Archdiocese's Catholic Community
Services and Tom Catlaw, the church agency's director for
Hudson County, which includes Jersey City. By this time, John
Neu was determined to go further in helping the homeless. (He
and his wife, incidentally, did eventually locate a place for
their homeless guest.)
   The archdiocese owned five empty lots in Jersey City, near
one of its community centers. Mr. Neu had five unfinished
prefab townhouses in a warehouse, repossessed from a failed
customer. The combination was a natural. Mr. Catlaw and the
archdiocese offered the five lots as a building site; Mr. Neu
put the final touches on the prefabs and donated them. The
church group raised most of the $115,000 needed for
foundations, sidewalks, utilities connections and other
site-preparation work.
   In June, the archdiocese began using the new homes as
transitional housing for families, most headed by single
parents, already enrolled in programs for counseling,
education and job training.
   The townhouses represent the final phase of a three-part
program for the homeless. This starts with emergency shelter
for as long as 45 days, moving next into a transitional
period of as long as six months, and finally, thanks to Mr.
Neu, into a period of stabilization when families can count
on a roof over their heads for as long as two years.
   This process, Mr. Catlaw says, is designed to break a
cycle of homelessness that finds many of the church agency's
clients entering a second generation without a permanent
home. They're "not necessarily on the street," he says, "but
living with relatives or in shelters." After this new
transitional stage, he says, "when children have been in the
same school for two years," the families should be ready to
move out on their own. The family heads, in turn, are
expected to turn over part of whatever earnings they have to
the archdiocese, which holds them in savings accounts against
the day the families are ready to stand alone.
   John Neu, in Mr. Catlaw's eyes, is "an incredible human
being." He recalls that this past Christmas, the developer
and his wife spent the day at one of the archdiocese's
psychiatric centers, cooking and serving meals. Mr. Neu's
company is Manhattan-based and he and his wife now live there
as well, but his interests are New Jersey-oriented. The firm
owns five million square feet of real estate there and a
scrap business has an installation in Jersey City.
   For Mr. Neu, this first gift is only the beginning. The
next is designed to help the nearly homeless, families caught
in that Catch-22 of too much income to qualify for housing
subsidies and too little to afford a home.
   Mr. Neu is now working with a new low-income project
sponsored by another nonprofit Jersey City organization
called Neighborhood Housing, which is rebuilding a 25-block
area there. For this, he plans to buy and donate 25
additional prefab townhouses, which will be erected on land
obtained from the city.

   Your Money Matters:
   How the Priveleged Find a Private Bank

   Congratulations, you've arrived]
   Perhaps you're a prosperous professional with a
well-established law or medical practice. Or an
entrepreneurial genius who just sold your company for $20
million. Or maybe you just inherited $2 million or so.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Whatever the case, you have achieved a level of affluence
where you want a lot more from a bank than a checking
account.
   A growing number of banks are eager to oblige, with
"private banking" services that mix highly personalized
attention with access to hefty loans and professional
investment management. Finding the right one can pay off in
coming years through improved financial performance, fast and
accurate service, and confidence that your financial
well-being is a crucial concern of your banker.
   But finding the right private bank can be a chore. The
likes of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. or
U.S. Trust Co. may be just the ticket for some people. Others
may prefer to have their wealth watched over by the
ever-so-discreet Swiss. Still others could find that their
local bank's recently created private banking service offers
just what they need.
   Be wary of "image" advertising featuring posh offices,
some advisers say. After all, you probably won't spend much
time sitting in the overstuffed chairs, casually reading a
newspaper. Rely instead on referrals from wealthy colleagues
and friends who already use private banking facilities. Word
of mouth is much more reliable than fancy advertising
campaigns.
   Don't be put off by advertised minimum financial
standards. "Every bank publishes minimums, and every bank
breaks them," a private banker says. "It all depends on the
potential of the relationship for the bank."
   Even within private banks, there are various rankings of
wealth. At Citicorp, the private bank generally divides
clients into two categories: those with assets of $1.5
million to $10 million and those with more than $10 million.
But the difference in fees and levels of service is virtually
nil, says David Gibson, group executive in charge of
world-wide private banking. For example, the bank's art
service reports to the executive in charge of the $10
million-and-over group in the private bank, but the art
service -- investment advice on the acquisition of art works
-- is available to any client.
   "It becomes a question of how much they need a particular
resource," Mr. Gibson says. "Somebody with less than $10
million will need less of the art service than somebody with
more than $50 million."
   Still, advisers say it is a good idea to try to match your
qualifications to the size and clientele of the bank. "You
want to be at least a medium-sized fish in their pond," Larry
Biehl, a San Mateo, Calif., investment manager, says. "If you
decide you want to go to a J.P. Morgan, you want to be a good
salesman who can convince them that you're a rising star.
That's one way to get better service than you deserve."
   After targeting two or three banks as likely choices,
schedule interviews -- and be prepared to bare your financial
soul. Private bankers will want to see detailed financial
information, including income tax returns for at least one or
two years.
   "Give them all the financial data they need and sign your
name once," Mr. Biehl says. "If they start telling you later
that you need to fill out an application for this or that
service, you're in the wrong place."
   When you interview the person who will handle your
account, find out all you can about his or her background and
abilities. But the most important question is how much credit
your private banker is authorized to extend without going
through a loan committee.
   "That's evidence of seniority and how well you're being
treated," Mr. Biehl says. "If the limit is $10,000, you're
not high enough up yet. It should be at least $250,000."
   If the private bank is part of a bigger institution, find
out to whom it reports. This is a good indication of how
seriously the parent bank approaches private banking,
financial advisers say. Ideally, they say, it should report
directly to senior management.
   If you're a professional, find out whether the bank has
specialists on handling financial affairs for your
profession. A physician, for example, might want someone who
is up to date on the comparative benefits of leasing or
buying an expensive new piece of diagnostic equipment.
   The objective is to pick a bank that will provide one
person who can handle all your banking needs, no matter what
department of the parent bank is involved. "You don't want to
be sent off to wander through the bank's halls," David Ross
Palmer, a New York-based private bank consultant, says. "You
want someone who is not only your personal financial adviser,
but who is also your representative to the bank."
   The cost of private banking services varies widely. Some
banks provide the essentials for as little as $350 a year,
says Marilyn MacGruder Barnewell, a consultant who advises
banks on establishing private banking operations. But many
banks also require compensating balances -- deposits equal to
some part of any loan you may receive -- to help boost the
bank's profit. And the interest rates on these loans will
vary, depending on the nature and collateral of the loan,
from the prime rate to as much as the prime plus three
percentage points.
   Mr. Biehl suggests that specific fees for specific
services often can be more economical for a private banking
client than compensating balances. "You can probably earn
more on your money if you have it somewhere else, so you can
pay their fees and still be ahead," he says.
   But specialists argue that shopping for low prices in the
private banking arena can defeat the whole purpose of the
exercise. "If you're paying a low fee for crummy service,
what have you accomplished?" Ms. Barnewell says.

   Workman Finds Clever, Quirky Books,
   Marketed With Great Care, Bring Success

   NEW YORK -- For 20 years, Barbara Ann Kipfer kept a list
of things that make her happy. Each year for 10 years, she
mailed it to Peter Workman, the founder and owner of Workman
Publishing. "I just knew it was a Workman book," says Ms.
Kipfer, who makes her living writing dictionaries in
Connecticut. "They do books that are offbeat but classy."
   Last year, Mr. Workman told Ms. Kipfer he was skeptical
about turning her 22,000 favorite things into a book but
wanted to try. The list was shortened, the title was changed
from "The Happy Book" to "14,000 things to be happy about,"
and the book was packaged in a small, chunky size with a
clever cover.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some readers might quarrel with flannel sheets, the word
"boo" or other specific entries, but "14,000 things" was on
the Publishers Weekly paperback best-seller list for five
weeks, and it has sold well over 100,000 copies. It's
building the kind of gentle cult following that proves it's a
Workman book after all.
   Over the past 22 years, Workman has developed a reputation
for books that are clever, quirky and distinctively designed.
Most are high-quality paperbacks priced below most comparable
competing books, and they tend to be cookbooks, humor books,
calendars or children's books. Workman has also pioneered in
merchandising non-book items in bookstores and books in
non-bookstores.
   "Unlike almost any other publisher, you can look at a book
and say, `That's a Workman,'" says Judith Riven, an executive
editor at Hearst Corp.'s Avon Books. "They are smart and
original and catch trends before anybody else. French bistros
are all the rage now, but Workman already has a bistro
cookbook out there."
   Workman books are so "endearing and intriguing that they
almost compel you to give them special display," adds Michael
Brownstein, manager of the Atticus Bookstore Cafe in New
Haven, Conn.
   What sets a Workman book apart isn't just subject and
design but also the way it's published.
   "Workman is my first choice of all the publishers in
America, provided I'm selling their kind of book," says
literary agent Elise Goodman. "If you sell a book to a big
conglomerate publisher and they pay a big advance and do a
big advertising campaign, you feel like the author gets lost
-- and the sales reflect it. Workman never gives up on a
book, and they don't treat them like soap: Each one gets
special handling."
   Such treatment is the centerpiece of the Workman
publishing philosophy and helps explain why writers often
accept lower advances to be published there. While other
publishers keep vowing to improve their profits by publishing
fewer books better, their lists rarely dwindle. For years,
Workman has limited itself to about 20 new titles a year,
although more than 75% of its books are still in print -- a
phenomenal record -- so its publicists and commissioned
salespeople keep quite busy.
   Workman's whimsy, eccentricity and obsessive attention to
detail flow from Mr. Workman, the 51-year-old founder. A
tall, gawky man with a lopsided grin and the bemused air of a
mad scientist, he works in a chaotic office where even the
floor is piled high with books and papers. Mr. Workman hates
meetings and memos, but he approves every project, book
jacket and print run and still writes every royalty check.
Editors and art directors are given enormous freedom to dream
up projects, but once they're picked, everyone is expected to
be as compulsive and disciplined as Mr. Workman to make them
succeed.
   The high-pressure frenzy at Workman's funky downtown
offices -- and the boss's sometimes hot temper -- have driven
some authors and employees away. Helene Siegel, who once
managed production at Workman, says, "Peter doesn't
compromise, and he can wear you down." She says she respects
him enormously but also remembers him getting mad that she
wouldn't jump on a plane to inspect some pillows printed with
a Workman character when she was eight months pregnant.
   "Every project drives us nuts; it's always missed
deadlines and crisis management," says James Martin, who has
supervised the printing of Workman books at Banta Co. in
Menasha, Wis., for 18 years. "We have never, ever had a book
whose cover didn't change three, four times." Nevertheless,
Mr. Martin is a big admirer of Mr. Workman. "Peter is a
genius and people here will do anything they can to
accommodate him," Mr. Martin says.
   Most Workman employees feel the same way. And Mr.
Workman's methods have produced extraordinary growth. Mr.
Workman refuses to divulge sales and profits, but Ron Jaffe,
senior marketing director for Waldenbooks, says that sales of
Workman items there have doubled in the past three years
alone. Bert Snyder, Workman's sales manager, adds that one
title in three sells more than 100,000 copies.
   Workman's success starts with Mr. Workman's instinct for
picking projects, but the publisher finds it hard to analyze
his formula. "Something begets something," he says in his
laconic way. "Things sort of unfold."
   Workman's marketing panache dates back to a time when the
publisher had more energy than money. Its first big success,
"The Toy Book," was a how-to book of simple toys kids can
build. An advertising budget was impossible in 1972, so
author Stephen Caney made "hundreds" of appearances, says Mr.
Workman, and sales started to climb. (Still in print, though
with a new cover, the book has sold more than 320,000
copies.) To this day, Workman routinely mounts far longer
author tours than most publishers, while spending little on
ads.
   Mr. Caney's penchant for dreaming up projects for kids has
led to a series of Workman "activity books" that come with
props. New fall selections from Mr. Caney include "Make Your
Own Time Capsule" and "Teach Yourself Tap Dancing," which
follow the best selling "Bug Book &amp; Bug Bottle" and "Beach
Book &amp; Beach Bucket" by other authors.
   It was a cartoon cat in red sneakers that put Workman on
the map. B. Kliban's goofy "Cat" book has sold nearly a
million copies, but it was a slow starter. To promote it in
1975, most of the Workman staff ran around selling copies at
the annual cat show at Madison Square Garden. Then Mr.
Workman decided to give display posters of the cartoon cat to
bookstores. The posters were so popular, patrons stole them,
so bookstores asked to sell the posters, and Workman took up
licensing.
   Pretty soon Workman was selling Kliban cat mugs, pillows,
stationery and aprons. Cat calendars led Workman into other
calendars, and today it sells millions, featuring teddy
bears, dolls, herbs, games and tips for saving the planet, as
well as 21 kinds of Page-A-Day calendars, a format it
pioneered.
   The Workman way is to start small, print conservatively
and promote like mad, sometimes even for a book published
years before. A good example of how its persistence pays off
is "What to Expect When You're Expecting." When the book came
out in 1984, bookstore orders were a paltry 6,800 copies.
"Booksellers said, `Who needs another pregnancy book,
especially one that isn't written by a doctor?'" recalls
Workman's sales manager.
   But Workman was convinced there was a market for the book.
Written by health writer Arlene Eisenberg and her two
daughters (one a nurse and both with children), the
month-by-month guide tells women how they'll feel and look
and answers questions they might feel silly bugging a doctor
with.
   To keep copies moving, Workman offered a special deal to
bookstores that would order five or more. And Workman paid to
send the authors to annual meetings of obstetricians and
pediatricians, who then recommended the book. Now, with sales
of more than a million, "What to Expect" is the top selling
book on pregnancy, and unlike most books, it has higher sales
every year.
   The authors followed it with "What to Eat When You're
Expecting" and "What to Expect the First Year," and Workman
has just signed them up for two more books. "We could get
more (advance) money from another publisher, but I don't want
to work for anyone else," says Mrs. Eisenberg. "Peter is the
only publisher I know who would allow updates with every
printing."
   Workman's respect for contributors can be carried to
extremes. Take the teddy bears. Every year, about 20,000
teddy bear lovers send photos of their favorite pals to
Workman to audition for a place in Workman's popular Teddy
Bear calendar. The winning bears are sent by Federal Express
to New York for a photo shoot, but if the designers want to
pose a bear named, say, "Ralph" in a dress, a Workman staffer
will call the bear's home "to make sure no one minds," says
editor Suzanne Rafer.
   There have been bombs at Workman, including a humor book
called "Sneakers," children's books by William Buckley and
Anne Beattie and a spoof of Chinese horoscopes called "Help,
I Just Found Out I'm a Pig."
   But Mr. Workman keeps trying new things. Last year, he
bought small, classy fiction publisher Algonquin Books of
Chapel Hill, N.C. This fall, along with such Workmanlike
titles as "All I Need to Know I Learned From My Cat," Workman
will publish an uncharacteristic book about AIDS, for
teen-agers, and its first novel ever. The novel, "Good
Omens," is a funny book about the end of the world.
   "It just felt good," says Mr. Workman.

   Baker's Dilemma

   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker emerged yesterday from
a meeting in Paris with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze with what's been greeted as a major policy
shift. He announced that the U.S. would drop its recognition
of the Cambodian resistance and start talking with Vietnam
about how to solve Cambodia's miseries. He explained, "We
want to talk to Vietnam because we think it has influence
with the Cambodian government to create conditions for
elections."
   Well, it's no secret that Indochina's political byways can
be confusing. And clearly Mr. Baker has in mind a worthy
goal: preventing the return of the Khmer Rouge, who conducted
genocidal terrors from the time of the U.S. withdrawal from
Indochina until the Vietnamese conquest of Cambodia. Our own
sources in Thailand support the State Department's conclusion
that right now the Khmer Rouge, who have been cultivating a
village-level support network in the rural countryside, stand
a good chance of again seizing power. The two non-communist
Cambodian resistance groups, led by Prince Sihanouk and
former Premier Son Sann, are far weaker and less
well-organized. While they have a claim to Western support as
the only conceivably democratic alternative, in fact they may
well be doing little more than smoothing the way for the
Khmer Rouge to make a hideous comeback in Phnom Penh.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But this is not a game that pits the bad Khmer Rouge
against the good Vietnamese-backed regime of Premier Hun Sen,
himself a renegade Khmer Rouge official. Both players are
monstrous villains by the lights of civilized conduct. It is
12 years of Vietnamese occupation that have made the vicious
Khmer Rouge, for all too many Cambodians, the only viable
defenders of the Cambodian nation. And despite the announced
pullout last fall, there have been reliable reports of the
continued presence of Vietnamese troops.
   In any event, Vietnam's Communists have never, anywhere,
ever, done anything to create conditions for democracy -- not
even in Vietnam, and certainly not in Laos or Cambodia. The
idea that Vietnam is now going to help set up democracy in
Cambodia is one of the strangest we've heard yet. Cambodia
presents Mr. Baker with a choice of devils, but there's
little point in avoiding one by leaping into the arms of the
other. For the moment, Cambodia may be one of the world's
impossible problems.
   It could be, of course, that the biggest shift here is
really an unstated U.S. step toward normalizing relations
with Vietnam. This would be quite a coup for Hanoi, which has
conceded nothing. Vietnam's Communists continue to run one of
the world's most repressive states, beggaring their own
people, bullying their neighbors and hosting a massive Soviet
military base at Cam Ranh Bay. Does America really want to
broadcast the message that these folks are now its chosen
champions in Indochina?
   When it comes to helping Cambodia, indeed, we have a
radical thought. Granted that Vietnam sets the tenor for
Indochina, wouldn't the best hope for democracy in the
dominoes lie in holding real elections in Vietnam? Maybe Mr.
Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze could make that their next
project.

   NEW YORK -- For 40 years, TV's Nielsen ratings have been
the only show in town.
   The data on television viewing gathered by A.C. Nielsen
Co. have been the unquestioned currency of the business,
dictating how billions of advertising dollars are spent and
determining which shows survive and which ones falter.
Customers didn't mind the monopoly: One set of numbers from a
single supplier made things less complicated.

<TEXT>
   But now television has turned the tables: It is rating the
Nielsens -- and it's not pleased with the result.
   The company is under fire, its numbers are suspect, and
new rivals are lining up to exploit the tumult. A growing
number of television executives claim that the Nielsen system
-- particularly the remote control "people meter" device
Nielsen families use to log who watches what -- has
fundamental flaws. New studies contend the ratings
significantly understate viewing in a number of ways,
especially by children and young adults and people in bars,
hotels and on vacation.
   Nielsen's trouble began a few months ago, when its
numbers, based on 4,093 homes that are supposed to represent
92.1 million households, showed millions of people suddenly
ceasing to watch TV. Network viewing had been slowly
declining for several years, but overall television viewing
had remained steady for decades. This sudden, severe falloff
in total TV viewing was unprecedented.
   The networks went ballistic, rueful over having to give
sponsors $100 million in free commercials to cover the
ratings decline of the first quarter alone. Something had to
be wrong, they argued. They later imposed the first major
change in how ratings are guaranteed to advertisers, using
eight-year trends instead of just the current year's
Nielsens.
   "As a researcher, I've got to have confidence in the
numbers, and I don't," says Alan Wurtzel, senior vice
president of research at Capital Cities/ABC Inc. "We continue
to do business based on numbers that are suspect, and we can
only do that for a short time."
   Nielsen officials defend their system as proven, accurate
and rigorously tested. John Dimling, executive vice president
at A.C. Nielsen's rating service, Nielsen Media Research,
notes that despite network complaints, the ad industry's
major trade group has endorsed the system.
   Nevertheless, would-be rivals see an opening.
Britain-based Pergamon AGB PLC says it will re-enter the U.S.
market soon; two years ago, it racked up losses of $67
million in an effort that Nielsen soundly stomped. Arbitron
Co., Nielsen's only major rival in local-market TV ratings,
has set a fall start for a much-delayed system it wants to
take nationwide by late next year.
   But any dive into Nielsen's domain may well belly-flop.
"It's anyone's prerogative to come into this market," says
William G. Jacobi, executive vice president of Nielsen Media
Research. "But if they do, we are going to fight them tooth
and nail. This is a business we love, and we're going to
defend it with every resource we have."
   The sometimes sleepy giant is known for aggressive and
shrewd tactics when challenged. Acquired by Dun &amp; Bradstreet
Corp. in 1984, Nielsen has annual sales of more than $600
million. Yet only about $50 million comes from national
television ratings. (About two-thirds of the company's total
revenue is from tracking the sale of packaged goods at retail
stores.) So it is questionable whether the market can support
more than one major player.
   After the networks screamed about the measured drop in
viewing, Nielsen reviewed its procedures and pronounced the
system healthy. Maybe, the company said, the drop was due to
normally sedentary sofa spuds heading outside to enjoy
unusually warm winter weather. But anomalies kept cropping
up.
   In some cases, curiously, the households watching
television held steady with a year ago, yet in specific age
groups the viewing fell sharply. In March, Nielsen noted only
a 2% drop in households watching all channels in prime time,
but women aged 18 to 34 inexplicably had a deeper decline of
8%. In April, late-night viewing fell only 3% in homes, yet
plunged 13% for men under age 35, the Nielsen ratings showed.
   How, the networks demanded, could overall viewing be about
the same yet decline so sharply in specific groups?
   The national numbers, moreover, contradicted Nielsen's own
local-market ratings derived from 200,000 diaries in the
nation's 200 television markets. In February, the local
markets saw no real change in TV viewing from a year before
-- but the national numbers logged a 5% drop.
   In May, according to the local surveys, "NBC Nightly News"
was in second place among the three network newscasts, with
an audience of 9.2 million people. Yet in the national
numbers, NBC was mired in third place, with 1.7 million fewer
viewers.
   Television executives and even some people in the ad
industry have been quick to take note. "There's some
suspicion the numbers are flawed," says Paul Isacsson,
executive vice president at Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. He worries
that they make it look as if ad agencies are paying higher
prices for fewer and fewer viewers.
   If the numbers are flawed, the culprit may be the people
meter, the newfangled device that Nielsen introduced --
reluctantly -- for national ratings in late 1987. Before
then, Nielsen had used diaries. Diaries were a lot cheaper,
but they were prone to error, especially as the number of
channels expanded with the rise of cable in the mid-1980s.
Viewers forgot what they had watched and simply guessed.
   Nielsen had tested the people meter since 1977 without
ever using it. Nielsen might have waited years more before
switching, but for a rare outbreak of competition in 1985.
British upstart AGB had entered the U.S brandishing the
people meter as a major selling point.
   The people meter works like a remote control. Each viewer
presses some buttons when he or she starts or stops watching
TV. When the set is on, a separate meter automatically
records the channel the set is tuned to. But even if the set
is turned on, what matters most is that someone has pressed
buttons showing that there's really a viewer, or several
viewers. Even the youngest tots are expected to use the gizmo
when they tumble out of bed at dawn for Saturday cartoons.
   For adults, too, this is an onerous burden of
button-pushing, especially when a Nielsen home is expected to
do it diligently for up to two years. That may be why almost
half of homes refuse when Nielsen asks them to join its
people meter sample, and why only 47% stay on as members of
the Nielsen system.
   The rate of cooperation may distort the random nature that
the system needs to represent an entire nation's viewing.
Viewers who agree to use the people meter may be
systematically different in their television habits from
those who refuse. "It's an enormous potential source of
bias," says Persi Diaconis, a statistician at the University
of Illinois.
   Nielsen's Mr. Jacobi, however, says getting 47% of homes
to cooperate "is an admirable achievement."
   Nielsen still uses diaries alone in 175 of the 200 TV
markets for local ratings, because people meters would be too
costly to install everywhere. Critics say this might help
explain the difference between the national ratings and
figures derived from local reports.
   For households that agree to use a people meter in the
national sample, "user fatigue" may understate viewing.
Nielsen data show the longer some viewers, particularly
younger ones, have the time-consuming device, the less they
use it.
   Among men aged 18 to 34, for example, newcomers using the
people meter only three months appear to watch 17% more
television than the Nielsen sample overall, a new study by
the firm Statistical Research Inc. finds. At the one-year
point they watch about the same load as the overall sample, a
sign that they may have grown lax in their button-pushing
duties.
   That argument is strengthened by a new phone survey the
firm did of 26,000 homes, says William Rubens, a longtime NBC
ratings executive who now consults to the networks. The
survey indicated that 26% more men aged 18 to 34 and 33% more
kids were watching TV than Nielsen showed for the same
period. "It's an inescapable conclusion," he says, that some
parts of the Nielsen system are a biased representation of
the public's viewing.
   Nielsen's Mr. Dimling says that the phone survey, like any
survey, may have its own problems and adds that the survey
results closely followed Nielsen figures for the broad
category of viewers aged two and above.
   The phone survey also showed 52% more visitors watching
television in other people's homes than Nielsen reported. And
Nielsen appears to understate other "out-of-home" viewing.
Because its people meters are based only in homes,
TV-watching in bars, hotels and other public places isn't
counted. Nor does Nielsen count viewing once a family turns
off the set and heads for a vacation. About 20% of the U.S.
public is on vacation during any given week of the summer
months, and studies find 80% of people on vacation watch TV.
   In addition to griping about Nielsen's numbers, some
customers are growing weary of dealing with a monopoly and
are looking for alternatives, such as AGB's failed effort two
years ago. "The real killer was aborting the competitive
process before it bore fruit," says CBS Inc. senior vice
president David Poltrack, who supported AGB's effort.
   AGB failed in its first attempt partly because it didn't
anticipate the huge investment required and the complexity of
tracking thousands of hours of programs. But counter-moves by
Nielsen hurt too. In October 1985, just as AGB was unveiling
the results of its first test, Nielsen announced its own
people meter plans -- though Nielsen didn't switch to the
contraption for two years. The company dealt another blow by
hiring away AGB's U.S. president, Joseph Philport, months
before the AGB service was to go nationwide.
   Last month, AGB announced plans to re-enter the
U.S.market, saying it had been "invited" by the three
networks. The fight could be nasty -- and petty. Nielsen's
Mr. Jacobi accused AGB of "false pretenses" because, he
notes, no formal invitation had been issued to the company.
   "The attack is really quite ridiculous," says Robert
Maxwell, the Britain-based tabloid publisher and chairman of
Maxwell Communication Corp., who bought AGB 18 months ago. He
calls Mr. Jacobi a "monopolist" and adds: "We are in
discussions with the networks and continue to be."
   Mr. Maxwell says AGB can set up in the U.S. on an
investment of up to $40 million and an annual budget of $30
million. But others say $100 million is a more likely
start-up figure. And so far, only the three networks are
interested in AGB.
   "If AGB is considered the handmaiden of the networks, even
if they're doing things right, the effort will be tainted,"
says consultant Norman Hecht, a former AGB executive.
   It also raises revenue questions. The Big Three now pay
Nielsen only $15 million combined, less than one-third of the
$50 million a year in revenue Nielsen gets for its national
television ratings service. The rest comes from ad agencies,
advertisers and cable channels, which so far aren't
expressing much interest in AGB.
   Nor are Nielsen's customers clamoring, as yet, for a new
service called ScanAmerica, from Arbitron. The service would
track both TV viewing and product purchases by the same
sample of families.
   Arbitron plans to be in 1,000 homes in five major cities
by year-end and have a national sample of 2,000 homes by late
1991. That will take an investment of $125 million, and
Arbitron will lose money on the service well into the
mid-1990s, says Kenneth Wollenberg, executive vice president.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb has signed up, eager to match TV
viewing to product purchases. The Nielsen people "just aren't
moving fast enough for our purposes," says Marianna Reges, a
media manager for Bristol-Myers's in-house advertising.
   Still, many television executives doubt that two ratings
services can survive. "It would be like having two monetary
systems," says John Hunt, a vice president at ad agency
Ogilvy &amp; Mather. If two suppliers turned in different
numbers, it would raise conflicts as to which set was right.
Yet if the numbers were the same, he says, why pay for two
services?
   Marshall Cohen, executive vice president at Viacom Inc.'s
MTV Networks subsidiary, says the networks would abandon a
new rival as soon as Nielsen's numbers got better. They
blamed a loss of audience two years ago on Nielsen's switch
to the people meter; a year later they cited the long strike
by script writers; now it's the people meter again. "Next
year," says Mr. Cohen, "they'll blame it on the bossa nova."
   But the networks say their complaints are legitimate and
that their desire for a new and better service is real. CBS's
Mr. Poltrack says when he first got into the television
business, he couldn't believe billions of dollars were based
on so fragile a system as Nielsen's. "I still can't believe
it," he says. "The whole thing is crazy."

   Of Major Economy Shift

   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, signaled that
no further easing of credit is imminent.
   Mr. Greenspan labored to explain that the Fed eased credit
"slightly" last Friday not because it sees the economy
deteriorating but because it became convinced that the credit
crunch "is beginning to have very real, unwelcome effects."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The distinction is important, Mr. Greenspan said. If the
Fed were "looking at a more profound change . . . in either
economic activity or inflationary pressures," Friday's action
would have been the first of a series of moves, he said. "We
were not looking to fundamentally change the underlying
credit conditions in the country."
   Pressed by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D., Md.), Mr. Greenspan
said that the economic odds are "perhaps a shade more toward
recession than they were earlier in the year," but he
attributed that almost entirely to the reluctance of banks to
make business loans. "We have offset most of that with the
action we have taken," he said.
   Mr. Greenspan didn't slam the door completely on another
move by the Fed if it sees evidence that the credit crunch is
growing worse. He said the Fed "must remain alert to the
possibility that an adjustment . . . might be needed," and he
pledged "continued scrutiny" and "a flexible approach to
policy making."
   He also held out the prospect of additional Fed easing
should Congress and the White House agree to "major,
substantive, credible cuts in the budget deficit" of between
$50 billion and $60 billion for next year. In apparent
response to Bush administration concerns that the Fed might
not move fast enough, Mr. Greenspan said, "We can decide that
a policy adjustment is appropriate and implement it fully,
all in the same morning if need be, and the effects of the
change will show through interest rates . . . almost
immediately."
   The Fed had been holding short-term interest rates steady
for more than six months. And as recently as a month ago, Mr.
Greenspan said that he saw no "broad-based tightening" by
lenders that was harming the national economy. But he changed
his tune last week, telling the Banking Committee Thursday
that the Fed was poised to ease because of "cumulating
evidence" of a credit crunch. Yesterday, he confirmed that
the Fed moved Friday to lower the short-term interest rate it
controls by a quarter of a percentage point, to 8%.
   Mr. Greenspan said it had become apparent "only in recent
days" that Fed action was warranted. He cited surprisingly
slow growth of the money supply as well as surveys and other
indications that banks are tightening lending standards and
increasing the spread between the rates they pay depositors
and those they charge lenders. "If you wait until you get
published numbers, you'll always be acting much too late," he
said.
   The Fed chairman said that for months he had welcomed
growing conservatism among banks and other lenders as a
prudent reaction to the excesses of the 1980s, but now he
fears banks have gone too far. "It is difficult to discern
the dividing line between lending standards that are still
healthy and those that are so restrictive as to be
inconsistent with the borrower's status and the best
interests of the lender in the long run," he said. "In recent
weeks, however, in my judgment, we may have slipped over the
line."
   Not only are banks reluctant to make real estate and
merger-related loans, Mr. Greenspan said, but they are
tightening lending standards for small and medium-sized
companies as well as weaker big companies. "In some cases,
loans have been simply unavailable," he said. Mr. Greenspan,
always precise in his language, said he "wouldn't call this
change technically `a credit crunch'" because it isn't a
"contraction of lending on a major scale." But he conceded
that to borrowers this distinction may be perceived as "a
semantic nicety."
   In its semiannual report to Congress, the Fed said that
forecasts by members of the reserve board and presidents of
district Federal Reserve banks anticipate that the economy
will grow by about 1.5% to 2% between the fourth quarter of
1989 and the fourth quarter of 1990, after adjusting for
inflation. The Fed policy makers now see consumer prices
climbing between 4.5% and 5% in the same period; in February,
their price forecast was between 4% and 4.5%.
   For next year, the Fed policy makers see a pickup in
growth and a slowdown in inflation. They expect the economy
to grow between 1.75% and 2.5% after inflation and expect
consumer prices to climb between 3.75% and 4.5%.
   The Fed expects unemployment, currently at 5.2% of the
work force, to climb to between 5.5% and 5.75% by the end of
this year and to between 5.5% and 6% by the end of next year.
Mr. Greenspan said the jobless rate has remained as low as it
has because of "a surprising decline" in young people,
particularly women, who are working or looking for work. He
said this may be a statistical fluke, but he suggested that
slower-than-anticipated growth in the labor force could be a
constraint on economic growth.
   As part of its long-run objective of reducing the
inflation rate, the Fed also said that its goal is for the M2
measure of the money supply to grow between 2.5% and 6.5%
next year, down a notch from the 3% to 7% range set for 1990,
a range it reaffirmed recently. M2 includes currency,
checking accounts and most savings accounts.
   The target growth range for M3, which includes M2 plus
large certificates of deposit and some other instruments, was
lowered to between 1% and 5% for both 1990 and 1991; in
February, the Fed set this range at 2.5% to 6.5%. Mr.
Greenspan said this revision reflects the consolidation of
the thrift industry rather than a policy change.

present and deferred payments to CFMI and allows the four
regional franchisers to rename their stores and have no other
payment obligations to the national franchiser, CFMI said.
   CFMI, which through its subsidiaries and independent
regional franchisers has about 500 stores operating under the
Convenient Food Mart name, is currently in Chapter 11
reorganization.

   Reports 18% Drop

   NEW YORK -- Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.'s second-quarter profit
fell 18% as results reflected the negative impact of a
controversy surrounding sales practices in the company's
credit services business.
   Analysts said the results were in line with their
expectations and the company's indications. Dun &amp; Bradstreet
has reiterated a forecast of 1990 per-share earnings of about
$2.80, indicating an 11% decline from 1989's $3.14 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the quarter, the company said net income fell to $123
million or 67 cents a share, from $150.4 million or 80 cents
a share a year ago. Revenue climbed 13% to $1.2 billion from
$1.06 billion. However, adjusted for the acquisition last
December of Management Science America, a software concern,
and the divestiture of Thomas Cook Travel USA in April 1989,
revenue rose 7%.
   The business-information concern said the earnings decline
was due in part to "a high single-digit decline" in revenue
at U.S. Credit Services and a sharp rise in costs relating to
the company's repositioning actions at that division.
   Last year, many customers accused Dun &amp; Bradstreet
salespeople of misleading them to buy far more credit
services than they needed. The company has conceded that, in
some cases, customers were abused. In addition, without
admitting any wrongdoing, the company reached an $18 million
agreement to settle five major lawsuits that similarly
alleged customers were deceived into overbuying services. As
part of the settlement, the company agreed to modify its
business practices in several important respects. And the
resulting changes accounted for substantial cost increases in
the credit services business.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet's profit had continued to increase until
the first quarter of this year, when the effects of the
controversy began to be felt.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Dunn &amp; Bradstreet shares closed at $46.125, down 75
cents.

   Market Tumbles as Sell-Off Continues;
   MCI Resumes Slide, Drops 1 7/8 to 36 1/2

   The over-the-counter market tumbled as investors combed
through second-quarter corporate earnings reports looking for
an excuse to sell.
   Skittish investors found reasons to unload stocks of many
companies despite profit reports that at first blush appeared
robust.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications, which came under pressure Tuesday
after competitor United Telecommunications's US Sprint unit
reported a huge loss, fell further yesterday even though its
second-quarter income was at the high end of analysts
expectations. The stock lost 1 7/8 to 36 1/2.
   Intel, which reported strong second-quarter results
Tuesday, came under further selling pressure yesterday,
dropping 2 points to 48 1/2.
   "I've never seen a market go from euphoria to complete
pessimism in such a short amount of time," says Jim
Tarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San
Francisco.
   The selling sent the Nasdaq Composite Index careening 3.66
points for a 0.8%-drop to 460.82. The New York Stock Exchange
didn't fare any better, with the composite index there losing
0.83%
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 791 to 1,107. Volume
eased to 159 million shares from Tuesday's 167.8 million
shares.
   Hambrecht &amp; Quist's Mr. Tarrantino says the profit-taking
has been orderly. But analysts and investors are franticaly
reassessing outlooks for many of the OTC market's largest
companies.
   MCI Communications reported profit of 67 cents a share in
the latest second quarter, up from 56 cents a year ago. That
was at the high end of the range of 64 cents to 68 cents a
share estimated by analysts.
   But MCI's stock fell yesterday on concerns that revenue
growth from the first quarter was not as robust as some
investors had hoped. The second quarter's $1.86 billion in
revenue was up about 3% from the first quarter.
   PaineWebber telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman says
the revenues were about $40 million below what he had hoped
for, adding that many people were looking for 5% growth in
revenue from the first quarter.
   "People are worried about the longterm growth rate," Mr.
Grubman says. He adds that both MCI and US Sprint are losing
market share to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in the
high-margin general business market. Mr. Grubman hasn't
changed his rating on the stock or estimates for the
company's future earnings.
   "The stock market isn't being driven by Wall Street
analysts, but by investors who are beginning to worry about
the revenues," the PaineWebber analyst says.
   Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Rajiv
Chaudhri removed Intel from the firm's "focus list" of stocks
that are attractive on the short-term basis.
   Mr. Chaudhri says this stock remains on Goldman's
"recommended for purchase list" for long-term oriented
investors. But he says the company's microprocessor revenue
is slowing on a quarter-to-quarter basis, while analysts'
earnings estimates continue to rise. That means Intel is less
likely to do much more than meet analysts estimates in the
near future, Mr. Chaudhri says.
   Lotus Development sank 2 7/8 to 31 1/4 despite reporting
that its profit surged to 54 cents a share in the latest
second quarter from 25 cents a year earlier. But the company
told analysts at a meeting later in the day that it thinks
Wall Street's third quarter earnings estimates are too high.
   Apple Computer was a rare winner among the big OTC
technology stocks yesterday. The computer maker's stock rose
3/8 to 44 5/8 in anticipation of its third quarter earnings
report, released after the market closed. Apple reported that
it earned 96 cents a share in the quarter, compared to 74
cents a year earlier. But Apple cautioned that its operating
earnings for the fourth quarter may not match those posted a
year earlier. For the fourth quarter ended Sept. 29, 1989,
Apple reported profit of $161 million, or $1.24 a share,
which included a gain of $8 million, or 37 cents a share,
from the sale of Apple's stake in Adobe Systems.
   Hambrecht &amp; Quist computer analyst Bruce Lupatkin said
Apple "painted a pretty dismal picture" in a conference call
with analysts late yesterday. The company told analysts it is
in a "transitional period" that is likely to continue through
the first half on fiscal 1991, Mr. Lupatkin said.
   Cetus fell 1 1/4 to 17 1/2 on volume of more than 3
million shares. The company has announced that it had
temporarily stopped testing of Proleukin as a potential
hypertension drug, citing difficulty in replicating results
from animal testing. The drug is currently pending approval
by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment
of kidney cancer. An FDA advisory committee panel will hear a
presentation on the drug at the end of July.
   American Ecology rose 2 3/4 to 8 1/4 after it reported
second quarter profit of 57 cents a share, compared with a
loss from continuing operations of 11 cents a share a year
ago. The company's revenue rose to $14.7 million from $9.6
million.

   Lotus Predicts
   Net May Fall
   In 3rd Quarter

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. reported
second-quarter net income more than doubled, as expected, but
shocked analysts by saying third-quarter results may trail
last year's.
   In a meeting with analysts that ended after the close of
stock trading, Lotus said its forecasts are "a little bit
more cautious" than analysts' predictions of 10% to 15% gains
in the third quarter. Robert Schechter, chief financial
officer, said in an interview, "We'll have a relatively tough
time getting to" the year-earlier earnings level.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lotus stock fell $2.875 to $31.25 in over-the-counter
trading before Mr. Schechter made his announcement. Analysts
predicted that the stock will fall further today. Rick
Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., said the
third-quarter prediction "was a big surprise to people in the
room." He added: "I would expect to reiterate my sell
recommendation tomorrow."
   Lotus's results have been strong for the past four
quarters, in the wake of its introduction in June 1989 of
upgraded versions of its best-selling 1-2-3 software program.
However, analysts had cautioned that gains would be smaller
in future quarters.
   Second-quarter net rose to $23.5 million, or 54 cents a
share, from $10.3 million, or 25 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales rose 33% to $175.2 million from $132.2
million.
   Mr. Schechter said that Lotus found the market for
spreadsheet programs is "getting more competitive." Both
industry giant Microsoft Inc. and Borland International Ltd.
have been selling their own spreadsheets vigorously,
competing against Lotus's product.
   Mr. Schechter said that in "our mainstream business, we
don't see significant loss in share." However, he said the
spreadsheet market has expanded, and in new market areas such
as small business, "there has been a little bit of share
loss, but not in a significant way."
   He declined to provide market-share numbers. Most analysts
estimate that Lotus holds between 60% and 70% of the
spreadsheet market.
   Robert Therrien, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. who had
previously predicted that Lotus would see an earnings decline
in the third quarter, said "I'm not panicked," by the
competition. "I think there's a reasonable probability that
Lotus will get an injunction," stopping Borland from selling
its spreadsheet. As reported, Lotus has filed suit against
Borland charging copyright violation.
   Mr. Schechter said that international sales rose 50%,
accounting for 46% of Lotus's business in the quarter.
   Mr. Schecter's caution about the forthcoming quarter
reflects the continued strong competition and his assumption
that Lotus won't see significant revenue from its next
revision of 1-2-3 in the quarter. He also said he expects a
seasonal sales slump in Europe this year, in contrast to last
year, when revenue from upgraded versions offset the normal
summer slowdown.
   Mr. Schecter said that after the third-quarter slump, he
expects fourth-quarter results to show improvement from the
year-earlier figures. However, Mr. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs
said, "It's very questionable whether the fourth quarter will
be up."

   In Leadership Roles

   LOOKING FOR black role models? "SuccessGuide" is to
publish the names and phone numbers of 44,500 black achievers
in seven major markets, including New York, Chicago,
Washington and Atlanta, next January.
   George Fraser, a former Procter &amp; Gamble marketing
manager, launched the directory two years ago with a
5,000-name guide for the Cleveland area. The four-color 1990
Cleveland book includes names of executives, high school
principals, visiting nurses and even caterers.
   Mr. Fraser says his directories answer a need by ambitious
African-Americans for information about other blacks who can
help them succeed. This "intellectual capital," he says, is
the black community's least-developed asset. Black magazines
feature stories about blacks and black-owned businesses, but
SuccessGuide aims "to identify role models not by tens, but
by the thousands," says Mr. Fraser.
   People listed must agree to accept phone calls from
SuccessGuide users. At $10 each, some 12,500 of the 1990
Cleveland books have been sold on newsstands and by direct
marketing to those listed in the directory. Advertising will
account for 70% of the $2.5 million Mr. Fraser expects to
gross this year, he says.
                                                                                                       

   Sneaker Makers Face
   Scrutiny From Push
                                                                                                       

   BLACKS SHOULD shun some sneaker brands if their makers
don't spend more with black businesses, says the Rev. Tyrone
Crider, executive director of Operation Push.
   Representatives of black-owned ad and media firms decided
to press sneaker makers to procure more services from black
companies at a meeting last month at the Chicago headquarters
of Push, an activist group.
   The athletic shoe market is driven by the preferences of
minority youth, but black media received little of the $94
million reportedly spent by the top five brands on ads last
year. Mr. Crider expects Push's board to approve plans to
target a sneaker firm for negotiations at the organization's
convention in Chicago next week. If negotiations fail, a
boycott could be urged, he says.
   Nike Inc., the domestic sales leader, has a good chance of
being that target, he says.
   Nike recently cited its absence from black media in
response to another race-related controversy. The Beaverton,
Ore., company had been under fire for marketing its expensive
sneakers directly to poor black youth. A sportswriter had
sparked widespread interest when he charged that black
teenagers were killing for the sneakers. "We don't market by
race," a spokeswoman says. "We market our product by sport."
   Push has had a low national profile in recent years as
founder Jesse Jackson focused on two presidential bids. In
1980, after a 40-day boycott organized by Push, Coca-Cola Co.
agreed to buy some $30 million in products and services from
black businesses and granted its first black-owned bottling
franchise.
                                                                                                       

   Minority Dealerships
   Hurt in Auto Slump
                                                                                                       

   WHEN DETROIT'S fortunes slide, minority car dealers can be
the hardest hit.
   Slow domestic auto sales are causing a shakeout among
black dealers. At the end of 1989, General Motors Corp. had
104 black-owned franchises, most nurtured by a program to aid
minority dealerships. At the end of June, the company had 90.
Total 1989 sales for the top 10 Hispanic-owned dealerships
ranked by Hispanic Business magazine fell 5% to $764 million.
   Minority dealers tend to be new to the business, with less
of a cushion built up to soften downturns. For example, 57 of
the top 100 dealers ranked by Black Enterprise magazine were
started since 1985. Another problem is that minority dealers
-- with only a tiny share of Big Three dealerships -- have
been nearly shut out of the healthy import-car business.
Import leader Toyota, for example, has only seven black and
seven Latino dealers out of 1,100. A Toyota spokeswoman says
the company is always looking for qualified minority dealers,
but doesn't include race in the selection criteria.
   Gregory Baranco, a multi-franchise dealer in Atlanta and
the nation's only black dealer of Honda's Acura luxury cars,
says that black import-car buyers might think twice about
their purchases if they knew the lack of minority
participation in the market, "but these facts aren't printed
in Consumer Reports."
                                                                                                       

   Solar Energy Powers
   Puerto Rican Quest
                                                                                                       

   PUERTO RICO'S hopes for a place in the high-tech market
are riding on three slim tires this week.
   A solar-powered vehicle built by students from the
University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez is in a race from
Florida to Michigan sponsored by General Motors. The team is
up against 31 other schools in the 10-day "Sunrayce" contest
for solar-powered cars that is to end today.
   "The Shining Star of the Caribbean," as the University of
Puerto Rico car is called, was conceived, designed, built and
promoted by a team of students and faculty members. It is
billed as Puerto Rico's first home-grown high-tech product.
   The car has run near the rear of the pack, but win or
lose, its backers hope to attract attention to Puerto Rico's
technological potential. A new public agency with a mission
to promote the island's high technology ventures pitched in
$300,000 to get the project started a year ago.
   The real goal, says Diego Loinaz, director of the agency,
is to prove to the world that "we `browns' are not less at
all."

   Union Wins
   Ruling Over
   Retirement

   WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court ruled that an
employer can't offer workers early-retirement packages
without the permission of their union.
   The decision, involving the Toledo Blade Co., could pose a
major roadblock for employers seeking to offer lump sums or
other inducements for senior workers to retire early when
those employers can't gain a union's acquiescence in
collective bargaining. Such early-retirement packages have
become commonplace lately.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling also may affect situations in which companies
try to go around unions in dealing with workers on other
matters, as more employers have been trying to do.
   The appeals court here ruled that the Toledo Blade
illegally declared it had the right to "buy out" employees'
lifetime job guarantees after negotiations with Local 63 of
the typographical union had failed in 1982. The dispute
centered on the company's effort to retain in the labor
contract a clause allowing such "direct dealing" with
employees. The court sent the case back to the National Labor
Relations Board, which had ruled in favor of the newspaper
company.
   Writing for the basically conservative three-judge panel,
Judge Douglas Ginsburg said the Blade's position is
"fundamentally inconsistent" with the system of collective
bargaining established by the National Labor Relations Act.
By negotiating directly with employees to try to buy out job
guarantees at the lowest cost, "the Employer could
effectively put the employees into competition with each
other to sell out at the lowest price," Judge Ginsburg said.
   This "not only displaces the union from its
representational role, it also gives the Employer the
opportunity to destroy the cohesiveness of the Union's
membership," Judge Ginsburg said.
   Elliott Bredhoff, a union-oriented labor lawyer, called
the decision "a rather strong reaffirmation of the importance
of the unions' role in collective bargaining," with a
conservative panel disagreeing with the NLRB over "one of the
most fundamental rights" spelled out in the labor act.
   The court said that a similar NLRB case is pending before
the U.S. appeals court in Denver. In that case, the board had
ruled that Colorado-Ute Electric Association, an electrical
cooperative, lawfully bargained to an impasse with the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers over the
co-op's right to offer merit raises directly to employees.
The NLRB also ruled, however, that the employer illegally
tried to put the plan into effect without negotiating with
the IBEW over the amount and timing of the merit raises.
   Still other cases involving employer attempts to
circumvent a union after reaching an impasse, such as one
involving subcontracting, are pending before the board. In
light of the court ruling, "we're going to have to reconsider
how we treat all these types of cases," said Jerry Hunter,
the NLRB's general counsel.
   Under the law, when employers and unions bargain to an
impasse over contract matters such as wages, benefits and
working rules, the employer may then seek to put its contract
offer into effect and the union may strike. But in the
appeals court's view, the employer's insistence on dealing
directly with workers over retirement changes isn't such an
issue. The employer must gain union permission before taking
such action, the court said.
   In 1976 and 1979, the Blade's union had agreed that the
newspaper could negotiate directly with individual employees
over the buy-out of the job guarantees that it, like many
newspaper publishers, had previously given as the price of
introducing labor-saving technology. But in 1982, the parties
reached an impasse over inclusion of that same clause in a
new contract.
   The union charged the Blade with refusing to bargain in
good faith. The NLRB dismissed the complaint, holding that
the employer could bargain to an impasse and then have the
right to continue dealing directly with employees in making
early-retirement offers.

   IBM to Join Ranks of Firms Developing
   Computers That Recognize Handwriting

   International Business Machines Corp. gave a boost to the
fledgling market for computers that recognize handwriting,
announcing it plans to build electronic pads that will allow
mobile workers uncomfortable with conventional computers to
take handwritten notes.
   Big Blue said that rather than develop the basic software
for such note-pad computers itself, it will rely on a tiny
California company to supply it. The company, Go Corp., is
attempting to establish its basic software as the standard
for electronic note pads, which are expected by some
observers to make up a major part of the computer industry by
the mid-1990s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   IBM's decision to rely on Go marks a departure for the
world's biggest computer maker. For the past decade, Big Blue
has relied almost entirely on Microsoft Corp. to supply it
with the basic operating software for its families of
personal computers.
   "I don't think this diminishes the role of Microsoft,"
said Richard Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter.
"It just makes good business sense. IBM can't possibly want
all of its computing future in the hands of one company."
   Microsoft is developing its own software to take advantage
of handwriting recognition, but IBM says it won't use such
software for its electronic note pads because Microsoft aims
to keep the software compatible with DOS, the standard
operating system for many personal computers.
   M.J. Quinlan, the IBM executive who crafted the licensing
deal with Go, said he didn't think note-pad computers would
reach their intended market of computer novices "by just
extending existing software environments such as DOS." He
said that handwriting devices required new operating software
and that DOS wasn't acceptable because it was designed to be
used with a keyboard.
   Microsoft disagrees. "There's nothing about DOS that says
it can't support {handwriting} input," said Jeff Raikes, who
oversees the company's note-pad software project. Mr. Raikes
added that he felt that in licensing Go's software "IBM is
simply doing what they have always done -- investing in many
different technologies." He said that such investments don't
always result in IBM products and that he still believed Big
Blue might embrace Microsoft's approach to the note-pad
field.
   IBM's endorsement figures to help Go in its efforts to
persuade other computer makers to adopt its handwriting
software. "IBM is the best possible strategic partner from
those purposes," Mr. Shaffer said.
   Jerry Kaplan, Go's chief executive, said the company
hasn't signed any other licensing deals yet, but that it is
in negotiations to do so with several other companies.
   Not everyone is persuaded that a new operating software is
needed for note-pad computers. Tandy Corp.'s Grid Systems
Corp. subsidiary, which is the only U.S. company currently
selling note-pad computers, relies on DOS for its basic
software. "Right now, that's an easier way to go, for the
vendor and the customer, because both are familiar with DOS,"
said Alan Lefkof, president of Grid.
   However, Mr. Lefkof conceded that "maybe the Go and IBM
{approach}, once we all see it, will be fabulous. Then we
might license it."
   Mr. Quinlan wouldn't say when IBM plans to introduce its
first note-pad computers, but said that a team devoted to the
product had been created in the company's Boca Raton, Fla.,
facility and that major customers were working with IBM on
figuring out just how these new devices might best be used.
   The technology underlying note-pad computers has been
under development for years, and even today the means of
recognizing handwriting is primitive. Grid's note pad, for
instance, only recognizes neatly printed capital letters,
forcing users to write in an unnatural fashion. Still, the
company said it shipped 1,000 units last month.
   IBM's interest in the market seems likely to heighten
interest in it. Apple Computer Inc. and several start-up
companies are considering entering the market, and at least
two Japanese companies are selling such devices in Japan.

   NEW YORK -- Philip Morris Cos. reported second-quarter net
income rose 27%, powered by strong gains in operating profit
in its big tobacco and food divisions.
   The consumer products concern said net increased to $948
million, or $1.03 a share, from $745 million, or 80 cents a
share, a year earlier. Operating revenue grew 12% to $12.74
billion from $11.42 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said earnings were even stronger than expected,
noting Philip Morris was particularly strong in its
international tobacco and big U.S. and international food
divisions.
   The company, which recently announced plans to acquire 80%
of Swiss coffee and chocolate maker Jacobs Suchard AG for
$3.8 billion, doesn't break out results by division. But
Hamish Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer, said in
a statement "cigarette unit volume, including exports,
increased strongly" for the quarter and the half. He said
unit sales of cigarettes in the U.S. edged up slightly during
the quarter and the half. That gain came despite declining
consumption of cigarettes in the U.S. Mr. Maxwell also cited
gains at the major food divisions.
   Overall, operating profit before amortization of good
will, unallocated corporate expenses and interest, and other
debt expense increased 19% to $2.28 billion from $1.91
billion.
   Analysts' estimates in operating profit growth by division
varied. Several of them put growth in operating profit for
the international cigarette business at 25% to 30%. In the
U.S. cigarette business, where Philip Morris is No. 1 in
revenue, analysts estimated operating profit grew between 12%
and 13% in the quarter. They noted the growth came despite an
about 20% increase in the company's marketing expenses in
that segment.
   The company's big food divisions -- it is the nation's
largest food company in terms of revenue -- particularly
General Foods USA and Kraft USA, and the Kraft General Foods
International business also performed well. Becky Barfield,
an analyst at First Boston Corp., estimated a more than 25%
growth in operating profit for Kraft USA, helped by cheese
prices, and about a 25% growth in operating profit at General
Foods USA, helped by the swing in coffee profit. She said the
Miller Brewing subsidiary also did well.
   Marc I. Cohen, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.,
estimated operating profit at Kraft General Foods
International grew about 50%.
   Analysts also noted the company had one-time expenses
related to its planned move of about 500 of its 1,700
Manhattan employees to Rye Brook in Westchester County.
   In the first half, earnings rose 29% to $1.72 billion, or
$1.86 a share, from $1.34 billion, or $1.44 a share, a year
ago. Operating revenue increased 9.5% to $24.1 billion from
$22 billion.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Philip Morris closed at $50.125, down 37.5 cents.

   China Stings Banks
   On State Concerns'
   Loan Guarantees

   HONG KONG -- Confronted with rising claims by foreign
banks, the Chinese government is dragging its feet in
honoring loan guarantees issued by troubled state
enterprises.
   Many state-owned concerns, squeezed for cash by an
austerity program implemented in late 1988, have defaulted on
their loan guarantees. Foreign banks stung by the defaults
have aired their grievances with the guarantors' parent
organizations at the provincial and central government
levels. But no one is willing to accept responsibility for
the bad debts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some Chinese officials say the guarantees are invalid,
having been issued without central government approval.
Others wash their hands of the matter, saying that under
revisions of recent years, Chinese enterprises are
responsible for their own profits and losses. Those few who
acknowledge that the government is obliged to repay bad loans
say the money should come from anywhere but their own agency.
   More generally, as the number of disputes between foreign
banks and Chinese agencies grows, China's international
financial standing is being affected.
   "Every bank world-wide is watching to see if Beijing will
assume eventual responsibility for these loan defaults," a
foreign banker with exposure to several China loan defaults
says. "We would go from the city government to the provincial
government and all the way to {Premier} Li Peng's office. If
the premier says it's not his problem, fine: Lending to China
would be an entirely new ball game."
   Because most China loan agreements specify the application
of Hong Kong law, an increasing number of foreign banks are
seeking repayment from their Chinese guarantors through the
British colony's courts. To their chagrin, many bankers have
found that Hong Kong court decisions are practically
unenforceable in China.
   "When the first loan documents were written, nobody
actually knew what went into a dispute," says Michael Moser,
a U.S. lawyer who specializes in China. And a Japanese banker
says, "Everybody was running a high fever" in the early
1980s, when most of the loans that now are problems were
signed.
   Of China's total foreign debt of $41.3 billion at the end
of 1989, $5 billion was covered by government guarantees, and
an additional $1.3 billion was guaranteed by foreign-invested
joint ventures. The People's Bank of China, the central bank,
recently released the debt breakdown to the World Bank to
dispel rumors about the country's financial health, says a
foreign banker with access to the data.
   But bankers say government-guaranteed obligations far
exceed $5 billion, because many guarantees were issued in the
early 1980s, before regulations went into effect that
required registration of loan guarantees with the central
government.
   The repayment records of central government institutions,
such as Bank of China and China International Trust &amp;
Investment Corp., remain impeccable, as are those of many
local guarantors, such as the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone
Development Corp., which paid promptly when called upon by a
bank syndicate led by Lloyds Bank PLC of Britain.
Furthermore, a sharp drop in imports has bolstered China's
foreign-exchange reserves, increasing government agencies'
ability to service their debts.
   But all of this brings little comfort to the foreign
creditors of Guangdong Overseas Chinese Enterprises Co., for
example. The large land-owning concern failed to honor its
multimillion-dollar guarantees when called upon by Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corp., Standard Chartered Bank PLC, First
National Bank of Chicago and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
   In the early 1980s, Guangdong Overseas was among foreign
banks' most favored customers. It came under the powerful
Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, which has ministerial
ranking and substantial foreign-exchange revenue from its
China Travel Services unit.
   Such factors are crucial in China, where conventional
methods for assessing creditworthiness don't apply: Many
foreign banks lent to projects and enterprises on the
strength of their guarantors, which were graded in accordance
with their political leverage. For example, if the parent of
a guarantor could be traced to the State Council, the loan
was considered nearly as safe as sovereign debt.
   "To a certain degree, our lending hinged on the degree of
central and provincial support on the project," says a
creditor whose bank lent to projects guaranteed by Guangdong
Overseas. When several of the projects flopped, the bank
called upon Guangdong Overseas, which said it hadn't any
money to honor its guarantees. The bank then turned to the
guarantor's Beijing parent, only to discover that Guangdong
Overseas had undergone a restructuring that severed its ties
to the central government and placed it under the Guangdong
Agricultural Commission.

   Chile Phone Firm, First Latin America Stock
   On the Big Board, Is Facing Strong Demand

   NEW YORK -- If anything proves that political borders no
longer inhibit the flow of capital, it is that shares of
Chile's biggest telephone company are expected to begin
trading tomorrow on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Compania de Telefonos de Chile's offering of 110 million
shares, underwritten by Salomon Brothers, is said to be
oversubscribed. It will be the first Latin American stock to
be listed on an American exchange since 1963 and the first on
the Big Board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pitch, in a word, is growth. And CTC's stock, expected
to be priced at 17 shares for about $15 on the Big Board, is
being offered at under six times earnings and at a yield
after Chilean taxes of 8%.
   CTC's roughly $100 million offering will increase its
float by 15%. Its shares now trade on the Santiago Stock
Exchange, which was founded in 1893 and is open every
business day for two 45-minute sessions.
   The Santiago exchange is small and illiquid -- its total
market capitalization is one-sixth of IBM's -- but CTC is a
bet not on Chile's stock exchange but on the country itself.
   Chile has what is probably Latin America's healthiest and
decidedly most free market-oriented economy. Its gross
domestic product grew last year by 10%; its trade balance in
1988 was positive by $2 billion; and its 13 million people
are, by Latin American standards, urbane and educated.
However, inflation is about 21%.
   The sentiment of foreigners doing business in Chile, as
expressed by John Duncan, chairman of Englewood, Colo.-based
Cyprus Minerals, is that Chile "is unique in Latin America.
It's taking off."
   CTC's basic business, which accounted for half of its $290
million in 1989 revenue, is providing regulated local
telephone service. It also sells some of Chile's
long-distance service and is expanding in public telephones,
private telephone systems and equipment, and cellular service
in the country's two major cities, Santiago and Valparaiso.
   But though telephone service has recently grown, it lags
behind demand and badly. Chile has six telephone lines for
each 100 people. Argentina has 10 for each 100; the U.S. has
52.
   The waiting period to get a telephone in Chile is roughly
a year. And 293,000 applications for service are pending,
equal to one-third of the total lines installed. This
situation is, the company believes, an opportunity for
growth. And, brokers emphasize to investors,
inflation-adjusted growth.
   Telephone tariffs are set by a government model to provide
a 12% real rate of return, and prices are adjusted for
inflation. And if CTC outperforms the model, it is free to
pocket the difference.
   CTC's backlog owes, in part, to a collection of uninspired
or underfinanced previous owners. Its former controlling
managers or shareholders include ITT; Chile's former elected
Marxist government; Chile's former unelected military
government; and Alan Bond, the Australian investor, art
collector and debtor.
   Bond Corp. International acquired a half-share in CTC when
it was privatized in 1988. Earlier this year, with Mr. Bond's
empire teetering, it sold its stake in CTC to Spanish-based
Telefonica de Espana for $391 million.
   Telefonica's first moves were to slow down CTC's
development plan and to cut dividends to 80% of net income
from 100%. It did this, according to the prospectus, because
CTC had "identified various potential obstacles . . .
including possible lack of outside contractors, possible
delays or shortfalls in financing, delays in equipment
supplies and potential limitations of skilled labor."
   However, the revised plan is hardly timid. CTC plans to
put one million new lines in service by 1996 and to double
the number of telephones per capita.
   Just through the end of 1992, it will need to spend about
$1 billion. This is, for CTC, a big number. Net income last
year was roughly $130 million, and most of its earnings, at
least for the moment, are being eaten up by dividends.
   Thus, growth will largely be financed from borrowings. Net
income is unlikely to rise much, if at all, in the next few
years because of rising interest costs and depreciation.
   CTC's debt is a tolerable 42% of capitalization. However,
covenants in pending loans restrict CTC from taking on too
much debt. If its development program runs into snags, it
could be forced to curtail borrowings and growth. "Financing
or other obstacles could result in a reduction of dividends,"
CTC says.
   Maria Elena Carrion, an analyst at U.S. Trust of New York,
says CTC has "two big negatives: no earnings growth for the
next three years and large capital expenses for years to
come." And Chile's recent transition to democracy brings, in
some analysts' minds, a prospect of higher inflation. Though
CTC's tariffs rise with inflation, Andrew Economos, a
portfolio manager at Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, worries that
"inflation-indexation is one of the first things to go" in an
economic crisis.
   Chile, though, doesn't seem headed for crisis. While the
current round of democratic government is new, free-market
economics aren't. The question, most likely, isn't whether
CTC will grow, but how fast?

   Money-Fund Assets
   Rose $3.2 Billion
   In the Latest Week

   Investors poured another $3.2 billion into money-market
mutual funds in the latest week, as yields remained nearly
unchanged.
   Assets of 430 taxable funds totaled $382.4 billion at the
close of business Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money
Fund Report. The average seven-day compound yield, which
assumes reinvestment of dividends, remained at 7.95%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Martha Wittbrodt, editor of the Holliston, Mass.-based
newsletter, predicted that yields will begin to slide in the
next few weeks, reflecting the Federal Reserve's recent
easing of interest rates. She said money-fund yields could
decline a tenth of a percentage point or so over the next
three to four weeks.
   Average yields on taxable funds have been at or just below
8% for most of this year.
   Most of the new money added to the funds in the week ended
Tuesday -- about $2.5 billion -- came from institutions,
Donoghue's reported. Ms. Wittbrodt said institutions that
took money out of the funds several weeks ago, when yields on
competing investments were slightly higher, may be putting it
back in now that those yields are falling. Yields on
three-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for
instance, were 7.88%, compared with 8.05% in late June.
   Money-fund yields typically lag behind general
interest-rate trends by a few weeks because portfolio
managers can vary the maturities of their investments to take
advantage of the best yields. The managers typically lengthen
maturities when rates are falling and shorten them when rates
are rising.
   Average maturity of the taxable funds grew by one day in
the week ended Tuesday, to 44 days. That's within the range
of the last few months; average maturity has been as short as
29 days and as long as 53 days in recent years. Money funds
invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.66% from 7.67%. The average 30-day simple yield
also eased to 7.66% from 7.67% and the average 30-day
compound yield dipped to 7.95% from 7.97%.
   Yields on tax-exempt funds fell faster. The average
seven-day compound yield of 224 tax-free funds fell to 5.23%
from 5.30%, Donoghue's reported. The latest yield is
equivalent to a taxable yield of 7.26% for an investor in the
28% tax bracket and 7.81% for someone paying 33% in taxes.
   Assets of the tax-exempt funds remained flat at $78.9
billion. Average maturity lengthened by two days to 51 days.

   Apple Computer Inc., continuing to post healthy financial
results despite concerns that it has a weak mix of products,
reported a 25% rise in profit for its third fiscal quarter
ended June 19.
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said net income rose to
$119.8 million from $96.1 million the year earlier. Per-share
net rose 30% to 96 cents from 74 cents a year earlier on a
greater number of shares outstanding. Revenue grew 9.3% to
$1.36 billion from $1.25 billion the year before.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, Apple warned that results for its current quarter
may not equal those of a year ago because of high spending on
products being developed.
   In the fall, the company is expected to revamp the low end
of its Macintosh computer line with at least two new models
that sport lower prices and higher performance than current
ones. Analysts fear that Apple's demand may soften somewhat
as the introduction of these products, tentatively set for
October, nears.
   The third-quarter results, released after the market
closed yesterday, were generally in line with expectations.
In a statement, John Sculley, Apple's chief executive
officer, attributed the results to strong demand for its
higher-end Macintosh computers and to price cuts that have
spurred demand for low-end Macintoshes.

   Is Warburg Pincus's Magic Waning?

   Investor Pins Hope
   On Turnarounds

   NEW YORK -- Warburg Pincus &amp; Co. is a classic Wall Street
"smart money" investor.
   From 1971 to 1978, Warburg Pincus and its affiliated
partnerships invested $15 million in Waste Management Co.; it
cashed out in 1981 for $66 million. The low-profile
partnership scored another coup in 1983, when it led a group
that bought 45% of troubled toy-maker Mattel Inc. Since then,
Warburg Pincus has quadrupled its money in Mattel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They're brilliant," says John Myers, an executive vice
president at General Electric Co.'s pension fund, which
invests with Warburg Pincus. Adds another investor, William
Snow, treasurer of Johns Hopkins University: "They pick good
companies, and they get very involved in management."
   The only trouble is, Warburg Pincus's knack for smart
investments may be waning. The firm still boasts an
extraordinary long-term record: profits that average 25% a
year since 1971. For most of the 1980s, though, its gains
have slipped to about 18 1/2% a year after fees -- only
slightly ahead of the stock market's performance, investors
say.
   Currently, Warburg Pincus is mired in a losing position in
Community Newspapers Inc., a joint investment that it made
with newspaper publisher Ralph Ingersoll in 1987. Last year
-- when stock market averages jumped 31% -- Warburg Pincus's
$1.1 billion 1986 fund posted only a 10% gain. Concedes
Chairman Lionel Pincus: "It wasn't a great year for us."
   All the same, money has poured in from backers such as the
pension funds of GE, General Motors Corp. and Pacific Telesis
Group. Headed by the 59-year-old Mr. Pincus and Vice Chairman
John Vogelstein, 56, Warburg Pincus invests $3 billion of
institutional money.
   Mr. Pincus "is one of the most effective money raisers I
ever saw," says Stanley Pratt, a general partner in Abbott
Capital Management. Mr. Pratt adds that Mr. Vogelstein, a
former partner at the investment bank Lazard Freres &amp; Co.,
"is very bright -- the Mr. Inside of the outfit."
   This spring, Warburg Pincus raised $1.78 billion, the New
York firm's biggest investment fund ever. That money, says
Mr. Pincus, will be used for "venture banking," an eclectic
mix of venture capital, turnaround investments in troubled
companies and minority stakes in companies that Warburg
Pincus partners think are cheaply valued.
   Just how well Warburg Pincus performs depends in part on
several big turnaround bets made between 1987 and 1989. The
biggest, at more than $190 million, is a battery of newspaper
investments that Warburg Pincus jointly made with Mr.
Ingersoll. This spring, Warburg Pincus bought out Mr.
Ingersoll's financially troubled U.S. interests in a swap for
Warburg Pincus's holdings in a few European newspapers.
   Mr. Pincus, though known as affable and easy-going to
outsiders, negotiated a tough deal with Mr. Ingersoll.
Although both parties insist that the negotiations produced
an even swap, Warburg Pincus ended up with U.S. publications
that at year-end 1989, at least, had a significantly larger
equity value than the European operations.
   Mr. Pincus asserts that the one-time Ingersoll newspapers
"will turn out to be a profitable investment" for Warburg
Pincus. That may be news to bondholders of Community
Newspapers Inc., one part of the former Ingersoll empire.
Community Newspapers failed to make an interest payment due
July 1 on its 13% bonds, which currently trade at about 64
cents on the dollar.
   In coming weeks, Mr. Pincus and his partners must
negotiate a repayment plan for bondholders. That probably
will involve putting in more equity to ward off the risk of
having the company thrown into bankruptcy proceedings.
   "We do have a loss in Community Newspapers," Mr. Pincus
says. But he expects to make that up in other parts of the
Ingersoll U.S. newspaper empire, notably Ingersoll Newspapers
Inc., which publishes suburban newspapers around St. Louis
and other U.S. cities. New management under Warburg Pincus
has indicated a willingness to cut costs and sell off assets;
Mr. Ingersoll had by his own admission taken "higher risks,"
such as starting the defunct St. Louis Sun. That left Warburg
Pincus "uncomfortable," Mr. Ingersoll had told an
interviewer.
   Another of Warburg Pincus's big turnaround bets, a $150
million investment in Mellon Bank, is about at break-even.
Here, too, Mr. Pincus and his partners had negotiated fine
terms for the initial investment in the then-slumping
Pittsburgh bank. They bought convertible preferred stock in
1988 that some analysts suggested was priced at 20% or more
below market value. (Mellon has disputed that valuation.)
   Mr. Pincus is convinced that Mellon's management team can
sort its way through problem real-estate loans and boost
profitability. Mellon Bank's stock has traded in the area of
$25 a share ever since Warburg Pincus bought in, but that
doesn't trouble Mr. Pincus. "We're patient longterm
investors," he says. "The banking system is a mess. That's
what makes it interesting."
   Other major holdings by Warburg Pincus, such as 47% of
personal-computer retailer ComputerLand Inc. and 29% of Magma
Copper Co., have been on the books too briefly to warrant
revaluation.
   Warburg Pincus also has a wide scattering of investments
in the $2 million to $5 million range in fledgling companies.
Their carrying value on Warburg Pincus's books won't be
adjusted for years, until the companies go public. But an
executive familiar with Warburg Pincus's portfolio says that
three or four of these companies may go public this year,
producing as much as fourfold profits for Warburg Pincus.
   However, one big source of investment opportunities for
Warburg Pincus, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., is gone for
good. In the 1980s, Warburg Pincus used junk bonds
underwritten by Drexel to help finance some of its
investments; it also teamed up with loyal Drexel clients such
as Mr. Ingersoll. Drexel "charged a great deal of money, but
they delivered," Mr. Pincus says. "It was a very good and
professional relationship."
   Near-term, Mr. Pincus isn't certain where his firm's next
deals will come from. Stocks seem overpriced, he says. He is
inclined to wait a bit to see if prices come down. "If you
buy high," he says, "you've got a lot more work to do to make
a profit."

   Ashton-Tate Corp. reported a larger-than-expected net loss
for its second quarter, a further sign that the company's
position in the database software market is slipping.
   Ashton-Tate posted a net loss of $12.6 million, or 47
cents a share, for the quarter. Net revenue declined 19% to
$48.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Torrance, Calif., company's fortunes have been hurt by
a long delay in the release of a new database product and
failed effort at diversifying into other software markets.
   "It was expected to be a bad quarter, but this was worse
than expected," said David Bayer, an analyst at Montgomery
Securities, who had anticipated that Ashton-Tate would have a
loss of only $500,000 for the quarter.
   Mr. Bayer said the company's sales fell in the quarter
because customers anticipate that Ashton-Tate will shortly
introduce a revamped version of dBASE 4, its flagship
product. The company declined to comment on the introduction
date.

   Sony Unit Reportedly Offers
   Deal Worth $6 Million
   To Husband-Wife Team

   NEW YORK -- In a deal that could trigger the latest round
of inflation in the movie business, Sony Corp.'s Columbia
Pictures Entertainment Inc. unit has reportedly agreed to pay
$6 million for the services of the team of star director
Richard Donner and his wife, producer Lauren Shuler Donner.
   According to executives familiar with the transaction,
Columbia offered Mr. Donner $5 million to direct the movie
"Radio Flyer," and an additional $1 million producer fee for
Mrs. Shuler Donner. As reported, Columbia last month halted
production on the movie and fired the previous director, just
a few weeks into production.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Columbia spokesman declined comment. Mr. Donner, through
an assistant, would say only that he is working on "The Last
Boy Scout," a movie for producer David Geffen and Warner
Bros., a unit of Time Warner Inc. People close to Mr. Donner
said he is trying to juggle both projects and hasn't formally
signed his agreement with Columbia.
   Executives at rival studios said "Radio Flyer," which
started out as a modestly budgeted movie, is likely to become
considerably pricier if Mr. Donner, as expected, begins
making changes in the screenplay and cast. Because production
was shut down, they note, Columbia must effectively start
from scratch.
   Although most of the industry inflation had been in movie
star salaries until recently, the price tags for directors,
writers and producers have been ratcheting upward lately,
too, despite mounting concern in the movie business that
costs are out of control. Screenplays that went for $300,000
last year are fetching $1 million.
   But industry executives say Mr. Donner's fee appears to
set a new high for a director, though some directors get
higher fees if they also produce and write. Recently, "Die
Hard 2" director Renny Harlin made news when Carolco Pictures
Inc. agreed to pay him $3 million for his next directing job.
   Mr. Donner, whose company has headquarters at Warner, has
a number of projects in the works for that studio, in
addition to "The Last Boy Scout." Warner executives said they
didn't expect that or any other current projects to be
directly affected by Mr. Donner's move.
   Mrs. Shuler Donner has been involved in producing the
films "Ladyhawke" "St. Elmo's Fire," "Mr. Mom" and "Three
Fugitives."
   "Radio Flyer" is the story of two young brothers who
escape into their fantasy worlds to cope with a harsh life
and abuse by their stepfather. Among its cast are Rosanna
Arquette and Joe Mantegna.

   `Dark Shadows' and a Cat
   That Makes Slam-Dunks
   Inspire Many Admirers

   NEW YORK -- Here in a downtown Manhattan hotel ballroom in
midsummer the fans of television's "Dark Shadows" stand out.
They're the people with the winter-pale faces of TV's true
and faithful followers. Some 1,500 strong, they have come
from 35 states for a weekend of reruns and reminiscence.
   Show-biz promotional hype can't buy loyalty like this.
"Dark Shadows," a Gothic afternoon soap opera featuring
vampires and time travel, went off network TV in 1971. It
reappeared sporadically in syndication and is now available
only on videotape. For its ardent fans, nothing on TV before
or since can rival it. "It's all we watch at night," says
Marianne Johanson, of New Jersey. She and her husband Carl,
an engineer, own cassettes of 100 of the 1,225 "Dark Shadows"
episodes extant on tape and are adding to their collection.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Dark Shadows" fans belong to a relatively new kind of fan
club, devoted to a TV series rather than a single performer.
Another in this genre is the 7,000-member Andy Griffith Show
Appreciation Society.
   Griffith Society President John Meroney, a 20-year-old
student at Wake Forest University, says he "cannot ever
remember not watching the program," which aired on CBS during
the 1960s and is now in syndication. Mr. Meroney, who claims
to have seen each of the 249 episodes 30 or 40 times, says
the show's small-town setting and homespun values give it a
"never-never-land quality. It represents Camelot . . . a
`Brigadoon.'"
   The Griffith Society's bimonthly newsletter rails against
the excision of precious seconds from beloved episodes to
squeeze in more commercials. It also has covered the
continuing saga of member Bill Flynn and his prickly
relationship with North Carolina law enforcement. Police take
a dim view of his attempts to tool around town in a replica
of the 1963 Ford Galaxie squad car featured on the series.
Nor do they approve of his sheriff's uniform -- a copy of a
costume Andy Griffith wore.
   Fan clubs are ephemeral; they come and they go. Some 350
currently are registered with the National Association of Fan
Clubs, whose president is Blanche Trinajstick of Pueblo,
Colo. The association has tried to improve the image of fan
clubs, which Mrs. Trinajstick says "was so bad for so long."
The "groupie factor" has unfairly stigmatized fan clubs and
alienated celebrities, she says.
   No one who has flirted even fleetingly with fame can be
sure of avoiding canonization by a fan club. There is even a
club dedicated to Lawrence Welk's "Champagne Lady," Norma
Zimmer. Princess Kitty has a fan club, too.
   She is a brown and white cat in Miami who played Ernest
Hemingway's cat in a TV miniseries and has made personal
appearances in hospitals and charity shows. She can play
"Three Blind Mice" on the piano and slam-dunk a small
basketball. Club President Moura Wrinkle, who works in
pest-control research, says most of Princess Kitty's 70 other
card-carrying fans are children. But she, too, is smitten:
"As many shows as I've seen, I'm still in awe," she says.
   In contrast to most of the entertainment world,
country-music stars, many of whom profess the common touch,
are often chummy with their fans. "You can't hire people to
do the kind of PR fans will do for free," says Loudilla
Johnson, who with her sisters, Loretta and Kay, founded the
Loretta Lynn Fan Club in 1963. "If you want to be reclusive,
fine, go home and close the door. Country-music stars know
they won't make it if that's their attitude."
   The Johnson sisters, who live on a 2,500-acre farm in Wild
Horse, Colo., met Loretta Lynn in 1960, when she was still an
unknown crisscrossing the heartland by car to plug her
records at radio stations. The singer encouraged them to form
a fan club, which has since grown to 5,000 members. The
sisters publish a quarterly newsletter, always containing a
chatty letter from Loretta, her performance schedule, fan
queries ("Can Loretta take a tease?" "What kind of shampoo
does she use?") and merchandise offerings such as Loretta
Lynn sweatpants and coffee mugs.
   Yet for all the frenetic activity of these groups, their
influence on entertainment careers has become marginal.
   There are some notable exceptions. In 1983, fan-club
pressure rescued the TV series "Cagney &amp; Lacey" after it was
canceled by CBS. The hoards of "Star Trek" followers had
clout too. And singers Barry Manilow, Engelbert Humperdinck
and Tom Jones were helped in their blockbuster careers by
knowing how to court their fans, who network through scores
of local chapters bearing names like "Tom's Vegas Luvs,"
"Manilovers Anonymous" and "Hump's Happy Hoosiers."
   For the most part, however, ratings and box-office grosses
speak far more eloquently to entertainment decision makers.
The days are long past when movie studios instigated fan
clubs and ordered contract-bound stars to cooperate with
them. Many entertainers have come to view their most
obsessive fans as nuisances or worse.
   Show-business ambivalence toward fans has failed to
discourage them. In kitchens and basements across the land,
their printers and copying machines spew out news of the
stars' comings and goings in exhaustive detail. However
unrequited, it is a labor of love -- a love that is sometimes
volatile.
   Last year, a deranged fan killed actress Rebecca
Schaeffer. Recent targets of harassment by fans have included
Vanna White, Teri Garr, Michael J. Fox and Sharon Gless.
"Idolizing heros is normal," says Gavin de Becker, a security
consultant to many Hollywood entertainers who has researched
fan behavior in the media age. "But what is usually a mild
drug is a poison for some people."
   Television's intrusion into living rooms and bedrooms
distorts the ordinary barrier between performer and audience,
Mr. de Becker theorizes. A false intimacy develops, in which,
he says, "we believe we really know Johnny Carson -- who in
fact we don't know." Disturbed people who have difficulty
distinguishing between fact and fantasy are especially
vulnerable to the illusion, he adds.
   Fans have tender sensibilities. At the "Dark Shadows"
festival, a vendor and disillusioned fan is miffed that
series star Jonathan Frid, who played the vampire Barnabas
Collins, will make only a brief appearance. "It's
disgraceful," she says. "These fans can recite every episode
verbatim -- this is their life. To see them mistreated I find
upsetting." Festival officials say the actor had a
conflicting out-of-town performance commitment.
   Once upon a time, stars enjoyed a simpler relationship
with their fans. Leatrice Gilbert Fountain, daughter of two
early movie stars, screen idol John Gilbert and actress
Leatrice Joy, recollects the adulation as she sips a cup of
coffee in her Greenwich, Conn., home. Her father, an
on-screen and off-screen lover of Greta Garbo, always wrote
"Gratefully yours" with his autograph. She says her mother
employed a team of secretaries who wrote handwritten replies
to the thousands of fan letters she got each week. One fan
became a lifelong friend.
   Miss Joy even bestowed tiny golden medals on infant girls
who were named after her. The medals were inscribed, "To
Leatrice Joy from Leatrice Joy."
   Mrs. Fountain, co-author of a biography of her father,
stays in touch with the 85-member Friends of Jack Gilbert fan
club, revived in 1986 by Alice D. Johnson, a 77-year-old
Philadelphian. Says Ms. Johnson of the actor: "I've loved him
all my life."

   Holding Firm Posts Loss
   Of $80 Million in Quarter

   Washington Bancorp., reporting a second-quarter loss of
$80 million, or $11.28 a share, said its ability to continue
operating is in doubt unless it can find new capital,
restructure assets and reach an accomodation with its
creditors.
   In the 1989 second quarter, the Washington, D.C.-based
bank holding company posted net income of $3.5 million, or 51
cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Much of the loss for the quarter ended June 30 came from
an increased provision for loan losses. After reviewing
Washington Bancorp.'s assets with federal regulators, the
company added $61 million to loan loss reserves, compared to
a $2 million provision in the year-ago period. The company
also realized losses of $15 million on asset sales and
write-downs.
   The tremendous loss seems to have torpedoed the company's
plan to refinance its debt by issuing $45 million in new
secured notes. The debt restructuring was announced in May,
after the company determined it wouldn't be able repay $36.7
million in commercial paper. That program is "no longer
feasible," the company said.
   The company said it hopes to come up with another plan to
improve its capital ratios and repay its debt. However, "No
assurances can be given that commercial paper holders or
other creditors will be repaid in full," said Chairman John
J. Mason.

   CyCare Systems Inc., Phoenix, Ariz., posted a
second-quarter loss of $14.2 million, or $2.55 a share,
including $21 million in write-offs and provisions related to
a plan to discontinue certain product lines.
   In the year-ago period, CyCare had net income of $791,000,
or 14 cents a share. The company had operating income in the
latest quarter of $250,000, or four cents a share. Revenue
fell 12%, to $19.6 million, from $22.4 million.

   CyCare, a data processing concern, plans to "go back to
working with physician-controlled medical groups and
hospitals," said a spokesman. In recent years, CyCare had
begun providing systems to certain kinds of health
maintenance organizations and other non-physician controlled
health-care concerns.
   The "strategic redirection" reflects a six-month review of
company operations initiated by Raymond R. Maturi, who became
president and chief operating officer in January, the
spokesman said. In the next 18 months, the company plans to
close, or significantly reduce in size, four of its 15 major

   AT&amp;T's Plan
   On Health Costs
   May Set Pattern

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and its major unions
took a big step toward trying to rein in soaring health care
costs by selecting three companies to manage a health care
system for 100,000 nonmanagement employees in the U.S.
   The new system gives a huge boost to a recent trend among
companies to develop health care networks of doctors and
hospitals to provide care for their employees at lower costs.
It also represents an unusual management-labor effort to
address the health cost issue, consultants said, and could
influence labor negotiations in a variety of industries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There's been a real movement in the past two years for
these kinds of arrangements," says Robert Levin of the
Washington Business Group on Health. The AT&amp;T plan "is
characteristic of the growing corporate interest" in more
effective purchasing of health care.
   AT&amp;T spends $3 million a day on health care overall and
about $500 million a year for its non-management employees.
Costs have risen about 10% a year since 1984, not as sharply
as at many other companies, but nevertheless troublesome
enough to reflect the crisis corporate America sees in
medical costs. The company hopes the managed care program
will hold annual increases to single-digits by 1993.
   The nuts and bolts of the system don't break much new
ground in managed care, however. And both the company and the
union now face the challenge of encouraging non-management
employees and their 225,000 dependents to use the doctors and
hospitals belonging to the various networks.
   The company selected Prudential Insurance Co., Newark,
N.J., Travelers Corp., Hartford Conn., and Empire Blue Cross/
Blue Shield, New York, to manage the plan in 23 metropolitan
areas across the country. They were selected from among some
20 companies, including all the major insurers and several
health maintenance organizations that initially expressed
interest in the program. The companies were evaluated by a
health cost-containment committee set up in the aftermath of
a labor contract settlement in 1989 between the company and
its two unions, the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   Under the plan, employees who get health care from members
of the networks set up by the insurers will pay $150
deductible and up to 10% of nonhospital medical procedures.
Hospitalization will be 100% covered. Those who see
physicians outside the plan will have a $200 deductible and
pay 20% of all care, in and out of the hospital, up to a
maximum of $1,000 a year.
   Hospitals and doctors in the plan agree to provide the
care at reduced prices. The three insurers will share in the
risk of providing the care: If they meet or exceed
predetermined targets of health costs per covered employee,
they will share in the savings; if they fail to meet the
goals, they will have to absorb a share of the overruns. AT&amp;T
wouldn't disclose the targets.
   "This plan will allow us to gain some kind of foothold to
flatten out the growth curve" in health costs, says John
Barry, division manager, human resources at the New York
communications giant. And rather than shifting costs to
employees, he added, "the terms will shift it to the provider
community-hospitals and doctors."
   Adds Joseph Martingale, of consultant Towers Perrin: "It
rewards efficiency, which isn't being done in indemnity
arrangements with fee-for-service medicine."
   Such terms are similar, and even less stringent than those
of some managed care plans adopted by other companies,
notably Allied Signal Corp. And the anticipated savings
aren't guaranteed. Both the company and the union must
persuade employees to use providers who are in the network.
   The out-of-pocket difference for employees might not be
enough to encourage them to leave their own doctors and steer
them into the network, says Robert Eicher, a consultant with
A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co.
   Few if any companies have been willing to force employees
to use company-selected doctors. If the AT&amp;T plan fails to
attract a significant number of workers, unrealized savings
would likely become the subject of labor talks in 1992,
consultants say.
   Union members on the health cost-containment committee won
some features in the plan that could help overcome barriers
to employee acceptance, says John Agee, a CWA representative
on the committee. For instance, any employee who currently
has a chronic or long-term illness such as cancer won't have
to change doctors and will be covered under the plan whether
the doctor is a member or not. And employees may nominate
doctors who aren't members to join the network; the doctors
would then be evaluated by the carriers to make sure they
meet requirements, Mr. Agee says.
   The selection was a boost for both Prudential and
Travelers. Prudential has handled dental insurance for AT&amp;T
but no other health care business for the company. Travelers
may lose some of the nonhospital business it now handles for
AT&amp;T, but consultants and an AT&amp;T spokeswoman said its share
of the contract boosts its effort to move into managed care,
not considered one of its strengths. Empire Blue Cross has
handled all of AT&amp;T's hospital business and now will lose
much of that business, even while winning a spot in the
nationwide system.
   The system will begin operation in October in seven areas
handled by Empire Blue Cross, including Minneapolis, Oklahoma
City, Atlanta and South Carolina. All 23 areas, accounting
for 72% of the nonmanagement employees, are to be in the
program by July 1991.

   Stotler Group Unit
   Is Said to Comply
   With Capital Rules

   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it "believes"
Stotler &amp; Co., the futures brokerage unit of Stotler Group
Inc., is in compliance with industry minimum capital
requirements.
   The terse exchange announcement late yesterday averts a
crisis for the old-line grain-trading firm whose chairman,
Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, is also Board of Trade chairman. But
exchange members said the firm, while a survivor for now,
will be a drastically smaller operation with an uncertain
future if customer and investor concerns about its financial
health aren't quickly assuaged.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stotler officials didn't return calls for comment.
   To slash costs, the company this week instituted sharp
salary cuts for salaried employees earning more than $20,000
annually. An internal company memorandum from President and
Chief Executive Officer Thomas Egan to the staff says
salaried employees' base pay over $20,000 annually
effectively would be halved, at least through Sept. 30. For
example, the memo says employees earning $30,000 annually
will have their pay cut to $25,000 a year. The memo said
futures brokers' commissions weren't affected by the salary
cuts.
   Stotler, with more than 300 branches and affiliates
scattered across the Midwest, has been transferring millions
of dollars worth of customer accounts to other futures
brokers this week in a frantic effort to reduce its
regulatory capital requirements, exchange members said.
   The Board of Trade last week determined that Stotler's
capital levels didn't meet industry standards, and had given
Stotler until the close of business today to shore up its
capital position.
   Neither the exchange nor Stotler said what caused the firm
to slip below the minimum requirement. Exchange members said
the problem may be tied to a rumored dispute with regulators
over the counting of certain assets within Stotler Group and
its subsidiaries, possibly about $11 million in commercial
paper issued by Stotler as capital.
   If Stotler hadn't met the minimum regulatory capital
requirements -- capital on hand equal to 4% of segregated
customer funds -- it could have been forced to only let
customers trade to liquidate positions, or all of its
customer accounts could have been transferred by regulators
to other brokerage firms.
   The exchange didn't say what amount of capital Stotler had
to support its customer accounts as of late yesterday, nor
did it reveal the amount of funds in the accounts. Exchange
members, who asked to remain anonymous, estimated that
Stotler's segregated customer funds peaked at between $250
million and $300 million a few weeks ago.
   Earlier in the week Stotler confirmed that it was
transferring customer accounts to other firms and said it was
seeking a capital infusion to satisfy regulatory demands for
capital. The company said that without a capital infusion,
"Stotler Group may be unable to meet its debt obligations
unless those obligations are refinanced or restructured."
   The company also said that transferring accounts would
reduce revenue and net income for Stotler Group. For the
first quarter ended March 31, the company had net income of
$370,000, or 17 cents a share, and commission revenue of
$28.4 million.

   PARIS -- French stockbrokerage Tuffier-Ravier-Py &amp;
Associes said it will file for bankruptcy following the
failure of its last-minute attempt to find a backer.
   The demise of Tuffier-Ravier-Py will be the largest
bankruptcy in the French stock market and provides the first
test for the bourse authorities' 200-millionfranc ($36.3
million) guarantee fund set up in 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The broker is one of the largest French stockbrokers and
is part of Tuffier &amp; Associes, an independent diversified
financial services company controlled by Thierry Tuffier.
   The Paris Bourse on Friday suspended Tuffier-Ravier-Py
from all stock trading because it was unable to pay its
bills. Mr. Tuffier said last week that the group's brokerage
arm had run up heavy losses this year due to a squeeze on its
margins since fixed commissions were abolished last year as
part of France's 1988 stock-market reforms. He said then that
all French brokers had been hit similarly by the lower
commissions and by a fall in volume this year on the stock
market.
   But rival French brokers said that Mr. Tuffier's problems
spring in large part from his group's over-ambitious
expansion as it diversified into financial futures, corporate
finance, money-market trading and other new fields.
   Mr. Tuffier said this week that his firm now needed loans
of up to 300 million francs to stay on its feet.

   Graphic Scanning Corp. said its directors decided to seek

develop new businesses and generate new capital.
   Based in Englewood, N.J., Graphic Scanning Corp., which is
involved in paging, cellular telephone and wireless cable
operations, has faltered in previous efforts to improve its
financial position. Discussions to sell a controlling
interest in its Digital Mobile Communications Ltd. business,
a U.K. telecommunications company, collapsed last year, as

   The company said its directors had determined that
developing its telecommunications businesses is "beyond the
scope" of its current resources. Termination of the Digital
Mobile sales discussions "creates immediate capital needs,"
the company added.
   It said it also is looking at other alternatives to raise
capital, including selling securities or assets or entering
into other joint ventures.
   For the nine months ended March 31, Graphic Scanning had a
net loss of $38.5 million, or $1.19 a share, on revenue of
$71.1 million.

   DETROIT -- United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber
opened contract talks with General Motors Corp. by vowing to
"change the way GM does business" so that no more union
members lose their jobs.
   But Alfred S. Warren, GM's vice president and top labor
negotiator, replied that the company wants the union to
accept measures that will cut costs in the auto maker's
parts-making operations. GM also wants the union's help in
narrowing the approximately $560-per-car gap between GM's
health-care costs and those of U.S. assembly factories
operated by Japanese auto makers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both Mr. Bieber and Mr. Warren said they want to resolve
their differences and produce a new, three-year contract
before the current pact ends Sept. 14.
   Union bargainers will push for job guarantees that will
force GM to lay off salaried workers before UAW members, Mr.
Bieber said.
   Although Mr. Warren declined to be specific about GM's
proposals for cutting labor costs in its parts businesses,
the vice president said, "If the union offered me a lower
wage scale (for parts workers) I'd take it." GM parts workers
now earn the same average $15.74 hourly wage as assembly
workers -- well above the average pay at competitive, non-GM
parts operations.
   As for health benefits, Mr. Warren said current UAW plans
add about $622 to the cost of each vehicle GM builds, which
compares to about $60 for U.S-built Japanese vehicles.

   Supercomputing Solutions Inc. said its loss widened to

said it plans to cut its staff by 50% and take other
cost-cutting steps due to "an uncomfortable cash position."
   In the year-earlier period, the San Diego-based maker and
seller of supercomputers and software reported a loss of
$743,836, or 17 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the recent quarter, revenues more than doubled to
$738,723 from $360,752. The gains were due to the company's
completion of a subcontract for the initial phase of the
Direct Solution of Turbulence Program for the Department of
Defense and the completion and sale of the company's first
CAPPS-9064 supercomputer to TRW Inc.
   However, the company said research and development costs
linked to the CAPPS-9064 resulted in significant losses,
leaving the company in an "uncomfortable cash position."
   The company said its cost-saving efforts will include
cutbacks in travel and capital-equipment expenditures as well
as the curtailment of a research grant to Princeton
University.

   MCI 2nd Quarter Net Climbed 18%,
   But Revenue Data Cause Stock to Fall

   NEW YORK -- The grueling long-distance phone battle is
starting to wear on American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
rivals as the war shifts from price-cutting to costlier
salesmanship.
   Long-distance rates, which have fallen almost 45% since
1984, are stabilizing as evidenced by recent price boosts on
certain consumer and business services by market leader
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There also is a growing reluctance by MCI Communications
Corp., AT&amp;T's principal nemesis, to cut price at the expense
of profits.
   MCI yesterday posted an 18% gain in second-quarter
earnings, but its stock was hammered after revenue growth
fell below expectations. Net income was $177 million, or 67
cents a share, compared with $150 million, or 56 cents, the
year before. Revenue rose 17% to $1.87 billion from $1.59
billion.
   MCI's shares dropped $1.875 to $36.50 in national
over-the-counter trading after trading as low as $36.125
during the day.
   MCI said revenue growth was strong in the residential and
big business sectors but slower in the general business
sector.
   Daniel Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer, said that
during the second quarter, the company was preparing to roll
out MCI Vision, a product that offers to small and
medium-sized businesses some voice and data transmission
services previously only available to big businesses. Also
during the quarter, he said, MCI froze hiring in the spring
to avoid sizable layoffs after MCI acquires Telecom USA. The
acquisition is expected to win regulatory approval soon and
could be completed this summer. Telecom USA's major strength
is in the general business sector.
   Mr. Akerson, who heads the effort to combine the two
companies, said MCI still won market share in the general
business segment but was "willing to accept a slower rate of
growth to facilitate the integration" with Telecom USA. "We
didn't have a product as competitive or as targeted as we
have today," Mr. Akerson said, referring to MCI Vision.
"Without the right weapon -- or product -- and a full team on
the field, then you might hold for a quarter."
   AT&amp;T is expected to post lower second-quarter earnings
today. Nonetheless, Sprint's and MCI's results could pose a
sticky timing problem for AT&amp;T. The company has been trying
to convince the Federal Communications Commission that the
industry is sufficiently competitive and that its
classification as "dominant" carrier should be dropped in
favor of looser regulation.
   On Tuesday, Sprint, which has traditionally been the
telephone industry's biggest price discounter, posted a $42
million second-quarter operating loss. This caused its parent
United Telecommunications Inc.'s second-quarter net to drop
55% to $40.6 million, or 18 cents a share. Revenue rose 12%
to $2.07 billion.
   United Telecommunications' stock is still reeling from the
Sprint debacle: Yesterday, its shares closed at $27.25, down
$2.25 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
after falling 24%, or $8.75, to close at $29.50 on Tuesday.
   United was also the volume leader, with more than 11.8
million shares traded Tuesday and 10 million shares
yesterday. MCI led in volume in over-the-counter trading
yesterday with about 13 million shares traded.
   Sprint and MCI are pushing to cut costs, but costs may be
the least of their problems, said Jack B. Grubman, analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. He said AT&amp;T's size and market presence
makes it easier for the company to cut costs while keeping
marketing outlays high.
   "In a starvation diet, the fat lady wins," said Mr.
Grubman. "This is going to squeeze competitors to death."
   Robert B. Morris III, analyst at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.,
noted that "Sprint has its eye on one ball -- cost-cutting --
while the industry has moved into an intensified mode of
marketing and sales."
   AT&amp;T and MCI have moved aggressively on Sprint's
bread-and-butter accounts: consumer and small business. To
win these accounts over, AT&amp;T and MCI have fueled their sales
and marketing with new pricing promotions and advertisements
about quality and service reliability aimed at consumer and
business customers for domestic and international
long-distance calls.
   "Right now our goal is to stabilize our market share,"said
Victor A. Pelson, senior vice president and group executive
of communications services at AT&amp;T. "We're on track with
regard to residential and business customers."

   WASHINGTON -- A top investigator for the Resolution Trust

savings-and-loan associations taken over by the government.
   James Dudine, assistant director of RTC investigations,
said the agency also expects to bring civil actions charging
malfeasance by directors and officers at 55% of the insolvent
thrifts. The RTC, created by last year's S&amp;L legislation to
sell off and liquidate hundreds of insolvent thrifts, has
taken over about 450 thrifts and has sold or liquidated about
210.

   The RTC believes civil claims against accountants will be
brought in 22% of the cases, and against attorneys in about
18%, Mr. Dudine said.
   RTC investigators also believe about 15% of the failed
thrifts colluded with other thrifts in fraudulent
transactions such as joint real-estate deals and loan swaps,
he added.
   Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said that agency was concerned that judges
aren't giving sufficiently stiff sentences to those convicted
of S&amp;L fraud. Though the Justice Department has pointed to
some executives who have received as much as 30-year
sentences, that is "the exception," Mr. Ryan said.

   UAL Airline Unit's Non-Union Workers
   Accept Wage Concessions to Aid Buy-Out

   In a boost for the employee effort to buy UAL Corp.,
United Airlines' 26,000 non-union workers agreed to provide
wage concessions to help finance the buy-out.
   Support from the non-union workers offers a sign of
progress when the buy-out group's efforts to obtain bank
financing appear to be moving slowly. Only 3 1/2 weeks remain
until the Aug. 9 financing deadline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the moment, bank negotiations seem to be taking a back
seat as the buy-out group, led by the unions representing
United's pilots, machinists and flight attendants,
concentrates on trying to obtain capital for the $4.38
billion transaction from various airline suppliers.
   The group has contacted a number of companies to provide
financing, including aircraft makers Boeing Co. and Airbus
Industrie; engine makers General Electric Co., Rolls-Royce
PLC and the Pratt &amp; Whitney unit of United Technologies
Corp.; and aircraft leasing companies and European airlines.
   In an interview, Gerald Greenwald, the buy-out group's
leader, confirmed that talks are continuing with several
suppliers. He declined to comment further, saying the
negotiations are "in a very delicate time."
   The agreement with the non-union workers should help the
financing effort. Banks had expressed concern about the
prospect of labor discord at the airline if the non-union
workers didn't participate. The accord with the non-union
employees "eliminates a negative," said one person familiar
with the effort.
   The reservations agents, customer-service representatives
and middle-level managers who make up the non-union group
agreed to one-time wage concessions amounting to $45.9
million, or an average 5.9% pay cut. The group also gave up
certain premium pay and rarely used medical benefits valued
at an additional $4.6 million in cost savings.
   In return, the non-union workers will receive a 14.26%
stake in Chicago-based UAL, as well as some improvements in
their pension plan. In all, UAL employees have agreed to
provide $300 million in wage concessions for the first year
and a total of $2 billion over five years if the buy-out
succeeds.
   The non-union workers agreed to support the buy-out after
Mr. Greenwald assured them in a letter that their accord with
the unions would become part of the actual agreement with
UAL.
   Just a month ago, the non-contract workers had threatened
to upset the buy-out effort unless the unions met its
conditions. In a statement yesterday, the group said it
concluded that "the interest of all employees are best served
by trying to work together." In an unusual move, UAL hired
First Chicago Corp. and the law firm of Fried Frank Shriver
Harris &amp; Jacobson several months ago to advise the
non-contract employees on the buy-out.
   Mr. Greenwald disagreed with assessments that the
financing effort is moving slowly. "This process is on track
with my own timetable," he said.
   The former Chrysler Corp. vice chairman said the unions
are currently working to develop "very definitive {financing}
proposals with some banks so that we can go with definitive
proposals to a larger group of banks."
   He added that the banks are reviewing large amounts of
information so that they can "decide for themselves whether
or not to make {financing} commitments."
   Mr. Greenwald said he felt that the current financing
deadline of Aug. 9 "has always been a little tight,"
suggesting the buy-out group may seek an extension. He said,
however, there are currently no plans to ask for one.
   Five major New York banks -- Citicorp, Chemical Banking
Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Bankers Trust New York
Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp. -- agreed two weeks ago to
assist in the financing effort. But the banks want the unions
to obtain subordinated financing from other sources before
they agree to commit bank funds.
   The extra layer of junior financing would give the banks
more comfort about the safety of their investment.
   Separately, the buy-out group also declined to comment on
whether United's pilots union had agreed to use $200 million
from one of its pension funds as equity for the transaction.
Pilot leaders concluded a three-day meeting yesterday but
apparently arrived at no decision on the pension fund.

rose 9% to $22.9 million from $21 million.

<TEXT>
   Pretax earnings of $522,000 were about half of what the
company had hoped for, Mr. Kessler said. New orders in the
quarter fell to $17.4 million from $23.7 million in the
year-ago period. He said the main problem is erosion in
demand for the company's electronic test-and-measurement
equipment, which accounts for about 60% of sales.
   Mr. Kessler said Wavetek expects to dismiss about 100
people, or about 10% of its work force, by the end of the
week, reflecting the company's lowered sales and profit
expectations. After the cuts, the company will have 850 to
900 employees.
   Wavetek retained Peers &amp; Co., a Chicago investment banking
concern, to assist it in arranging a "strategic alliance" or
sale of the company.
   Wavetek closed yesterday at $4.25, up 37.5 cents, in
over-the-counter trading.

   NEW YORK -- U.S. companies' acquisitions of foreign
concerns declined in the first half because of tighter credit
conditions and fears about slower economic growth, according
to a survey by KPMG, the accounting firm.
   The number of acquisitions declined to 124 from 213 in the
1989 first half, and the dollar total fell to $8.1 billion
from $11.4 billion. The drop in dollars would have been even
steeper except for Philip Morris Cos.' plan to buy Jacobs
Suchard AG of Switzerland, an agreement that accounted for
more than a third of the total in the 1990 first half.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The number of acquisitions by foreign companies in the
U.S. also fell, to 338 from 392 in the 1989 half. The dollar
total, however, continued to dwarf the value of U.S.
purchases abroad, as it rose to $27.9 billion from $23.9
billion.
   KPMG cited Swedish and Japanese companies as showing
especially large increases in cross-border acquisitions.
Swedish companies announced 71 transactions in the first half
totaling $8.5 billion, well above the year-earlier 51
transactions totaling $700 million. KPMG said it expects
Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland to be active on the
acquisition front in Europe to improve their position in
advance of the formation of a highly unified European market
in 1992. Japanese cross-border purchases increased to 114
from 70 and to $5.3 billion from $2.9 billion.

   Union Pacific Corp. said second-quarter earnings were flat
at $153 million, or $1.53 a share, compared with $152
million, or $1.41 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue climbed 9.2% to 1.78 billion, from $1.63 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Bethlehem, Pa., company said net income from its
railroad rose 4% to $141 million, despite a softer economy
and the non-recurrence of last year's favorable retroactive
tax claims. But the railroad's higher profit was partly
offset by a 21% drop in earnings from Union Pacific
Resources, the company's energy and mineral business, which
fell to $43 million from $55 million.
   Union Pacific said the sharper rise in net earnings per
share reflects the effect of its stock repurchase program;
average shares outstanding declined to 100.4 million from
110.6 million.
   For the first half, the company's earnings fell 3% to $281
million or $2.80 a share, from $290 million or $2.63 a share.
Revenue rose 10% to $3.51 billion, from $3.18 billion.

   Warfarin Medicine Found
   To Lower Heart Attack Risk

   Warfarin, a blood thinning medicine, reduced the risk of
heart attacks and death in people who had survived a previous
heart attack, Norwegian researchers reported in the latest
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Their new study is the strongest evidence that the drug,
which has been available for years, may be useful in
preventing a second heart attack. Warfarin is sold as
Coumadin by DuPont Pharmaceuticals, a unit of DuPont Co., and
is also marketed by several other companies in generic form.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Over the years, several research teams tried, but failed,
to show that the drug's ability to prevent the formation of
blood clots could prevent second heart attacks. Doctors have
been fearful that the drug's long-term use might increase the
risk of cerebral hemorrhaging. Therefore, many doctors
prescribe aspirin to heart attack survivors based on recent
studies showing that aspirin reduced the risk of future
attacks.
   In the latest study, doctors at Ulleval University
Hospital in Norway followed 1,214 heart attack patients,
giving half of them warfarin and the other half a placebo for
an average of three years of therapy. The warfarin-treated
group had 94 deaths, compared with 123 in the placebo group,
meaning that the drug reduced the risk of death by 24%.
   The group taking warfarin had a 34% lower risk of having a
subsequent heart attack.

   AmeriTrust attributed its second-quarter decline to higher

with year-earlier results of $30.3 million, or 83 cents a

   Oil Spill Occurs
   At Exxon Dock
   Off New York City

   NEW YORK -- Two barges collided at an Exxon Corp. loading
dock, spilling 40,000 gallons of heating oil into a busy
shipping channel in New York Harbor.
   The accident occurred when one of the barges, which had
finished loading at Exxon's Bayway refinery, was being
maneuvered by two tug boats into the Arthur Kill shipping
channel and rammed another barge that was unloading nearby.
No Exxon personnel were involved.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Oil spewed from a gash at least 15 feet long as the vessel
was returned to the dock. Half of the spilled oil escaped
into the Arthur Kill before booms to contain it could be laid
out.
   The barges and tug boats are owned by Maritrans Partners
L.P. of Philadelphia. Maritran Chairman Stephan Van Dyck,
visiting the site of the accident yesterday, said his company
is taking full responsibility for causing the accident and
would assume the full cost of cleanup.
   Regulators said that fines could run into hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   The incident marks the 13th time oil has been dumped into
the busy harbor this year. Three of the spills have been
considered major, exceeding 100,000 gallons of oil. At least
three have occurred at or near Exxon's Bayway refinery,
including a massive spill of more than 500,000 gallons in
January, when an underwater pipeline at the refinery
ruptured.
   The refinery was closed from late March until June for an
inspection to see if there was anything inherently wrong with
the facility or its operations. The results of that study
identified some operating problems and established procedures
to correct them.
   Coast Guard Lt. Raymond Maher said he doubted that
yesterday's collision would spark a re-examination of
operations at the refinery.
   Although only one of 10 storage tanks on the barge was
ruptured, the entire cargo was unloaded at the dock. A
Massachusetts company called Astro-Line owns the oil, which
it had just purchased from Exxon.
   The spill didn't appear to cause significant damage to the
marine environment, according to a Coast Guard spokeswoman,
and booms were put around sensitive areas to keep the oil
out. "Because it's light oil, much of it will evaporate
quickly," she said.
   However, that evaporation may have caused an air-quality
violation, according to Anthony McMahon, an official with New
Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection. He explained
that shortly after the accident, air-quality monitors near
the refinery registered a jump in the ozone level.
   Although regulators expressed frustration with yesterday's
incident, they said the response was impressive. Shortly
after the spill occurred, a cleanup crew of 170 was on the
scene. Three Coast Guard boats showed up, and three skimmers
were scooping up the spilled fuel. Five vacuum trucks along
the shoreline were removing oil from the water as well. At
some other oil spills, Mr. McMahon said, "it's taken up to 20
hours to get a skimmer on the scene."

   H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., parent of Home Savings of America,
said its second-quarter earnings increased 51% to $60.1

   The Los Angeles thrift holding company attributed the
results to strong growth in new mortgage loans, which totaled
a record $4.2 billion for the quarter.
</LP>

   The growth is impressive because it comes at a time when
home sales are slowing and "generally mortgage lenders are
having trouble putting loans out the door," said Allan
Bortel, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Co.
   Ahmanson's said its second-quarter nonperforming assets
increased by $51 million to $597 million, or 1.25% of total
assets. It also said that it may sell its real-estate
development operations because of new capital rules it said
will take effect by 1994.
   The thrift company's stock fell 12.5 cents to $21.875
yesterday.

   British Steel PLC said it agreed in principle to acquire
40% of Spain's Aristrain steelmaking group, with La
Corporacion Banesto, the industrial conglomerate of Spain's
Banesto banking group, buying another 40%.
   The purchase price wasn't disclosed in a statement
released by British Steel, which also said that provision had
been made for Ensidesa, the Spanish national steel company,
to acquire a shareholding up to a maximum 10%. The balance
will be retained by current shareholders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A British Steel spokesman said it was premature to discuss
the acquisition price. The current family shareholders will
retain 20% of the concern under the accord. Any Ensidesa
purchase would come jointly from British Steel and LCB's
holdings.
   Aristrain, based in Madrid and the Basque country, is
Spain's largest specialist producer of steel sections for the
construction industry. Its annual output is about 1.5 million
tons, which is marketed through its national distribution
network.

   U.S., in Policy Shift, Will Begin
   Talks With Vietnam on Cambodia

   The Bush administration, abandoning its failed Cambodia
policy, said it will hold talks with the U.S.'s old enemy
Vietnam to try to revitalize the Cambodia peace effort.
   Secretary of State James Baker, speaking to reporters in
Paris, said the administration will begin talking with
Vietnam to try to prevent the murderous Khmer Rouge
guerrillas from again taking over Cambodia. As part of its
policy shift, the U.S. won't any longer back the awarding of
Cambodia's United Nations seat to a three-party coalition
that includes two non-Communist groups and the Khmer Rouge.
The U.S. also plans to loosen restrictions on
humanitarian-aid projects for Vietnam and for Cambodia, which
is dominated by Vietnam.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The diplomatic shift reflects growing congressional and
international concerns that the U.S. policy inadvertently
might have been aiding the Khmer Rouge. "It's very important
to do what we can to prevent a return to power of the Khmer
Rouge," Mr. Baker said.
   A senior U.S. official in Washington said the talks with
Vietnam will be at the same diplomatic level as discussions
under way over locating and returning the remains of U.S.
soldiers killed in the Vietnam War. Top administration
officials, including Vice President Dan Quayle, have
emphasized recently that if Vietnam cooperates on that issue
and the Cambodian peace issue, normal diplomatic relations
could follow. The senior U.S. official said that the
administration would consider talking to Cambodia's Communist
regime if that would advance the process of holding free
elections in Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge
regime, which slaughtered about one million people in
Cambodia. After it occupied Cambodia, Vietnam set up a puppet
regime there. The U.S. has been backing non-Communist forces,
led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, that are fighting Cambodia's
government.
   Over the past decade, Vietnam was viewed by U.S. policy
makers as a client of the Soviet Union, and U.S. policy
toward Asia was driven by the goal of blocking Soviet
expansionism. This included supporting the insurgents who
were battling against the regime installed in Cambodia by
Hanoi.
   The end of the Cold War is altering this view. The senior
U.S. official said that although the Soviets continue to
supply Vietnam and Cambodia, "it's clear they are prepared to
engage in dialogue on regional issues." Mr. Baker announced
the new policy in Paris after explaining it to Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at a meeting.
   But recent battlefield successes by the Khmer Rouge,
combined with its stalling tactics at the negotiating table,
set off alarm bells in the U.S. Last month, the Senate
Intelligence Committee voted to cut off covert assistance to
the non-Communist forces because of concern over the
administration's policy and fear that some of the aid was
going to the Khmer Rouge. And the House approved $7 million
in non-lethal aid to non-Communist forces only after imposing
restrictions in response to criticism that those forces were
mounting operations in cooperation with the Khmer Rouge.
   This month, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D.,
Maine), with GOP support, drafted a letter calling on the
administration to "re-examine that policy." The letter, which
is circulating in the Senate, urged the administration to end
U.S. support at the U.N. for any Cambodian forces that
include the Khmer Rouge and to base its policy on preventing
that group from returning to power.
   In a statement, Sen. Mitchell welcomed the policy changes
but said they didn't go far enough in "clearly and
effectively preventing future Khmer Rouge domination of
Cambodia." He urged the administration to start talking with
the regime in Cambodia and to exert pressure on China, the
key backer of the Khmer Rouge. President Bush has resisted
calls for stiff penalties to influence China's behavior,
claiming such measures are counterproductive.
   It would be difficult in any event for Mr. Bush to change
China's policy. China believes that its long-term interests
in Southeast Asia are best served by protecting smaller
states against Vietnamese aggression. Thus, it aids the Khmer
Rouge against the Cambodian regime installed by Hanoi.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, said the
administration's new approach "should help solidify support
on Capitol Hill for assistance to the non-Communist
resistance."
   The senior U.S. official who briefed reporters in
Washington yesterday said that "we stand strongly behind"
requests for aid to the non-Communist insurgents. He
underscored that the administration was withdrawing its
support for the coalition at the U.N. only because it
included the Khmer Rouge and wouldn't support Cambodia's
Vietnam-backed leader for the seat.
   It isn't clear how the shift in U.S. policy will lead to a
breakthrough at the peace table. The U.S. hasn't yet
determined specifically what it will ask Vietnam to do once
the talks begin, nor is it clear it can persuade China to be
more cooperative. And the policy assumes a continuing
military stalemate in Cambodia. However, the Khmer Rouge,
taking advantage of the rainy season, which favors mobile
guerrilla groups over heavily equipped government units,
appears to have scored a string of recent military successes.
   The policy shift may anger some congressional Republicans.
Mr. Baker said the administration felt free to open the
dialogue with Hanoi because the withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops from Cambodia, the original U.S. policy goal, has been
accomplished. The senior U.S. official in Washington said
that all combat troops have been removed and that there were
no more than 10,000 Vietnamese military advisers left in
Cambodia.
   But the House GOP task force on terrorism and
unconventional warfare, in a report in April, said that
Vietnam has "re-invaded" Cambodia and has about 65,000 troops
there. In an interview yesterday, Vaughn Forrest, the group's
chief of staff, said: "The withdrawal is incomplete at best.
That doesn't signal to me that there's a government there
dealing forthrightly."

   Lowe Chief Discusses Game Plan for U.S.

   Most Americans don't know that Dudley Moore pitches
free-range chickens for a British supermarket chain.
   What's more surprising is that the ads are amusing. In
fact, after just weeks on the air, they're fast becoming a
cult favorite in advertising circles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The off-the-wall commercials, in which Mr. Moore as a
supermarket flunky pokes about rural France in search of
chickens, are the work of Lowe Group, a well-regarded British
agency. Now, Lowe wants to do as well or better in the U.S.
with its Lowe &amp; Partners agency.
   In a rare interview, Frank Lowe, the Briton who founded
and heads the parent company, talked about his U.S. game
plan, including ambitious expansion plans. Lowe &amp; Partners,
with about a dozen blue-chip clients from Prudential
Insurance to Coca-Cola, currently bills about $300 million
annually, squeezing it into that awkward spot of being bigger
than a boutique but smaller than a major player.
   "I'd like it to double {in size} in the next five years,"
said Mr. Lowe, a 47-year-old in blue jeans and a Rod Stewart
hairdo who chain-smoked small cigars throughout the two-hour
interview. He also wants to improve Lowe &amp; Partners' solid,
if unremarkable, creative reputation, which doesn't match up
to that of its British counterpart. "We'd like people to say
five years from now, as they have the last five years about
Chiat, that it's the best agency in the States."
   Lowe &amp; Partners has already been on something of a hot
streak. Earlier this year, it emerged as the long-shot winner
in snagging the $60 million Prudential account away from
Backer Spielvogel Bates. Currently, it is in the running for
a piece of the Xerox account, another major Backer client for
which Lowe handles some direct response advertising.
   "Their work is getting noticed. They're becoming the
creative agency they want to be," said Leslie Winthrop of
Advertising Agency Register, which helps clients choose ad
agencies.
   But Mr. Lowe's grand vision nevertheless remains, for now,
nothing more than that. Mr. Lowe said he doesn't intend to
make acquisitions in the U.S., but to grow the agency
internally. Yet industry consultants say the agency will
first have to digest the big Prudential business before it
can launch on an aggressive new-business warpath.
   The agency is also still adjusting to a merger. Lowe &amp;
Partners was created just last month from the marriage of
Lowe Marschalk and its much smaller sister agency Lowe Tucker
Metcalf. Lowe Marschalk's chief executive officer, Andrew J.
Langer, became chief executive of the merged company, while
the agency's new co-creative directors, David Metcalf and
Dennis D'Amico, hail from Lowe Tucker.
   According to Mr. Lowe, the merger has been relatively
painless, with no professionals and only a few support staff
members leaving. Still, the merger followed a number of other
changes. Last year, Mr. Langer's predecessor left after
sometimes clashing with Mr. Lowe over the agency's direction.
The agency also saw a change in ownership, when Interpublic
Group swapped its interest in Lowe Marschalk for a larger
interest in Lowe Group; it now owns 35.4% of Lowe Group.
   Bringing the agency's creative work up to the level he
wants, meanwhile, will take five years, Mr. Lowe estimates.
The agency's current fare includes such standards as the "I
like the Sprite in You" campaign for Coca-Cola and the "Pass
the Grey Poupon" commercial in which one Rolls Royce
passenger asks another for mustard.
   "There's a body of good work," Mr. Lowe said. "What's
missing, and not just in this agency, is that not too many
people scale the peaks."
   In Mr. Lowe's view, American advertising was clearly
leading the rest of the world until about 1973, when the oil
crisis hit and ad agencies, frightened of losing their
clients, tamed down their acts. Stubborn clients, afraid of
taking risks, made the advertising that much worse, he said.
"Advertising was invented here. But somehow, it lost it's
nerve," Mr. Lowe said. "The agency shouldn't be terrified of
the client."
   As for Lowe &amp; Partners, "What we have to do is advertising
that Americans call breakthrough," he said. He reels off the
type of advertising he aspires to: Chiat/Day's Energizer
bunny commercials, Hal Riney's Bartles and Jaymes spots, and
Wieden &amp; Kennedy's "Bo Knows" campaign for Nike.
   To move things in the right direction, Mr. Lowe, who
started his career at age 18 in the J. Walter Thompson
mailroom in London, currently spends about half his time in
the U.S. In the London agency, he still approves every
commercial script, and he often informally checks up on works
in progress here.
   His leadership can sometimes turn, well, loud. After
spending his early years working his way up through several
agencies, where his colleagues included such volatile
personalities as Charles Saatchi, he concedes that he learned
by example.
   "We have a saying in England that the good is the enemy of
the great," he said. "I get volatile only because so often .
. . there's a kind of a conspiracy of mediocrity. That's when
I get excited. Somebody has to have some passion about the
whole thing."

   ADVERTISER APPEAL: The Allied Printing Trades Council,
which represents 10 unions at the Daily News in New York,
yesterday sent letters encouraging the paper's advertisers
not to buy ads until new contract agreements with Daily News
staff members are reached. The unions' contracts expired in
March, and labor negotiations have been tense and largely
unproductive. "We expect advertisers to give the Daily News a
dose of tough love," the unions' letter said. A spokesman for
the Daily News called the unions' appeal "unfortunate and
misguided."
                                                                                                       

   BBDO PUCHASE: The Atlanta office of Omnicom's BBDO agency
said it agreed in principle to acquire Hutcheson-Shutze, a
five-year-old Atlanta agency with $46 million in billings.
The acquisition, whose price wasn't disclosed, would create a
$200 million office that would be the second-largest U.S.
BBDO outpost after New York. Don Mitchum, president and chief
executive of BBDO's Atlanta office, will retain his title,
while HutchesonShutze's Virgil Shutze becomes chairman and
chief creative officer. His partner, Don Hutcheson, is
leaving the agency business.

   Clothestime Inc. said it sees about a 30% decline in
second-quarter per-share profit to about 11 cents a share
from 16 cents a share.
   In the year-ago quarter ended July 29, the apparel-store
chain posted net income of $2.3 million, or 16 cents a share,
on sales of about $52 million. The second quarter ends on
July 28.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Clothestime said that comparable store sales this month
are running about 9% lower than last July. Total monthly
sales are expected to be about $17 million, roughly the same
as last year, a company official said.
   Clothestime attributed the lower-than-expected sales
mainly to a lack of television advertising this month. Last
summer, the company reoriented its marketing to focus on
somewhat older customers and to sell more brand-name clothes.
Clothestime said its "competitive pricing" on the brand-name
merchandise has resulted in "slightly lower gross margins."

   Treasury Long Bonds Fall on Investors' Fears
   That Fed Is Relaxing Its Fight Against Inflation

   NEW YORK -- Investors knocked prices of long-term Treasury
bonds sharply lower yesterday on fears that the Federal
Reserve is temporarily giving up its fight against inflation.
   Bond prices dropped as soon as New York Trading began,
falling about 1/2 point on news that the consumer price index
-- a key measure of inflation -- jumped 0.5% in June, higher
than expected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The market tumbled further on comments made by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Some investors interpreted
Mr. Greenspan's comments to suggest that the nation's central
bank may be forced to ease credit conditions further, if it
appears that the credit crunch is growing worse. Mr.
Greenspan made his comments to Congress in his semiannual
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.
   The news about possible easing, coming on top of a
disappointing inflation report, "left the distinct impression
that the Fed was biased toward easing policy and that its
fight against inflation has taken a back seat to other
considerations," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa
Securities America Inc.
   Rising inflation is the bond market's worst fear. The
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly one point, a
loss of $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's
yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price,
rose to 8.54%
   Several weeks ago, bond investors would have cheered if
the Fed Chairman were to hint that lower rates were on the
horizon. But investors now view inflation as a growing threat
to the value of their portfolios and they have become
suspicious of Mr. Greenspan's motives for easing credit
conditions at this time.
   "If you had asked many people last week if the Fed should
ease, most would have said yes. But now investors are worried
because they believe that if the Fed eases monetary policy
again, inflation will get worse. I think it is an unwarranted
fear, but it's out there," said Charles Lieberman, a managing
director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
   Mr. Greenspan confirmed that the Fed nudged the Federal
Funds rate to 8% from 8.25% just last week. And holding out
the possibility of a further ease in policy, the Fed chairman
said the central bank must remain alert to the possibility
that an adjustment in bank reserves might be needed to
maintain stable overall financial conditions.
   "Investor faith in the Fed's commitment to turn back
inflation is now being tested," said John Lonski, senior
economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. "Without a
meaningful slackening of the economy, additional reductions
in the federal funds rate are likely to feed inflation
expectations and thereby push bond prices lower despite lower
money-market rates."
   But Mr. Lieberman believes that investors "got a little
carried away. The fact that Greenspan has eased, is an
indication to me that he must have significant concerns,"
about the economy.
   In any case, investors are very worried. The CPI report is
"very disappointing and it brings up memories of
stagflation," said Michael M. Spencer, a vice president and
portfolio manager at One Federal Asset Management, Boston.
"It's too soon to say if {stagflation} is actually happening,
but that's the fear in the markets," he said. Stagflation is
a term created in the 1970s to describe the previously
unprecedented combination of slow economic growth and rising
prices and unemployment. So far, unemployment hasn't risen.
   Also weighing on prices in the long end of the market,
traders and analysts said, are signs of a possible snag in
Congressional negotiations to reduce the federal budget
deficit.
   "There is some concern about the near-term outlook on
budget negotiations with the passage of the House Republican
resolution," said James Capra, senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. Earlier yesterday,
Republicans in the House of Representatives approved a
resolution in a voice vote that declared their opposition to
any deficit reduction plan that includes new taxes.
   Meanwhile, as yields on long-term bonds jumped, yields of
short-term securities were only slightly changed. Thus the
spread, or gap, between rates on long-term and short-term
rates widened sharply yesterday. Bond market analysts refer
to that condition as a steepening yield curve.
   The Treasury's key long bond now yields .40 percentage
point more than the outstanding two-year note. That spread
stood at .30 percentage points late Tuesday. A little less
than a week ago, just before Mr. Greenspan disclosed that the
Fed was poised to ease policy to offset a credit crunch, the
30-year bond yielded just 0.17 percentage point more than the
two-year note.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
102 4/32, down from 103 3/32 on Tuesday. The issue's yield
rose to 8.54% from 8.45%. Two-year notes were quoted late at
a price of 100 13/ 32, little changed from 100 12/32 on
Tuesday. The yield was virtually unchanged at 8.12%.
   Rates on Treasury bills were also little changed to
slightly lower. The discount rate on three-month bills ended
at 7.56% compared with 7.61% on Tuesday while the rate on
six-month bills ended at 7.48% compared with 7.49% on
Tuesday. The bond-equivalent yield on three-month bills eased
yesterday to 7.79% from 7.85% while the yield on six-month
bills eased to 7.86% from 7.87%.

rose to sharply higher levels during two explosive days of
trading.
   Prices on most high-yield debt issues were 1/8 to 1/4
lower after gaining between one and three points since
Monday.
   The recent stampede to invest in the junk bond market was
set off by RJR Nabisco Inc.'s release on Monday of the
details of its $6.9 billion recapitalization plan.
   Trading in RJR's most widely held debt, the pay-in-kind
bonds, more than tripled in the wake of the announcement.
Pay-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of additional
securities. Volume in the broader market nearly doubled on
Monday, and remained sharply higher for much of Tuesday.
   But investors have largely digested RJR's refinancing
package, and the junk bond market has resumed the modest
volume that has characterized high-yield trading for most of
the month, traders say.
   Some investors have seen the calm after the storm as a
chance to consolidate their positions and take profits,
traders say.
   But RJR's junk bonds continued to post strong gains. The
company's convertible pay-in-kind debentures due in 2009, for
example, added 3/8 point to end at 116 1/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The bonds have gained 10 1/8 points since
Monday.
   In the high-grade corporate bond market, prices were flat
to lower. Bonds of shorter maturity were little changed,
while the longer end of the market slipped 1/8 to 1/4 point.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds followed the Treasury market lower, with
prices generally ending off 1/8 to 1/4 point, while some
issues fell as much as 5/8 point.
   After more than $1.3 billion in new municipal debt hit the
market Tuesday, the pace of new issuance leveled off
considerably, with only more than $272 million in debt being
priced yesterday.
   In one of the largest deals of the day, a Chase Securities
Inc. group placed the winning bid for $195 million Washington
state general obligation and motor vehicle fuel tax revenue
bonds.
   The bonds were priced for reoffering to yield from 5.75%
in 1991 to 6.96% in 2010.
   No large new municipal issues are expected to be priced
today.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   West German government bonds rose sharply yesterday as
heavy domestic buying boosted prices.
   Bonn's benchmark 10-year bond rose 0.80 point to yield
8.36% while five-year notes rose 0.36 point to yield 8.60%.
   Among yesterday's buyers, which included pension funds and
other institutional investors, was the Bundesbank, West
Germany's central bank.
   "I don't know if they {the Bundesbank} are preparing the
ground for new bonds or what, but they've been good buyers,"
said one London trader.
   Analysts believe that either a new government bond or
another German Unity Fund Bond is expected in the next few
weeks.
   In Japan, a firmer yen kept bond prices from posting large
declines and prices ended just modestly weaker.
   However, some dealers believe the continued rise in
Japanese short-term interest rates ultimately will swamp
whatever support that the yen can give the bond market.
   One dealer said the "Bank of Japan {the central bank}
wants rates higher" but they want to move cautiously to keep
the Japanese financial markets from nearly collapsing as they
did early this year. Nonetheless "the Bank of Japan does want
the yield curve steeper," he said. So "the money market is
clearly pricing in higher rates" and "there is a defensive
psychology in the Japanese government bond market" as a
result, he said.
   In exchange trading, Japan's benchmark 10-year bond fell
0.07 point to yield 7.27%. (Foreign bond yields are quoted
here in local terms and therefore differ from yields
calculated for these markets by U.S. investment firms, which
tend to use the semiannual compound measure to compare yields
across markets.)
   In London, the British gilts market ended little changed
after a quiet day as market participants await additional May
and June U.K. economic data today.
                                                                                                       

   Asset, Mortgage-backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities fell as much as 3/8
point, taking their cues from the Treasury market.
   The asset-backed market was abuzz yesterday with news
about several new offerings. There was talk of a $1 billion
   Chrysler Corp. offering backed by auto loans soon-to-be
priced by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Chemical Banking Corp. said it will handle the debut of
Allied Stores Corp. asset-backed commercial paper. The deal
would represent the first time a company under Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection will access the investment grade
asset-backed commercial paper market. Allied is a unit of
Campeau Corp.
   Separately, a unit of General Motors Corp., GMAC
Residential Funding, said it filed a $4 billion shelf
registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for
the issuance of registered securities backed by residential
mortgages.
   It is the largest private-label mortgage-related
securities shelf registration on record, the company said.
GMAC Residential purchases "jumbo," or "nonconforming,"
residential mortgages that exceed the purchasing-size limits
used by Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. It then securitizes those loans and
issues double-A or triple-A-rated mortgage-backed securities.
The firm was the leading private-label issuer of
mortgage-backed securities in 1989.

   Mercedes-Benz AG said the company's workers' council
agreed to special Saturday overtime shifts to help the
company cope with rising demand.
   The auto-making arm of Daimler-Benz AG said that special
shifts will be added on "several Saturdays" beginning
September. The overtime shifts will affect the company's
plants in Stuttgart-Untertuerkheim, Sindelfingen and Bremen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mercedes-Benz had tried to introduce the overtime shifts
at the start of the year, but the company couldn't reach an
agreement with the workers' council
   In a statement, Mercedes-Benz said the extra shifts will
be added "so that the company can react flexibly to the
heightened demand." It said that "clear" growth rates in
Europe and in other foreign markets for Mercedes-Benz cars in
general, along with lively demand for certain models and for
equipment, had prompted the need for extra shifts.

   Senate Approves Civil Rights Measure
   On Vote of 65-34 Despite Veto Threat

CONGRESS (CNG)
EXECUTIVE (EXE)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- After weeks of sometimes angry negotiations
and heated debate and despite a White House veto threat, the
Senate passed the Civil Rights Act of 1990.
   The legislation, which was approved 65-34, would overturn
five 1989 Supreme Court decisions that made it more difficult
for victims of employment discrimination to win court cases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the bill said nothing in it should "be construed to
require an employer to adopt hiring or promotion quotas,"
President Bush and Senate Republicans insisted the measure
would result in businesses setting quotas to protect
themselves from litigation.
   "Quotas, schmotas," said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.),
floor manager of the bill, adding that the "false cry of
quotas" is a "disreputable tactic by those who oppose full
civil rights" for women and minorities.
   He said there wasn't "one iota of evidence" that quotas
resulted from the law that was in place for 18 years before
the Supreme Court overruled it. The court's unanimous 1971
decision in what is commonly called the Griggs case placed
the burden of proof on employers to demonstrate the business
necessity of employment practices that work to exclude
minorities and women.
   That employer burden of proof would be restored by the
legislation. Under the bill, "the only way employers can
avoid costly lawsuits they are sure to lose" is to use
quotas, argued Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).
   The language indicating the measure doesn't require quotas
is meaningless, a "feel-good provision," said Senate
Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas. "To assert that a
duck is not a duck does not transform a duck into a pigeon,"
he said.
   Another provision fought by Republicans would allow women
and members of certain religious groups who are victims of
intentional discrimination to sue for compensatory and, in
some cases, punitive damages. Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell (D., Maine) said he will try to have the bill's
final language, after House action, include a provision that
punitive damages couldn't exceed $150,000 or the amount of
the compensatory damages, whichever is greater. An amendment
to that effect wasn't voted on, for procedural reasons.
   The legislation also would prohibit lawsuits challenging
court-approved employment agreements except in certain cases
and would facilitate lawsuits against discriminatory
employment policies involving seniority systems.
   The affirmative vote fell two short of the two-thirds
necessary to override a presidential veto. Ralph Neas,
executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights, said negotiations with the White House will continue
as similar legislation is considered by the House.
   Mr. Neas, who lobbied strongly for the measure, said he
was confident "this bill will be enacted into law." He said,
"There will be a two-thirds bipartisan majority in both
houses."
   White House officials repeatedly have said Mr. Bush wants
to sign a civil rights bill, but one that wouldn't result in
quotas. For a Republican president, he is relatively popular
among black Americans, and he doesn't want to hurt that
standing.
   "No one wants to be branded, no matter how incorrectly,"
Sen. Hatch said, "with all the baggage that comes with a `no'
vote on a measure some claim is anti-discrimination."

   NEW YORK -- The board of the Commodity Exchange Inc., as
expected, named David A. Halperin its new president.
   Mr. Halperin, 47 years old, had been executive vice
president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, a post he
occupied since December 1989. He came to the Merc from the
Comex, where he had been employed for eight years. His last
post at the Comex was executive vice president responsible
for economics and research, new product development,
operations and computer systems. Mr. Halperin moved to the
Merc last year as part of a reorganization plan.

<TEXT>
   "I feel very fortunate to have been able to work at the
highest level of policy development and operations" at both
Comex and the New York Mercantile Exchange, "which has given
me insight into the needs of both exchanges," he said.
   Martin Greenberg, Comex chairman, said, "His (Mr.
Halperin's) professional experience with our organization and
his industry insight make him the perfect man for the job."
   One former exchange official says he thinks Mr. Halperin
will do well at the Comex because "he knows where all the
bodies are buried."

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Lutherans Suspend Church Over Lesbians

   After listening to legal arguments by secular lawyers, a
special disciplinary committee of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America suspended a San Francisco congregation for
five years for hiring a lesbian couple as ministers.
   In addition, the committee of the nation's third-largest
Protestant denomination warned another San Francisco
congregation, which hired a gay man as a minister, that it
faced suspension within 30 days unless it made efforts to
comply with church law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling yesterday -- unprecedented within the 5.2
million-member church -- stopped just short of expelling St.
Francis Lutheran Church, which installed Ruth Frost, 42 years
old, and Phyllis Zillhart, 32, as assistant ministers six
months ago. Instead, it revoked the congregation's political
rights within the church, barring it from voting or
introducing legislation at church assemblies.
   The suspension will run until Dec. 31, 1995, after which
the 130-member congregation will face expulsion from the
church if it still doesn't comply with church law, said
Charles Ruthroth, assistant to Bishop Lyle Miller, who
brought the charges against the two congregations.
   The question of whether homosexuals should be allowed to
serve as clergy is becoming a deeply divisive issue within
several Protestant denominations. Some church leaders admit
to being torn between upholding biblical injunctions against
sex outside marriage and a more modern desire not to
discriminate against a minority group.
   Last month, the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
head of the of 1.3 million-member Reform branch of Judaism,
voted to accept homosexuals into their ranks.
   Bishop Miller, head of the Lutheran church's Sierra
Pacific Synod -- a district that includes San Francisco --
charged that St. Francis Lutheran, by hiring Ms. Frost and
Ms. Zillhart, and First United Lutheran Church, by hiring
Jeff Johnson, 28, had violated the church's constitution.
   At hearings before the disclipinary committee earlier this
month, Bishop Miller said the church -- formed in 1988
through the merger of three smaller Lutheran denominations --
might collapse if individual congregations were allowed to
set their own rules for calling clergy. He charged the two
congregations with violating the church's provision that
ministers may be hired only if they are listed on a roster of
clergy candidates.
   The roster is compiled by a special committee within each
synod. A church rule prohibits the listing of anyone who is a
"practicing" homosexual. Ms. Frost and Ms. Zillhart were
never approved for the roster; Mr. Johnson was originally
listed, but then dropped after refusing to promise to lead a
celibate life.
   In the ruling, the disciplinary committee said that if Mr.
Johnson reapplied for listing on the clergy roster and was
approved, charges against First United Lutheran would be
dropped.
   The attorneys involved in the case found themselves in
unfamiliar waters. "From our perspective, it's difficult in
that it involves ultimate issues of life and being," said
Kathleen Kelly, chairwoman of the disciplinary committee and
a professor at McGeorge Law School of the University of the
Pacific in Sacramento, Calif. Tony Tanke, a staff attorney
for the California Supreme Court, worked with Ms. Kelly in
writing the decision.
   Ms. Kelly said she and Mr. Tanke were originally elected
to the committee as active lay people in the Lutheran church,
rather than as lawyers.
   Ms. Kelly said attorneys on both sides attempted to limit
their arguments to church law and theology. However, she
said, the attorney representing the congregations -- Richard
D. Warren of the San Francisco law firm of Landels, Ripley &amp;
Diamond -- appealed to the committee to follow the example of
the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1803 case of Marbury vs.
Madison, in which the court asserted the power of judicial
review. The analogy was used to prompt the committee to
review critically the church's law against the hiring of
homosexual ministers.

   SCRAMBLE OVER ASBESTOS class action heats up as judge
issues new order.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Parker, who is presiding over
asbestos cases in his court in Beaumont, Texas, said a class
action may be necessary to consolidate the hundreds of
thousands of asbestos personal-injury cases in the U.S. But
he said no action should be taken until all federal judges
handling major asbestos litigation can meet and agree on how
a nationwide class action should be structured. In a typical
class action, all similar cases are consolidated in a single
court and then tried together.
   Earlier this week, a federal judge in Cleveland ordered a
nationwide class action for the cases. Lawyers have said that
the impact of the Cleveland order was unclear because it
allowed cases in many courts to continue separate from the
class-action lawsuit.
   "The problem is a national one, and it calls for a
national solution," Judge Parker said. "Courts must set aside
regional concerns and become the problem solvers our society
rightly expects."
   He said the judges also will have to determine whether
defendants in the cases -- former makers and distributors of
asbestos -- lack sufficient funds to continue litigating the
cases.

   CURBSIDE GARBAGE can't be searched without a warrant,
state court rules.
   Rejecting precedents set by the U.S. Supreme Court and
nearly every state court that has confronted the issue, the
New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that police officers can't
search through curbside garbage bags without a search
warrant. However, the court said that officers can seize the
bags as part of a criminal investigation, as long as they
obtain a warrant before examining their contents.
   The court said the state's constitution guarantees New
Jersey citizens greater protection against unreasonable
searches than does the U.S. Constitution. In 1989, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment's prohibition
of unreasonable searches and seizures doesn't apply to
garbage left for collection in an area accessible to the
public.
   Two of the New Jersey court's seven justices dissented
from the opinion, criticizing the majority for departing from
the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

   Roller Coaster Ride in Hog Market Continues
   As Most Contracts Plummet on Profit-Taking

   CHICAGO -- The roller coaster ride in the hog market
continued as prices of most futures contracts went into a
jowl-flapping tailspin.
   With meatpackers bidding up prices for mature hogs to near
the record levels set in May, some futures traders decided to
take profits and not press their luck any further.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday
the hog contract for August delivery dropped 0.87 cent a
pound to settle at 59.72 cents a pound.
   The price of the August futures contract for pork bellies,
which are used to make bacon, sank its daily permissible
limit of two cents a pound to settle at 46.42 cents a pound.
   Hog prices have been whipsawed for several months.
   Because of a tight supply of mature hogs, the nation's
slaughter is running about 6% behind last year's pace. That
is creating fierce competition among meatpackers for hogs.
   On Monday, for example, prices of several hog futures
contracts jumped their daily permissible limit of 1.5 cents a
pound because of a sudden hog shortage.
   Those high prices have also pushed up the consumer price
of pork to record levels. As a result, any sign of consumer
resistance to high retail prices can trigger a wild plunge in
futures prices.
   "We are waffling between supply bulls and demand bears,"
said Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton,
Chicago.
   What triggered yesterday's sudden disinflationary
sentiment isn't clear. The consumption of refrigerated pork
bellies is running above analysts' estimates. That usually
would support prices.
   There were widespread rumors yesterday, however, that one
major pork belly supplier suddenly lowered its price by two
cents a pound -- igniting speculation that demand for pork is
wavering.
   Because the pork belly market is so thinly traded, the
move by just one concern can shift prices. Analysts are
divided, however, over the impact of that price cut on the
market.
   Cattle futures prices rose.
   After the close of trading tomorrow traders expect the
Agriculture Department to report that the number of young
cattle placed on feedlots in seven major ranch states in June
rose 2.5% from June 1989.
   Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter. Usually a rise in
placements signals that the supply of fattened cattle will
increase several months into the future, thus damping the
price that meatpackers will pay then.
   Opinion is mixed, however, over whether cattle prices will
begin to retreat significantly anytime soon from their high
levels. During part of the trading session yesterday, the
cattle contract for August delivery touched a
life-of-contract high of 76.30 cents a pound.
   Among other things, the Agriculture Department is also
expected to report that placements onto feedlots during the
entire second quarter in 13 states trailed last year's
levels.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Petroleum futures closed mixed on little news.
Although oil inventories still are high, expectations that
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will curb
its overproduction as a result of next week's midyear meeting
kept a support for prices. Also, Iraq again figured
prominently in world oil markets on an unsubstantiated rumor
that it is massing troops on the Kuwait border. Energy
futures brokers have been trying to peddle that rumor for
several days. But there were few takers until yesterday when
it resurfaced after Iraq's foreign minister accused Kuwait of
violating the Iraqi border and stealing oil valued at $2.4
billion. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been the
chief targets of Iraqi complaints about OPEC quota cheaters.
Yesterday's charges followed Tuesday's statement by President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq that he would deal forcefully with
overproducers in OPEC unless they mended their ways. But both
Kuwait and the UAE already had pledged they will reduce
output. So most traders were puzzled by the Iraqi troops
rumor and discounted it. Still, oil futures surged, if only
briefly, on London's International Petroleum Exchange and the
New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures price for the
International Petroleum Exchange's September Brent crude
contract closed 16 cents higher at $18.35 a barrel. In U.S.
futures trading, the September crude contract settled at
$19.61 a barrel, down 16 cents, after nudging $20 during the
day. August crude was down 10 cents at $18.55.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: The July contract swung widely on its last
day of trading because a large number of outstanding
contracts remained to be nullified or fulfilled; but it ended
barely changed. The most active contract, September, eased.
July traded from a low of $1.81 to a high of $1.88 before
expiring at noon EDT 0.10 cent a pound lower at $1.8685.
September declined 2.55 cents a pound to $1.7585. The July
contract showed early strength as traders who didn't want to
take delivery of the concentrate hung on for a while before
liquidating their positions, an analyst said. As the July
price dropped, processors bought contracts. Processors have
been active buyers of contracts, with the intention of taking
delivery of concentrate because futures prices are well below
cash market quotes of $2 to $2.05 a pound, the analyst said.
Trading turned thin as expiration neared; at one point, the
price jumped more than three cents a pound from one trade to
the next. Overall, the analyst said, "It was a reasonably
orderly expiration. The fact that July ended 11 cents {a
pound} over September was a positive development that could
help provide September with further support."
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed. Silver was
strong and platinum edged higher, but gold couldn't sustain
early gains and ended lower. September silver advanced 6.7
cents an ounce to $4.935. October platinum was up 30 cents an
ounce to $479.60. August gold ended with a loss of 50 cents
an ounce at $362.50 after trading as high as $363.90.
Yesterday's advance in silver was a continuation of the
recovery in the metal Tuesday after the September price
dropped to its previously set life-of-contract low of $4.81.
The contract Tuesday recovered most of its sharp loss and
yesterday tacked on further gains as traders, particularly
speculators, were attracted by the market's strong
performance. According to Peter Cardillo, director of
commodity research for Jesup, Josephthal Inc., of New York, a
slight change has taken place in fundamentals that has
contributed some support to the market. "Some smaller silver
mines in the U.S. and Canada have suspended production
because of low prices," he said. "It isn't a major
development, but it has injected a more positive note in the
market." If silver continues to attract demand, Mr. Cardillo
said, there is a possibility that the September contract's
price could top $5 and possibly trade as high as $5.25.

   ATLANTA -- Georgia Gulf Corp., in its first earnings
report since it recapitalized to thwart an unwanted takeover,
said second-quarter net income plunged 68% on a 25% drop in
sales.
   The chemical company reported net income of $15.7 million,
or 50 cents a share, compared with $49.3 million, or $1.91 a
share, a year earlier. The latest results reflected
recapitalization costs, including such items as legal fees,
of about $15.2 million. The quarter's earnings also included
$16.9 million in interest expense related to the
recapitalization.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Gulf adopted the recapitalization plan in April,
ending a protracted and bitter takeover battle with Dallas
investor Harold C. Simmons.
   Sales dropped to $218.7 million from $292.3 million.
Georgia Gulf attributed the decrease largely to the recent
sale of its Freeman Chemical Corp. subsidiary.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
exchange yesterday, Georgia Gulf fell 12.5 cents to close at
$10.375. The company released its earnings after the market
closed.
   For the first half, earnings fell 49% to $53.1 million, or
$1.90 a share, from $104.7 million, or $4.04 a share, a year
earlier. Sales dropped 23% to $470.4 million from $610
million. "Considering that in the first six months of last
year the chemical industry experienced some of its strongest
markets ever, the current level of earnings, while down,
represents a good performance," a company news release said.

   Business Brief -- Bamberger Polymers Inc.:
   Restraining Order Prevents

   Bamberger Polymers Inc. said it secured a temporary
restraining order against 11 former sales and marketing
employees, who, it said, are starting a competing plastics
business.
   Bamberger, a New Hyde Park, N.Y., plastics merchant,
earlier this week said loss of the employees would have a
"material adverse effect" on its sales and earnings from the
Northeast and West Coast operations in the third quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The order restrains the former employees from operating a
plastics business.
   Walter Craig, legal counsel for Helm Resources Inc., a
holding company that controls about half of Bamberger, said
the defecting workers are "engaged in basically the same
business they were involved in, the trading and sale of
thermoplastic resins." Mr. Craig said that Bamberger suspects
another company provided the workers financial backing.
   The company also is seeking damages against the former
employees in a proceeding in New York state Supreme Court in
Nassau County. A request for a preliminary injunction will be
considered Tuesday.
   None of the defendants could be reached for comment.

   World Markets:
   Tokyo Stock Prices Fall on Growing Expectations
   That Bank of Japan Will Push Up Interest Rates

   Tokyo stocks finished lower as growing expectations for
higher domestic interest rates increased a wait-and-see mood
in the afternoon session, traders said.
   In London, shares ended near intraday lows in relatively
active trading, pressured by sagging Wall Street share
prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues, which had advanced for
five consecutive trading days, fell back 124.17 points to
33048.11.
   The index, a 150.55-point gainer Tuesday, fell as low as
32971 at midafternoon Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei eased 67.77
points to 32980.34.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
600 million shares, down slightly from 628 million shares
Tuesday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 505-446, while 176
issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 9.53 points, or 0.40%, to 2397.78.
   The second section index dropped 29.42 points, or 0.66%,
to 4402.08. Volume in the section was estimated at 22 million
shares, down from 23.8 million shares Tuesday.
   Discouraging the market was speculation on the bond market
that the Bank of Japan wants to push up both long-term and
short-term interest rates.
   "It was a blow to investors who were just ready to come
out to the trading floor," said Shigeru Akiba, head of equity
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International.
   After the federal fund rate reduction by the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Friday, expectation grew Monday that Japanese
interest rates, if not falling, at least may not rise higher.
   Such expectations were about to bring institutions off the
sidelines, Mr. Akiba said. "But now they are unable to move"
out of fear of higher interest rates, he said.
   Kimitoshi Hasegawa, head of group pension management at
Dai-Ichi Mutual Life, said continuing high interest rates
despite the yen's strength lead to a consensus among
investors that the overall funds invested on stocks won't
increase. Therefore, strong gains for large-capital domestic
demand-related shares are least expected.
   Fund managers are more and more focused on small-capital
shares with strong earnings predictions, he said.
   Traders said that although the market lacked strength to
push up stock prices, the sentiment wasn't too bearish.
Buying orders constantly placed at lower levels prevented
stocks from plunging.
   Public spending-related shares advanced, helped by buying
by the Big Four brokerage houses.
   Nippon Hodo rose 50 yen to 3,830 yen (34 cents to $25.90).
Taisei gained 10 to 1,330, while Ohbayashi was up 20 at
1,700.
   Stocks that appeared to be targets of buying by some
speculator groups rose strongly, traders said. Among these
were Jujo Paper, which advanced 100 to 970, and Kurabo, which
gained 80 to 1,150.
   Pharmaceutical shares advanced, with Sankyo up 70 to 2,710
and Ono gaining 50 to 5,900.
   High-technology shares finished generally lower as
investors took profits after recent gains, traders said. Sony
was down 80 at 8,900, while Kyocera fell 170 to 8,970 yen.
Fanuc fell 50 to 7,500.
   The London market opened higher but rapidly lost ground on
expectations of a lower Wall Street because of an anticipated
inflationary U.S. consumer price report for June. Those fears
came true, with the data showing a rise of 0.5%, compared
with the consensus forecast of 0.3%.
   However, traders said some of London's losses could be
ascribed to profit-taking after the recent rally. Overall,
sentiment remains optimistic, with "people looking for buy
ideas rather than sell ideas," one dealer said. "People are
using bad news to pick up cheap stock."
   Also affecting prices was sterling's new highs compared
with the dollar and several European currencies. The rise put
pressure on overseas earners.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index dropped
13 points to 2402. The intraday high of 2424.8 was reached in
the midmorning. The Financial Times 30-Share Index closed off
12.3 points at 1900.6.
   Volume was a reasonably robust 595.2 million issues,
compared with 374.9 million Tuesday, even after taking into
account the placing of 54 million British Gas shares.
   These shares represent a line of reserved stock offered as
a bonus to holders but not all taken up. British Gas was off
a penny at 222 pence ($4.03).
   British Steel's announcement that it had agreed in
principle to acquire 40% of Spain's Aristrain for an
undisclosed sum was unsurprising and therefore had little
effect on the company's share price. The stock ended
unchanged at 142 1/2 pence.
   British Aerospace was down 5 at 550. However, dealers said
the shares were hit by the falling market, as the news was
largely discounted in the price because the government move
was disclosed several weeks ago.
   Among overseas earners to be hit by the pound's strength,
ICI dropped 9 to #11.56, Glaxo shed 22 to 853, and B.A.T fell
8 to 963. Reuters dropped 17 to #12.65, and Wellcome finished
at 580, off 13.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt
and Milan, mixed in Brussels and Amsterdam, and lower in
Zurich, Madrid and Stockholm. South African gold stocks
closed lower.
   Meanwhile, stocks ended lower in Sydney, Singapore, Manila
and Taipei, mixed in Wellington, and higher in Hong Kong and
Seoul.

   THE U.S. SAID it would hold talks with Vietnam in a bid to
end Cambodia's war.
   In a policy reversal, Secretary of State Baker said the
Bush administration would negotiate with the Vietnamese to
try to prevent the Khmer Rouge guerrillas from again taking
over Cambodia. The U.S. said it will no longer support
awarding Cambodia's U.N. seat to a three-party coalition that
includes two non-Communist groups and the Khmer Rouge. The
U.S. also plans to loosen curbs on humanitarian aid for
Vietnam and Cambodia, whose government was installed by
Hanoi.

   Senate Clears
   Bill Expanding
   SEC's Powers

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed legislation giving the
Securities and Exchange Commission far broader enforcement
powers, including expanding the agency's fining authority
beyond insider trading for the first time.
   The bill, approved on a voice vote, also would allow the
agency to police corporate America more actively. That area
had been somewhat de-emphasized in recent years as the SEC
focused on Wall Street insider-trading cases. One provision
would grant the SEC authority to ask a federal court to bar
an officer or director from serving at a public company if
that person violates securities law and "demonstrates
substantial unfitness to serve."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, the legislation would grant the SEC
"cease-and-desist authority" to block allegedly fraudulent
investment activity from continuing.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), chairman of the
securities subcommittee, said the bill "sends a strong
message to would-be law violators that they will be detected
and prosecuted with remedies that fit the crime."
   Some securities lawyers, however, worry that the agency is
being granted more power than it needs to police the markets
adequately. For example, Theodore Levine, a Washington
securities lawyer, expressed concern in a letter to clients
that "neither the House nor the Senate have addressed the
fact that the SEC has produced absolutely no evidence" that
it needs cease-and-desist authority to supplement traditional
court action.
   The bill was first proposed by the SEC in 1988 to fill
what it perceived as holes in its enforcement program. For
example, SEC officials had complained that they can either
slap the wrists of offenders by simply requiring them to
promise not to repeat an illegal act, or they can bar them
from the business. That didn't leave much ability to punish
medium-sized violations such as failure to file disclosures,
the agency argued.
   The bill would allow the agency to fine securities-law
violators on a tiered system, with maximums of $500,000 for
corporations and $100,000 for individuals.
   The measure is awaiting floor approval in the House.
Energy and Commerce Committee staff members expect the bill
to pass easily in a vote scheduled for Monday. The House bill
generally matches the Senate legislation, although it doesn't
have tiers for fines, and it has tighter procedural rules for
the cease-and-desist authority.

   NEW YORK -- The leveraged buy-out firm Clayton &amp; Dubilier
is negotiating a possible $2.5 billion to $3 billion buy-out
of International Business Machines Corp.'s typewriter,
keyboard and other low-end operations, according to industry
and financial executives.
   If completed, the acquisition would be the largest ever
for the New York-based partnership. An IBM deal also would be
consistent with some of Clayton &amp; Dubilier's previous
acquisitions, which included low-technology units shed by
Harris Corp. and Unisys Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that IBM was
looking at a $3 billion divestiture of its low-tech
businesses. In a statement yesterday, IBM said it is
"considering many options as it moves to sharpen its
strategic focus," but the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant didn't
comment directly on the newspaper story. IBM did say, though,
that it "hasn't concluded any transaction."
   IBM also said any action "would ensure that our employees
are treated fairly, that service to our customers is
uninterrupted and that the transaction is in the best
economic interest of our company."
   Financial executives also said Clayton &amp; Dubilier may have
lined up an equity partner to share in the acquisition.
Clayton &amp; Dubilier reportedly sounded out General Electric
Capital Corp., a unit of General Electric Co., about buying
some subordinated debt to help finance the transaction. GE
Capital declined to comment.
   Several bankers said Clayton &amp; Dubilier's longtime lead
bank, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., is likely to organize bank
loans for an IBM deal. The bankers cautioned that they hadn't
yet seen Clayton &amp; Dubilier's exact financing terms.
Officials at Manufacturers didn't return phone calls.
   People familiar with Clayton &amp; Dubilier said they expect
the firm will strive to meet IBM's concerns. Recent Clayton &amp;
Dubilier acquisitions have let management and employees buy a
stake of about 25% in the post-buy-out company. Clayton &amp;
Dubilier "has made an effort to put equity ownership in the
broadest hands," an adviser to the buy-out firm said.
   Clayton &amp; Dubilier also has tried to assure IBM that its
acquisitions generally don't involve the big asset sales and
job cuts that have soured the public image of buy-outs.
Instead, Clayton &amp; Dubilier, led by its chairman, former
McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant Martin Dubilier, has portrayed
itself as a team of hands-on operating specialists, with
ideas on improving everything from a company's distribution
system to its inventory control.
   To date, Clayton &amp; Dubilier's largest acquisition has been
the $1.16 billion purchase of Uniroyal Inc. in 1985.
Recently, however, Clayton &amp; Dubilier has taken steps to
increase its buying power. It raised a $1 billion equity fund
last year from pension funds and other institutional
investors, triple the size of its previous fund. At the time,
Clayton &amp; Dubilier said it wanted to "participate in
transactions . . . above the $1 billion level."
   Several bankers said Clayton &amp; Dubilier's longtime lead
bank, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., is likely to organize bank
loans for an IBM deal. The bankers cautioned that they hadn't
yet seen Clayton &amp; Dubilier's exact financing terms.
Financial executives also said Clayton &amp; Dubilier is in talks
with General Electric Capital Corp., a unit of General
Electric Co., which is considering buying some subordinated
debt to help finance the transaction. Officials at
Manufacturers didn't return phone calls; General Electric
Capital declined comment.
   The indicated purchase price of $2.5 billion to $3 billion
would appear to include other operations besides typewriters,
keyboards and printers. Although IBM doesn't break out
results by individual product lines, its world-wide sales of
typewriters, keyboards and low-end printers are estimated at
less than $2 billion. Given the relatively low margins on
those businesses, any purchase price would presumably come to
less than the annual revenue.
   IBM spent $350 million in the early 1980s to modernize and
automate its facility in Lexington, Ky., where more than
4,000 employees build the products that are up for sale. But
it has apparently decided that it can't build the products as
efficiently as competitors can.
   IBM has been re-evaluating what businesses are central to
its strategy and has been selling some marginal assets. With
pressure from competitors unabating, IBM has aggressively cut
costs, to the point of taking a $2.4 billion write-off in
last year's fourth quarter to cover the costs of cutting
10,000 jobs and consolidating some plants.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
IBM shares closed at $119.875, down 87.5 cents.

   HHS Head Predicts
   Faster Approvals
   For Generic Drugs

   WASHINGTON -- Federal approvals for new generic drugs will
accelerate within "a period of months," Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan told a congressional
hearing.
   Dr. Sullivan's prediction offers hope to the industry and
consumers that the Food and Drug Administration will soon
recover from the disorder and demoralization brought on by
last year's generic-drug scandals. But Rep. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.) painted a bleaker picture, chiding Dr. Sullivan for
the FDA's "negligible criminal enforcement" and the
"continuing paralysis of the generic-drug approval process."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Disclosures last year of fraud and bribery by officials of
some generic-drug companies slowed the FDA's generic-drug
approvals to a near halt. The FDA, a part of the Health and
Human Services Department, went from approving 61 generic
drugs in April 1989 to 15 in May 1989, when congressional
hearings chaired by Rep. Dingell publicized the scandals.
Since then, generic-drug approvals have averaged fewer than
10 a month.
   Generics are lower-priced copies of brand-name drugs on
which the patents have expired.
   Top executives of several generic-drug companies,
including American Therapeutics Inc. and My-K Laboratories
Inc., have been convicted of charges stemming from the
scandal. In addition, a grand jury last month indicted Dr.
Marvin Seife, former director of the FDA's division of
generic drugs, on two counts of perjury.
   Generic-drug companies initially suffered a steep decline
in sales as pharmacists and consumers reacted to the news
that certain generic-drug companies had falsified data
submitted to win FDA clearance. Since January of this year,
however, sales have bounced back and are approaching a record
pace, according to industry analyst Hemant Shah of HKS &amp; Co.,
Warren, N.J.
   The slowdown in approvals has had a minimal effect on the
generic-drug industry, says Mr. Shah, because "there aren't
that many drugs which have gone off patent in the last couple
of years."
   But the FDA's slow rate of approval could spell trouble
for the generic-drug industry in coming years as a large
number of high-selling brand-name drugs -- called
"blockbusters" in the industry -- that entered the market in
the early 1980s come off patent and generic-drug companies
attempt to introduce their own versions. Among the brand-name
drugs affected are Ceclor, a popular antibiotic made by Eli
Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, whose patent expires in 1992, and
Tagamet, a popular anti-ulcer drug made by SmithKline
Beckman, Philadelphia, which loses its patent in 1994. The
combined annual sales of blockbuster drugs coming off patent
between 1991 and 1995 is estimated to be $10 billion.
   At yesterday's hearing, Before the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, Dr. Sullivan announced several steps to
improve the FDA's regulation of generic drugs. He said that
within the next week he would appoint an FDA ombudsman "to
address grievances that cannot be resolved by the agency's
line managers." He also announced the appointment of Roger
Williams, a pharmacologist at the University of California at
San Francisco, to head a newly created generic-drug office.
   These officials face a formidable task in attempting to
improve the FDA's regulation of generic drugs. According to
Dr. Sullivan, an FDA survey of generic-drug approvals
conducted in the wake of the scandals found deficiencies in
half of all products surveyed.
   Of particular concern are generic-drug tests conducted at
Biodecision Laboratories, Pittsburgh, which has done work for
almost every major generic-drug company. Eleven of 13
pre-approval drug tests conducted by the lab and surveyed by
the FDA were judged faulty by the agency. Among these were
tests for a generic version of doxycycline made by
Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains,
N.J., and a generic version of erythromycin made by Mylan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Morgantown, W.Va. Both generic
products are antibiotics.
   Biodecision President Robert Lecher said yesterday that
the lab had conducted extensive evaluations of the 11 tests
involved and found "no new evidence that would make us
question our work."
   But Dr. Sullivan said the FDA would hold up approvals "on
pending applications that may be affected" by any flaws in
Biodecision's procedures.

   Budget Talks Hit Snag as Republicans
   In House Vote to Oppose Tax Increases

   WASHINGTON -- The budget talks suffered a setback as a
White House meeting with top lawmakers failed to produce any
tangible results, and House Republicans overwhelmingly voted
to oppose raising any taxes to shrink the deficit.
   Top congressional Democrats said they agreed with
President Bush to strive for a fiscal 1991 deficit-reduction
accord in the next month, but they provided no reason for
optimism.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "No startling decisions were made," House Speaker Thomas
Foley (D., Wash.) said after the White House session.
   Mr. Foley said Democrats complained to the president about
a resolution approved yesterday by House Republicans that
opposes "new taxes and all tax rate increases as a means of
reducing the federal budget deficit."
   The speaker said it was "unfortunate" that Republicans
"approved a statement that repudiates the president," but
added that it wouldn't derail the summit. Other Democrats
gave harsher assessments. House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said, "It certainly will
have a chilling effect on how the Democrats approach the
summit." Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D.,
Texas), referring to the House Republicans, said, "Those
people are living in a dream world."
   Mr. Bush said he asked White House Budget Director Richard
Darman to continue talks with House Majority Leader Dick
Gephardt (D., Mo.) during the next few days. The budget
summit hasn't met for a week, but Mr. Gephardt said he may
convene a session as early as today. Congressional leaders
are to meet again with Mr. Bush on Monday, the White House
said.
   In the budget summit, negotiators are seeking a package of
tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the deficit by
about $50 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Democrats have been working on a tax package in
anticipation that the administration will soon offer one of
its own. Both the Democrats and the administration are
looking closely at a broad-based energy tax, particularly one
that levies a flat percentage on the prices of all types of
fuel.
   Rep. Rostenkowski said in an interview with NBC News
yesterday that "there will be a general increase in energy
taxes." Sen. Bentsen also spoke favorably about the energy
tax, saying in an interview that it "does not
disproportionately hurt any single region." Sen. Bentsen said
some way would have to be found to offset the regressivity of
such a tax.
   Earlier, Bush administration officials had been pushing a
so-called British Thermal Unit tax, which would have been
levied on different energy sources based on the amount of
energy they produce. But that approach has been criticized as
too complicated and as especially burdensome to
coal-producing regions. Congressional staffs are exploring
ways to raise between $12 billion and $15 billion a year from
a price-based energy tax.
   Shortly after his meeting with congressional leaders, Mr.
Bush said aboard Air Force One: "The deficit problem is so
serious that there must be a bipartisan, responsible answer,
and I will keep saying that."
   But the House Republicans' resolution, drafted by Rep.
Richard Armey (R., Texas), singles out Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell (D., Maine) for having "abandoned the summit
goals and emerged as a consistent roadblock," and asserted
that he "has championed tax increases at every turn."
   Asked for his reaction, Sen. Mitchell smiled broadly and
said, "This is essentially a dispute between the House
Republicans and the president. I don't want to get involved."
The senator reiterated his position that any accord requires
support from a majority of both parties.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said he urged Mr. Bush
and the Democrats not to let the vote by his rank-and-file
interfere with their objective. Another Republican budget
negotiator, Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel, sought to play down
the significance of the vote, arguing, "All it says is that
Republicans oppose taxes. We've always opposed taxes."
   Separately, the Senate Budget Committee voted 20-1 in
favor of legislation offered by Sen. Ernest Hollings (D.,
S.C.) that would exclude the Social Security surplus from the
calculation of the deficit under the Gramm-Rudman law. The
bill doesn't alter the deficit targets set in the law; Sen.
Hollings said that was up to the budget summit.

   NEW YORK -- The credit quality of American companies fell
at a record pace in the first half, as soft real-estate
markets, weak junk-bond issuers and a sluggish economy
undercut corporate creditworthiness, Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said.
   Corporate downgrades led upgrades by a margin of 4.2 to 1
during the period. In 1989, downgrades led upgrades 2.5-1,
and during the 1982 recession year they led 2.8-1, according
to Moody's, a unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The credit-rating concern said there are signs that the
quality of borrowers may start improving. Moody's said it's
reviewing 41 companies for possible downgrade and 15
companies for upgrade. That ratio, 2.7-1, is below the 3-1
ratio of possible downgrades to possible upgrades on Moody's
Watchlist at the start of the year.
   "While both the economy and earnings growth may remain
lackluster for the remainder of 1990, a recession that could
put considerable stress on credit quality appears unlikely,"
said John Lonski, Moody's senior economist. "The frequency of
downgrades to upgrades may thus have bottomed out, although
there are few signs that any marked improvement in corporate
creditworthiness is at hand," he said.
   In the first six months of 1990, rating downgrades
affected 217 companies and $235 billion of long-term debt,
while ratings of 52 companies were raised, affecting $50.5
billion of debt.

   BITING THEIR LIPS: Small business holds its fire on Bush's
tax switch.
   "Our feeling is there's nothing on the table to criticize
yet," says John Motley, chief lobbyist for the National
Federation of Independent Business, the largest
small-business trade group. He notes that the president could
take new taxes off the table if he doesn't reach a budget
agreement with Congress. National Small Business United calls
Mr. Bush's move "necessary and responsible" to get the
deficit and interest rates under control. Small-business
groups still want a cut in capital gains tax rates to be part
of any budget package.

<TEXT>
   "I just hope he trades that for something," J. W. Kisling,
chairman of the small manufacturers council of the National
Association of Manufacturers, says of Mr. Bush's pull-back
from his no-new-taxes pledge. Small businesses say new
broad-based energy taxes would hurt more than an excise tax.
They argue that changing tax rates or charging businesses
environmental or energy taxes could damp a recent push among
small manufacturers to export and be more competitive.
   Interest in exporting has doubled among small
manufacturers, who see it as a new source of growth in a
sluggish U.S. economy, Mr. Kisling says.

group, have increased about 20% in the last month. Even more
inquiries are anticipated once President Bush signs the bill
into law, as expected. The groups' advice still is general
because regulations governing the law probably won't be
completed for another year.
   Most small storefront businesses can begin by installing
ramps or widening doors for wheelchair users, the groups say.
An easy way to widen a doorway is by applying "swing clear
hinges" that let a door swing back beyond a 90-degree angle
when open, says the federal Architectural and Transportation
Barriers and Compliance Board. While some computer equipment
for disabled workers is expensive, "most state vocational
rehabilitation organizations will pay all or part of the cost
to help a company or an individual," says Larry Pencak,
Mainstream's executive director.
   The Small Business Legislative Council holds a seminar
this week on complying with the law, and the National
Restaurant Association plans a symposium in January.

   FALLING SHORT: The Federal Reserve Board's action last
week easing the rate banks charge each other for loans was
"too little, too late, and won't have any major effect on the
interest rates impacting small manufacturers," says Jerry
Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers. He urges more aggressive efforts to bring down
the prime lending rate. Last month, a survey of the NAM's
small and medium-sized members showed that a third of them
are finding it more difficult to obtain credit. Mr.
Jasinowski says the tone of the responses reflected even more
concern about the economy's slow growth.

   TO PAY OR NOT TO PAY the expenses of delegates who
otherwise couldn't afford to attend the proposed White House
Conference on Small Business is the question the House Small
Business Committee will debate next week. Rep. Neal Smith,
(D., Iowa), argues that without a subsidy, the 1994 meeting
could be controlled by the organized small-business lobbying
groups. Other committee members say the offer will encourage
those who can afford the expense to claim they can't. The
Senate Small Business Committee hasn't considered a bill on
the conference.

   ENTREPRENEURS studying Eastern Europe to get a boost from
Congress.
   Lawmakers are moving to help such business owners with a
new version of the Support for Eastern European Democracies
bill (SEED II). The legislation would establish at least two
American business centers in Eastern Europe to provide
translation and telecommunications services and market
research for smaller concerns. Poland and Czechoslovakia are
likely candidates for the first two centers, which are
expected to cost from $3 million to $5 million apiece to
establish, Senate staff members say.
   SEED II would also reauthorize a fund to provide venture
capital and loans for U.S. business projects, especially
joint ventures, in Eastern Europe. The first so-called
enterprise fund was aimed only at Poland and Hungary. "This
bill is designed to stimulate a program that's been slow to
get off the ground," says Sen. Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), one
of the bill's sponsors. The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee is expected to vote on the measure in the next few
days, and quick congressional approval is anticipated.
   In addition, the Small Business Administration says it
will recruit American small business owners to help train
East European entrepreneurs during six-week internships in
the U.S.

   U.S. Offers Soviets
   Detailed Proposal
   For Technical Aid

   PARIS -- The U.S. presented the Soviet Union a detailed
proposal for extended U.S. technical aid to Moscow in several
economic problem areas.
   The paper, handed to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze by Secretary of State James Baker at a meeting
here, offers no U.S. funds but promises U.S. expertise to
help improve such areas as banking, housing, the tax system
and distribution networks. The U.S. also is offering to help
with market education.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposal is a follow-up to the annual economic summit
last week in Houston, at which President Bush said direct
economic aid was premature and, instead, stressed technical
economic assistance.
   According to an aide to Mr. Baker, the secretary of state
emphasized U.S. help for changing the Soviet distribution
system. The official said Mr. Baker told Mr. Shevardnadze
that "It doesn't do the Soviets a lot of good if they are
producing a lot more goods or acquiring a lot more goods if
they can't distribute them."
   The official conceded that President Bush made a similar
offer to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev at the Malta
summit in December and that the technical advice projects
offered then hadn't yet been carried out. But he added that
Mr. Shevardnadze seemed anxious to accept the current offer
and that he told Mr. Baker he might appoint a small staff to
see that the technical assistance actually is delivered.
   Separately, the State Department official said Mr.
Shevardnadze didn't object to the U.S. policy of trying to
build ties to the new non-Communist opposition in the Soviet
Union.
   "Shevardnadze said that was understandable, he had no
problem with that," the official said.

   I am a Goddess worshiper who read your June 7 page-one
article "Is Goddess Worship Finally Going to Put Men in Their
Place?" As you say, Goddess worship is not anti-men or
anti-male. But your overall emphasis and tone contradict that
statement. Many (if not most) branches of Goddess worship
include a male deity and stress love and understanding
between the sexes. My personal experience is of a roughly
equal number of men and women who participate; the men are
not wimps and the women are not bitches.
   Some rituals and services in Goddess worship are designed
to let go of things that hold us back from our full human
potential and they may seem peculiar to those not familiar
with Goddess worship. You made almost no mention of the
reverence for nature, the acknowledgment of both female and
male energies in life, and the fulfillment for human
potential that truly make up Goddess worship as we know it
today.

   Shame on you for your patronizing and superficial article
about Goddess worshipers. I suppose if you went to a
Christian church, you would tell of a cannibalistic death
cult (referring to its practice of communion and the
crucifixes adorning church walls and worshipers' necks).
   Although you did touch on one of our basic beliefs -- that
all life is interconnected and that we strive for harmony
between all life on earth -- you failed to report how this is
related to our rituals, thus trivializing them. You also buy
into mainstream culture's "war between the sexes" when you
attempt to pit the men's spirituality movement against the
womens's.
   Most of us are working for a new kind of partnership
between women and men in which each is honored and respected.
Honor and respect are the last things present when women
treat men as success objects and men treat women as sex
objects. A lot of healing and relearning will have to happen
to overcome thousands of years of dominator/manipulator
culture.

   Your article reflected the patronization of women by the
establishment that we are trying to combat. The women
portrayed (all of whom took some other name, as if playing
make-believe) are shown as "giggling," primal screaming
man-haters.
   I do not use an alias, and I take my religion seriously.
This includes laughing and dancing and a sense of humor not
portrayed in your article. I do not worship on Groundhog Day,
but on Imbolc, the eve of February.

   A prehistoric, Goddess-centered culture has now been
described, marked by egalitarianism (not woman-dominance),
nurturing and focus on life-giving rather than life-taking.
   The overthrow and subsequent attempts at revival of that
nonviolent culture are a valuable part of this Goddess
scholarship. Dynamics between dominating forces vs.
equalizing/nurturing forces are presented as a useful tool
for the study of history and current events.
   I must confess that the religion and ritual of Goddess
culture do little for me; but the scholarship associated with
an ancient history too long obscured from our view may shed a
valuable, hope-rekindling light on the human condition. We
could use it.

   The laws and the national social philosophy of this
country are based on the Judeo-Christian tradition.
   In that religious tradition, the First Commandment refers
to one true God: "I am the Lord, thy God; thou shalt not have
strange gods before Me."
   The Bible is full of terrible, historical events, which
resulted in the collective spiritual judgments on the Jewish
and Christian peoples because of their worship of false gods.

   Taxing Sin -- As Bad As Taxing Virtue

ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)

<LP>
   When Washington becomes desperate in its search of new tax
revenue, it inevitably moves toward "sin" taxes. Taxes on
alcohol, tobacco, oil, gasoline, firearms and a host of other
sources are always fair game to politicians. Sin taxes help
politicians to avoid hornet nests -- income taxes for example
-- and to dodge the wrath of special interest groups that
contribute generously to re-election campaigns, such as the
financial and securities industries that would be singled out
by the proposed tax on securities transactions.
   At first blush it might appear that only a few industries
or individuals -- those directly in harm's way -- would
suffer greatly from sin tax hikes. Not so. Because items that
carry sin taxes are included in the U.S. Labor Department's
monthly survey of prices, higher "sin" taxes drive up the
Consumer Price Index. Everyone whose wages are tied to the
CPI by cost-of-living (COLA) clauses -- government workers,
veterans, Social Security recipients and unionized workers --
is exempted (partially or wholly) from the effect of sin tax
increases. Their advocacy of such taxes becomes self-serving
at the expense of the rest of the tax-paying public.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fact, because some 30% of federal outlays -- $400
billion -- is tied to the CPI, sin taxes can drive federal
spending upward in perverse ways. It might at first seem, for
example, that a 50 cent increase in the current 9 cent per
gallon federal excise tax on gasoline and gasohol would
generate an added $30 billion for Uncle Sam's coffers.
   That 50 cent tax hike, though, translates into a 51.4%
increase (on average) in prices of gasoline at the pump. And
"motor fuels" get a 3.3% weight in the CPI. So, that 50 cent
tax hike boosts the CPI by 1.7 percentage points. Funneled
through the federal government's COLA clauses, those 1.7
percentage points would add some $6.8 billion to federal
spending. If the federal government chose, as it likely
would, to offset the regressive effects of higher excise
taxes with bigger tax credits for low-income people, the cost
would be even higher.
   The combination, substitution or addition of other sin
taxes could alter the magnitudes of the results, but not the
principle. Worse, not only do sin taxes cost money -- they
habitually fail to raise as much as projected.
   Excise taxes on cigarettes were doubled in 1982. Revenue
from tobacco taxes (99.1% of which comes from cigarettes) at
first jumped nicely: to $4.14 billion in fiscal 1983 and then
to $4.66 billion in fiscal 1984 from $2.58 billion in fiscal
1981. But as consumers cut back their cigarette use, and as
the black market in untaxed cigarettes grew, tobacco revenues
contracted. By fiscal 1989, tobacco tax revenues had slumped
to $4.29 billion.
   Other examples are even starker. Over the past three
years, one excise tax rate after another has been raised.
Taxes that were due to expire -- such as the 3% tax on
telephone services -- have been retained. And yet total
federal revenues from excise taxes in fiscal 1990 are
estimated to be $35 billion -- no more than they were in
1987. Simply put, excise taxes are too easy to evade and
avoid to be very lucrative.
   And all of this analysis skips over the biggest problem of
all: The harm this artificial spurt in the CPI does to the
economy as a whole. COLAs pervade the private economy too,
and the higher labor costs that sin taxes impose on industry
will slow consumption and investment. In turn, a general
economic slowdown will reduce the federal government's take
from corporate and personal income taxes. A tax remains a
tax. Even the sin taxes that Washington contemplates so
eagerly would burden the productive economy.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   Civil Rights and Wrongs

   The struggle for hearts and minds in the black community,
which ultimately will be more important than the civil-rights
bill Congress is debating, has recently grown a lot more
complicated.
   Growing numbers of blacks are calling for self-help,
independence, progress through education and black
enterprise. In Milwaukee, for example, state legislator Polly
Williams conceived a school voucher program for the poor. Bob
Woodson, who has led an effort to convert public housing to
tenant ownership, this week was awarded a MacArthur
Fellowship, known in some quarters as "the genius grant."
Former EEOC head Clarence Thomas, now a federal judge, and
economists like Thomas Sowell voice similar sentiments.
Shelby Steele, an essayist and teacher, has lately garnered
considerable attention for writting on race and the harm done
by affirmative-action programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, grass-roots members of the black community are
showing some impatience with racism as the all-purpose excuse
for misbehavior, and with calls for racial solidarity at all
costs. Most especially, as the trial of Washington Mayor
Marion Barry accumulates evidence of drug use, a recent poll
showed blacks viewing the mayor negatively by a margin of 47%
to 19%.
   On the other side are the militants who are calling,
essentially, for a new black separatism. They include people
like minister Louis Farrakhan, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and
lawyers Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox, who gave us the Tawana
Brawley story. Include in this number, also, those calling
for an Afro-centered school curriculum for black children.
   Both groups pose challenges to traditional civil-rights
groups. Perhaps inevitably, that challenge has led to some
confusion -- the sort that was on display last week at the
NAACP's 81st annual convention, particularly by NAACP head
Benjamin Hooks. Throughout his career, Mr. Hooks has been
nothing if not eloquent about the responsibilities of black
leaders and image-makers. To take just one example, he
recently delivered a scathing denunciation of 2 Live Crew,
excoriating them particularly for trying to "wrap the mantle
of black cultural experience" around their "vicious and
sadistic" works. And in the course of his speech, Mr. Hooks
strongly attacked those who would use racism as an alibi for
the ills of the black community, and called for "a moratorium
on excuses."
   Yet in his fire-and-brimstone speech, Mr. Hooks charged
that black elected officials were being subjected to
victimization and harassment, comparable to the post-Civil
War Reconstruction era. The victimized official he apparently
had in mind was none other than Mayor Barry, whose
prosecution Mr. Hooks presented as a typical instance of
racial harassment, despite evidence that is nothing short of
overwhelming.
   Matters became still more confusing when at the same
convention, Mr. Hooks lashed out at black scholars who have
pointed out the harms that accompany affirmative action.
Referring to the scholars as "some of the biggest liars the
world ever saw," Mr. Hooks told a reporter, "They're just a
new breed of Uncle Toms as far as I'm concerned." Mr. Hooks
said he particularly resented one "lowdown dirty rascal" for
writing "a big story in a white magazine."
   The particular dirty rascal Mr. Hooks seems to have had in
mind was Professor Steele, who recently wrote a piece
published in the New York Times Magazine. In it, Mr. Steele
argued forcefully against racial-entitlement programs. He
noted that racial-preference programs did not teach skills or
educate, but that they did "encourage blacks to exploit their
victimization" while also stigmatizing them with an implied
inferiority.
   Mr. Hooks offers a melange of black attitudes, but it is
not clear for whom he actually speaks. Other influential
blacks were quick to take issue with some of his statements.
Columnist Carl Rowan wrote that Mr. Hooks encouraged
thousands of black youngsters at that convention "to wallow
in the absurd notion" that Mayor Barry was on trial because
of selective prosecution of black leaders. Is this
leadership, Mr. Rowan asked, "Or is it pandering to black
frustrations and hatred that are being fanned by Farrakhan
and those of his mentality?"
   The confusion coming out of the NAACP convention is part
of a larger ferment that signals an important turn in the
road toward black progress, and one that is a lot more
significant than the rhetoric wafted about the halls of
Congress. Over the past generation, blacks in general and the
NAACP in particular have won important and well-deserved
victories. But surely there's room for more players and new
thinking when as earnest a leader as Mr. Hooks finds himself,
in the name of the black community, attacking Professor
Steele and defending Mayor Barry.

   S&amp;L Cleanup Law's Measures Weakened
   By Court Rulings, Relaxed Regulations

   WASHINGTON -- As political accusations over the
savings-and-loan mess build, the tough measures in last
year's S&amp;L cleanup law intended to ward off a future disaster
are quietly being undermined by court rulings and eased
thrift regulations.
   The S&amp;L cleanup law, passed last August, forced thrifts to
abandon accounting rules that had allowed them to hide losses
for years. The law also wiped out contracts between the
government and buyers of S&amp;Ls in which buyers believed they
had special dispensation to continue using the accounting
rules. But in isolated cases, both are being weakened.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I think it's significant," says Karen Shaw of the
Institute for Strategy Development, a Washington banking
consultant. "Those are relatively unrelated events decided
for different reasons, but they are happening."
   In return for hitting up taxpayers for $130 billion -- not
including hundreds of billions of dollars more in interest --
the S&amp;L cleanup law racheted up capital standards. The
capital represents the investment that thrift shareholders
have at risk, and it acts as a cushion to protect the
taxpayer-backed deposit insurance fund.
   But already, four federal judges have blocked the Office
of Thrift Supervision from seizing insolvent institutions,
based on contracts that those thrifts had with the federal
government. And recently, the thrift office delayed a
provision of the S&amp;L bailout law that limited a thrift's
exposure to loss from any one borrower. The thrift office
then delayed for review a proposed regulation to increase the
amount of capital to be held for certain loans backed by the
Department of Veterans Affairs.
   The thrift office, which contends that capital standards
haven't been eroded, said it was appealing the four cases. A
spokesman said that the office has prevailed in four suits
filed by other thrifts seeking to block federal takeover.
   "The Office of Thrift Supervision believes that capital is
king," Director Timothy Ryan said yesterday. "We will do
nothing to erode the (cleanup law) capital standards, which
we view as the most important provision of the statute."
   The most recent court ruling was Monday, when federal
Judge Thomas G. Hull in Tennessee issued a permanent
injunction blocking regulators from seizing Franklin Federal
Savings Bank of Morristown, Tenn., with $107 million in
assets.
   The court ruled that the thrift had a solid contract with
the government in which the S&amp;L was permitted to count
certain losses as capital and therefore couldn't be seized as
insolvent.
   Some industry-watchers say the courts are just recognizing
what they have contended for the past year -- that Congress,
in a vengeful mood over the costs of the cleanup, went too
far. They say that the law set standards too high and that
the thrift office is inflexible. The Resolution Trust Corp.,
the new bailout agency, has so many insolvent thrifts to sell
that, to cut its losses, it is trying to find buyers for
failing S&amp;Ls even before they are seized.
   "You can sit in your ivory tower and dictate what should
be true, but when you are out there in the trenches, you have
to recognize reality," says Richard Kneipper, a Dallas thrift
attorney.
   Seven other court cases contesting capital rules are
pending in federal courts across the country, and more are
certain to be filed. Attorneys say that many of the suits are
frivolous but that some thrifts make a compelling case that
they were induced by the government to acquire failing S&amp;Ls,
based on the special capital provisions.
   "The law was passed in a spirit of blunt-edged machismo,"
says Ms. Shaw. "The regulators are now in between a very hard
rock and a very hard place."

   Gannett, New York Times Net Declined
   In 2nd Quarter, Reflecting Drop in Ads

   NEW YORK -- Two major newspaper publishers reported lower
earnings for the second quarter, reflecting a nationwide
slump in advertising so persistent it is now hurting one of
the industry's best performers.
   Gannett Co. and the New York Times Co., publishers of
daily newspapers in major cities as well as smaller markets,
had been expected to report lower earnings. Yet while the
falling ad market has battered the industry for at least a
year, Arlington, Va.-based Gannett's results were especially
noteworthy: It was the first time since going public in 1967
that it reported a quarterly earnings drop from the
comparable period a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gannett earnings were $105.3 million, or 66 cents per
share, compared with $112.1 million, or 70 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue fell 1% to $893.8 million from $904.2
million.
   Gannett sold a radio station in Seattle, but it
represented only a "minor" gain, the company said.
   Gannett executives blamed "continuing restructuring in the
retail industry and a deteriorating consumer economy" for
stalling the revenue growth. Major department stores, some
hit by bankruptcy reorganizations and consolidations, are
traditionally among Gannett's largest advertisers.
   Troubling for all newspapers is that classified
advertising continues its fall, after years of robust growth
in the 1980s. Gannett said classified volume at most of its
83 daily newspapers declined for cars, real estate and help
wanted.
   At Gannett's flagship, USA Today, the number of ad pages
in the first six months fell 9% to 1,780. Gannett said,
though, that ad rate increases and higher circulation
resulted in a revenue gain of 3% for the first half.
Gannett's outdoor advertising unit, the largest billboard
company in North America, reported an increase in revenue but
the broadcasting division, including radio and TV stations,
reported a decline.
   Peter Appert, analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc., called Gannett's drop in revenue troubling. "Earnings
will continue to be under pressure if revenues continue in
this range," he said. "And there's nothing in the next
quarter that says it will turn around."
   For the six months, Gannett said net fell 4% to $180.3
million, or $1.13 a share, from $187.0 million, or $1.16 a
share. Revenue for the first six months dropped 1% to $1.7
billion.
   At the New York Times Co., still reeling from slumping ad
linage at its flagship daily, the earnings drop wasn't as
steep as some analysts had expected.
   The company reported earnings of $26.8 million, or 35
cents a share, compared with $39.2 million, or 50 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose to $468.9
million from $460.3 million.
   "We thought they might come in at about 27 cents, so it's
better than we expected," said Jeffrey Russell, an analyst
for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "They are holding the
margins as well as they can, considering the poor ad climate
in New York."
   New York Times executives said the earnings drop was
largely a result of lower ad linage at the Times, brought on
by a weak New York area economy. Earnings also suffered from
the acquisition of McCall's magazine, and increased
depreciation and interest expense related to completion of
the Times's color printing plant in Edison, N.J. and a newly
constructed facility for the Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News.
   About 60% of the loss in ad linage at the Times was in
classified ads for help wanted, real estate and automotive.
   For the six months, net income was $43.4 million, or 57
cents a share, compared with $70.7 million, or 90 cents a
share, last year. Revenue for the period grew by 2% to $900.1
million.

   Chrysler Corp. Sees
   Negative Cash Flow
   In 1990 on Weak Sales

   DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. expects to end 1990 with
negative cash flow for the second straight year because
earnings from its sagging sales aren't covering its heavy
spending for badly needed new products.
   Robert A. Lutz, president of the company's Chrysler Motors
unit, said that the No. 3 U.S. auto maker will likely have
"slightly negative cash flow this year," which will turn into
break-even cash flow in 1991. He didn't give specific
figures, but industry analysts said Chrysler could see its
consolidated cash flow fall as much as $1 billion this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler managed to alleviate much of the pressure on its
cash situation earlier this year. A sale and lease-back deal
on its Auburn Hills, Mich., technical center -- which is
still under construction -- raised $1.1 billion for this
year. And the sale of its Gulfstream Aerospace unit added
more than $800 million.
   Chrysler common closed yesterday at $16, down 62.5 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   A big reason for Chrysler's negative cash flow this year
is its plan to spend $3.1 billion on new products and other
capital improvements. The spending is part of the company's
goal of spending $15.6 billion through 1994 to revamp its
vehicle lineup and improve facilities.
   While spending has increased significantly, weak sales are
driving down the company's earnings. Through the end of June,
Chrysler's domestic new-car sales were off 15% from a year
ago, while its domestic new-truck sales fell 13%.
   Analysts are forecasting Chrysler will report
second-quarter earnings of $138 million to $185 million, or
60 cents to 85 cents a share. In the 1989 second quarter,
Chrysler had net income of $341 million, or $1.46 a share.

   Dollar Ends Little Changed as Dealers
   Are Confused by Greenspan Testimony

   NEW YORK -- Confounded by the congressional testimony of
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, foreign
exchange dealers left the dollar about where they found it
yesterday.
   After hectic, seesaw trading, the greenback was up
strongly against the Swiss franc and marginally against other
European currencies but was slightly lower against the
Japanese yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At no point in his testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee did Mr. Greenspan give a clear signal on the
central issue of whether markets can expect lower U.S.
interest rates.
   The Fed chief confirmed that the recent quarter-point
decline in the federal funds rate to 8% was the result of
deliberate central bank action, but he said the move
addressed a technical constriction rather than an economic
stall.
   Mr. Greenspan said the Fed wants to keep credit conditions
"about where they are" and held out the possibility of
further monetary easing to offset tightness in the market.
   The central banker said the 0.5% rise in June consumer
prices reported yesterday was "higher than we would like to
see." He allowed that, for the U.S., the risk of recession is
"a shade larger" than that of inflation but said the
likelihood of a near-term recession "seems low."
   Mr. Greenspan "is obviously dancing on the edge of a very
teetery fence," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for
Nikko Securities. "Doing one thing and saying something
else," he said, allows the Fed chief to ease monetary policy
without losing the market's confidence in him as an
inflation-fighter.
   Jesse Torres, chief foreign exchange trader in New York
for Bank Brussels Lambert, concluded that Mr. Greenspan is "a
bull on the dollar."
   Valerie Walker, New York corporate foreign exchange
manager for Chicago's Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank, said the
Fed chairman "did a good job at balancing the Fed's
conflicting signals" and added that "we got pretty much what
the market expected."
   Still, Mr. Brusca said, "It was a very, very confusing
day. It always is when Greenspan speaks."
   It was also a tumultuous day, as dealers and investors who
had shorted, or oversold, the dollar ahead of the Greenspan
question-and-answer session bought that money back when the
resulting headlines proved ambiguous.
   The dollar-buying wasn't strong enough to break the dollar
out of its bounds. Several times, for example, the greenback
was slapped back down just after exceeding a technical
ceiling at 1.6490 marks. The last attempt to push the dollar
out of its range against the German currency occurred about
an hour before the close of global trading, when the U.S.
unit hit its intraday high of 1.6495 marks.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6480 marks, up from 1.6440 marks late Tuesday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 147.75 yen, just
below 147.80 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was trading at
$1.8155, down from $1.8165.
   The dollar also ended in New York at 1.4165 Swiss francs,
well above 1.4045 francs Tuesday. The U.S. unit's gains
against the Swiss currency were abetted by the selling of
francs against other nondollar currencies.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading at 148.10 yen
soon after the opening; it closed at 147.25 yen in Tokyo
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.6490 marks, up a bit from Tokyo's Wednesday close of 1.6436
marks.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $361.60 an ounce, down 40 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.2 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$361.75 an ounce.

   Steel Union's Troubles Get Even Worse
   ---
   Convictions of Two Top
   Officials Spark Distrust

   The United Steelworkers of America knew 1990 would be
tough.
   The union faces contract talks with the industry's most
combative negotiator, USX Corp. At the same time, it must
beef up efforts to find new dues-paying members to replace
thousands laid off in the 1980s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The year just got tougher. Last week, two high-ranking
union officials were found guilty of conspiracy and
violations of the Taft-Hartley Act. The government said the
union officials, along with USX, which was found guilty of 14
related counts, received secret pension benefits as part of a
conspiracy to win significant concessions in 1983. The
trend-setting pact ultimately resulted in reopening USX's
then-idled Fairfield, Ala., plant.
   Labor experts say the convictions could strain what
already promise to be tense negotiations with the nation's
largest steelmaker. More important, the convictions could
hurt the union's credibility among some rank-and-file
members, still smarting from such concessionary contracts.
   Although both the company and union say they're confident
the convictions will be overturned, the damage is largely
done. Buddy Davis, a union director, says that convictions
make big news, while reversals don't. Moreover, he says,
"even though I'm confident the charges will be dropped,
you'll still have people talking behind their {union
officials'} backs saying, `They got off the hook.' "
   The timing couldn't have been worse. The USW had finally
begun to get back on its feet after a decade marred by
layoffs and divisive elections for top officials. It had
become more militant -- weathering a tough strike against USX
in 1986, its first in 26 years -- and more progressive by
creating employee-owned plants. Furthermore, membership had
stopped its downward spiral in recent years, and last year
the union negotiated rich contracts with four major
steelmakers.
   "In the last five years, we've pulled together and gotten
a lot more unity," says Mr. Davis. "This is the last thing we
need."
   Some rank-and-file members, feeling cheated, have already
sued the union. A group in Birmingham, Ala., seeking wages
and benefits lost in the concessions, claims the union
breached not only its fiduciary duty but its duty of fair
representation. And Larry Regan, president of Local 1014 in
Gary, Ind., plans to file a second suit. He said the
Fairfield pact set a pattern of concessions -- including
reducing work crews to unsafe levels -- for future contracts
at plants around the country. "You had people committing
suicides and being injured because of these concessions," he
says.
   The union already is seeing the impact on its efforts to
gain and retain members. At O'Neal Steel Inc. in Birmingham,
where 250 union members in four plants voted to decertify the
union, the indictments against the union officials became a
campaign issue. "We certainly weren't bashful about
mentioning it," says Raymond Lindsey, O'Neal's vice president
of human resources.
   Andrew Turner, who was the local president until the
decertification, says members were more concerned about job
security than about the indictment. "But this hurt. Some
members said they didn't want a bunch of crooks representing
them," he says.
   The union has warned its organizers that companies would
use the conviction as an anti-union club. "I'm sure this is
going to bite us in some places," says Mr. Davis. Membership
in his own district has dropped to 18,000 from a high of
36,000 a decade ago, and he has fewer staff members trying to
organize a larger number of small plants.
   One point the union is stressing in its defense is that
most companies offer pension benefits to union officials --
which the court has deemed illegal. A Department of Labor
survey found that 62% of U.S. manufacturers provide such
benefits to labor representatives even though they're
employed by unions.
   Carl Frankel, a USW staff attorney, says the convictions
"won't cause us to lose an {organizing} election that
otherwise we'd win. No doubt we'll have to deal with this,
but we've had other challenges, and we'll get through this
one."
   How last week's verdict will play out with USX
negotiations isn't quite clear, but some people say the union
and USX, both fearing any cozy appearance, might be more
hard-nosed than normal.
   The Steelworkers want to pattern contracts after one
signed last year by Bethlehem Steel Corp., the first major
steelmaker to reach an accord. USX has already scoffed at the
pact, calling it "too generous." Moreover, the company is
willing to sell its steel operations at the right price, and
it can threaten during talks to do so to a less
union-friendly company.
   Ben Fischer, director of the Center for Labor Studies at
Carnegie Mellon University, fears that the ruling will ban
nearly all collaborative arrangements, even if they benefit
rank-and-file workers and employers. It could also taint any
concessionary contract, even when it's needed for a company
to survive.
   "The only thing that becomes safe is arms-length
adversarial relationships," he said. "That way, even though
you may destroy the institution, you protect yourselves."
   Labor experts also warn that the convictions could
increase friction between top USW officials and local plant
presidents, making it more difficult for the union to
solidify its negotiating stance against USX. Local leaders
have always wanted more control over individual plant issues,
such as holidays, contracting out and maintenance schedules,
but with the convictions they may feel more justified in
distancing themselves from headquarters.
   "There has always been friction," said economist Don
Barnett. "This just means more mistrust."

   Republicans Seek Guarantees From Democrats
   On Spending as Part of Deficit-Reduction Plan

   WASHINGTON -- When the subject of the budget process came
up at the deficit talks recently, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady was out of town, Budget Director Richard Darman came in
late and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) slipped out early
to go to a ball game.
   Clearly, "budget process" is a topic that bores even the
most devoted of the budget negotiators. In two months of
talks, they've devoted precisely one day to it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But don't be fooled. Changing the process is critical to
getting a budget accord because the White House has made it a
top priority. Many congressional Republicans, convinced that
past bipartisan accords have failed to limit spending, agree.
The House Republican Whip, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, told
fellow negotiators the other day that if he had to walk out
of the room uttering the "T-word," they would have to utter
the "C-word" -- control of spending.
   What President Bush and the Republicans are looking for is
some guarantee that any tax increase will go to reduce the
deficit -- not to fuel more spending. That means pushing
Democrats to establish in advance firm spending totals for
defense and domestic programs for the next five years, and
then finding a way to make that promise stick. "Whatever we
come to agreement on would have to be enforceable on a
multi-year basis," says Mr. Darman. "That has never been
possible before."
   In speeches, Mr. Bush has highlighted the need for a
line-item veto -- a change favored by conservatives that
would give the president the power to pluck wasteful
porkbarrel projects out of massive spending bills.
   But the line-item veto isn't considered a realistic
solution. In private, Bush administration officials concede
that Congress isn't about to surrender so much power to the
president. Moreover, it isn't clear that the veto would be
much help in cutting the deficit. "It's symbolic," says
political scientist Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think tank. "The president would find it
extraordinarily difficult to do anything with the line-item
veto that would add up to numbers that would make any
difference as far as the deficit is concerned."
   Efforts to change the budget process to enforce a
bipartisan deficit-reduction accord are undeniably arcane.
"The public doesn't understand the process, and you can't
explain it to them," says Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.).
But the process can be immensely important. The Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law has been driving tax and spending
policy for the past five years. And because any change in the
process tends to alter the balance of power in Congress, the
resistance to altering the budget process is substantial.
   Any agreement at the budget talks to raise taxes or save
money on benefit programs like Medicare or Social Security
will be written into law and won't require new enforcement
mechanisms. But the spending levels for the Pentagon and for
domestic programs ranging from space to sewers are less
certain. Those spending levels are set annually and, as a
result, the congressional appropriations committees can
easily undo any agreements made by the summiteers.
   Republicans want guarantees that that won't happen. "I
want assurance that, but for absolutely unexpected events,
the end result is achieved," says Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico, senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
   Participants in the talks say Mr. Darman has proposed
fixing by law five years of spending totals for defense,
overall domestic programs and foreign aid, a step that
basically would prevent any changes to the summit
understandings without the president's consent.
   An alternative plan being circulated by the private
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget would alter the
Gramm-Rudman law to target automatic spending cuts
specifically at appropriations subcommittees that overspend
their allocations. A subcommittee that overshot its target
one year would be penalized the following year. The
Gramm-Rudman deficit targets would be dropped in favor of the
new spending ceilings.
   Democrats are resistant to all these proposals. "I don't
want to be a party to any mechanism that diminishes the
constitutional authority of Congress to control spending
bills," says Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser
(D., Tenn.). Some Democrats say they might go along with new
parliamentary hurdles for spending bills that exceed
summit-set totals, but the summit isn't likely to resolve the
process issues until after it strikes a compromise on a
package of spending cuts and tax increases.
   Much of the disagreement isn't about how much the
government spends in total, but what the money goes for. The
administration, for instance, wants the summit to set a floor
under defense spending to protect it from attempts to make
deeper cuts in the future. Some Democrats complain that the
world is changing too fast to lock in a five-year commitment
now.
   In the end, though, the issue is one of power rather than
policy. Democratic and Republican members of appropriation
committees cherish their role in divvying up the federal
spending pie. Negotiators from both sides expect Sen. Robert
Byrd (D., W.Va.) and Rep. Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.), chairmen
of the appropriations committees, to be among the last
obstacles to an agreement on writing rules to enforce a
summit agreement.
   Even convening the ad hoc congressional-White House summit
steps on their toes. Indeed, Rep. Whitten occasionally rises
from his chair at the summit talks -- the only participant
who stands to speak -- and protests that the entire
enterprise is improperly encroaching on his turf.

   LOS ANGELES -- An investor has sued Dataproducts Corp. and
its chief executive officer, Jack C. Davis, for allegedly
issuing false and misleading positive statements about the
company before its stock took a tumble last September.
   The drop in the stock price, to $9.50 a share on Sept. 8
from as high as $13.875 in August, came after Dataproducts
announced a restructuring that resulted in a one-time charge
of $45 million. That move came as Dataproducts sought to
resist a hostile bid from DPC Acquisition Corp., a New York
investment group led by Crescott Investment Associates. This
year, Dataproducts was acquired by a venture formed by two
affiliates of Hitachi Ltd., the Tokyo-based electronic
equipment maker, for about $160 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nadeem Faruqi, a purchaser of 100 Dataproducts shares,
said in his lawsuit filed in federal court here that the
misleading statements began May 3, 1988, with a news release
calling "solid ink technology" the future of office printing,
when the company knew it was facing technical and marketing
difficulties.
   The Woodland Hills, Calif., maker of computer printers and
other data handling equipment also covered up problems with
its SI 480 printer and airline ticket printing products, the
suit charges.
   Mr. Davis said yesterday that he hadn't seen the suit and
thus couldn't comment on it.
   The suit, which seeks class-action status on behalf of
those who purchased stock between May 3, 1988, and Sept. 7,
1989, seeks unspecified damages.
   In the year ended March 31, Dataproducts had a net loss of
$8.1 million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $333.7
million. It had net income of $3.8 million, or 19 cents a
share, on revenue of $353.4 million the year before.

   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade modified their "circuit breaker" trading halts
that would be activated by sharp one-day swings in stock and
stock-index futures prices.
   The revisions were made in accordance with recent
recommendations from a New York Stock Exchange panel on
market volatility, and have been submitted to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission for approval. The changes are
conditional on their acceptance by the Big Board and other
stock and stock options exchanges, the Chicago futures
exchanges said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wild price swings in stock-index futures prices were
blamed by many for worsening the slide in stock prices during
the October 1987 stock market crash and last October's
mini-crash. Futures industry officials generally reject that
notion, but have acceded to circuit breakers and other
restrictions to avoid more onerous oversight from federal
regulators.
   Trading would be halted for one to two hours in Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock-index futures trading at the Merc each time
the S&amp;P 500 contract moved up or down 12, 24, 36 and 44 index
points. The Merc's current circuit breakers are triggered
when the S&amp;P 500 contract moves 12 and 20 points. A
five-point price limit during the opening minutes of trading
will remain in effect.
   The Board of Trade revised circuit breakers for its Major
Market Index of 20 blue-chip stocks to take effect at swings
of 20, 40, 60 and 80 index points. The exchange's existing
circuit breakers take effect at downward moves of 20, 30 and
50 index points, and as a result of an upward spike of 50
index points.
   The stock-index future circuit breakers correspond with
moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 100, 200, 300
and 400 points.

   Companies listed below reported quarterly profit
substantially different from the average of analysts'
estimates. The companies are followed by at least three
analysts. Results in parentheses are losses.
   The percent difference compares actual profit with the
30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues
forecasts in the past 30 days. Otherwise, actual profit is
compared with the 120-day estimate.
