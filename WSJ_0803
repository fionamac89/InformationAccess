   Safety Board Urges
   Check of Wiring
   On Boeing Planes

   The National Transportation Safety Board is recommending
an inspection of fuel-switch wiring on all Boeing Co.
737-300, -400 and -500 jetliners in the wake of a May
explosion aboard a Philippine Air Lines jet that killed eight
people.
   Safety officials say they think the explosion in the
plane's center fuel tank may have been caused by defects in a
"float switch," which is used in fueling the plane, and
faulty wiring to the switch. The blast occurred as the
late-model Boeing 737-300 prepared for takeoff from Manila
with 119 on board. A bomb was initially suspected as the
cause, but the safety board said its investigation found "no
evidence of a bomb, an incendiary device, or sabotage."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Boeing, based in Seattle, said it "doesn't believe that
sufficient evidence exists to call for any fleetwide
inspections of 737 components or the wiring." Such a
directive would mean inspection of some 750 planes.
   The safety board's recommendation is being considered by
the Federal Aviation Administration. "We have not decided
what means and on what schedule to implement" the safety
board's recommendations, said Anthony J. Broderick, associate
administrator for regulation and certification for the FAA.
Part of the problem is that a fleetwide inspection of the
switches and wiring would require "development of procedures
and tests which don't yet exist," he said.
   In addition to recommending inspections of the wiring on
the 737 fleet, the safety board asked that tests be developed
to ensure that the float switches "are free from defect that
could cause an explosion or fire."
   "From a technical point of view, we are looking to see if
there is a way of testing" the float switches, said Ronald A.
Buchanan, president of Revere Aerospace Inc., a Dobson Park
Industries PLC division that makes the devices. As for the
safety board's suggestions of problems with the float switch,
he said: "There were no defects in the switch."
   The safety board concedes that its investigation, being
conducted in conjunction with the Philippine government, "has
yet to reveal the exact ignition source." Other
possibilities, the board said, include the airline's
installation of additional wiring near the fuel tanks for
wing lights, which could have led to damage that caused the
explosion, or defects in a fuel pump. Mr. Broderick said the
FAA is already working with Boeing to test the fuel pump
system.
   The possibility of an inspection of the twin-engine 737s
for wiring defects once again brings up the specter of
quality problems that have plagued Boeing in recent years. In
May, the FAA ordered airlines to inspect pilot controls on
737-300s, -400s and -500s after a missing cotter pin caused a
control wheel to come off in a co-pilot's hand. Last year,
after flaws were discovered in fire-extinguisher systems in
the engines and cargo bays of some aircraft, a world-wide
inspection resulted in reports of 94 separate instances of
defects, on almost every Boeing model. Boeing has said it has
taken steps to improve production-line quality, including
redesigning the fire-extinguisher wiring.

   Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and the Kuwaiti oil industry
seems sure to be felt quickly by Americans. But just how
severely isn't so predictable.
   World oil prices surged yesterday after Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein sent troops rolling across his nation's
100-mile border with Kuwait and swiftly conquered the tiny
sheikdom. The startling move threatens to put oil prices on a
new, higher plane that could continue for years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Oil in the teens is, for the foreseeable future,
nostalgia," predicts Shahrokh Nikkhah, a senior vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities. He sees U.S. crude
oil prices settling into a range of $26 to $27.50 a barrel.
Only weeks ago, U.S. oil was selling as low as $16 a barrel,
and some less-desirable Mideast crudes were $4 a barrel
cheaper than that.
   How far oil prices might rise in the near term is a
guessing game. Much depends on the next moves not only by
Iraq and its Persian Gulf neighbors but also by the
industrialized nations that consume most of the world's
petroleum. And most of all, it may depend on the U.S., which
immediately barred Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude -- now in Iraq's
hands -- from American shores.
   Erratic as they are, oil prices could of course fall as
fast as they now are climbing. Industry fundamentals really
haven't changed yet; there still is a world oil glut, and the
price increases are largely due to a change in market
psychology.
   World oil markets were thrown into turmoil yesterday,
however, with prices surging between $1.50 and $3.50 a barrel
for the day. In the U.S., spot prices of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark crude, topped $23 a barrel
yesterday. Another key oil, North Sea Brent, rose from $20.20
a barrel to $22.70.
   For Big Oil such news was cause for rejoicing. Though
companies will pay more for any oil they buy, most also drill
for, produce and sell crude themselves. What they get for
that oil will be up just as sharply. Also, refining profits
can improve despite higher raw material costs if end products
like gasoline go up enough.
   But government officials in Washington estimate that the
rise in oil prices that has already occurred, if it sticks,
could add a full percentage point to consumer prices over the
next year. It also could cut a half percentage point off the
nation's growth -- a serious blow to an economy growing at an
annual rate of just over one percentage point.
   The hit could be felt most acutely by gasoline buyers, who
might have to pay an extra 10 cents or so a gallon, and later
this year by families who heat their homes with oil.
Consistently higher oil prices also would be a heavy blow to
airlines and the chemical industry. They would make life more
difficult for auto makers, both domestic and foreign.
   With control of Kuwaiti reserves, Iraq now has the power
to drive up oil prices, according to Philip Verleger, senior
fellow at the Institute for International Economics. "They
can easily make a $25-a-barrel price happen," he believes.
"They could even make $30 a barrel."
   For some time, however, the impact of any Iraqi moves will
be softened somewhat by current unusually high levels of oil
stocks. Mr. Verleger says stocks total about 1.65 billion
barrels, compared with the normal 1.5 billion. Moreover, the
U.S. strategic petroleum reserve, squirreled away in
underground salt domes in Texas and Louisiana, now is big
enough to carry the country through any temporary supply
disruptions.
   However, some 60% to 70% of the oil imported into the U.S.
is priced on the basis of spot-market quotes, and a surge in
spot prices would be felt quickly.
   There's no denying American vulnerability. With domestic
oil production slipping gradually but inexorably, about half
of U.S. oil supplies are now imported. In the first five
months of this year, Iraq and Kuwait combined were the
fifth-largest suppliers to the U.S., after Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela, Nigeria and Canada, according to the American
Petroleum Institute. Iraq provided about 610,000 barrels a
day, and Kuwait about 121,000. Together, that was about 9% of
U.S. oil imports. OPEC as a whole provided about 54%.
   How tough things get for U.S. oil users will depend
largely on how hard a line the U.S. takes against Iraq and
Iraq-controlled Kuwait. Many oil traders spent much of
yesterday trying to figure out how new U.S. import curbs will
be implemented. "We're walking around here saying, `stay
calm, stay calm, stay calm,'" says Gerard Vetromile, vice
president of crude trading for Chevron Corp.
   President Bush's order is already causing temporary
dislocations. Mr. Vetromile says Chevron took title to some
Iraqi crude two weeks ago, but the oil hasn't yet arrived at
the company's giant Pascagoula, Miss., refinery. "If the U.S.
government says we can't take that crude, it could create a
refining problem for us by next week," Mr. Vetromile says.
   American Petrofina is already stuck. It has four million
barrels of Iraqi crude at sea heading toward its refinery in
Port Arthur, Texas. One tanker carrying 500,000 barrels is
due today. "We've been told by the customs people that we
cannot unload that crude," says Ron Haddock, chief executive.
He says the company has only a three-week supply of crude on
hand and is being forced to hunt for other supplies.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat, predicts that
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
may be intimidated by Iraq into sticking to their production
quotas. "The implications for this country are stark," he
says. "OPEC discipline has now been insured by the point of a
gun."
   At a joint news conference in Colorado yesterday
afternoon, President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher didn't address directly the question of whether the
industrial nations would engage in a full-scale embargo of
oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Any such oil embargo would be far different from that in
1973. Then, it was producers who struck against consumers. A
1990 embargo, should it occur, would be a consumers' boycott.
That this could even be contemplated probably is a tribute to
the stored supplies of the Western nations, as well as Iraq's
isolation from the rest of the world, including Arab
neighbors.
   However, the upshot in the marketplace of such an
eventuality could match that of the past -- surging oil
prices. And whether the U.S., Europe and Japan could deal
more effectively with such a surge remains to be seen.
   If America's embargo isn't widely observed, it would mean
little. Oil is a fungible commodity, and its ownership can
easily be disguised. And as of last night, there wasn't any
indication that the U.S. would press other nations hard to go
along.
   But even oil prices modestly above current levels could do
some damage. "Our economy would change from a growing to a
declining economy by the fourth quarter," says Donald
Ratajczak, economic forecaster at Georgia State University.
   Michael Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, attempted to play down the effects in
testimony yesterday morning on Capitol Hill. A 25% rise in
oil prices would have "some deleterious impact on our
economy," he acknowledged, but he argued that "our economy
today is much better able to absorb modest price increases."
He noted in an interview later that companies now have more
flexibility to switch to natural gas and other forms of
energy.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Toby Roth, a Wisconsin Republican, urged
fellow lawmakers "to focus an eagle eye" on what oil
companies do about pricing.
   Whatever the oil companies plan to do, people ranging from
economists to truckers are scrambling to figure out how to
cope with suddenly unpredictable oil prices. And some
service-station operators are already talking about
gasoline-price gouging -- by their competitors.
   "There's going to be some gouging out there, you can be
sure," says Sasan Faraji, manager of Fenway Park Exxon in
Boston. He says he won't raise his prices unless his own
costs go up. But a nearby competitor, whom he won't name, has
just added another 5/10ths of a cent to his prices, he
alleges. "All this just hit us this morning," he says.
"People are still trying to figure out where Kuwait is -- or
was."
   Gasoline prices in California have just gone up five cents
a gallon, though apparently the rise is due to a gas-tax
increase aimed at expanding mass transit and improving road
maintenance. Stephen R. Shelton, executive director of the
Southern California Service Station Association, expects
retail gasoline prices to increase, but not for at least 30
days because of current ample inventory.
   Eventually, though, motorists may take a heavy hit.
Generally, each $1 increase in a barrel of crude could
translate into about 2.5 cents a gallon at the pump. Thus, a
sustained $4-a-barrel increase would drive gasoline up almost
10 cents a gallon. Already, American Petrofina says it is
raising gasoline prices by a nickel a gallon. Among those
feeling the effects of this would be the auto industry.
   The Iraqi action catches foreign and domestic auto makers
in the middle of a move toward more powerful, less fuel
efficient cars spurred by a relative decline in gasoline
prices during the late 1980s. New-car fuel efficiency has
fallen two years in a row, after rising steadily since 1978.
Japanese auto makers contributed heavily to this decline,
introducing new models with powerful V-6 and V-8 engines.
Now, auto makers face the risk of a consumer shift in buying
patterns.
   A 10-to-20-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline prices might not
have much impact, "but 50 {cents} would," says Bennett E.
Bidwell, chairman of Chrysler's automotive operations. Adds a
Toyota spokesman: "We figure that to have any effect on
sales, it would have to be at least a quarter."
   If consumers do react to this latest oil problem by
returning to smaller, more efficient cars, Japanese auto
makers seem best-positioned -- much as they were more than a
decade ago. The average fuel economy of cars sold by Toyota
Motor Corp. in the U.S. is 31.8 miles to the gallon, down
from Toyota's 33-mile-a-gallon average a year ago but still
better than the domestic average of 26.9 miles to the gallon.
Nissan's average is 30.8 miles a gallon.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., despite major
advances in fuel economy, still rely heavily on full-size,
V-6 and V-8 cars for their U.S. profits. Chrysler Corp.'s
highest-profit vehicles, minivans and Jeep Cherokees, average
less than 20 miles a gallon in city driving.
   As voracious consumers of fuel, airlines will feel the
higher prices rapidly. The airline industry estimates that
every penny rise in the price-per-gallon of jet fuel adds
$150 million to annual costs.
   "We're on our third bottle" of antacid, says Jack Zaves,
who manages the fuel needs of American Airlines, which uses
some 2.4 billion gallons of jet fuel a year. "How do you
plan?"
   UAL Corp., the parent of United Air Lines, has said that
every penny change in the price-per-gallon of jet fuel causes
an approximately $22.5 million change in United's annual fuel
bill. The huge carrier is accustomed to major changes. Its
average cost-per-gallon last year was 64 cents, up from 56
cents in 1988 but far below the 83 cents in 1985. Most of
United's fuel is provided under contracts with major U.S. oil
refiners, but it also purchases minor volumes of fuel on the
spot market at Gulf Coast and New York Harbor locations and
offshore from the Mideast.
   "Fuel surcharges are imminent," promises Dean Cannon,
president of Cannon Express Corp., a Springdale, Ark.,
trucking company. Fuel accounts for about 22% of his
operating costs, and Mr. Cannon says that by noon yesterday
it is was already going up. He says he plans to send a letter
today to warn about 500 of his customers of higher rates.
   The threat of possibly sharply higher oil prices is
already being felt all around the industrial world. The
inflationary potential is a big problem for countries such as
Britain, Italy and Spain, which are already struggling to
wring out stubbornly high inflation. For countries fighting
to stave off a recession -- Britain as well as the U.S., for
example -- that problem has suddenly become worse, too. Even
under the threat that slowdowns will turn into recessions,
central bankers will find it more difficult to reduce
interest rates while climbing oil prices are pushing up
inflation.
   On the other hand, an excessive climb in oil prices would
depress world-wide consumption. "Forces like recessions come
into play," says Tom Burns, a Chevron economist. "So demand
goes down a bit. This has been of extreme concern to some
OPEC producers."
   Moreover, higher prices would encourage the U.S. and other
non-OPEC countries to expand oil development that isn't
profitable when prices are lower. "Longer-term, oil that is
today marginal or not economic suddenly becomes considerably
more attractive," Mr. Burns says. He cites the expansion of
enhanced-recovery projects in existing U.S. fields. In
addition, West African and Latin American countries could
raise their oil output if prices climb. The Soviet Union and
Mexico still have a lot of untapped oil.
   Previous price surges, in 1973 and 1979, ended for
precisely such reasons. Consumption declined for several
years, partly because of widespread conservation. And
supplies expanded as oil companies stepped up development of
new areas such as Alaska's North Slope and the North Sea.
Beginning in 1980, OPEC, for the first time in its history,
lost market share.
   The economic jolts from higher oil prices could be
widespread, however:
   -- For West Germany and Japan, the expected rise in oil
prices may well be the last straw that pushes central bankers
to increase interest rates. Tokyo stocks entered a tailspin,
amid expectations of higher inflation and a move by the Bank
of Japan to raise the discount rate it charges on loans to
financial institutions.
   -- For Spain and Italy, higher oil prices are damaging.
"Italy is very reliant on external supplies of energy," says
Eugenio Namor, an economist at San Paolo Bank in Turin. He
predicts that recent reductions in inflation will be
reversed.
   -- For struggling East European states, Iraq's invasion
may make it all the more painful to wean themselves from
subsidized oil purchases from the Soviet Union. Not only will
they have to pay hard currency for oil and gas but also
higher prices than expected just last week.
   -- For Sub-Saharan Africa, a higher cost of oil imports
could cut deeply into hoped-for economic growth. With
interest rates stuck at lofty levels or rising, the cost of
capital also will be a constraint.
   The specter of higher energy prices especially worries
Japan. Surging oil prices in the 1970s triggered severe
inflation and forced companies to restructure their
manufacturing operations drastically.
   This time, Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche
Bank AG, predicts another response from Japan: "an export
offensive in Europe." He reasons that with the
already-sluggish U.S. economy hit by higher energy costs,
Europe will be the one major market to which Japan can turn.
Japan's financial institutions, however, may well concentrate
their investments at home, at least for several months.
   In any event, one clear winner is Mexico. Each $1-a-barrel
increase in oil prices raises its revenues about $500 million
a year, bolstering its balance of payments at a time when it
is under pressure.
   Mexico will face its own frustrations, though. Petroleos
Mexicanos S.A., the state oil monopoly and the world's
fifth-largest oil company, has limited room to increase
production and take advantage of higher prices. Since
Mexico's debt crisis exploded in 1982, public investment in
the oil company, known as Pemex, has plunged about 75%.
   "I don't think there's anything significant they could do
in the next three months or so to raise production," says
George Baker, a Berkeley, Calif., oil consultant who follows
the company. "Fundamentally, they're at a full-production
schedule now and have been for a year."

   United Technologies Unit to Eliminate
   4,000 Jobs Due to Military Spending Cuts

   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt
&amp; Whitney aircraft engine unit, responding to Pentagon
spending cuts, said it would eliminate 4,000 jobs, or 11% of
its domestic work force, over the next three years.
   The cuts, to be split between operations in Connecticut
and Florida, are expected to be attained largely through
attrition. But some layoffs are probable, the company said,
including as many as 300 this fall in West Palm Beach, Fla.
The cuts will affect all categories of staff, from hourly
production workers to engineers to senior managers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I do expect selective work force adjustments will be
required in some areas," James G. O'Connor, Pratt &amp; Whitney's
top executive, told employees in a letter yesterday.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
United Technologies shares closed at $56.875 a share, down
$1.625 a share.
   The company has a $20 billion backlog of orders for
commercial jetliner engines and the flow of new orders
remains strong, Mr. O'Connor said. But with deliveries spread
over the next decade, he added, "we do not see the commercial
workload sufficiently offsetting the decline in military
sales."
   About 35% of Pratt &amp; Whitney's $7.1 billion in revenue
last year came from military contracts. That percentage is
expected to shrink to 25% by the time the newly announced
cost-cutting plan is completed in 1993, a spokesman said.
   Many aerospace companies, including General Dynamics
Corp., General Electric Co., Lockheed Corp. and Northrop
Corp., have announced layoffs and other cuts in recent months
as the prospect of deep military spending reductions has
grown. In the largest such action, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
said last month it would eliminate up to 17,000 jobs, or 11%
of its work force, by year's end.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney last trimmed its rolls in 1988, when it
began a program to reduce its salaried staff by 2,600
positions.
   The company currently employs nearly 37,000 employees in
the U.S., with about 25,400 working in four Connecticut
plants and 8,400 based in a research and development facility
in West Palm Beach. Beyond those sites, the latest cuts will
also extend to smaller plants in Georgia and Maine; about
7,000 employees working abroad won't be affected.
   Already, about 150 positions in Florida have been trimmed
since January through attrition, and the company is counting
on a 6% companywide annual attrition rate to yield the
remainder of the new reductions. A spokesman said it's too
early to know how many layoffs would occur -- and what the
related costs would be -- if attrition alone doesn't work.
   The military squeeze is expected to hit hardest at Pratt &amp;
Whitney in early 1991, when company orders expire for the
F-404 engine, used in the F-18 fighter, and the J-52, which
powers the A-4. The company has also made engines for the
SR-71 reconnaissance plane, which the Pentagon has canceled,
the F-15 and F-16 fighters, for which demand has trickled,
and the new C-17 cargo plane, now the target of budget
slashing in Washington.
   To minimize layoffs, the company said it will train and
transfer some employees now doing military engine work to new
jobs within Pratt &amp; Whitney or in other United Technologies
divisions. A spokesman said the company hopes to help
compensate for the military cuts by expanding its engine
overhaul and repair business, pushing for more space program
contracts and boosting the use of its gas turbine engines to
generate electricity.
   A union official with District 91 of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which
represents 14,000 hourly Pratt &amp; Whitney employees in
Connecticut, pledged to work with the company to avert the
need for layoffs.
   "Now is not the time for either the country, or the
company, to abandon these fine workers," said Andrew
Romegialli, District 91's directing labor representative.

   Unocal Unit's Profit
   Fell 45% in 2nd Period
   On Lower Oil Prices

   LOS ANGELES -- Union Exploration Corp., the 95%-owned
production and exploration arm of Unocal Corp., reported a
45% plunge in second-quarter net income, largely because of
lower crude oil prices, unsuccessful drilling efforts and
higher well-repair costs.
   The company, formerly Union Exploration Partners Ltd.,
said net slid to $28.3 million, or 11 cents a partnership
unit, from $51.5 million, or 21 cents a unit, a year earlier.
Revenue fell 2.9% to $172.9 million from $178.0 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As of 9 a.m. EDT yesterday, Union Exploration ceased to be
a limited partnership and was converted to corporate status,
now trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Pacific stock
exchanges under the symbol UXC.
   Union Exploration was established in the wake of a 1985
takeover battle lead by Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr.,
who sought to acquire Unocal. As part of its settlement with
Mr. Pickens, Unocal agreed to put many of its oil and gas
producing and exploration properties in the limited
partnership.
   The company said adverse trends in the latest quarter were
partly offset by higher volumes of natural gas sales. Daily
natural gas sales rose 13% to 480.4 million cubic feet from
426.2 million cubic feet a year earlier. Crude oil sales
averaged 54,300 barrels a day, compared with 54,200 barrels a
year earlier.
   Exploration and development outlays rose 31% to $76.1
million from $58.2 million a year earlier.
   Net in the first half fell 38% to $98 million, or 39 cents
a partnership unit, from the year-earlier $157.6 million, or
64 cents a unit, which included $61.4 million in one-time
gains for natural gas contracts. Revenue declined 8.1% to
$377.7 million from $411 million.
   Unocal on Monday reported a 38% surge in second-quarter
net income to $165 million, or 70 cents a share, as a result
of a $132 million one-time gain from the sale of the
company's Norwegian operations.

   They Did Pick a Name Suggesting
   The Possibility of a Thorny Path

   CINCINNATI -- Pete Rose Way, by any other name, would
smell a lot sweeter.
   The City Council thought it made a hit when it named a
street after Mr. Rose in 1985. But with the former baseball
star heading to prison this month, the city's action looks
more like an error.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the city changed the name of Second Street six days
before Mr. Rose broke Ty Cobb's hit record, it slid under
regulations that require people to be dead for at least five
years before having streets named in their honor. Now, after
Mr. Rose's tax-fraud conviction, the council feels caught off
base.
   "This was done very hastily," says Councilwoman Bobbie
Sterne. "It's a great public lesson."
   Reggie Williams, linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals
turned city councilman, wants to take Mr. Rose's name off the
downtown street. But he knows he may be caught in a rundown
for bad-mouthing Mr. Rose. "Pete Rose walks on water in
Cincinnati," he says.
   Others balk at changing the name. "There were about
500,000 Cincinnatians who agreed with us at the time," says
Councilman Peter Strauss. And besides, he adds, changing the
name could cost the city about $400,000 in new signs.
   That's not to say the city council hasn't discussed the
problem.
   Councilman James Cissell proposes renaming the boulevard
"Wager Way." Ms. Sterne thinks the city could save money by
painting over the "Pete" on all the signs. One letter in the
Cincinnati Enquirer suggests "Cooperstown Bypass," referring
to Mr. Rose's dwindling prospects of being named to
baseball's hall of fame.
   The two-mile, six-lane Pete Rose Way is the first thing
many visitors see when they enter the city. It also passes
under the Suspension Bridge, a geographical coincidence that
has assumed new meaning since Mr. Rose's suspension from
baseball last year for gambling.
   Pete Rose Way isn't the only celebrity street in town.
Cincinnati boasts the usual Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln
and Madison streets, and it also has roads honoring Martin
Luther King and "Mad" Anthony Wayne, the Indian fighter. But
in this city, Pete Rose tops the list of notables. "Probably
a higher percentage of people know Pete Rose than knew Mad
Anthony Wayne," says city engineer Thomas Young.
   Maybe that's why they waited until Gen. Wayne was dead.

   Gold Surges on News of Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait,
   But Prices Retreat on Profit-Taking, Other Selling

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Like a fizzling rocket, gold prices shot up on
news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, then fell back as they
encountered profit-taking and other selling.
   "Trading was incredible at the beginning, but quiet at the
end," said Ian MacDonald, vice president at Credit Suisse,
New York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It was a typical knee-jerk reaction that lacked
follow-through," said William O'Neill, senior commodities
strategist for Merrill Lynch.
   Traders decided that, for the time being, the situation
wouldn't worsen, analysts said. They cited condemnation of
the invasion by the U.S., as well as by the Soviet Union and
France, Iraq's largest arms suppliers. And they noted the
comments of the Iraqi ambassador to the U.S. in Washington
that his nation's troops may withdraw from Kuwait in a matter
of weeks.
   Heavy sales by producers, who took advantage of the rally
to fix the prices of their gold at high levels, countered the
gains. Another dampening factor was that crude oil prices
erased about 50% of their initial advances.
   Precious metals futures prices ended mixed and at or just
above the lows of the day. The soonest-to-expire August gold
delivery traded as high as $386.50 an ounce, which
represented a gain of $13.20 from Wednesday's close, before
slumping to finish at $376.80 for a gain of just $3.50. The
most-active December delivery also ended with an advance of
$3.50 at $385.90, just 30 cents above its low, after trading
as high as $394.50.
   September silver rose one cent an ounce to $4.8650, just
half a cent above its low, after being as high as $4.9700.
October platinum's early gain turned into a loss at the
close; it ended $1.70 an ounce lower at $490.50. That was 50
cents above the low and down from the day's high of $501.
   Credit Suisse's Mr. MacDonald said that just before the
gold close he was on the telephone with clients in Kuwait.
"The fighting had died down considerably," Mr. MacDonald
said. "Sporadic firing could still be heard, but it was
quieter than early in the day. The Kuwaitis are very
concerned. Marketwise, we face some very volatile days
ahead."
   Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals
Advisors of Toronto, observed that in the past decade gold
has gone through wars and all kinds of major global upheavals
and hardly reacted to them.
   "What was the difference now?" he asked. "World-wide
supplies of gold are much tighter than people realize. That
wasn't the case during previous crises. Traders are still so
shell-shocked from the Saudi Arabian sales that they have yet
to become really aware of how the supply-demand situation has
changed."
   A critical factor that will determine gold's future
behavior will be whether the current advance sticks, Mr.
Nichols said. "If it doesn't, it will reinforce the belief
that nothing can really help gold prices to rise. If it does,
there's a good possibility that we can see a $400 price by
the end of the year," he said.
   Early in the day, analysts acknowledged that, in the
tinder-box situation of the Middle East, an Iraq emboldened
by its foray into Kuwait might be encouraged to broaden and
intensify the strife by attacking Saudi Arabia. The two
nations share a long border, and Saudi Arabia also has been a
target of Iraqi criticism over oil policies. However, these
analysts thought such a scenario was unlikely and saw the
crisis as a short-term one, politically and for oil and gold.
   "Everyone's trying to second-guess {Iraqi President}
Saddam Hussein's intentions," said Vahid Fathi, analyst for
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben of Cleveland. "It could be the
annexation of territory disputed with Kuwait, or he may just
be trying to make the point that he is the boss of the Middle
East, or both."
   It is unlikely that he will attack Saudi Arabia, but the
possibility is always there, he said. "It's obvious that
political observers underestimated his willingness to make
war. However, I don't want to read any more into this than
there is at the moment."
   Mr. Fathi said he would have liked to have seen gold's
prices "struggle" up rather than rise so sharply. But he
predicted that after fluctuating, the spot gold price would
rise to $385 or $390 an ounce.
   Anthony Rizzuto Jr., assistant vice president and metals
and mining analyst for Nomura Research Institute America, New
York, saw the Middle Eastern crisis as injecting further
underlying strength into gold.
   "With the Soviets selling diamonds to De Beers to gain
hard currency, the fear that they and Eastern bloc countries
will sell gold has lessened, and that has had a positive
impact" on the gold market, he said.
   Strong oil prices lead to higher gold prices because oil
and gold tend to move similarly, he said, and the possibility
of declining interest rates is indicating softness in the
U.S. economy. "Gold competes with interest-bearing
investments, and gold is looking better against them now," he
said.
   Gold prices are going higher in the fourth quarter and
early next year, Mr. Rizzuto said, and might get up to $425
in the first quarter of 1991.
   One analyst who remained bearish was Ronald Shorr of Bear
Stearns, who said gold would go down before it rises. His
reason: "lower inflation and the era of peace that has
developed between the Soviet Union and the U.S., which has
taken away a great deal of world tension."
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices again rose to new life-of-contract
highs and traded over a three cent-a-pound range before
closing almost unchanged. The September contract ended with a
gain of 0.05 cent a pound at $1.2890, after trading as high
as $1.2980 and as low as $1.2680. Analysts said offsetting
factors tended to create the volatility. On one hand, an
analyst noted, there is strong demand for copper from Japan
and West Germany. Also, there is the expectation that
supplies will tighten toward the end of the year, in part
because producers have encountered operating difficulties. On
the other hand, it's expected that the London Metal Exchange
will report today that warehouse supplies rose as much as
10,000 tons. Also, another analyst noted, the surge in oil
prices caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait could cool
Japan's economic growth, which consequently would reduce
demand for copper.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: The price of pork belly futures
contracts declined the daily limit of two cents a pound for
the second day in a row, eroding part of a strong price
increase that occurred, off and on, over the last two weeks.
Analysts said a significant increase in the number of hogs
reaching the slaughter market exerted downward pressure on
pork belly futures prices. The increase in fresh slaughtered
hogs has the effect of diminishing interest in frozen pork
bellies, which tends to push futures prices down, said
Charles Levitt, livestock analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton
in Chicago. Rumors also were circulating yesterday that Iraq
might renege on $2 billion in loans that are guaranteed by
the U.S. Agriculture Department because of the U.S. response
to its invasion of Kuwait.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices ended mixed after falling sharply.
The soonest-to-expire October contract recovered from a drop
to 73.90 cents a pound to end at 75.39 cents, down only 0.03
cent from Wednesday. The most-active December contract
rebounded 1.65 cents from a low of 70.01 cents to settle at
71.66 cents, up 0.29 cent for the day. There were no new
developments to account for the volatility. According to
Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache
Securities, the early losses were an extension of a
deterioration in prices of as much as seven cents a pound
over the past month. There have been some recoveries during
the decline, but yesterday's sharp rebound was stronger than
expected, Mr. Simon said.

   WAIOTAPU, New Zealand -- For several hours now, beekeepers
have been turning their flatbed trucks off State Highway 5
headed for a clutch of tin sheds. On board are honeybees --
millions of them.
   The sheds are the first stop in a journey that will end
more than 7,500 miles away in Canada where the bees will
start a new life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Welcome to Russell Berry's bee farm, nestled in the
rolling green hills between Rotorua and Reporoa on a volcanic
patch of earth called Waiotapu.
   Not much more than a wide place in the road, Waiotapu
boasts four houses, a pub, a gaggle of geysers, boiling mud
ponds, and a population of 20, most of whom work at Mr.
Berry's Arataki Honey Ltd.
   It was the area's geothermal energy and its potential to
fuel his honey-processing business that drew Mr. Berry here
30 years ago. Steam belches from hot spots in the land around
the sheds. A whiff of sulfur is in the air. And bees are
everywhere.
   There are bees in the family car. Bees in the office. In a
nearby yellow brick farmhouse, there are bees in the
bathroom. Bees in the kitchen. Bees in the wash. "They are
always folded up where I can't see them," frets Annette
Berry, who is taking the laundry off the line in the backyard
and who has an unfortunate affliction for a beekeeper's wife:
She's violently allergic to bee stings.
   Mostly there are bees in the main tin shed known as the
honey house. They are pioneers in New Zealand's burgeoning
trade in live bee exports.
   Arataki Honey is one of the nation's largest bee
exporters. In fact, with 17,000 hives, the family-owned
company is the country's biggest beekeeper, about three times
bigger than its nearest rival. "We used to say we were the
biggest beekeepers in the British empire," says Mr. Berry.
But the empire isn't what it used to be, so now he bills
himself as the biggest beekeeper in the Southern Hemisphere.
   The honeybee itself is an import, brought to New Zealand
150 years ago by an English settler known in local bee lore
only as Miss Bumby. Over the years, New Zealand bees have won
a reputation for being good-tempered. Furthermore, their
isolation has kept them relatively free of such ailments as
mites that are a bane to bees elsewhere.
   They are the envy of apiarists around the world who have
been buying the country's queen bees for the past 15 years.
But in 1985, demand soared for whole hives of bees, or
packages of a queen and 9,000-odd worker bees, turning the
annual live bee trade into a thriving, albeit modest, NZ$1
million (about US$585,000) industry.
   What set the market off was a mite infestation in the U.S.
that began to close the bee border with Canada, cutting off
Canadian beekeepers' usual supply. Because it is costly to
keep bees during the cold Canadian winters, beekeepers
normally kill off their hives and start with new stock the
next year. "All of a sudden, there was a big panic about
where to get the bees," Mr. Berry says.
   He was unsurprised if a bit unprepared for the export
upturn. He had been eyeing North America for some time, but
he expected the demand to come later from the U.S., where the
Africanized bee has been heading from South America. Its
dreaded arrival could mean a bonanza for New Zealand's 6,700
beekeepers. They believe that as the sting-happy "killer
bees" infiltrate local hives, American beekeepers will
scramble for New Zealand's placid bees to temper the
onslaught.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Berry is busy polishing his bee-export
techniques, which can be trickier than the uninitiated might
think. The bees fly to Canada -- in the cargo holds of
regularly scheduled passenger flights. And they need special
attention. "Bees can't get too hot or too cold or too
hungry," he says. And they can't get too nervous.
   Putting bees in a confined area "is like putting a paper
bag over a claustrophobic" person, says Murray Reid, a New
Zealand government bee inspector. "They start to fan their
wings and generate body heat and quickly self-destruct." So
Mr. Berry perfected a bee case with 600 well-placed holes
that keep the air flow constant.
   Still, unexpected problems arise in transit. Like the
llama episode. It was Easter Sunday when the Berry family
arrived at Auckland International Airport with a truck full
of bees. The llamas were already there, waiting to go to
Canada -- on the same flight as the bees. When the Berrys
learned that the bees were to be unloaded in Honolulu while
the llamas were sprayed on board with insecticide, Mr. Berry
had visions of his bees succumbing to the spray's lingering
fumes. It took a dozen telephone calls over the next 12 hours
before Mr. Berry could turn the situation around: The bees
stayed on board, and the llamas were sprayed outside.
   To be packed for travel, the bees are quickly dumped out
of their hives into metal bins and rushed to a makeshift
packing area sheathed in a giant mosquito net. There,
shrouded workers bundle the bees into their travel tubes. In
goes the final touch, an inflight meal of a big sticky sponge
soaked in sugar water. By day's end, 704 tubes -- about six
million bees -- are ready for export. And as night falls,
they are loaded onto a flatbed truck.
   At the airport, the truck's driver stores the bees in a
refrigerated cargo room. Unsuspecting passengers check in for
the Sunday 1:15 p.m. flight, blissfully unaware that among
their fellow passengers on the 14-hour journey to Vancouver
are six million honeybees.

   It is apparently Herbert R. Northrup's anti-union bias
that leads him to denigrate the proposal of United Air Lines'
unions to buy the company ("Not All Employee Ownership Plans
Will Fly," Manager's Journal, July 2). There can be no other
rational explanation for confusing employee ownership with
employee control, as he does.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to his unsupported assertion that "union power
and management control" will be "concentrated in the same
hands" at United, a fair reading of the public documents and
statements of the principals involved in the deal leaves no
question that professional management -- not union leadership
-- will run the airline.
   In fact, the governance and management structure
contemplated for United is no different than that of scores
of successful public and wholly or partially employee-owned
companies with union or stockholder representatives on the
board.
   Basic research would have revealed to Prof. Northrup the
overwhelming evidence that neither union politics nor
short-term planning typifies the management of these firms.
Indeed, at 100% employee-owned companies, exactly the
opposite is true, as it is at any profit-oriented
corporation.
   Such a normal corporate approach is all the unions are
seeking. After five years of merger mania, wild
diversification and revolving-door CEOs, the unions saw no
other way to stabilize their company than to buy it. Clearly,
they are not going to destabilize it now by trying to run it.

   Mr. Northrup's information on seniority is incorrect.
During the initial Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP)
meetings more than three years ago, we posed this question to
the advisers: "Certainly you do not expect us {Air Line
Pilots Association} to run this company?" They responded:
"No, professionals will do it." It appears to me that Gerald
Greenwald of the United Employee Acquisition Corp. is well on
his way to this end.
   If Mr. Northrup had read the history of the Air Line
Pilots Association (ALPA) and been cognizant of the events in
the past 10-plus years at United, he would have known about
management's efforts to displace organized labor from the
property when they should have been aggressively seeking to
make United Airlines the No. 1 carrier.
   ESOP is not a pipe dream, but an opportunity for
enthusiastic employees to make a service-oriented company
great; and once they do so, they can share in its success.

   ---
   For Mr. Northrup, putting labor in the pilot's seat is
tantamount to a corporate tailspin -- contradicting the
proponents' assertion that shared responsibility is a virtue.
Both perceptions stem from the way the employees' financial
interest is structured. Shifting a (reported) $2 billion in
employee compensation out of the category of wages and into
that of shareholder revenue acts as a fulcrum in matters of
corporate governance. The question is, in whose favor will
strategic decisions tilt: labor or capital?
   To the proponents of employee ownership, this question is
irrelevant. From their viewpoint, compensating employees in
the coin of capital will cause the interests to coalesce,
propelling the firm to superior performance. Both parties
stand to benefit.
   But does this interpretation bear scrutiny? On the
superficial level of "employee motivation" it is appealing,
but it overlooks a fundamental point: By accepting an
uncertain capital reward, the employees are taking on a risk
appropriate to the long run -- and giving up a contractually
guaranteed wage appropriate to the need for "income now." To
the extent of this exchange, they will be working at the
behest of management without any certainty of reward.
   What happens when a risky investment opportunity confronts
the need for job security and a predictable income stream?
What would be the reaction to introducing an innovative
operating technique that threatens working relationships and
relative rates of pay? At such a juncture, the commonality of
labor and capital interests is likely to undergo a subtle
transformation into an alliance between labor and management
-- in opposition to the shareholder interest in maximizing
residual profits. Management's stake in conducting "business
as usual" will be commensurate with that of the employees.
And decisions that are risk-averse will be justifiable in the
interest of maintaining labor peace.
   In other words, on top of the rigid escalation of wage
rates pointed out by Mr. Northrup, this unimaginative
proposal for employee investment imposes an operational
straitjacket. In the competitive environment of a deregulated
airline industry, UAL shareholder complacency would not seem
well-advised.

   Mr. Northrup writes that the ESOP attempt at United will
fail because, "When union power and management control are
concentrated in the same hands, the result . . . is likely to
lead neither to fiscal responsibility nor to more democratic
participation by individual workers."
   Even though the ESOP initiative did not begin until almost
a year later, Mr. Northrup attempts to blame the Air Line
Pilots Association for the failure of the Frontier deal
because in his words, "A merger of United with Frontier would
have added millions to the cost of ALPA taking over control
of United." The insinuation is that ALPA did not want the
Frontier pilots to come over at United pilots' contractual
rates. Exactly the opposite was true. Richard Ferris,
then-chief executive of UAL, did not want the Frontier pilots
to be paid at United contract rates under any circumstances.
This was illustrated in litigation by the former Frontier
pilots in a federal district court, which ruled that one of
the primary reasons for Mr. Ferris's pursuit of Frontier was
to use the Frontier pilots' relatively low pay scale as a
lever in negotiations with the United pilots.
   In a completely separate deal less than 12 months prior,
Mr. Ferris, who wanted a smooth merger of the Pan Am Pacific
division into the United operation, acted differently. He had
no objection to an even larger number of former Pan Am pilots
being merged with full seniority and full pay. For most of
these pilots, that action resulted in a 30% raise and a much
higher total cost to United than the Frontier deal would ever
have been.
   Mr. Northrup then goes on to say, "The proposed machinists
union agreement also exhibits unbridled union power." He
insinuates that the machinists will set terms and conditions
for nonunion employees and have "carte blanche to organize
the thousands of United's nonunion clerical and reservations
employees." The machinists' union by law has always had the
right to attempt to organize anybody, and employees have the
right to vote yes or no for representation, as the passenger
and reservations agents at United have done several times. As
for setting terms and conditions for nonunion employees, that
is just not true.
   The most astounding of Mr. Northrup's statements was that
directors' decisions would be made on a "political basis
rather than on a long-range economic basis, because union
officials must make re-election their prime objective." In
1980, when United was the largest carrier in the U.S., Mr.
Ferris stated that "there is no money in the short-haul
market" (a statement that USAir loves to this day). The UAL
directors heartily embraced Mr. Ferris's philosophy,
resulting in the start of United's slide toward its current
No. 2 position. Was that decision based on long-range
economic planning or a desire to stay in Mr. Ferris's good
graces and enjoy all the perks associated with being a board
member of UAL?
   For Mr. Northrup to say business decisions made by
United's management and board will be done so in order to
ensure re-election of its unions' leaders is ludicrous: All
union work by representatives of the Association of Flight
Attendants and ALPA is strictly voluntary -- recall is no
threat to a volunteer.

   Stocks Tumble World-Wide on Invasion by Iraq,
   Its Effects on Oil Prices, Inflation, Interest Rates

   News of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent the Tokyo stock
market into a tailspin Thursday. The Nikkei index of 225
issues, which was off 197.67 points Wednesday, fell 592.81 to
30245.18, the market's sixth decline in the past seven
sessions.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index continued its decline
and ended the morning session at 29953.47, down 291.71
points. Earlier, it had been off more than 500 points.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fallout from the Mideast situation blanketed the world's
stock markets, most of which posted steep declines because of
concerns about the potential economic effects. London share
prices finished a dismal session sharply lower and at the
day's minimums, on the heels of Iraq's invasion and the
accompanying repercussions from higher global oil prices.
   At one point in Tokyo, the benchmark index plunged below
the 30000 mark, as the currency and bond markets also
weakened, but stocks recovered as selling was absorbed.
Program buying linked to indexes helped prices rebound
moderately from intraday lows. Trading volume was light, with
about 400 million shares changing hands in the first section,
down from 439.9 million shares on Wednesday. The Tokyo Stock
Price Index, or Topix, of all first section issues, which
fell 5.88 points Wednesday, dropped 31.25 to 2215.43. The
second section index, which added 13.93 points a day earlier,
rose 8.13 to 4444.39, on volume estimated at 37.74 million
shares, up from 37.216 million shares Wednesday.
   Analysts said the decline was prompted by worries that the
conflict in the Middle East might lead to steep increases in
the price of crude oil, which in turn could raise costs for
Japanese manufacturers. Japan relies on imports for roughly
two-thirds of its energy needs and is the world's largest
importer of crude oil. Only 6.6% of Japan's oil imports come
from Kuwait, but the fear among investors in Japan is that by
taking control of Kuwait, Iraq will be in a stronger position
to persuade other oil-producing nations to raise their
prices. The dollar's rise on the yen, sparked by safe-haven
buying as an inflation hedge on the Iraq-Kuwait news, also
swayed stock market sentiment, traders said.
   To forestall the threat to the market of the possibility
that higher oil prices could translate into inflation,
analysts said, the Bank of Japan might raise interest rates.
Most analysts attributed the poor performance of the Tokyo
exchange in recent weeks to investor fears that central bank
officials might make good on hints about another increase in
the discount rate, the interest rate that the central bank
charges on loans to financial institutions. Before news
reports of the Iraqi incursion, many observers believed the
stock market had declined enough to discount the potential
effect of a rate change. Now they aren't so sure.
   "If you'd asked me yesterday if this market could slip to
its April low, I'd have told you definitely not," James
Vestal, an economist at Baring Securities (Japan) Co., said.
"It's difficult to see why the market should sell itself off
in the absence of some sort of external shock. But now we'll
have to wait and see."
   "Basically, everything is pointing in the direction of
higher interest rates," Russell Jones, an analyst with
UBS-Phillips and Drew International Ltd., a British
securities concern, said. "If crude oil reaches $25 a barrel,
its very hard to see how the Bank of Japan can avoid putting
the {discount rate} up again."
   The dreary outlook is further clouded by concerns that the
Iraqi incursion may result in a withdrawal of Kuwaiti
investments from the Tokyo market. One of the world's largest
investors, the Kuwaiti government has more than $100 billion
invested overseas, about $8 billion of this in Japan,
according to the Japan-Kuwait Friendship Society.
   Morihiko Iida, a senior strategist at Morgan Stanley
Investment Trust Co., believes the Tokyo market will shake
off jitters about oil prices and rebound within two or three
weeks. He said the market's afternoon rally demonstrates its
resilience.
   Peter Tasker, a strategist at Kleinwort Benson Co., a
British securities company, wasn't so upbeat. "You'd have to
be very, very optimistic to come and buy in this market now,"
he said. "I see no indication that the downtrend is
finished."
   Trading volume has been off nearly two-thirds since the
Tokyo market plunged nearly 28% in the first quarter, and
news of the Iraqi move helped keep Japan's already sluggish
investors out of the market. "With all the other negatives
around, investors are saying, `Here's even more reason to sit
on your hands,'" Stuart Matthews, an analyst with Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan) Ltd., a British brokerage
house, said. "There's a lot of uncertainty and a lot of
risk."
   The risk of higher energy prices has a strong
psychological effect on Japanese investors, analysts said,
because of the national trauma stirred by oil crises in the
1970s. Sharp increases in crude oil prices in 1973 and 1974
triggered severe inflation in Japan and forced Japanese
companies to restructure their manufacturing operations
significantly.
   Teikoku Oil rose 60 yen to 1,360 yen ($9.24), Nippon Oil
rose 40 to 1,430 and Mitsubishi Oil was unchanged at 1,320.
   Interest was strong in high-priced blue chips, led by
gains in Nintendo, which ended at 31,200, up 1,800. Nippon
Telegraph &amp; Telephone rose 20,000 to 1.06 million.
Seven-Eleven rose 90 to 8,790.
   Nippon Mining rose 27 to 919, Mitsubishi Mining was up 4
at 735, Mitsubishi Metal advanced 19 to 880, and Sumitomo
Mining added 10 to 1,560. Asahi Diamond closed at 3,000, up
10.
   Domestic stocks sensitive to interest rates, particularly
shipbuilding, construction and steel, were much lower.
Ohbayashi Corp. lost 30 to 1,500, Nippon Hodo fell 100 to
3,580, Maeda Construction was down 70 at 2,010, and Kajima
fell 30 to 1,690. Taisei Corp. fell 40 to 1,160, and Shimizu
Corp. sank 40 to 1,840. Nisshin Steel fell 13 to 805,
Kawasaki Steel was down 9 at 509, and Daido Steel fell 8 to
870.
   In London, excluding the oil sector, stocks were knocked
broadly lower, as the market interpreted the events in the
Persian Gulf to mean that higher oil prices would boost
Britain's inflation rate, now 9.8%, and keep British base
interest rates at least at current 15% levels. Wall Street's
sharp decline also was a drag on the London market,
commentators said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell
34.5 points to 2304.5, which also was the intraday low and
well below the opening peak of 2347.9. Volume was a brisk
561.5 million shares, compared with 419.2 million shares a
day earlier, though 77 million shares of Thursday's total
were traded in British Petroleum alone. The Financial Times
30-share index lost 41.4 to 1811.4.
   While the prospect of higher oil prices helps correct the
balance-of-payments shortfall in Britain, Paul Harrison, a
vice president at Salomon Brothers International in London,
said it "does little to alleviate the pressure on inflation."
Moreover, the government has said evidence of lower inflation
is needed before the pound enters the exchange-rate mechanism
of the European Monetary System, which now could be delayed,
he said.
   But market watchers generally said they didn't see any
panic selling during the session. The major performer was
British Petroleum, which advanced 21 pence to 361 pence
($6.70). BP shares were viewed as most vulnerable to any
supply disruptions in the Middle East. Kuwait's investment
arm owns a 9.9% stake in BP.
   Shell Transport &amp; Trading added 13 to 496, on robust
volume of 14 million shares. Enterprise Oil rose 8 to 676,
Ultramar gained 7 to 349, and Lasmo advanced 17 to 461.
   Sectors sensitive to interest rates were severely
disrupted, with building and property issues hit hardest.
Land Securities shed 17 to 513, British Land skidded 16 to
292, Tarmac dropped 10 to 260, Hammerson lost 14 to 685, and
Trafalgar House retreated 12 to 283.
   British Aerospace rose 5 to 564, because of the increased
tension in the Mideast. The company supplies arms to the
region and is the main contractor for the Al Yamamah
agreements with Saudi Arabia.
   Elsewhere, stock prices retreated broadly in Paris,
Frankfurt, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid, slid on thin trading
in Zurich, and tumbled across the board in Amsterdam, all on
worries about the Iraqi military action's effect on oil
prices, inflation and interest rates. Brussels prices fell,
though most oil stocks there fared well on the Kuwaiti news.
South African gold stocks closed sharply higher.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney and Manila, and lower
in Taipei, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and Wellington. The
Sydney stock market surged after the government unexpectedly
eased domestic interest rates, and the Mideast news helped
propel gold and oil shares. Stocks plummeted in Hong Kong and
fell sharply in Singapore and Taipei on the invasion report.
Manila equities were buoyed by speculation that gold will
rise, because of the Iraqi move. Wellington prices fell
sharply in continuing fallout from Wednesday's jump in
domestic interest rates.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   Factory Orders
   In June Slipped
   By a Steep 1.5%

   Durable Goods Take Brunt
   Of Decline in New Sign
   Of Slowdown in Industry

   WASHINGTON -- June factory orders declined a sharp 1.5%,
providing fresh evidence that the health of the U.S.'s
manufacturing sector is deteriorating.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders fell to
$237.4 billion in June after increasing a revised 2.2% in May
to $241.1 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Taken with other recent economic news, the orders data
suggest that "there are renewed signs of weakness in
manufacturing following some signs of firming" earlier in the
year, said Norman Robertson, chief economist for Mellon Bank
in Pittsburgh.
   "The outlook for manufacturing employment is certainly
bleak," he said. "The prospect for output is for lackluster
gains at best over coming months." Mr. Robertson said he
believes that the economy will squeak by without a recession
but said it will be close.
   Yesterday's report was consistent with three issued
Wednesday that detailed an uninspired performance by the
economy. The government's index of leading indicators was
unchanged for June, while construction spending was flat for
the same month, according to the Commerce Department. In
addition, the National Association of Purchasing Management's
July index of manufacturing health plunged.
   The decline in June factory orders was concentrated in
durable goods, which are items expected to last at least
three years. Orders for these goods skidded 2.8% to $125.08
billion after rising 4.1% in May to $128.74 billion. The June
drop reflected decreases in orders for defense capital goods,
primary metals, electrical machinery and related products.
   The 2.8% drop in durable-goods orders was smaller than the
3.2% decline estimated by the department last week. Orders
for nondurable goods were about unchanged in June from May at
$112.32 billion.
   Brian Keyser, an economist at First Fidelity Bancorp. in
Philadelphia, said the data confirm his view that the economy
will grow at an anemic pace in the next few months. "We'll be

residential construction will continue to be a drag on the

   Regarding "Davis-Bacon: Racist Then, Racist Now" by Scott
Alan Hodge of the Heritage Foundation (editorial page, June
25): First, Mr. Hodge states that the "Davis-Bacon {Act} was
written to prevent black workers, mostly from the South, from
competing with Northern construction trades," when in fact on
March 19, 1928, a letter from the Commissioner of Labor
Statistics stated that a Southern contractor on Long Island
had "brought with him an entire outfit of Negro laborers from
the South, housed them in barracks and boxcars, permitting no
one to see them." We submit this legislation was passed to
prevent exploitation of all workers, and not, as Mr. Hodge
suggests, to prevent black workers from competing for jobs.
   Second, Mr. Hodge asserts that "the Labor Department uses
local union wage scales as a proxy for the `prevailing
wage,'" when in fact a 1986 study of 3,358 wage decisions
issued by the Labor Department showed only 881, or 26.2%,
were based on union rates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Third, Mr. Hodge's statement that the "debate on
Davis-Bacon has focused primarily on its costs, the estimated
$1.5 billion it costs U.S. taxpayers to pay union scale," is
unprovable. We have already proved that these rates are not
based on union scale; our study also showed that 44.7% of the
1986 decisions issued provided a wage rate below the poverty
level recognized by the Census Bureau. In fact, we found
prevailing wages issued in 77 decisions that were at or below
the minimum wage.

   RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. said
preliminary sales for the first quarter ended July 29,
slipped 1.5% to $389 million from $394.9 million a year ago.
   The company said a strong sales performance by its
manufactured-housing group was more than offset by a 6%
decline in recreational-vehicle revenue. Lower
recreational-vehicle sales are "a result of a continuing
slowdown in consumer spending, caused by concerns about a
weakening economy and the threat of a recession," said Glenn
Kummer, Fleetwood president.

   Track Stars Get Set to Dash for the Cash

   SEATTLE -- After years as a mostly amateur sport, U.S.
track and field may be going pro.
   Unlike in Europe, where private clubs organize hugely
popular track meets and pay athletes large fees to compete,
U.S. track and field is dominated by an amateur governing
body that does very little to promote the sport commercially.
Though this has angered some U.S. athletes for years, they
have never before mustered the clout or sophistication to do
anything about it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, after a decade of battling the system, speedster Carl
Lewis and his manager, Joe Douglas, are mounting the most
serious challenge yet to the amateur ways of U.S. track and
field. Through the muscle of their Santa Monica Track Club --
part labor union, part talent agency, part revolutionary cell
-- Messrs. Lewis and Douglas are forcing U.S. amateur
officials to reckon with athletes as pros.
   The Santa Monica club's growing influence was particularly
evident here last week during the track and field events at
the Goodwill Games. In part because of the club's agitation,
The Athletics Congress, or TAC, the federation that controls
the sport in the U.S., paid members of the U.S. track team
from $3,000 to $23,000 -- depending on their world ranking --
to compete in the Goodwill meet. The arrangement, which drew
jealous complaints from swimmer Matt Biondi and other
competitors who didn't get paid for their appearances here,
ensured Santa Monica's participation and averted a likely
public-relations disaster for Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., sponsor of the games.
   But more important, the payments advanced the principle,
at a major U.S. "amateur" meet, of pay for participation.
   "For years, everyone has fought us because we've always
treated this sport as a professional business," says Mr.
Lewis, a six-time Olympic gold medalist and the driving force
behind the Santa Monica club, founded by Mr. Douglas.
   Adds 23-year-old Leroy Burrell, the world's fastest
100-meter sprinter since 1988 and Mr. Lewis's close friend
and clubmate: "We're not in this sport because we like it or
we want to earn our way through school. We're in it to make
money. That's what this country is all about: Get a job and
make money."
   The Santa Monica club's power derives from its sheer
speed. Messrs. Lewis and Douglas have recruited a dazzling
array of sprinters to the club, many of them ranked among the
fastest in the world in their events. The assembled talent
gives the club the athletic and economic clout to back its
demands.
   For example, by keeping the club's premier runners out of
the U.S. National Championships last year, Mr. Douglas says
he made progress in negotiations with TAC on such issues as
prize money for races, grievance procedures, the right to
wear the Santa Monica uniform at international meets, and the
right to compete at certain meets without going through
qualifying steps. He also says TAC and Santa Monica have
agreed to work together to promote the sport, starting with
three to five meets in the U.S. next summer.
   Santa Monica is also trying to become a marketing power on
its own. Mr. Lewis designed the club's distinctive orange and
blue uniforms himself, testing their TV luster under a video
camera, he says. He's working on marketing the apparel.
   Santa Monica runners attend speech and acting classes to
enhance their marketability as commercial spokesmen. They
travel with a business manager, a lawyer and a travel
consultant. They often stay in downtown hotels, rather than
in athletes' dormitories, and they sometimes ride in
limousines to meets.
   "We're just a totally different baby from everybody else,"
Mr. Lewis says.
   Some of these differences irritate others connected to the
sport. Indeed, the flamboyant stance taken by the Santa
Monica athletes has driven a wedge through the ranks of track
and field. On one side are the free marketeers like Mr. Lewis
and his cohorts, who say athletes should be allowed to fetch
the highest possible price for their services.
   On the other side are the traditionalists who think that
even the marquee athletes bear a moral responsibility to help
the sport as a whole. They worry that if the amateur system
loses sway too quickly, what little financial support that
non-elite athletes receive from TAC and other amateur bodies
will dry up.
   "We have a lot of athletes who are still in this sport
because they love track and field -- not because of the
money," says Harvey Glance, a three-time Olympic sprinter and
chairman of the Athletes' Advisory Committee to TAC.
   Edwin Moses, the world-record holder in the 400-meter
hurdles and chairman of the Committee on Substance Abuse for
the U.S. Olympic Committee, puts it more bluntly. "Santa
Monica is interested in Santa Monica," he says. "I'm
interested in the sport as a whole. No one club, no one
person, is bigger than track and field."
   The hurdler, who is studying for a masters degree in
business administration while training for the 1992 Winter
Olympics as a bobsledder, wants TAC to hire a marketing and
publicity staff. He and others want it to reach out to clubs,
to schools, to networks, to advertisers. Ultimately, they
want TAC to promote track and field the way the National
Football League promotes football.
   "You're looking at a threshold philosophical question as
to what you want to be," says Ollan Cassell, executive
director of TAC and the man in the middle of the maelstrom.
He sees grave dangers in trying to use TAC as a marketing
arm. "Your duty is to carry out the rules and regulations {of
an amateur sport}. When you get into the promotional side of
it, you get into conflicts."
   Those conflicts were all too clear at the Goodwill meet.
On July 23, Turner Broadcasting equaled its highest
prime-time ratings of the event so far, a 3.6, when Messrs.
Burrell and Lewis squared off in the 100-meter dash. The
viewership surge inspired the network to invite the Santa
Monica Track Club's 4x100-meter relay team -- including both
speedsters from the 100-meter race, plus two other
world-class sprinters -- to run in the relay on July 26.
   But Mr. Cassell quashed the special invitation, on the
ground that the relays were meant for national teams, not
clubs. None of the Santa Monica sprinters, who prefer to run
as a team or not at all, competed in the event. Turner
Broadcasting's ratings fell to 2.7 that night.
   "How is it helping the sport not to let us run?" Mr. Lewis
asks.
   Says Svein Romstad, Turner Broadcasting's director of
sports relations: "It's very frustrating to sit on the
sidelines and let the national governing bodies handle the
negotiations with athletes."

   The Americas:
   Trinidad Fiasco Spotlights Libya's Terror Network
   ----

   When the 112 AK-47-toting members of the Jamaat al
Muslimeen, or People of Islam, seized the Parliament of
Trinidad and Tobago along with the prime minister and 40
other hostages -- allegedly to rid Trinidad of a corrupt and
unpopular government -- news accounts portrayed it as an act
of terrorism by a fringe Moslem fundamentalist group.
Subsequent reports revealed that the group received training
in Libya and that Yasin Abu Bakr, the group's leader,
acknowledged traveling to Libya and called Col. Moammar
Gadhafi "our friend." The U.S. State Department, though
critical of Libya's involvement, says no apparent direct link
exists between the terrorists and Libya.
   That is surprising. A 1986 State Department report charged
that "Libya has also actively recruited members of . . .
leftist leaders from Antigua, Barbados, the Dominican
Republic, Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and the French
Departments {who are} invited to Libya for seminars at which
they are urged to undertake violent action rather than
peacefully participate in the political process." The report
concluded that "Libyan activities should be a matter of
serious concern for the entire hemisphere." Since then,
Libyan involvement in the Caribbean has continued if not
increased. Moreover, it appears Col. Gadhafi has enlisted
terrorist groups from the Middle East and Europe with close
ties to Libya.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In April 1987, Venezuela expelled a Libyan diplomat "for
allegedly being involved in activities incompatible with his
diplomatic status" -- a euphemism for spying or terrorism.
The "diplomat," Abdul Salim Ashur, was later arrested. In his
possession authorities found evidence of a "huge terrorist
operation directed against the Lesser Antilles": read
Trinidad. The Arab Press Service reported that Mr. Ashur's
plans called for Libya's financing and arming of radical
groups in French Guiana, Suriname, Haiti, Jamaica and, yes,
Trinidad and Tobago (as well as other Caribbean islands).
   Throughout the region, Libya has set up "People's Bureaus"
and Islamic schools and centers that act as front
organizations to conceal Libya's active recruitment and
financing of regional subversives. Since 1986, delegates from
leftist Caribbean organizations have attended the
"International Center for Combating Imperialism" conference
held every year in Tripoli. Through these instruments, Libya
has succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with a
well-trained cadre of terrorists.
   Two months ago, 15 pro-Libyan terrorists were indicted in
Costa Rica for various terrorist acts, including three
bombings of U.S. offices in Costa Rica between 1986 and 1988.
The group, the Santamaria Patriotic Organization, was formed
in 1986 following the U.S. bombing of Libya in April. One of
the terrorists, Domingo Solis Solis, was reported to have
joined the El Salvadoran communist FMLN guerrillas in their
military offensive last November.
   Middle Eastern radicals operate in South America as well.
In May 1987, Venezuelan authorities arrested Mahmoud Abed
Atta, reportedly a senior agent of terrorist Abu Nidal, and
had him deported. Another man with reported Abu Nidal links,
Hussein Bouzildi was arrested by Peruvian authorities two
months after the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement bombed a
U.S. Information Service Center to mark the anniversary of
the April 1986 U.S. bombing of Tripoli.
   Besides Tupac Amaru, other Latin American radical groups
receive Libyan support, including Ecuador's Alfaro Lives,
Carajo], Colombia's 19th of April Movement and Chile's
Movement of the Revolutionary Left. All have sent guerrillas
to training camps in Libya and received financial support
from Col. Gadhafi.
   Perhaps the most disturbing terrorist event in the
hemisphere with possible Libyan connections is the bombing by
the Medellin cocaine cartel of a Colombian Avianca plane last
November in which 107 people were killed. Though no evidence
directly implicates Libya, major aspects of the case suggest
an indirect role.
   Interpol informed Colombian authorities that guerrillas of
the Basque separatist group, ETA, carried out the bombing for
the Medellin cartel. The subsequent investigation revealed
the guerrillas used Semtex, a Czechoslovakian-made explosive
that cannot be detected by airport security checkpoints. The
ETA receives financial support from Libya and many of its
members go there for training. Moreover, Czechoslovakia's
President Vaclav Havel disclosed in March that the previous
communist government sold Libya 1,000 tons of Semtex. Quoting
from government sources, the Bogota-based newspaper El
Tiempo, reported that "the same detonator was used to blow up
the Pan Am plane on a flight from Britain to the United
States in December 1988." Libya has been directly linked to
that bombing as well.
   The coup attempt in Trinidad is the tip of the iceberg.
The social dislocation and resentment accompanying economic
restructuring have weakened already fragile Caribbean
democracies and simultaneously created an unstable political
environment susceptible to exploitation by radical groups. We
should expect more terrorism traced backed to Libya.

   BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Pratt &amp; Lambert Inc. said soft demand for
adhesives depressed second-quarter net income 7% from a year
earlier, but it expects "reasonably strong" third and fourth
quarters.
   Net fell to $2.3 million, or 40 cents a share, from $2.5
million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. The company's
stock repurchase program reduced average shares outstanding
6% for the 1990 period. Sales fell 2% to $65.4 million from
$66.7 million a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The paint, coatings and adhesives concern declined to make
a specific earnings projection. In the 1989 third quarter the
company earned $1.9 million, or 33 cents a share, on sales of
$63 million.
   Chairman R. D. Stevens, Jr. said the modest sales decline
in the latest quarter reflected soft demand for adhesives
used in construction, footwear and recreational vehicles.
"While we don't look for an early recovery in these markets,
we anticipate that strengthening sales during the second half
in other lines will more than eliminate the current
shortfall," Mr. Stevens said.
   In the first half, net fell 2% to $3 million, or 52 cents
a share, from $3.9 million, or 62 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales fell 1% to $124.8 million from $126.1 million.

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent stock and bond prices
tumbling around the world.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 34.66 points to
close at 2864.60. Trading volume was the heaviest since last
October. The setback followed large declines in Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Europe as news of Middle East fighting sparked fears
of less-plentiful oil supplies, driving up oil prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Surging oil prices in turn added to inflation fears and
prompted investors to unload bonds. Prices of 30-year
Treasury bonds nosedived nearly 1 1/4 points, or almost
$12.50 for each $1,000 face amount, the biggest decline in
more than three and one-half months. German, Japanese,
British, and French government bond prices also slumped.
   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen, which was
depressed by Japan's heavy dependence on imported oil, but it
eked out only a small gain against the German mark.
   "Not since the Iranian Revolution of 1979 have we seen a
geopolitical event that threatens world oil production and
prices as much as this," said Peter Gignoux, an energy
specialist at Lehman Brothers in London.
   While long-term bonds fell out of favor, some investors
turned instead to short-term Treasury bills, traditionally a
haven in times of international crisis. "We saw some signs of
a flight to safety," said Anthony Woodruff, a managing
director at Kidder Peabody.
   Higher oil prices could jolt the U.S. economy, several
analysts said. "Higher oil prices are a tax on both
households and businesses, which means they will be spending
less money and bring the U.S. economy that much closer to a
recession," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at
Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
   Worries about oil also revived memories of 1973-1974, when
stock prices tanked following the Arab oil embargo. Among the
losers yesterday were stocks of airlines, trucking companies
and other transportation concerns that depend heavily on oil.
Consumer and other growth stocks that have been slumping
lately continued to drop. Big gainers included stocks of oil
and oil-service companies, as well as precious metals, mining
and coal companies.
   Middle East strife could reduce chances of significant
cuts in U.S. defense spending, compounding the problem of
slashing the bloated U.S. budget deficit, several analysts
said. Prices of many defense stocks such as Raytheon, General
Dynamics, and McDonnell Douglas, surged yesterday.
   Higher oil prices and accelerating inflation also could
pull interest rates even higher and make the Federal Reserve
unwilling to ease credit further, several economists
contended. But others dismissed these worries, arguing that
oil prices soon will begin dropping again because of a
world-wide oil glut. They also contend that the U.S. economy
already is so stagnant that interest rates are heading lower,
which will help revive economic activity and bolster stock
prices.
   "I think we may already be in a recession even though
people are afraid to call it one," said Mr. Woodruff of
Kidder. "All the economic statistics point to that."
   While U.S. stocks were bloodied, several foreign stock
markets fell even harder. The Dow industrials fell 1.2%, but
an index of Japanese stock prices dropped 1.9%. London and
Hong Kong shares each fell 1.5%.
   In major markets:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell in heavy trading of 253.1 million shares
on the Big Board, where decliners outnumbered advancers by
1,211 to 464.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices tumbled. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year
bonds rose to 8.45% from 8.35% Wednesday.

   NEW YORK -- Program trading accounted for an average of
9.6% of New York Stock Exchange volume, or 16 million shares
a day, in the week ended July 20.
   That was up from 7.9% the previous week, the Big Board
said in its weekly report on the computer-aided trading

These five firms accounted for 58% of all program trading on
the exchange.
   Program trading is the purchase or sale of a group of at
least 15 and often hundreds of different stocks. Stock-index
arbitrage, which involves stock purchases and sales with
offsetting trades in futures and options, was led by Kidder
Peabody, which accounted for 32% of the total.

   Small-Business Group Works to Unseat Nine Lawmakers

   NFIB's Aggressive Stance Reflects
   Its Growing Political Involvement

   WASHINGTON -- Small business has a hit list for this
fall's congressional elections.
   The Free Enterprise Political Action Committee, an arm of
the National Federation of Independent Business, has targeted
nine Senate and House Democrats the PAC considers anti-small
business. They include Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, Sen. Tom
Harkin of Iowa and Oklahoma Rep. Mike Synar. The three
lawmakers vigorously deny they are foes of small business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The drive to defeat candidates reflects the growing
political involvement of the NFIB, the largest small-business
group. It is the first time that the federation's PAC has
gone after more than a few lawmakers and the first time it
has opposed House members. The move also bucks the usual
corporate PAC pattern of backing incumbents, a practice that
helps most federal lawmakers return to Washington every
election.
   "The PAC's board isn't happy that the small-business
community, the creator of jobs, is seen as the enemy, that
we're always on the defensive," says John Motley, the NFIB's
chief lobbyist. "At the last meeting they were telling us we
weren't being aggressive enough in supporting challengers."
   Taking the gloves off, the NFIB wrote its members in
Michigan last month that Sen. Levin's membership on the
Senate Small Business Committee is "nothing more than a smoke
screen to cover up his lack of support for free enterprise."
The group's literature declares that it is "mad as hell at
Sen. Levin and isn't going to take it anymore."
   Sen. Harkin, the NFIB said in a recent letter to its Iowa
members, "does not care how many small firms may be
overburdened or driven out of business because of the
anti-small business policies he supports." The group is
telling its Oklahoma members that Rep. Synar has "voted
against you 80% of the time."
   NFIB President John Sloan says the group decided on which
legislators to oppose based on its tally of key votes in
Congress. These included bills to mandate parental leave for
companies with more than 50 employees, raise the minimum
wage, bar discrimination against the disabled and notify
workers in advance of large layoffs and plant closings -- all
legislation the group opposed as unduly increasing government
involvement in small businesses. A 70% pro-small business
rating earns lawmakers the federation's Guardian of Small
Business award, while a score below 40% means the group will
begin supporting their opponents.
   The political targets are returning the fire. Sen. Levin
says: "John Sloan's agenda is not a small-business agenda,
but a partisan, political agenda. He uses small business to
influence elections -- mainly for Republicans." He says that
"most Michigan citizens and business" would agree with his
vote for a 60-day notification of plant layoffs and closings.
   Rep. Synar says the NFIB is trying to flex its muscle
because it is losing congressional votes on important issues
such as the minimum wage, child care and parental leave. "I
consider those pro-business issues. They don't because
they've taken it on themselves to be the final judge of
what's good for business," Rep. Synar says.
   Sen. Harkin's campaign manager, Tim Raftis, accuses the
NFIB of trying to "whip up opposition" to the senator's
sponsorship of the disability-rights bill recently signed
into law by President Bush. "From the reactions we've gotten
back, small-business owners have reacted very negatively to
NFIB's attacks," Mr. Raftis says.
   The NFIB's Mr. Sloan defends the federation's action. "The
'80s taught us if you really want to influence policy, work
to get your friends elected," he says. In addition to harsh
rhetoric against incumbents, the NFIB also is contributing
money to challengers, including $9,000 to Rep. Bill Schuette,
a candidate in Michigan's GOP primary to pick Sen. Levin's
opponent; $10,000 to Sen. Harkin's opponent, Rep. Thomas
Tauke; and about $5,000 to Rep. Synar's rival, Jack Ross, a
small-business owner.
   Mr. Motley denies that the NFIB is targeting Democrats,
although it usually opposes "Democrats from the labor wing of
the party." Although there aren't any Republicans on the NFIB
list of nine targets, the group's PAC won't challenge such
Democratic senators as Howell Heflin of Alabama or James Exon
of Nebraska.
   In the past, the NFIB has challenged a few senators in
small states, such as former Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker
of Connecticut, while using most of its contributions to
support incumbents. This year, however, far more resources
will go to challenging incumbents. The nine target elections
account for almost one-third of the 30 races slated to
receive Free Enterprise PAC contributions. "But our members
don't want us to squander money to make a point," says Mr.
Motley. "There has to be a chance the person will win."
   The NFIB also concedes that its campaigns can stumble: The
group supports GOP Sen. Jesse Helms's re-election bid in
North Carolina, but it won't get as heavily involved as in
some other races because it has found that some federation
members love him and others hate him.
   Most of the other small-business organizations don't have
PACs. But the Chamber of Commerce, which endorses candidates,
and the Small Business Legislative Council, which doesn't
endorse, support the NFIB's aggressive stance. So does
National Small Business United, which started its own PAC
nine months ago but says it doesn't have enough money to
spend on such an effort now.
   "I'm glad they're doing it," says John Satajag, president
of SBLC. "You can't allow people in Washington to use the
rhetoric of supporting small business and never be
accountable."
   But the SBLC is "less confrontational as a group," Mr.
Satajag adds. "There are a lot of intangibles that don't show
up in a vote count" such as the one the NFIB uses. He cites
for example a behind-the-scenes effort by Arkansas's
Democratic Sen. David Pryor on the Pepper Commission to
explain the small-business viewpoint on opposing mandated
health benefits to his fellow commissioners.
   The NFIB's challenge to incumbents risks creating powerful
enemies. But Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia professor
of government who wrote a book on PACs, says the organization
could win big by bucking the usual practice of backing office
holders.
   "One of the least favorable aspects of PACs is their
slavish devotion to incumbents of all types. It really does
suggest prostitution to people," says Prof. Sabato.
   "The vast majority of our members," says the NFIB's Mr.
Motley, "don't want anything from government except to be
left alone, and a Congress that doesn't look to small
business every time they want to provide an interest group
with some benefit."

   William Anthony Rand, whose now-defunct Rand Theaters Inc.
was furiously expanding last year, was jailed by a state
judge in Little Rock, Ark., for contempt of court.
   The demise of Mr. Rand's highflying, movie-theater empire
was described in a page one article in December in this
newspaper.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Rand was jailed along with his wife, Mary Ann, by
Judge Robin Mays after a hearing over $71,000 he had been
ordered to deposit with the court. The money was the proceeds
of a sale of a home in the resort community of Eden Isle in
Cleburne County, about 100 miles north of Little Rock. First
American Title Insurance Co. of the Midwest, Memphis, Tenn.,
filed suit in March seeking part of the proceeds from the
sale. Its attorney, Marian M. McMullan, claimed in court that
the Rands hid the money by putting it in bank accounts and by
distributing it among friends and relatives.
   Ms. McMullan also says Mr. Rand is the subject of a
federal criminal investigation in Little Rock over the
operation of the theater chain, and state tax officials say
they turned over office records in response to a federal
grand jury subpoena earlier this year. The U.S. Attorney's
office in Little Rock wouldn't comment, but it is believed
part of the investigation involves alleged fraud in the
leasing of theater equipment.

   WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Air New Zealand Ltd., the
country's international air carrier, said it is firing 600
staff and scrapping its fleet of 15 Fokker Friendship F27
aircraft to become more competitive on domestic services.
   Jim Scott, chief executive of Air New Zealand, said the
provincial routes will be included on main trunk routes
serviced by its bigger Boeing 737 aircraft because of heavy
competition on those main routes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Air New Zealand's main competitor on the trunk routes is
Ansett New Zealand Ltd., a unit of Ansett Transport
Industries Ltd., an Australian domestic airline owned jointly
by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and transportation company TNT
Ltd.
   "Today's reality is that Air New Zealand is contesting the
main trunk routes with a totally overseas-owned competitor
who has chosen to concentrate its efforts on these higher
volume and, thereby, more profitable routes," Mr. Scott said.
   The company said that since Air New Zealand isn't allowed
to contest Ansett's home markets in Australia, it can't
afford any longer to serve less-profitable provincial routes
in New Zealand with the F27 fleet.
   Air New Zealand is 35% owned by Brierley Investments Ltd.
of New Zealand and 20% owned by Qantas Aiways Ltd.,
Australia's state-owned international airline. Japan Air
Lines Co. and American Airlines Inc. each own 7.5%, and the
remaining 30% was floated on the New Zealand stock exchange
in 1989.

   NATICK, Mass. -- Prime Computer Inc.'s share of an Army
computer contract is expected to amount to more than $100
million, the largest in the company's history, industry
sources say.
   The $700 million, multiyear contract was awarded Friday to
Electronic Data Systems Corp., a General Motors Corp. unit.
Spokesmen for both companies refused to disclose how much of
that contract would go to Prime.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The contract calls for EDS to provide up to 20,000
computers and systems for general office use by the Army,
Navy and defense logistics agency by 1995. A spokeswoman for
the Army's information systems procurement agency confirmed
that Prime's machines will be "the heart of the system." But
she wouldn't break out the company's potential share.
   The subcontract appears to be a major win for Prime, which
has been struggling to cut costs and reverse huge losses it
suffered in the wake of a hostile takeover attempt. Prime was
taken private in 1989 by a unit of D.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New
York investment firm.

   Akzo's Profit Fell Steep 24% in Quarter;
   Less-Sharp Decline Is Seen in 2nd Half

   Akzo N.V. reported an unexpectedly steep 24% drop in
second-quarter profit and predicted that earnings would
continue to fall in the second half, although at a slower
rate.
   The Dutch chemical company, which has been hurt by falling
bulk chemical prices, Brazil's austerity program and the
dollar's slump, also promised further cost-cutting measures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Akzo's results "are indicative of the pain being felt in
the {chemical} industry," said Jackie Ashurst, an analyst at
James Capel &amp; Co. in London, adding: "I don't think we're
going to see any alleviation short term."
   Last week, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC reported a 21%
decline in first-half pretax profit, while Dow Chemical Co.'s
second-quarter net plunged 50%.
   Syb Bergsma, a member of Akzo's management committee,
acknowledged that the company's results were disappointing,
but said they would have been far worse if Akzo hadn't
diversified. The Dutch concern has slashed its synthetic
fibers division's work force and built up production of
drugs, paints and other coatings.
   Akzo's second-quarter net totaled 205.7 million guilders
($114.9 million), or 4.63 guilders a share, down from 270.6
million guilders, or 6.25 guilders a share. Sales fell 10% to
4.32 billion guilders from 4.79 billion guilders.
   For the first half, net slumped 18% to 407.4 million
guilders, or 9.17 guilders a share, from 498 million
guilders, or 11.50 guilders a share. Sales declined 4.2% to
8.9 billion guilders from 9.29 billion guilders.
   Akzo's Mr. Bergsma predicted that second-half net income
will drop less severely than in the first half. He said Akzo
believes bulk chemical prices will stabilize for the rest of
the year, although some analysts fear a further drop.
   The company plans to intensify efforts announced in April
to improve short-term earnings. Mr. Bergsma said Akzo will
seek to reduce administrative costs, streamline its sales
forces and trim spending on consultants and other outside
experts.
   Akzo blamed a large part of its problems on austerity
measures imposed last spring by Brazil, which accounts for
about 5% of the company's sales. The dollar's weakness also
hurt Akzo by making its products less competitive in
dollar-oriented markets and by reducing the guilder value of
Akzo's sales in the U.S.

   PARIS -- Cement maker Lafarge Coppee S.A., judged a prime
takeover target because of its loosely structured capital
base, plans to adopt a "poison pill" strategy to ward off
potential predators.
   Europe's largest cement company announced that, in the
event of an unwelcome takeover attempt, it will launch bids
for the shares its doesn't already own in three of its
foreign units -- Lafarge Corp. of the U.S., Cementia AS of
Switzerland and Asland S.A. of Spain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a result, any buy-out attempt would have to include a
bid for the entire ensemble, boosting the cost of the
takeover to about 40 billion francs ($7.52 billion) from the
25 billion francs needed to take control of the parent
company.
   The parent currently holds 57.4% of Lafarge Corp., 60.4%
of Cementia and 49.8% of Asland.
   The plan is subject to approval by the Comite des

   GATT Charges Japan
   With Maintaining
   Barriers to Imports

   GENEVA -- Japan is maintaining a "hard core" of import
barriers against many farm products and several kinds of
industrial goods, a survey by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade said.
   Analysts at GATT's secretariat said Tokyo has made
"tangible progress" in opening its markets to foreign goods
in recent years, under pressure from trade partners, led by
the U.S., to reduce its surpluses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "However, a hard core of high protection has remained,"
said the survey, which also criticized other parts of
Japanese trade policy and predicted rising pressure from
Third World exports.
   Japanese Ambassador Minoru Endo said his country has taken
"giant steps" to lower trade barriers.
   Criticism of Tokyo often seems "to stem from an outdated
perception about us," Mr. Endo told a session of GATT's
96-nation council, which commissioned the review.
   Rice farming is "the most deep-rooted example" of how the
Japanese government gives wide-ranging protection against
foreign competition to agriculture, the survey said.
   Developing countries are especially hit by restrictions on
industrial products, which include leather, jute, clothing
and footwear, the survey said.
   A thicket of trade regulations and official channels was
cited as another import obstacle.
   GATT analysts said that while Japan says it reduced state
aid to farmers 20% since 1986, it "continues to have a highly
protected agricultural sector."
   The report noted that Japan last spring urged major
private companies to boost imports. But it said this approach
could distort trade by promoting only certain kinds of
imports.
   GATT also warned Tokyo against making trade restraint
deals with Third World producers wanting to gain a foothold
in the Japanese market, saying such accords endanger the
principles of international trade.
   Japan has rarely used this method but is likely to face
increasing pressure as developing economies become more
diversified and competitive, the survey said.
   Recent market-opening moves have led to surging shipments
of cigarettes, wine and other alcoholic drinks, fruits, beef,
passenger cars and semiconductors, the survey said.

   German Booty in Texas

   An American soldier's theft of German church treasures at
the end of World War II began to surface this April. The New
York Times reported that a government-funded German
foundation had paid a $3 million "finder's fee" for the
Quedlinburg Gospels, a magnificent illuminated Carolingian
manuscript written in gold. The seller reportedly had
threatened the manuscript would be sold to a Japanese buyer.
John S. Torigian, a Dallas attorney acting for anonymous
clients, had arranged the transfer in Switzerland through
Heribert Tenschert, a Bavarian dealer in rare books and
manuscripts. Reaction to the sale was mixed. While pleased
that the Gospels might return to their home when
reunification takes place, many were incensed at the
extortion and disturbed by the secrecy of the seller's
identity.
   The Gospels and other medieval works of art from the
Quedlinburg cloister's treasury were stored for safety in a
mine shaft outside Quedlinburg in 1945 when American troops
approached. The U.S. Army knew treasures were missing, but by
1949, Quedlinburg was part of the Russian zone and later East
Germany, and the Army dropped its investigation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among medievalists, the disappearance of the Quedlinburg
treasures was considered a major war loss. The convent had
especially beautiful things, 10th- and 11th-century gifts
from the Ottonian imperial family. The medieval works from
Quedlinburg now in Texas include a silver reliquary with
enamel plaques and carved ivory panels, a small group of rock
crystal vessels, crucifixes of gold and silver, and a carved
ivory comb.
   Shortly after the sale of the Gospels, Willi Korte of
Berlin's Prussian Cultural Heritage administration traveled
to the U.S. and followed a trail to the town of Whitewright
in northeast Texas, and to its bank, where heirs of Lt. Joe
T. Meador, who served in the unit that occupied Quedlinburg,
had deposited the treasures as collateral for a loan. Meador
apparently stole more than 10 works from the Quedlinburg
treasury. Witnesses who served with Meador have come forward
to tell of the theft from the mine shaft. Meador died of
cancer in 1980.
   The Church of Quedlinburg has brought suit in Federal
District Court in Dallas to recover the items, and the West
German government will foot the legal bill. A restraining
order will keep the treasure safe until its ownership is
determined. Meador's sister and brother are defendants and,
along with Mr. Torigian, subjects of a criminal investigation
seeking to discover whether they knew the objects were stolen
before transporting the manuscript to Switzerland for sale.
It later was reported that the IRS also is looking into their
possible tax liability, putting additional pressure on Jane
Meador Cook and Jack Meador to settle this deeply
embarrassing situation.
   ---
   In mid-July, Judge Vincent L. Broderick denied the
Metropolitan Museum of Art's motion to dismiss a 1987 lawsuit
filed by the Republic of Turkey to recover more than 200
ancient silver and gold artifacts that Turkey calls the
Lydian Hoard and the Met labels "East Greek." Turkey claims
the objects were plundered from a burial mound in Ushak and
smuggled out for sale. Although almost 20 years had passed
since the Met acquired the objects through purchases totaling
more than $1 million and through gifts from the two dealers
who made the sale, the court ruled that the museum could not
use the statute of limitations defense. Turkey's assertion
that the Met was not a good-faith purchaser needed to be
tested, the court ruled, adding that the museum may have been
aware of the artifacts' illicit export and may have
deliberately concealed their acquisition. The ruling cleared
the way to trial.

   Van Gogh's centenary exhibition in Amsterdam just closed
after drawing 1.2 million visitors, who admired, among other
paintings, three van Goghs from the Kroller-Muller Museum
recovered by Dutch police earlier this year. Meanwhile,
however, the Noord Brabant Museum in nearby s'Hertogenbosch
suffered the theft of three paintings from the artist's early
years in Nuenen. On the night of June 27, a window was
broken, the alarm system failed, and in the morning the
museum discovered it was missing works it values between $2.7
and $5.4 million.

   On July 4, Paris lost three paintings from three museums.
A small Renoir portrait of a woman, on display near a
staircase in the Louvre's Pavilion des Flores, was cut from
its frame during museum hours. About an hour later, the theft
of Ernest Hebert's portrait of "Monaluccia" was discovered at
the Musee Hebert, a small museum on the Left Bank. It too was
cut from its stretcher without tripping the alarm attached to
the frame. A third picture, a landscape of 1816 by Paul Huet,
was discovered missing from the museum of the city of Paris,
the Musee Carnavalet.
   Reaction was swift. The next day Jacques Sallois, the
director of the national museums, announced an unusual
decision: Five small museums in Paris would close until
further notice. In addition to the Musee Hebert, the Gustave
Moreau, Eugene Delacroix, Ennery, and Jean-Jacques Henner
museums will admit visitors only in pre-arranged groups and
for lectures. These museums were the homes or studios of the
artists, and the security staff in each could only be
described as minimal. Increased security was announced for
three of the capital's most popular tourist attractions, the
Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, and the Palace of Versailles.

   Print dealers in the Los Angeles area are relieved that
the Doremus twins, Paul Drake and Kevin, are in police
custody. The brothers allegedly worked together, one
distracting gallery staff while the other took prints, then
rolled or folded them, before the two left the gallery. The
"system" then required a visit to a paper conservator to
repair the damage and to alter the edition numbers. Once
framed, the stolen prints were consigned for auction.
Cooperation among victims, specialists at Butterfield's
auction house and Detective William Martin of the Los Angeles
Police Department's Art Theft Detail resulted in the arrests
and several felony counts for the brothers.

   TOKYO -- Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.
agreed to establish a company to develop and market
engineering software, the two companies said.
   The joint venture, Toyota System Research Inc., will be
set up next month in Nagoya, with Toyota taking a 65%
interest and computer maker Fujitsu putting up the remaining
35% in the 300 million yen ($2 million) project, Toyota said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The venture would aim to match Fujitsu's basic knowledge
as a computer maker with Toyota's applied knowledge as a
computer user to develop software capable of responding to
technological advances in laboratory and factory automation,
artificial intelligence and computer-aided engineering, or
CAE, Toyota said.
   The company will initially focus on developing and
marketing software for the automobile industry, chiefly for
rapidly expanding CAE applications, Toyota said.
   Sales for the first year are targeted at 500 million yen,
with a goal of three billion yen annually after five years.
   Operations are tentatively scheduled to begin in November,
with a work force of 30 people. Over the next five years, the
number of employees is seen rising to 250.

if it was considering action with respect to the $2.7 billion
it is owed by Iraq.
   A spokesman of Italy's largest commercial bank said only
that it is "attentively following the situation" and will "in
any case abide by any decision the (Italian) government might
take."
</LP>

   The bank last year was rocked by an international
financial scandal involving nearly $3 billion of irregular
credits to Iraq. The credits were extended by the bank's U.S.
branch in Atlanta without the authorization of its North
American management.
   The bank's top management was forced to resign over the
scandal, which is still being investigated by U.S. and
Italian authorities.

   Abbott Says Compound It Developed
   Can Block Replication of AIDS Virus

   Scientists at Abbott Laboratories Inc. said they developed
an experimental compound highly effective in blocking
replication of the AIDS virus.
   A report by the scientists indicates that the Abbott Park,
Ill., pharmaceutical company has produced a major entry into
a high-stakes race to discover a new type of drug to combat
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The Abbott team, whose
report is carried in the current issue of Science magazine,
said its drug candidate "differs" in important ways from
those reported over the past year by other scientists.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Abbott researchers said they have devised a molecule
that can inhibit the action of an enzyme called protease. The
enzyme is essential for the proper assembly and maturation of
the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV-1, in uninfected
cells in the human body.
   Over the past year and a half, scientific journals have
carried a sprinkling of reports indicating that pursuit of a
drug to inhibit the HIV-1 protease is highly competitive
between drug company research labs. To date, researchers at
Merck &amp; Co., SmithKline Beecham PLC, Upjohn Co., Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc. and a group at Washington University in St. Louis
working with Monsanto Co., have reported producing
experimental protease blockers.
   As yet, all the reports have said that the researchers
have blocked the AIDS virus from infecting healthy cells only
in test-tube experiments. The problem is to produce a
compound that will reach AIDS-infected cells in the body
before it can be destroyed or excreted.
   Scientists at Abbott Labs said they believe their protease
blocker, called A-74704, may solve that problem through its
design. Using computer models of the protease enzyme, the
Abbott team said it made a drug that closely mirrors the
receptor site on the enzyme's surface, which activates the
protease enzyme. The blocker is made up of two identical
halves whose combined shape fits the structure of the
receptor site. Such a compound sitting in the receptor site
would effectively defuse the enzyme.
   "Early on we bet that this symmetrical structure would be
a potent blocker, and we now know that it is," said John
Ericson, lead author of the Abbott report. Mr. Ericson said
the structure also may resist degradation by enzymes in the
gut, a problem that must be overcome before the blocker can
be tested as a potential drug. He said Abbott soon will begin
testing the compound and other versions of it in animals.
   Blocking the HIV-1 protease is one of three major
strategies under way in pharmaceutical labs seeking to
develop novel AIDS drugs. Companies also are seeking to block
an essential enzyme called transcriptase, and to block a
receptor called CD4 that the AIDS virus uses to infect
healthy cells. Scientists think all three types of drugs may
be needed to fight off an AIDS infection.

   Sour Notes Sound in Life of Irving Berlin

   Israel Baline, an orthodox cantor's son, sailed with his
family into New York harbor in 1893. Eight Balines and a
paying boarder shared three rooms; when he was 13 Izzy quit
school and eventually worked as a singing waiter in a
Chinatown dance hall popular with tourists hoping to see a
real opium addict.
   The happy response greeting his rendition of a song he
wrote himself ("Marie From Sunny Italy") inspired Baline to
change his name and head for Tin Pan Alley. Soon he was
dictating his prodigious nocturnal output (sometimes five
songs in as many hours of insomnia) to professional
transcribers in a voice that sounded alternately like a
foghorn and an old man imitating a hysterical teenager. He
remained a musical illiterate his whole life.

   The romanticized version of Irving Berlin's life was
written by his friend Alexander Woollcott when Berlin, 37,
already was earning more than $160,000 a year from song
royalties. "As Thousands Cheer" (Viking, 674 pages, $24.95)
is Laurence Bergreen's antidote to Woollcott's 1925 fluff.
His Berlin is an inspired amateur and national schmaltz
machine who now and again managed to write something more
complex, say "Russian Lullaby" or "Cheek to Cheek."
   Successful immigrant incarnate, Berlin pleased his
American dream-starved public by earning millions, buying his
mother a house in "the country" (then the Bronx), and
marrying out of his class. The "farloyrene menshen" (lost
souls) who never made it included Berlin's younger sister
Sarah, whom he gave $100 a month once he struck it rich;
after 61 years of bad health and depression, she leapt from
the roof of her Brooklyn tenement.
   Based on 200 interviews, "As Thousands Cheer" is as much
about the music business as it is Berlin's story, though Mr.
Bergreen had no help from the songwriter himself, who died
last September and usually responded to phone calls from
musicologists with expletives. Berlin as he got older, and
then very old, disliked having his tunes analyzed.
   Mr. Bergreen does exactly what Berlin would have abhorred:
He has put the life and songs in the context of 20th-century
vernacular music history. He describes, for example, how
Berlin cashed in on ragtime with "Alexander's Ragtime Band,"
although it "contained almost no syncopation." This did not
stop Berlin from accepting the title Ragtime King, or stir
him to learn a little more about compositional techniques.
"The actual nature of ragtime music continued to elude this
untrained musician," Mr. Bergreen writes.
   Berlin preferred to spend more time on his own appearance.
Mr. Bergreen describes how Berlin dressed uptown before he
lived there, wearing "the most fashionable and expensive
suits he could afford, suits with tight trousers and fancy
lapels." Indeed, descriptions of "the little man" with hair
"pomaded to a respectable gloss" run through the text like a
maddeningly simple refrain.
   In 1925 Berlin married Ellin Mackay -- a pampered Catholic
who introduced herself to Berlin in a speakeasy and sneaked
off with him to City Hall. It was 22-year-old Ellin's first
subway ride. Her father, owner of Postal Telegraph Co.,
instantly cut off her $50,000-a-year trust fund. Later,
Clarence Mackay lost $36 million in the Depression and Berlin
gave him a million to tide him over. Mackay still snubbed
him.
   Generous according to his whims (he didn't like direct
requests), Berlin's fame made him the target of frequent
handout pleas. If his closet got full, he distributed
hand-tailored shirts around the office. He could be remote
and willfully hateful: When his sister Ruth's son, Irving
Berlin Kahn, approached Berlin for help with his mother's
cancer-treatment bills, he refused and as a parting shot told
his nephew to drop his middle name: "Use the initial. Please
don't use my name."
   In 1963 Berlin put together his last score -- 10 fresh
songs, 15 old hits -- for a Hollywood retrospective, "Say It
With Music." When the project collapsed after six years and
several discarded scripts, so, in a way, did Berlin. Still,
one wonders about Mr. Bergreen calling him a "has-been" and
"unemployed" (with their hint of shame, rather odd words to
use for a man who was then 76 years old).
   As he grew yet more ancient and "misanthropic," Berlin hid
out in his multi-million-dollar Beekman Place home till his
death at 101, dining alone with Ellin, until she predeceased
him by a year. He sat to her left and she said she only
needed to fix that side of her hair when she dressed for
supper.
   Mr. Bergreen presents Berlin's life as one massive attempt
at assimilation, and he has made an often interesting theme
of the ironies inherent in the composer's efforts to fit in.
In separating the man from his myth, his biography exerts
considerable fascination. Berlin certainly was not a man one
wished to encounter cheek to cheek. Still, does it really
make sense to view the songwriter's about face to the world
as the petulant exit of a man "tormented" because he no
longer occupied center stage? Was it not a stance Berlin was
entitled to take after 62 years in the business?

   WASHINGTON -- The China National Aero-Technology Import
and Export Corp. said it agreed to sell Mamco Manufacturing
Inc. to comply with an order by President Bush, who required
the action on grounds of national security.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese company said the ownership of Seattle-based
Mamco, which makes aircraft parts for U.S. commercial
aircraft manufacturers, will be transferred to DeCrane
Aircraft Holdings Inc., a private Midwest firm. The price
wasn't disclosed.
   U.S. trade law allows the president to suspend or prohibit
the acquisition of a U.S. company by a foreign party if he
finds they are contrary to national security interests. The
decision to force Catic to sell its stake in Mamco was the
first time President Bush rejected an acquisition on such
grounds.
   Initially, Catic was ordered to dispose of its stock in
Mamco, acquired in November 1989, within three months of Feb.
1. This deadline was subsequently extended for another three
months.
   U.S. officials said Catic, an export-import company of
China's Ministry of Aerospace Industry, has business dealings
with various U.S. companies, including commercial aircraft
manufacturers. The Chinese government ministry engages in
aerospace research and development and is responsible for the
design and production of military and commercial aircraft and
missiles in China.

   CINCINNATI -- U.S. Shoe Corp. said a class-action suit,
filed against the company after it retained Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets to explore sale of all or parts of the
specialty retailer, was conditionally dismissed at the
request of plaintiffs' counsel.
   The suit, brought by shareholders who bought their shares
after Aug. 15, 1988, was dismissed by U.S. District Judge
Carl B. Rubin in Cincinnati.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James J. Crowe, vice president and general counsel at U.S.
Shoe, said plaintiffs made a number of allegations, including
questioning whether management was serious about selling all
or part of the company.
   In April 1989, Merill Lynch pulled out of an agreement to
acquire the company's footwear division in a $422.5-million
leveraged buy-out. Merrill Lynch didn't offer any
explanation, but U.S. Shoe attributed the action to concern
about the junk-bond market and the performance of the
struggling, footwear division.
   The court order also includes dimissal of litigation
against various U.S. Shoe directors and officers and against
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.

   SOVIETS' CHEMICAL WEAPONS

   The Soviet Union has a stockpile of 40,000 tons of
chemical weapons, about 10,000 tons less than previous
independent estimates, the country's commander of chemical
forces was quoted as saying.
   The weapons are all stored in Soviet territory, Stanislav
Petrov was quoted as telling the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda. Mr. Petrov told Pravda there are no facilities in the
Soviet Union to destroy the chemical weapons, despite a
superpower agreement to eliminate 80% of them immediately.
   A destruction plant was built at Chapayevsk, 550 miles
southwest of Moscow, but was closed last summer after local
residents complained it would add to already high pollution
levels. Mr. Petrov told Pravda the Chapayevsk site would
become a training center for workers who destroy chemical
weapons.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature was asked to find a safe
site to build a replacement for the Chapayevsk facility, but
so far no lawmaker has volunteered a district in which to
place the plant.
                                                                                                       

   WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN
                                                                                                       

   Thirty-eight presidents (including George Bush), 20 prime
ministers and two kings have confirmed that they will
participate in the World Summit for Children at the United
Nations this September, organizers said, adding that it would
be the largest gathering of world leaders in history. Some 80
leaders have yet to respond. The gathering, whose
co-chairpersons are Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan
and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, will focus on
such topics as disease prevention, nutrition, education and
child labor.
                                                                                                       

   STRIKE THREAT IN BRAZIL
                                                                                                       

   Brazilian oil workers want a 280% pay raise from the state
oil monopoly Petrobras and will strike in September if their
demands are not met, a union leader said. "The 280% figure
represents losses caused by inflation during the last year,"
said Mozart Queiroz, a director of the Oil Workers Union. "If
we cannot reach an accord we will begin a strike on Sept. 4."
Petrobras, which produces 665,000 barrels of oil per day, has
about 60,000 workers represented by 19 unions nationwide. Mr.
Queiroz said he expected Petrobras to offer a raise of
between 60% and 70%.

   The European Community is planning a major
export-promotion campaign in Japan. EC officials said a
multimedia advertising campaign to improve the image of
European products would be launched next year with a budget
of well over $1 million. The campaign will focus on four
industries: furniture, jewelry, health foods and testing and
measuring equipment. The Japanese must realize that there is
more to be found in Europe than Gucci shoes and Louis Vuitton

   AIDS IN UGANDA
                                                                                                       

   At least one million Ugandans -- out of a population of
about 17 million -- are believed to be infected with the AIDS
virus, said Samuel Okware, head of Uganda's AIDS-control
program. He said that as of July there were 17,000 diagnosed
AIDS cases in Uganda, an increase of nearly 50% from the
number recorded in December. Dr. Okware also said that
heterosexual contacts were responsible for more than 90% of
AIDS cases diagnosed in Uganda and that slightly more women
were dying of the disease than men.

   Joint research projects between companies and universities
are on the rise in Japan, jumping 21% in fiscal 1989, ended
last March, from the previous fiscal year, the Education
Ministry said. Ministry officials said the fiscal 1989 total,
705 projects, was five times the number in 1982 when the
joint industry-university research system started. The
officials said joint research projects in fiscal 1989
amounted to 3.37 billion yen ($22.9 million), a fivefold
surge from fiscal 1982.
                                                                                                       

   AN ORDER FROM THE EC
                                                                                                       

   The European Community ordered Spain to allow private
express-mail companies to compete with the state postal
service for international deliveries.
   The EC said Spain's post-office monopoly violates EC
competition law and gave the government two months to change
its rules. Meanwhile, the community is putting pressure on
Danish authorities to abandon similar practices.
   Because of EC action since 1984, West Germany, France,
Belgium and Italy have abandoned most curbs placed on
international courier firms. The community has also ordered
the Netherlands to scrap restrictive practices, but that
country is appealing the decision to the European Court of
Justice.
   The latest move is "further evidence of the {EC}
commission's determination" to ensure that the express-mail
market is open to competition, said Michael D'Arcy of the
Dublin-based International Express Courier Conference.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Soviet newspapers hailed the nation's first press-freedom
law, which took effect Wednesday. "Goodbye censorship," read
a headline in the government newspaper Izvestia. . . . Rather
than destroy surplus apples, oranges and lemons, the European
Community wants to hand the fruit out to charitable
organizations and the poor. The commission's budget will pay
for handling and packaging costs.

   Hong Kong Frictions Grow Over Issue
   Of Importation of Foreign Laborers

   HONG KONG -- A growing dispute over the importation of
foreign workers has sparked friction between the government
of this British colony and labor unions and has highlighted
an issue that analysts say has at least as much bearing on
Hong Kong's economic future as the well-publicized "brain
drain."
   At the heart of the dispute is the government's proposal
to let in as many as 14,700 foreign workers by year end, a
nearly fivefold increase from a quota of 3,000 last year,
when the government first allowed foreign labor to be
imported. The bulk of this year's quota would be filled by
10,000 "operatives," or low-skilled workers for manufacturing
jobs, while the balance would be divided between 2,700
semi-skilled workers and 2,000 manual laborers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Government planners argue that the territory is suffering
from a labor shortage and that the importation of foreign
workers is essential if Hong Kong is to maintain its
competitive edge in the world economy. Labor leaders say the
colony's work force can meet current job needs and that the
sharp rise in foreign labor proposed by the government is
partly aimed at undercutting local workers' wages and
benefits.
   Meanwhile, some suspect that the government may be trying
to work both sides of the fence by imposing added costs on
employers seeking to hire foreign workers and so encouraging
the employers to try harder to hire locally. One analyst has
suggested establishing a more liberal immigration policy as a
less costly and less bureaucratic alternative to the
government's plan.
   While labor and government hurl claims and statistics at
each other, analysts note that even if labor isn't in short
supply at present, a shortage is almost unavoidable in the
next few years and could become acute. The analysts point to
an expected surge in demand for construction workers for huge
airport and seaport projects scheduled to begin in a couple
of years and to demographic trends that are likely to deplete
portions of the work force needed for manual jobs and
manufacturing.
   "Our population is aging, and our economy is growing,"
says Richard Wong, director of the Hong Kong Center for
Economic Research, a privately funded research group. Other
analysts note that more young people are choosing the
services sector over the labor end of the work force. "The
labor shortage is not a cyclical phenomenon. It's a long-term
trend," Mr. Wong says.
   K.Y. Yeung, secretary of the Education and Manpower
Department, says the government holds with that long-term
view. He says that since 1985, job vacancies have tripled,
with 102,000 reported last year.
   Union leaders, while conceding that the government may
eventually need to import labor, decry the decision to do so
now. "The government's timing couldn't be worse," says Lee
Cheuk Yan, a spokesman for the recently formed Action
Committee Against the Import of Labor. "Investment incentive
has declined, and the economic situation is in a low-growth
stage."
   Labor leaders note that last year's 3,000-worker quota,
which eventually brought in 2,700 foreign manual laborers,
came when economic forecasts for the colony were rosier than
they are today. Private economists forecast a rise in
unemployment this year to 1.7% from 1.3% in 1989. (Government
figures for the March-May period put unemployment at 1.6%,
compared with 1.5% for the same period last year.) Labor
leaders also point out that the number of reported job
vacancies has declined in recent months, according to
government figures.
   Especially troublesome to labor leaders and union
advocates is the sharp jump in the government's proposed
quota for foreign workers this year. "For the government to
expand to 14,700 this year from just 3,000 last year seems
unreasonable," says Y.C. Tam, Legislative Council member and
vice chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions.
"We are worried that once the importation begins, older and
unskilled workers will be affected. And how many workers will
the government import next year?"
   "We are well aware of the labor sector's views," says
Stanley Wong, principal assistant secretary in the Education
and Manpower Department. "But the fact remains: We suffer
from a labor shortage, and this is a constraint on Hong
Kong's ability to grow."
   Advocates of imported labor also point to the recent spate
of illegal immigrants found working on local construction
sites as evidence of the continuing labor shortage. Union
advocates argue that the immigrants' willingness to work for
lower pay means they are stealing jobs from local workers
rather than filling a need.
   In the first half of this year, 13,300 illegal workers
were arrested, twice the number for the same period last
year, according to the government. Increased unemployment in
southern China and news of Hong Kong's huge infrastructural
plans have contributed to the influx of illegal immigrants,
says Ian Strachan, deputy secretary for security. Mr.
Strachan concedes that jailing illegal workers hasn't been an
effective deterrent and that changes in laws to penalize
their employers are under consideration.
   However that issue is resolved, analysts say the flood of
illegal workers at least serves as a reminder that, by many
projections, the construction industry's current work force
of nearly 70,000 can't meet future requirements. During the
1990s, the government estimates that more than 20,000
additional workers will be needed just to build the
territory's 127 billion Hong Kong dollar (US$16.36 billion)
airport and port facilities. In addition, the government
plans to construct 527,000 public-housing units by 2001.
   Anthony Chan, an economist at the consulting and
publishing firm Business International, forecasts that
building and construction growth will increase by an average
of 2.9% a year in the first half of this decade, compared
with an average of 0.7% a year over the past five years.
   Besides disputing the government's claim of a labor
shortage and questioning the timing of the importation plan,
labor leaders argue that the proposal aims to undermine local
gains in wages and benefits. "The labor-importation scheme is
a political decision, not an economic decision, based on the
business sector's demand for cheap labor," says Mr. Lee of
the Action Committee Against the Import of Labor.

   R.H. Macy Sells
   Small Equity Stake
   To New York Firm

   NEW YORK -- In a letter to shareholders, R.H. Macy &amp; Co.
disclosed it sold a 1% equity stake in the company to
Corporate Property Investors, a closely held, New York-based
real estate concern, for $15 million.
   Macy has said on previous occasions that it would evaluate
offers from potential additional equity partners, and
analysts said the company appears to have gotten a rich
price. According to those familiar with the situation,
Corporate Property Investors expressed interest in making a
stock purchase within the last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Macy said it will use the $15 million to buy back some of
its subordinated debentures on the open market. Macy noted it
would need approval from its senior bank lenders before
making the purchases.
   Corporate Property Investors owns 28 regional malls
nationwide, including 12 in which Macy's has stores.
   "We have plans for expanding and improving certain malls,
and we feel this investment will help us accomplish that,"
said Hans Mautner, chairman of the investment company.
   Macy also said it has amended its bank agreement with key
lenders, as it has for the two previous quarters. Macy will
be allowed to reduce its cash flow coverage ratio relative to
debt from 1.5 times to 1.2 times through the end of the
January 1991 quarter. Management believes this will calm any
supplier concerns.
   Macy executives also said the company is negotiating to
sell the Bullock's office building in Los Angeles to
Alexander Haagen Co., a real estate developer based in
Manhattan Beach, Calif. Some believe the building may bring
about $40 million.
   Macy said that its cash availability has been greater than
expected earlier this year. Macy attributed this to its
conservative inventory levels and expense plans.
   "Given all the debt Macy's has on its balance sheet, the
$15 million is a damn good price," commented Evan Mann,
high-yield bond analyst at Dillon, Read &amp; Co. "From Macy's
point of view, it's an excellent deal."
   Mr. Mann said he believes Macy will have an "okay but not
great" Christmas selling season. If so, Mr. Mann said the
company won't have any problem meeting its debt obligations.
   "The poor performance last Christmas was an aberration,"
said Mr. Mann. "There shouldn't be nearly as much discounting
this year. However, if the economy turns down, and we have a
harsh Christmas, this could force Macy to make some kind of
exchange offer."
   Mr. Mann added that in addition to the office building,
Macy executives may decide to sell some I. Magnin stores in
Chicago.

   Gleaning Information Becomes Booming Business
   In Washington as Congressional Staffs Swell

CONGRESS (CNG)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Imagine being paid as much as $50,000 a year
to do such things as standing for hours in the hallway of a
public building.
   Of course, it isn't just any hallway. Still bleary-eyed at
7:15 a.m., Terry Bolger waits in the marble hallway of a
congressional office building, second in a line outside the
regal, chandeliered chamber where the House Ways and Means
Committee writes the nation's tax laws.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By the time the committee convenes hours later, more than
a hundred people will have lined up behind Mr. Bolger, a tax
analyst for the public-relations firm of Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc.
Like him, most will be buttonholing congressional staffers,
poring through committee papers, and jostling each other, all
in the attempt to glean the smallest bit of information, or
even of rumor, about what the committee may do next.
   Mr. Bolger and his colleagues represent a relatively new
creature in Washington: the information-gatherer who chases
paper for his employer, usually a law, public-relations or
accounting firm.
   Unlike the stereotypical glad-handing lobbyist, these
agents don't seek to persuade politicians, only to collect
information before anyone else knows it exists and to speed
it to their employers' clients. And while the fat-cat
lobbyists focus on the 535 people in Congress who vote on
issues, the information-gatherers work on the hordes of
staffers who work for those people.
   With budget summiteers meeting behind closed doors to
negotiate what could become a large tax increase, the
information-gatherers are hard at work, looking for any
tidbits about the tax package that may emerge.
   "Our job is the paper chase," says Catherine Schultz, who
pursues tax information for the Washington law firm of Miller
&amp; Chevalier. "If there is an inkling that something might be
out there, we've got to get it. Time is a very crucial
element." The information she collects is used in myriad
ways. One client might want an early warning about a possible
tax change so it can try to head off the change before the
rumor solidifies into legislation. Another might want to
complete a contemplated corporate acquisition before a tax
loophole favoring it is closed.
   Other major congressional committees are also watched
closely. But Ground Zero for the information-gatherers is the
hallway by the Ways and Means Committee, where offhand
decisions made quickly in the wee hours can cost corporations
and investors billions of dollars. A little-noticed
anti-takeover tax bill approved by the committee in October
1987, for example, was later cited as a factor in that
month's stock-market crash. So it is at Ways and Means that
the elite of the information-gatherers has formed a
tight-knit network.
   Until the 1980s, no such class of data-oriented lobbyists
existed. Congress-watching was simpler when congressional
power was more concentrated. Until the early 1970s, big-time
lobbyists generally could track a committee just by knowing
the thinking of its chairman.
   But now power is more dispersed among members of Congress.
That means junior members must be watched. It also means
those junior members can hire more staffers, who themselves
can be valuable sources of information. Since 1972, the
number of staffers on Capitol Hill has increased about 50% to
about 30,000.
   During the 1980s, Ways and Means moved a tax bill almost
every year, making watching it a full-time, year-round task.
As the tax bills proliferated, so did the people who are paid
to monitor them. They are characterized by their cellular
telephones, used to quickly communicate with clients, and
their generous expense accounts, used to schmooze
congressional staffers.
   At first the information-gatherers tended to operate
separately. But the ups and downs of the sweeping 1986 tax
bill sensitized much of corporate America to the importance
of unrelentingly keeping track of what the Ways and Means was
up to. The market for these legislative monitors boomed.
   Over the years, information-gatherers for law, accounting
and public-relations firms have formed an informal
data-sharing network. Not unlike the groups that occasionally
spring up among reporters on a beat, the network's
approximately 30 members share information.
   "Everybody doing it on their own would be just horrible,"
says Ms. Schultz, a resourceful 32-year-old considered one of
the best of the group. "I may talk to a staff person and you
might talk to a committee member, while someone else may get
a document, and then we share notes."
   Two unspoken but crucial rules govern the group: Be
accurate, and share what you get as soon as possible.
Intentional violators of these rules are ostracized.
   And violations do occur. Jean Hartman, who follows tax
legislation for Deloitte &amp; Touche, the big accounting firm,
recalls a colleague asking to borrow a document to copy in a
nearby congressional office. When she stepped outside a few
minutes later for a breath of air, Ms. Hartman saw the woman
hailing a cab to go downtown with another lobbyist.
   But generally, network members cooperate. Two years ago,
for example, Ms. Schultz and a few others sensed that the
conventional wisdom was wrong on an obscure provision of the
pending Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988.
   "Everybody was saying that the bill was dead,"she
remembers. "But a few of us didn't give up on it." Early one
evening she and her colleagues camped out in front of an
office where an informal meeting was taking place and waited
for a hint of a deal.
   At 3 a.m., some staff people who had been in a back room
with Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D.,
Ill.) emerged and indicated the bill was in fact alive. That
meant a provision in the bill extending the government's
authority to issue bonds was alive, and that information
alone was expected to give the bond market a slight boost.
   This was news that Ms. Schultz's bond-trading clients on
Wall Street could use. Despite the hour, she ran to a phone
and began notifying them, and they were grateful to be
roused. "The clients, basically, were thrilled to know that
we were able to get that information when everyone else
thought it was a dead issue," she says.
   "It's a very, very strong network," says Lori Pickford,
who follows the tax committee for the New York law firm of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. During last year's tax
bill, she said, "We worked 24 hours around the clock. When
you spend that much time together, you get on a more personal
level." Indeed, insiders count four marriages among network
members over the last five years.

   NEW YORK -- Habersheir Securities Inc. of Atlanta was
expelled from the National Association of Securities Dealers,
and a principal of the firm was barred from the securities
industry for alleged failure to maintain accurate records and
required net capital.
   The disciplinary action was among a number taken by the
NASD, the self-regulatory agency for the over-the-counter
markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Habersheir, also known as W.D. Fard Securities Inc., also
was fined $15,000 while the principal, Raymond R. Khalif of
Newark, N.J., was assessed $10,000. The firm and Mr. Khalif,
who couldn't be reached, were fined and suspended under an
NASD action announced early this year.
   Hampton Securities Inc. and principal Delores Easthom,
both of West Palm Beach, Fla., settled with the NASD,
agreeing to a total fine of $147,700.
   The firm, which went out of business around last
September, had been expelled under a previous action; Ms.
Easthom was barred as a principal and suspended in any
capacity for two years. Without admitting or denying
wrongdoing, they consented to findings that the firm charged
unfair prices for securities. Ms. Easthom couldn't be
reached.
   Marvin W. Fulford of Asheville, N.C., was fined $205,000
and barred. The NASD charged that Mr. Fulford, who couldn't
be reached for comment, misappropriated customers' securities
and kept the proceeds.
   Other firms and individuals disciplined include the
following. Fines and suspensions are noted:
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., a unit of Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, $90,000; Union Planters Investment
Bankers Group Inc., and three principals, James Neal
Augustine, Lindsay Hill and Robert Joseph Finley, all
Memphis, Tenn., total $75,000; Heiner &amp; Stock Inc. of
Minneapolis and principal Randall R. Heiner, total $15,000.
Heiner &amp; Stock must disgorge almost $50,000, and Mr. Heiner
was suspended 10 days.
   Also, Cardinal Financial Equities Inc., and principal Leo
Charles Loevner, Fairfax and Burke, Va., respectively, total
$30,000 fine. Mr. Loevner was barred as principal and
suspended in any capacity for 30 days; Heidtke &amp; Co. and
principal Lyman O. Heidtke, both Nashville, Tenn., total
$20,000 fine and suspended from effecting securities
transactions for five business days except for certain
unsolicited customer orders; Allegiance Securities Inc., New
York, and Joseph Anthony Giordano, Elmwood Park, N.J., total
$20,000 fine. Mr. Giordano was suspended as principal for one
year and must requalify by exam.
   And Kochcapital Inc. and principal Russell Gordon Koch,
Bellevue and Issaquah, Wash., respectively, total $20,000
fine and must make restitution; First Nutley Securities Inc.
and principal Ronald Durando, both Nutley, N.J., $15,000
fine. Mr. Durando was suspended 60 days; Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., New York, and principal T. Clark Octigan,
Chesterfield, Mo., $10,000 fine. Shearson also was fined an
additional $10,000 and Mr. Octigan must undertake
compliance-related duties.
   All of the above except Heiner &amp; Stock and Mr. Heiner
settled the NASD's charges without admitting or denying any
wrongdoing.
   The NASD barred the following individuals. Fines are
noted:
   Dorothea Yvonne Rivers, Richmond, Va., $75,000; Mark E.
Frost, Phoenix, and Robert E. Panza, Washington, N.J.,

Marshall Britt Wright, Ruther Glen, Va., $6,000; Chaim
Ingber, Boca Raton, Fla., and Edward William Toth,
Spartansburg, S.C., $5,000 each.
   John Terry Thacker, El Paso, Texas, was barred until he
satisfies a $16,000 arbitration award. He also was fined
$5,000.
   The following settled with the NASD and agreed to be
barred without admitting or denying wrongdoing:
   Michael W. Warner Sr., Nashville, $30,000; James A. Brady,
Fairfax, Va., $15,000; Vince J. Castille, Lake Charles, La.,
$10,000; Clarence W. Crawford Sr., Jefferson, Ga., $6,000;
Cregg B. Cannon, Salt Lake City, $5,000.
   Other NASD disciplinary sanctions include the following.
Fines and suspensions are noted:
   Kenneth Glen Schave, Aurora, Colo., six months and
$20,000; James Ross Halloran, Shaker Heights, Ohio; $5,000,
one month, registration revoked; Gibson Connor Gray, Chula
Vista, Calif., 10 business days and $5,000; Arthur L. Svec
Jr., Fairfax, Va., 10 days and $5,000; Craig R. Grossman,
Boulder, Colo., $2,500, five business days, must retake an
exam.
   The following neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing:
   Cornelius J. Jacobs, Huntsville, Ala., six months, no
fine; Ronald Vincent O'Grady, Merrick, N.Y., 10 business days
and $3,000; Daniel James Devaney of Plandome, N.Y., and
Edward Joseph Vierling, Garden City, N.Y., each 10 days as a
principal and $3,000; Michael Patrick Walsh, Mentor, Ohio,
five business days and $3,000; Stanley Charles Goldstein,
Palm Harbour, Fla., three business days and $2,000; James
Ross Halloran, in a separate proceeding, three days to be
served consecutively with above sanction and additional $500.
   Except as noted below, the individuals and firms involved
in NASD disciplinary proceedings couldn't be reached for
comment:
   Jackson W. Moore, president of Union Planters Corp.,
parent of the investment subsidiary, said the NASD matter
"involved some transactions that happened probably close to
two years ago." The firm already has charged off the fine, he
said. "Rather than going to the expense and distraction of
going to litigation, we proceeded with a negotiated
settlement of the matter," the executive said.
   Mr. Heiner said, "We disagree with the interpretation by
the NASD of the facts. The firm did not benefit by the amount
the agency told us we had to give back."
   Mr. Ingber said, "The arbitration hearing is just
symbolic. Everybody told (me), `you're just wasting your
time.' They were right."
   Mr. Heidtke said the firm made a market in a local
low-price stock. Because the issue was a pink-sheet stock,
regulators argued that the markups the firm charged should
have been based on the bid price, or on the firm's cost,
rather than on the more-usual asked price.
   Shearson declined to comment, as did Messrs. Castille,
Crawford, Durando, Giordano, Halloran, Ostrand and Thacker.
   A spokeswoman for Prudential-Bache said the NASD matters
occurred "several years ago" and that the firm settled
without admitting or denying wrongdoing "to put the matter
behind us."
   A spokesman for Kochcapital declined comment.

   Saddam Delivers
   A Little Reminder
   To a Snoozy U.S.

   Who knows, in this era of instant communication maybe
Saddam Hussein was watching the U.S. House of Representatives
this week on C-Span.
   If he gets cable, the Iraqi tyrant could have seen Les
Aspin explain why he wants to kill the B-2 Stealth bomber.
The Soviet threat is gone, said the Armed Services Committee
chairman and supposedly the stoutest hawk among House
Democrats. "Something's got to go." So a bomber with a
10,000-mile range and big weapons payload -- the kind that
could hit or deter Iraq -- isn't needed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Maybe Mr. Hussein saw Florida Rep. Charles Bennett boast
that he's helping to "bring down the Navy from a 600-ship
objective and 500 and more ships to something less than 400."
In the event this week, the U.S. had six small warships in
the Persian Gulf.
   Or perhaps the Butcher of Baghdad caught Rep. Pat
Schroeder (D., Colo.) defending her subcommittee's decision
not to pay to transfer 72 F-16 fighters to southern Italy
from Spain. NATO Commander Gen. John Galvin had personally
lobbied the House about Europe's weak southern flank, but Ms.
Schroeder said "there are no interesting targets left" in the
F-16s' range.
   Besides, she added, what is a congressperson to say "when
a constituent asks you, `Why did you vote to build a base in
Italy at the same time that the Defense Department is closing
Camp Swampy right here?'" Mr. Hussein seems unimpressed with
the Camp Swampy-as-deterrent strategy.
   Though Kuwaitis are suffering for it, in a perverse way
Saddam Hussein has done Americans a favor. He has reminded
Washington that history hasn't ended. Before his invasion,
the defense debate here had an abstract, almost surreal
quality. With the Soviets imploding, the rhetorical question
became, "Where's the threat?" The implicit answer was, there
isn't one. The Noriegas were thought little more than
small-time thugs. Think tanks and members of Congress
stumbled all over themselves to recommend which weapons to
cut and how fast. Anyone who raised doubts was a "cold
warrior."
   Saddam Hussein has rudely, but perhaps fortunately, given
everyone a look at the post-Cold War future. Amazing as it
sounds, American weapons and the occasional use of force will
still be required. Yesterday morning, Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn,
the last serious Democratic hawk, was on TV saying that the
only way the U.S. could project force immediately into the
Gulf is with "long-range bombers." That sounds like the B-2
the House wants to kill.
   To be fair to Congress, the Bush administration has hardly
sounded the alarm about Iraq. U.S. policy before Iraqi troops
massed near Kuwait last week can be summed up as early
Carterism. The State Department resisted even mild
congressional sanctions. It continued government credits for
farm exports worth hundreds of millions of dollars. John
Kelly, State's Middle East man, told Congress only a few
weeks ago that sanctions would impair "our ability to
exercise a restraining influence on Iraqi actions." So much
for restraint.
   In one remarkable episode, only a last-minute tip to the
Pentagon prevented the sale to Iraq of state-of-the-art
furnaces. Made by a New Jersey company, the furnaces are
designed to burn high-purity metal of the sort used to make
parts for nuclear weapons, missiles and gas turbines. The
furnaces were on the dock ready to go; Commerce had approved
the purchase. After prodding by Florida Sen. Connie Mack and
defense officials, the White House blocked the sale.
   The White House appeasement is baffling, since Mr. Hussein
has advertised his belligerence for weeks, including to the
Journal's Karen House. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin
Powell did say recently that, "Iraq has more tanks" -- 5,500
-- "than Rommel, Montgomery and Eisenhower combined had
during the North African campaign." But even while trying to
protect his own defense budget, George Bush hasn't said a
word about Hussein.
   Iraq's invasion is the shape of things to come if the U.S.
withdraws as a military force in the post-Cold War era.
Regional powers, preeminent in their part of the world, will
attempt to dominate their weaker neighbors. India has already
done this on the Asian subcontinent, but no great U.S.
interests are at stake there. The Persian Gulf is different.
   As Soviet power has ebbed, a strange new alliance of
disarmers and isolationists has grown in influence in
Washington, uniting some conservatives and many liberals. One
symbol: The libertarian Cato Institute and left-wing
Institute for Policy Studies agree on defense policy. Their
shared view is that economic might is our main guarantee of
future security (though obviously for different reasons). The
U.S. should come home. The rest of the world (like Kuwait)
isn't our concern.
   By invading Kuwait, Saddam Hussein is showing that
economic interests indeed count, but not merely in the way
liberals and libertarians hope. In a world where a commodity
like oil is still defined by geography, bullies will exist
who will want to control it. In the future, these bullies
will, like Hussein, have nuclear and chemical weapons,
ballistic missiles and eventually space weapons too. We'd
better have enough military power to deter them.

   Florida Is Gaining Reputation as Haven
   For Debtors Who Seek to Shelter Wealth

   Florida is known nationwide as the Sunshine State. But
it's also getting a reputation as a debtor's paradise.
   Attracted by state laws that shield certain personal
assets, individuals looking over their shoulders at creditors
are streaming into Florida. It isn't clear how many people
move to the state expressly to shelter their wealth, and not
all such moves will survive court challenges. But bankruptcy
filings have increased far more rapidly in Florida than
nationally.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the federal Bankruptcy Code applies everywhere,
states can write their own rules about which assets are
exempt from creditors. "In Florida, you can fashion your
ownership of property so you are totally insulated from ever
paying a debt," says Michael G. Williamson, an Orlando
bankruptcy attorney.
   Among the 50 states, only Texas comes close as a debtor's
retreat. John Connally, the former Texas governor, clung to a
200-acre ranch there, leaving creditors to pick over the
remains of his bankrupt estate. The Hunt Brothers also
salvaged big residences despite bankruptcy. Still, Florida
seems to be the favored spot for debtors on the move. "People
don't want to move {to Texas} and buy these houses and see
them go down 30% in value," says Lindsay Sharpe, a bankruptcy
attorney in Austin.
   The centerpiece of Florida's debtor protection measures is
its homestead law. No matter what his debts, a homesteader --
someone who declares a particular property as his principal
abode -- can keep a home of unlimited value on as much as a
half acre of land within a city, or on as much as 160 acres
outside one.
   But that's only the start. The salary of a head of
household is exempt from a creditor's grasp, as are
annuities, certain retirement and profit-sharing plans and
individual retirement accounts. In addition, property owned
by a married couple in tenancy by the entirety -- a legal
form in which each party is viewed as owning the whole asset
-- cannot be seized for debts owed by only one spouse.
   Former baseball commissioner Bowie K. Kuhn, for instance,
moved to Florida last December. His relocation from New
Jersey came just two weeks before a bankruptcy-law filing in
New York by the defunct law firm of Myerson &amp; Kuhn, of which
he was a founding, name partner. By law, individual partners
can be held liable for all the debts of the partnership.
   Mr. Kuhn filed papers in a Florida state court last
December declaring Florida as his legal domicile -- a way of
establishing a homestead. He sold his home in New Jersey in
January and bought a $1 million estate in Marsh Landing, an
enclave in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., a few days later.
   Mr. Kuhn says he "certainly took into consideration the
debtor laws" when he moved to Florida, but also found it an
attractive spot to make a fresh start because of his strong
ties there and the state's professional and recreational
offerings.
   In the spring, Mr. Kuhn was joined in Florida by his
ex-partner, Harvey D. Myerson, who also has obligations
resulting from the bankruptcy of his previous firm -- the
defunct Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp;
Casey.
   Mr. Myerson put up for sale his Manhattan co-op apartment
and East Hampton, N.Y., house and bought a home in Key West
for $1.75 million. The Mediterranean-style, four-bedroom,
six-bathroom property -- including an oceanfront swimming
pool, gold fixtures, a coral staircase and an elevator -- is
tagged "the southernmost home in the continental U.S." A real
estate agent's brochure describes the place as "only 88 miles
from Cuba."
   More to the point, grumble some of Mr. Myerson's former
partners, is that the abode is in Florida. In May, an
attorney representing the bankrupt firm of Myerson &amp; Kuhn
went to federal bankruptcy court in New York for relief.
   "Mr. Myerson is selling his residences in New York,"
Ronald Cohen, the firm's attorney, urgently advised federal
bankruptcy Judge Prudence B. Abram at the hearing. "And we
have learned that he is intending to purchase or maybe has
already purchased . . ."
   "A house in Florida," Judge Abram said, finishing the
sentence. "Beyond ridiculous" was the judge's assessment of
the development. "We've already got one person in Florida,"
she said. "I don't think we should have two."
   Mr. Myerson told his Myerson &amp; Kuhn colleagues that he
wasn't trying to pull a fast one. He agreed to give them a
security interest in his artwork and some New York real
estate to quiet their fears. His attorney, Charles Stillman,
says, "His decision to go to Florida was strictly personal
and not based on creditors' rights."
   For his part, Mr. Kuhn isn't home free yet. After his move
south, Marine Midland Bank, a big creditor, filed suit in a
Florida court, asking for a lien on his Florida property. The
bank alleges he put money into the house to dodge a personal
guarantee of a $3.2 million loan to the law firm.
   "It's an outrage is what it is," says Leon Marcus, a
former Myerson &amp; Kuhn partner, who calls Mr. Kuhn's move "a
great test case" of the Florida homestead law. "I can't
believe the intent of the Legislature was to protect people
under these circumstances. I don't think you have any
instance as flagrant as this one."
   Just how flagrant is too flagrant isn't clear under
Florida law: A certain degree of "pre-petition planning," as
bankruptcy lawyers like to call it, is acceptable. However, a
deliberate move to evade creditors doesn't always work,
particularly if it's taken on the eve of bankruptcy. Under
the federal Bankruptcy Code, if a judge finds a move was made
"to hinder, delay or defraud" creditors, it will be deemed a
"fraudulent transfer" and void.
   Some people have lost their homestead battles. Jake
Butcher's wife left Tennessee and bought a big house in
Longwood, Fla., after the Tennessee banker's empire collapsed
in 1983. But a bankruptcy judge rejected her homestead claim
because she wasn't a "head of household," a requirement since
dropped from Florida law.
   A move to Florida can put a debtor in a strong bargaining
position with his creditors, though, even if he doesn't
ultimately prevail on every point.
   Consider the case of former Ohio financier Marvin L.
Warner. Shortly after the collapse of his Cincinnati-based
Home State Savings Bank in 1985, Mr. Warner put his horse
farm up for sale in Ohio, where only $10,000 of a homestead
is safe from creditors, and headed for Ocala, Fla.
   In the midst of a storm of lawsuits that accused Mr.
Warner of participating in a huge fraud with E.S.M.
Government Securities Inc., a defunct Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
firm, he and his wife filed papers in a Florida court
declaring Florida their domicile and paving the way for a
homestead.
   Mr. Warner bought a 160-acre Ocala horse farm valued at
$2.2 million. He invested $3.2 million in annuities. And he
changed $10.8 million of his assets into property held in
tenancy by the entirety by him and his wife.
   Then, last September, Mr. Warner agreed to pay $16 million
to creditors in a settlement of his bankruptcy case and put
most of his bankrupt-proof assets back into the kitty. He has
kept about $6 million, however, and remains ensconced on the
horse farm, having conceded only to give a lien on it to
ensure payment of the settlement. His conviction on charges
related to Home State Savings and E.S.M. Securities was
overturned on appeal, and the Ohio Supreme Court is reviewing
the case.
   Mr. Warner's attorney, Scott Orth, says his client's
Florida asset transfers were "appropriate estate planning for
a man of his age." Both Mr. Warner and his attorney say that
though he had lived in Ohio, he had strong ties to Florida
where he had kept a condominium for 20 years and wheeled and
dealed in Florida banks. Mr. Warner calls assertions he was
trying to stash assets out of reach "absolutely so untrue."
   Congress is taking aim at one of the more flagrant and
high-profile abuses of bankruptcy. The U.S. Senate passed a
bill July 11 that, among other things, strips bank and thrift
officials of bankruptcy protection for debts arising from
fraud or a breach of duty.
   But drives by thwarted bill collectors to stem unfair
exploitation of Florida's exemptions have received a chilly
reception in Tallahassee, the state capital. Winton E.
Williams, a University of Florida law professor, says any
suggestion of revising the laws is "construed as putting
widows and orphans out on the street."
   Robert Gilbert, former president of the Bankruptcy Bar
Association in Florida's Southern District, acknowledges that
the state's debtor laws provide an "opportunity for abuse."
But he says that there are checks and balances -- "other
statutes that can be used at times to temper or remove the
protections."
   He also argues that "most of the exemptions are geared
toward keeping people off the public dole," and he cites the
"adverse consequences" to a family of garnisheeing a head of
household's wages or limiting the value of the house a family
can keep. "It's a question of where you're going to put the
major burden," he says. "On creditors, who are capable of
taking care of themselves for the most part, or on the
individual who incurs the debt."

   LONDON -- In a new effort to counter Japanese competition,
the European Community is in talks with Washington to expand
trans-Atlantic cooperation in electronics research.
   The talks, begun quietly in Washington and Brussels last
month, explore ways to coordinate existing U.S. and EC
research programs on semiconductors, computers and other
aspects of "information technology," according to EC Science
Commissioner Filippo Maria Pandolfi. If successful, the talks
may expand opportunities for each region's corporate and
academic researchers to collaborate in the other's government
electronics programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The talks are the latest EC response to the growing
success of Japanese electronics companies in Europe, and the
declining health of Europe's own computer and semiconductor
industries. In recent months, nearly all of Europe's major
computer makers have reported tumbling profits or losses.
Japanese manufacturers, meanwhile, have posted rapid gains --
highlighted by an agreement Monday by Fujitsu Ltd. to buy
control of Britain's biggest computer maker, the
International Computers Ltd. unit of STC PLC.
   The research-program talks are "a major effort to
establish a new background of cooperation with the U.S.," Mr.
Pandolfi said in an interview. "I have nothing against the
Japanese, but I have {begun} this preliminary activity to
support our international competitiveness." He said
cooperation with the U.S. would help European industry by
strengthening EC research programs, slated to total 5.7
billion European Currency Units ($7.4 billion) through 1994.
   In Washington, however, officials were eager to play down
any characterization of the talks as anti-Japanese. From the
U.S. perspective, "there isn't any strategic motive for this,
other than seeing what might be useful" in making U.S.
research programs more effective, said Charles Brownstein, an
acting assistant director at the National Science Foundation.
He added that the Bush Administration won't decide whether to
go ahead with the EC research cooperation until a study on
the subject is completed this month.
   The possibility of EC-U.S. collaboration is a new twist in
global technology trade. For most of the 1980s, the two
regions competed bitterly against each other in high-tech
research programs, jealously excluding each other's
researchers from projects. But in Europe, the Japanese are
beginning to supplant the Americans as the biggest source of
high-tech trade worries. The EC's deficit in electronics
trade with Japan has surged rapidly, leading the EC into a
series of anti-dumping investigations against Japanese makers
of photocopiers, computer peripherals and other products.
   The eight days of U.S.-EC discussions last month, in
Washington and Brussels, involved about 75 scientists and
bureaucrats involved in U.S. and EC research programs.
   Besides Mr. Brownstein of the National Science Foundation,
which spends about $200 million a year on
information-technology programs, U.S. representatives at the
talks included President Bush's science adviser and an
official of the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, or Darpa. Darpa subsidizes the Sematech program, a
collaborative effort by U.S. semiconductor makers to bolster
their technology in the face of Japanese competition. Mr.
Pandolfi said he hopes the U.S. and EC will agree soon to
continue such talks, by establishing a permanent task force
on research collaboration.
   One specific issue under consideration is whether to
increase ties between Sematech and Europe's semiconductor
project, called Jessi. Jessi, which gets EC and national
government subsidies of about 500 million marks ($314.7
million) a year, began two years ago as Europe's response to
Sematech.
   But in a further sign of changing attitudes here to the
U.S. and Japan, last January the Jessi board decided to let
the European operations of U.S.-based International Business
Machines Corp. participate in some Jessi research. IBM's
semiconductor operations are among the largest in Europe and
were welcomed for the technology they could contribute to
Jessi. Likewise, Sematech has begun considering the admission
of some U.S. units of such European chip makers as N.V.
Philips of the Netherlands. A further meeting on
Jessi-Sematech collaboration is scheduled for next month at
the Sematech program's headquarters in Austin, Texas.

   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. officials hinted they
may be willing to offer the iron-clad job protection its
biggest union wants in return for concessions that help the
auto maker boost quality and productivity.
   United Auto Workers executives praised Ford's proposal,
outlined in general terms yesterday, as one setting a

security and pension benefits its top priorities in the
talks.

   "The message we got across the table today is that {Ford
is} listening to us," said Ernest Lofton, the UAW vice
president in charge of the union's Ford negotiations.
   Although still in the early stages, the UAW's contract
talks are going better at Ford than at General Motors Corp.
or Chrysler Corp. All three companies are negotiating
concurrently for new three-year pacts with the union. The
three contracts expire Sept. 14.
   Talks are moving more smoothly at Ford principally because
the company's operations are leaner than its U.S. rivals.
That gives Ford more flexibility to make job security
promises.
   "The people we're dealing with here at Ford are unlike
those at GM or Chrysler," Mr. Lofton said.
   Ford has objectives of its own, chiefly quality
improvement. The auto maker also hinted that it will ask the
union to accept less in the way of pay and benefits
improvements in return for job security.
   By signaling their willingness to negotiate strict job
security provisions, Ford officials are angling to become the
union's strike target. That would give Ford the chance to
negotiate an agreement that would set the pattern for
contracts at GM and Chrysler. In effect, Ford could set the
terms for labor relations at the rival U.S. companies.
   Many in the auto industry still expect the UAW to choose
GM as its target and force a showdown over job security
there. The No. 1 auto maker has laid off more than 30,000 UAW
members in the past three years.
   However, a UAW spokesman suggested Ford may have improved
its chances.
   "If Ford meets all of our requirements and the other
companies are dragging their feet, then Ford will be the
target," a UAW spokesman said.

   JACKSON CENTER, Ohio -- Thor Industries Inc. said it filed
suit against Rexhall Industries Inc., alleging that Rexhall
violated a non-compete agreement, among other things. Thor is
seeking more than $10 million in damages.
   Thor, a maker of recreational vehicles, said the action
stems from its purchase in 1985 of Establishment Industries
Inc. from several individuals, including Rexhall's founder
and majority shareholder. At the time, Thor said it had
obtained non-compete agreements.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit, filed in Los Angeles federal district court,
also names Herbert F. Boeckmann II and William J. Rex. Mr.
Boeckmann was the principal shareholder of Establishment. Mr.
Rex, a former president of Establishment, is founder and
majority shareholder of Rexhall Industries, which is a
Saugus, Calif.-based maker of motor homes.
   Officials at Rexhall couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.
   Also a party in the suit is Airstream Inc., a Thor
subsidiary. Airstream alleges that Rexhall has unfairly
competed and infringed on a trademark. Airstream seeks to
enjoin the use of the trademark. The subsidiary also seeks
unspecified damages, Thor said.

   WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 521 money-market
funds increased $800.1 million, to $395.42 billion, in the
week ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a trade association.
   Assets of 251 general-purpose funds rose $541.5 million to
$136.44 billion, and assets of 102 broker-dealer funds rose
$258.7 million to $161.01 billion. Assets of 168
institutional funds were virtually the same as the previous
week, at $97.97 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Several consecutive weeks of solid inflows into
money-market funds brought their assets to the highest level
ever," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist
at the institute. He said the increases occurred "despite a
gradual easing of short-term rates and some steepening of the
yield curve," adding that the funds "succeeded in maintaining
their competitive yield relative to alternative short-term"
investments.
   Mutual-fund assets were revised through July 4 to include
eight new institutional funds with assets totaling $2.8
billion. For the previous week, the revised total of assets
of funds is $394.62 billion.

   Free to Enjoy the Cruelty of the Streets

   When a church opens its doors for worship, it opens them
to everyone, and that should include the homeless, no matter
their physical or mental condition. But this Christian
response can also be dangerous -- witness last year's
horrifying murder of a worshipper in St. Patrick's Cathedral
by a deranged homeless man.
   At the church where I am rector, a midtown Manhattan
Episcopal parish, just such people -- homeless and
unmistakably very mentally ill -- do sometimes wander in
during our Sunday services. One man in particular, swathed in
torn and dirty clothes and unable to speak coherently, has
come in several times; he walks quickly up a side aisle,
enters a pew near the front, kneels and seems to pray, though
it be only babbling.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He even came in briefly while the new Episcopal bishop of
New York was conducting confirmation ceremonies. As on
previous occasions, he knelt, seemed to pray, then jumped up
and walked out down the center aisle, speaking frantically
but causing only minimal disturbance.
   But on a recent Sunday, his pattern changed radically. As
my associate minister was giving her sermon, the man came
quickly up the center aisle in a very agitated state. He
entered a front pew, knelt and then stared at the woman in
the pulpit. Suddenly, he scrambled from the pew and ran
toward her, shouting.
   My associate stopped speaking but held her ground in the
pulpit. Fortunately, two laymen reacted quickly and ran up to
either side of the man, touched his arms gently and quietly
persuaded him to leave. They escorted him back down the
center aisle as he raged and shouted.
   "And we will pray for him, too," my associate told the
congregation.
   Though only a brief intrusion, it left us all a bit
shaken, realizing how differently and violently such an
incident might have ended. And, of course, thoughts of our
own safety aside, we are concerned for the hundreds of people
such as our anguished visitor who are living on the city's
streets, most of them seemingly mentally ill. Our church,
like so many in the city, has programs to aid the homeless.
But our concern also leads us to a philosophical, legal and,
sometimes, religious debate with ourselves: Should insane
people who roam the streets be confined against their will or
should they be allowed to remain free?
   Many are on the streets as a result of the closing of
mental institutions in the 1960s and '70s. Critics who
campaigned against these institutions said they were more
barbaric prisons than hospitals for healing; sadly, the
community-based outpatient clinics that were supposed to have
replaced them have never materialized.
   When I began my ministry in New York City in the early
1970s, I, too, argued that these unfortunates were better off
on the street than in some hellish asylum. Now, I am not so
sure.
   A friend who is both a professor of philosophy and an
Episcopal priest doesn't accept the position that society's
overriding concern is for the freedom of movement of the
insane. "I am a member of the American Civil Liberties Union
and I am a Christian," he told me. "The ACLU part of me says
they should not be locked up; the Christian part of me says
that it is not right to let them roam the streets in such
terrible shape."
   My friend's statement of the alternatives shows that it's
not simply a question of confining the disturbed against
their will or letting them live free -- for what does "free"
mean in such cases? How could the man who lunged toward the
pulpit in our church be described as exercising his free will
if he is clearly unaware of what he is doing? How could he be
said to have civil rights that include freedom of movement if
his actions are driven by inner compulsions over which he has
no control?
   Surely not only the Christian would take a larger view
that leaving the man in a degraded state not only doesn't
help him but casts a moral shadow over the society that is
guaranteeing him his putative freedom of movement. Surely not
only the Christian would wonder if we would all be better off
if the man were confined and had a better chance for a more
human existence.
   We need, then, to recognize that confining at least some
of the mentally ill may be the best thing for them -- not
just pragmatically, for the good of society, but in humanist
and spiritual terms, for their own good. Already, in New York
City at least, there appears to be wide public sympathy for
measures to keep the homeless from bus and train stations. As
these measures could reflect a coming wave of resentment of
the homeless themselves, it may be time to find ways to get
the mentally ill homeless off the streets.
   As for those who are not insane but who are in danger of
being committed by unscupulous relatives, their rights can be
safeguarded, while those who clearly cannot care for
themselves are cared for. While the indigency of the street
people should make us careful about sweeping them out of
sight for our convenience, we can maintain institutions for
the mentally ill in humane and dignified ways rather than
allowing the least of these, our brothers and sisters, to
suffer the effects of their alleged freedom.

   House Votes to Let Airports Charge
   Passengers Up to $3 Departure Tax

   WASHINGTON -- The House voted to let airports slap
departure taxes of up to $3 on passengers, but the Senate may
ground the proposal.
   The House bill would let the nation's 71 largest airports
impose the fees to pay for airport expansion and noise
reduction. There would be a limit of two charges per one-way
trip, but a passenger could end up paying as much as $12 on a
round trip with intermediate stops.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After a contentious debate, the House, by a 252-171 vote,
rebuffed a bid by Rep. Doug Bosco (D., Calif.) to delete the
provision permitting the taxes.
   "Airline passengers are once again on the verge of being
taken for a ride by the White House," said Rep. Norman Mineta
(D., Calif.), an opponent of the fees, officially dubbed
passenger facilities charges. "The Congress shouldn't license
this slap at the consumer." He said the government should
first spend the $8 billion surplus in the aviation trust
fund, which is financed by the 8% airline ticket tax.
   But Glenn Anderson (D., Calif.), chairman of the House
Public Works and Transportation Committee, argued that the
new fees are needed to augment the spending.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner has made approval
of the fees a top priority, and that was reflected in the
vote on the Bosco amendment. Republicans voted overwhelmingly
against the amendment, while Democrats were split.
   Still pending before Congress is a Bush administration
proposal to increase the airline ticket tax to 10% from 8%.
That proposal is expected to be adopted as part of the budget
negotiations.
   The House bill also authorizes $17.7 billion in spending
by the Federal Aviation Administration on airport development
and air-traffic control programs for the next two years. The
final vote on the bill was 405-15.
   In the Senate, prospects for the legislation are murky.
Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), chairman of the Commerce
Committee, and Sen. Wendell Ford, (D., Ky.), chairman of the
aviation subcommittee, oppose the passenger facilities
charges. According to their aides, the senators don't plan to
pass an FAA authorization bill this year because they don't
want to provide a vehicle for the departure-tax provision.
The agency would receive funding in any case.
   Congress banned departure taxes in the early 1970s because
some local governments were using the money for non-airport
projects -- a practice prohibited under the new House bill.
Airports levying departure taxes would be required to
relinquish up to half of their regular federal funding. Most
of the unused federal funds would go to a discretionary fund
for smaller airports.

   IRAQ'S ATTACK on Kuwait rouses demands to temper U.S.
defense cuts.
   The invasion is bound to help Bush's efforts to stave off
some reductions. The Navy is more likely to get funds for
fast military cargo ships. Some aircraft and non-nuclear
missile programs also should benefit from the Mideast
tension. Bush can use the crisis to argue that lawmakers
should consider "what could happen 10 years from now," says
former defense chief Harold Brown.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Backers of the B-2 use Iraqi dangers to renew their push
to save the bomber. But critics argue that such programs were
meant to deter Soviet nuclear threats, not deal with Third
World blow-ups. House Democrats say their proposed cuts spare
conventional weapons, such as fighter jets, that are most
useful in regional crises.
   Big cuts are still likely, but the crisis changes the
mood. Sen. Dole calls it a "wake-up call" for a strong
defense.
                                                                                                       

   ISRAEL REAPS immediate political benefit from the Iraqi
invasion.
   "Saddam Hussein replaces the Ayatollah as the devil
incarnate in the Mideast, and Israel's strategic importance
is again highlighted," says New York Rep. Downey. The Iraqi
dictator's aggression is sure to shore up political support
for U.S. aid to Israel. The split among Arab nations also is
seen as an opportunity for Israel to face up to long-term
problems in the Mideast.
   "Israel can't afford to have the Saudis under the gun and
neither can the Arab world," says Wisconsin Rep. Obey,
chairman of a House panel overseeing foreign aid. But chances
for pressuring the Israeli government to accept Baker's
Mideast peace plan evaporate as the the Iraqi attack
strengthens Israel's political standing in the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   RECESSION WORRIES, fanned by Iraqi turmoil, hurt GOP
candidates the most.
   Oil-price fears fueled by Iraq's invasion will add to
voter concerns about a sluggish economy, falling house prices
and a possible severe downturn by fall elections. The party
in power usually gets the blame. "Combine a recession with
taxes and the S&amp;L crisis, and you've got a pretty deadly
situation" for the GOP, predicts Democratic political
consultant Paul Maslin.
   Most at risk: incumbent governors in states with soft
economies, including GOP governors in Rhode Island, Maine,
Florida, Nebraska and Iowa. A downturn would hurt GOP Sens.
Coats in Indiana and McConnell in Kentucky, and challenger
Schneider in Rhode Island. Democratic Sen. Baucus is
vulnerable in Montana, where the economy already is bad.
   Most economists think an actual recession will be avoided.
One bright spot: increased U.S. exports to Europe.
                                                                                                       

   HIGHER OIL PRICES from the Iraqi crisis "could hurt" the
movement toward raising taxes on energy as part of a budget
accord, says House Budget Committee Chairman Panetta. A House
Democratic leadership aide says energy taxes are still on the
table for now, but probably would be removed if oil prices
jump sharply.
                                                                                                       

   TAX RESISTANCE is linked to the S&amp;L scandal. "There's just
a sense of rage," says GOP Rep. Gingrich; voters ask if
Congress will "raise taxes for the savings &amp; loan bailout."
Democratic Rep. Williams says voters oppose taxes to pay for
"spending into infinity, and the biggest spending pit to
nowhere is the S&amp;L cleanup."
                                                                                                       

   MONEY FLOWS into Senate races. Texas Sen. Gramm leads the
way with $13.5 million. New Jersey Sen. Bradley is next at
$11.5 million. Others above $5 million: Sens. Helms, Simon,
Boschwitz, Kerry and Levin. GOP Senate hopefuls Rep. Martin
in Illinois and Rep. Tauke in Iowa raise more than $3 million
each, tops among challengers.
                                                                                                       

   FAMILY LEAVE heats up in the states, after Bush vetoes a
federal law. More than 12 states, including Illinois and
Pennsylvania, have bills pending to create or expand
job-protected leave. Democrats push leave "as one of the main
campaign issues" in the Illinois governor's race, says
Shelley Gates of Chicago's Women Employed.
                                                                                                       

   CLEAN AIR LEGISLATION is bogged down by delays and
disputes.
   More than two months after the Senate and House passed
bills, conferees have met just twice. Much of one session was
spent arguing over whether White House aide Roger Porter
could sit in. Environmentalists accuse Rep. Dingell and other
friends of industry of foot-dragging to increase their
leverage. Dingell denies delaying.
   William Fay, head of an industry coalition, says the
biggest threat to the bill "comes from the extremism of the
Senate." He contends senators push to combine the toughest
parts of both bills on such issues as industrial emissions of
toxic chemicals. The Sierra Club's Daniel Weiss grumbles
sarcastically that the process is "moving faster than a
speeding glacier."
   The White House raises its estimate of the annual cost to
industry of each bill to $25 billion by 2005, above the $21
billion Bush said he would accept.

   Bear Stearns Cos.
   Profit Fell 30%
   In June Quarter

   NEW YORK -- Bear Stearns Cos. posted a 30% drop in net
income for its fiscal fourth quarter, capping a mixed
earnings season for Wall Street securities firms.
   The big securities firm, citing the cyclical downturn on
Wall Street, said net for the quarter ended June 30 was $33.5
million, or 32 cents a share, compared with $47.6 million, or
43 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $640
million from $629.7 million. Many analysts had expected the
firm to earn between 40 cents and 43 cents for the quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the results, however, Bear Stearns remains one of
the few securities darlings among financial-services
analysts.
   "I'm not table-pounding any of these stocks, but Bear is
the only one I have a buy on," says Larry Eckenfelder, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "It still has
good value and not a lot more downside."
   Yesterday, Bear Stearns shares closed at $12, down 62.5
cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Bear Stearns's results bring to a close an uneven period
for securities-firm earnings. For the first time in nine
months, securities firms as a group broke into the black in
the June quarter. But the results were mixed: Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. surprised analysts with a jump in investment-banking
revenue, while Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s shares have
dropped 18% since its disappointing earnings were released
last week.
   Bear Stearns's per-share results are adjusted for a 5%
stock dividend declared yesterday, to be distributed with the
regular quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents on Aug. 31.
   Commissions were a little softer than some analysts were
expecting; apparently an anticipated investment-banking deal
didn't close before the quarter ended, some analysts said.
Commission revenue for the quarter was down 22% to $77.9
million.
   Investment banking revenue rose 4.3%. An increase in
interest and dividend income was offset by an increase in
interest expense.
   For the year, Bear Stearns's net income fell 31% to $119.4
million, or $1.10 a share, down from $172.4 million, or $1.54
a share. Revenue was flat at $2.4 billion. Commission revenue
was down 2% but investment banking revenue dropped 17%.
   Strong performances in the areas of mortgage-backed
securities, government bond and stock trading helped the
fourth quarter, Bear Stearns said.
   In a statement, Chairman Alan C. Greenberg said "fiscal
1990, particularly the first six months, was a tough year for
the investment banking and brokerage industry." In light of
that, he said, "we are proud of our results for the quarter
and the year."
   Indeed, Mr. Greenberg showed good spirit and a touch of
humor about the results. "I have always heard that we are in
a cyclical business. I am eagerly awaiting the next upward
cycle," he said in the statement.

   Westerners rubbed their sleepy eyes yesterday morning to
the news that Saddam Hussein had made his big play for the
Persian Gulf's oil.
   His takeover of Kuwait capped a week in which the U.S.
Congress has been busily gutting the President's military
budget. It came after a long string of warnings, including
one from the Journal's Karen Elliott House, that feeding Mr.
Hussein cream won't turn him into a pussy cat. Now, someone
has to figure out how to put the pussy cat back in his cage,
and that won't be easy.

   President Bush responded yesterday by freezing Iraqi
assets in the U.S. and launching a trade embargo, policies
Jimmy Carter employed with such great effect against Iran at
the outset of the hostage crisis. Iraq probably has some
assets in the U.S., but it is doubtful that they are anywhere
close to matching the size of its total external debt;
yesterday the Iraqis replied that they'd stop debt repayments
to the U.S.
   Basically, what Saddam Hussein has conducted is a good
old-fashioned caravan raid of the type his ancestors, and
multitudinous other war-makers throughout history, would
understand quite well. Not only is Chief Hussein looting a
very rich country, with external assets estimated at $100
billion, but he is wiping out his $10 billion debt to the
Kuwaitis. He used that $10 billion to help buy the arms he is
now employing for liquidating the debt.
   What effect the invasion will have on the world-wide
supply of oil is a more complex question than it might at
first seem. London initially marked up crude-oil futures by
some $2 a barrel to over $22. Presumably, Mr. Hussein intends
to sell his stolen oil -- he needs the money -- so supply
curtailment is not a certainty. But there can be no doubt
that he has gained important leverage in the world market.
   Some other factors aid his leverage. The Soviet Union's
producing and distribution infrastructure has been breaking
down because of shoddy construction and poor maintenance and
it has had to curtail its exports to such places as Poland
and Czechoslovakia. The Soviets yesterday joined the
world-wide chorus of complaint against Mr. Hussein, but they
desperately need foreign exchange, and an oil-price increase
would help offset their lost shipments. It should also be
remembered that the Soviets have been his number one arms
supplier (the French are second).
   Which raises the question of military retaliation against
Iraq. Hussein's million-man army is not the Panamanian
self-defense force. The U.S. has no ground forces in the
region, in no small part because allies like Kuwait were
unwilling to accept American bases. Our NATO allies have
consistently insisted that a threat to their Gulf oil
supplies is an "out of area contingency." The U.S. yesterday
headed a carrier task force for the Persian Gulf, but for
carriers the Gulf is a constraining puddle. Iraq has some
fairly sophisticated attack fighters, with Exocet missiles,
and might score a lucky hit.
   The U.S. has the means to conduct discriminate raids
against Iraqi economic targets, and should be reading this as
a possibility. But Mr. Hussein's threats to gas half of
Israel are probably meant to hold it hostage against
precisely such raids. The Israelis, lately treated with some
disdain by the American foreign policy establishment, have a
lot of muscle but indicated yesterday that they will sit on
their hands unless they themselves are attacked.
   Against those limited options we must set the high stakes
involved. You can bet that Mr. Hussein made some serious
calculations of his chances for getting by with his theft of
Kuwait, and also that those calculations do not stop with
Kuwait. The way to get real leverage on world oil prices, he
will surely reason, is to steal Saudi Arabia's oil as well.
He is militarily capable of doing so, unless the Saudis
seriously resist and the West is united in their aid -- both
highly doubtful.
   Mr. Hussein could easily take control of the entire Gulf
oil region except Iran, which would give him a real prospect
of controlling the world oil price, at least for a time. He
could levy billions of dollars of taxes on Western oil
consumers. These taxes would beyond doubt be devoted to his
military machine, particularly to the development of nuclear
weapons and missiles to allow him to threaten and intimidate
not only the Gulf Region but the developed world.
   Years of fecklessness have left the West without a good
response to Saddam Hussein. Faced with ideological conflict,
its leaders have forgotten the ancient threat of piracy, all
the more serious in today's interdependent world. The need to
stand up to pirates should come clear as the West finishes
rubbing its eyes. Western leaders have a lot of new thinking
to do. We do not know where it ends, but it starts with a
recognition that they have huge interests involved.

   Travel Industry Is Stalled for Second Summer in a Row

   The U.S. travel and tourism industry is having a slow
summer for the second year in a row.
   Nearly every sector of domestic leisure travel -- from the
sprawling California theme parks to the quaint inns of
Nantucket, Mass. -- is reporting that business is flat or
down 5% to 10% from last year. Many airlines, hotels and car
rental companies say domestic business is flat, too.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's a big change from the double-digit increases the
industry reveled in during most of the 1980s. More
importantly, the slowdown comes only a few months after air
travel began rebounding, which had raised some hopes that the
industry wouldn't be hurt badly by the nation's weakening
economy. Now, most experts are worried that the $320
billion-a-year travel industry may be headed for a prolonged
slump.
   "Just about nobody is doing very well," says James
Cammisa, publisher of Travel Industry Indicators, a
Miami-based newsletter. "Everyone has come down a notch," he
says. Like most experts, Mr. Cammisa says the shaky national
economy seems to be keeping travelers home. "In bad times,
discretionary travel is the first to go," he says.
   The news is good for travelers, since the slowdown is
keeping many travel prices down. But it's troubling for
airlines, because most of them are in the midst of big fleet
expansions. It's also worrisome for several huge new resorts,
casinos and theme parks -- ranging from the Excalibur Hotel
in Las Vegas to MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios Florida in
Orlando -- that have opened in the past few months.
   To be sure, a few regions, such as parts of Florida and
Texas, are experiencing a strong summer. But overall, U.S.
airline boardings fell 0.7% in June from year-earlier
figures, and analysts say July doesn't look much better. "The
industry is just having a soft summer," says John Tague,
marketing vice president for Midway Airlines. The National
Park Service, meanwhile, says June traffic volume was flat.
   Although Walt Disney Co. doesn't release attendance
figures, analysts suspect that Disneyland's business is at
best flat and that DisneyWorld in Orlando is ahead of last
year. Universal Studios Hollywood concedes its total gate is
off slightly, with stronger local attendance mitigating the
lack of foreign and out-of-state visitors. "The tourists are
not here" in Southern California, says Joan Bullard, a
spokeswoman for the MCA tour.
   One of the hardest-hit areas is New England, according to
travel experts. Some Nantucket hotels, for example, say
business is off 10% to 40% during the week. "We're not a
bunch of happy campers right now," says Elizabeth Oldham,
executive director of the Nantucket Island Chamber of
Commerce.
   Along with the unstable economy, travel experts say high
airline fares may be contributing to the slowdown. The fare
increases have slowed down this summer, but prices are still
50% higher on some routes than a few years ago. Other travel
specialists are worried that as the baby boom generation gets
older, the percentage of people in their 20s, a large
traveling group, is shrinking. They say baby boomers also may
be a little burned out from all their past trips.
   "Americans went on a travel binge in the '80s," says John
Savich, director of the Michigan Travel Bureau. "Now, they
just have less of a drive to travel, particularly on long
trips."
   Few analysts are optimistic that there will be a
turnaround this fall. Often, airlines drop fares in this
season, which gives the travel industry a boost. But fuel
prices are expected to rise sharply soon, and that could
discourage a lot of carriers from dropping prices. "If you
asked me a month ago, I would have said there would be
discounting in the fall," says Sky Magary, executive vice
president of marketing for Northwest Airlines, a unit of NWA
Inc. "Now, I'd say there would be less of it."

   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent prices of oil and gold
jumping and prices of stocks skidding. That is, it's a push
toward both inflation and recession. But this only continued
the recent trend. Stocks started retreating from their highs
with Dick Darman's "crisis" budget review, and indicator
after indicator has suggested a flattening real economy. Yet
rising gold and a falling dollar have suggested more
inflation, voting no confidence in the Federal Reserve's July
easing.
   The military developments in the Gulf, in short, are a
fresh reason to doubt that this is the time to increase
taxes. Since when, and in what economic model, do higher
taxes forestall recessions? With Saddam Hussein threatening
to slap an energy tax of his own on Western consumers, why
should the U.S. budget summit slap them with another?
Especially so since the inflation numbers suggest the Fed
cannot afford to bail out the deal with easier money. The
fiscal-monetary mix of higher taxes and easy money, indeed,
has always been a prescription for stagflation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the Fed is going to have to fight inflation, we will
have to find another policy lever to stimulate real growth.
We can rule out Keynesian pump-priming, for both technical
and political reasons. Spending cuts would help by relieving
government demands on real resources, but no one really
expects that from the summit. What the economy needs is a
sound dollar to fight inflation, and incentive-directed tax
cuts to stimulate growth. That is, monetary restraint and tax
cuts, the supply-side policy mix that curbed stagflation
under President Reagan.
   Fed Chairman Greenspan, already having taken back the
language that suggested easier money if taxes were increased,
can be counted on to keep an eye on the dollar. Happily, the
U.S. Senate will shortly have a chance to vote on the fiscal
side of the prescription.
   When the bill raising the debt ceiling comes up today or
this weekend, Senators Connie Mack and Bob Kasten will offer
an amendment to cut the capital-gains tax, a clean proposal
with a 15% rate after a one-year holding period. When
Majority Leader George Mitchell personally stopped a
capital-gains cut last year, we predicted it would slow the
economy. Now it has; it's time for the Senate to do what a
majority wanted to back then.
   Especially so since a capital-gains cut would increase
property values, directly easing the burden of the savings
and loan bailout. Only yesterday, William Seidman, chairman
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., testified that a
capital-gains tax cut would boost sales of foreclosed S&amp;L
assets. He told the Senate Banking Committee, "There's no
question in my mind that a great many people who are
purchasers are buying these assets for the purpose of seeing
them appreciate and then selling them, and clearly, if the
tax rate were lower, they would be more interested."
   We know that Senator Mitchell and other Democrats complain
that capital gains is a tax cut for "the rich," and refuse to
accept studies -- most recently by Allen Sinai -- that with a
lower rate the rich would pay more total taxes. We sometimes
suspect they want a recession for political reasons. But it's
OK by us if they help lower-income taxpayers by passing
another amendment, Senator Daniel P. Moynihan's proposal to
phase down the Social Security payroll tax.
   Unlike the capital-gains tax cut, the Moynihan proposal
would reduce federal revenues. That is, the incentive effects
are not so powerful, but they are powerful enough that the
Moynihan loss would not be as large as depicted by the usual
static models. Studies by former Treasury economists Gary and
Aldona Robbins show that every $1 cut in the payroll tax
would produce about 55 cents of new economic output and 15
cents to 20 cents of revenue to the federal government. Over
five years the Moynihan plan would probably cost Washington
only about $40 billion in revenue, or roughly the same as the
gain Mr. Sinai predicts from the capital gains cut.
   The package of the two would be a powerful jump-start for
the general economy, but would produce screams from both
Senator Mitchell and those who share his ideological tic, and
from a White House that's persuaded itself the whole universe
revolves around the deficit. But especially with the new
Iraqi threat to the economy, the Senate majority is still
free to do the right thing.

   The Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait:
   Kuwait Fails in Attempt to Sell
   $100 Million of Treasurys in London

   Kuwait tried to sell about $100 million of U.S. Treasury
securities in London early yesterday as Iraqi troops invaded
its territory, but it was rebuffed by most securities
dealers, traders said.
   Kuwait had been selling U.S. Treasury notes and bonds for
several days to raise cash as tensions with Iraq increased,
the traders said. But as news of Iraqi troops entering Kuwait
hit the newswires, dealers in U.S. government bonds stopped
doing business with Kuwait because they feared that the
Persian Gulf nation might not be able to deliver the
securities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A manager at a Swiss securities firm said: "We could not
transact business with Kuwait because we were not sure if
we'd get paid."
   Jonathan Binder, a bond salesman in the New York office of
British securities dealer James Capel &amp; Co., said that most
large dealers received calls from Kuwait trying to sell
securities, mostly three-to-seven-year Treasury notes.
   However, some British-based securities firms were
cautioned by the Bank of England that trading with Kuwait
could be risky.
   One firm that did trade with Kuwait, despite the Bank of
England's warning, was Midland Montagu Securities, a unit of
Britain's Midland Bank PLC. But according to an executive at
Midland, which announced a few weeks ago that it would no
longer be a primary dealer of U.S. government bonds, the firm
purchased only foreign currency from the Kuwait Investment
Office. The government-owned office holds a 10.5% stake in
Midland Bank.
   A $100 million trade is considered small for the U.S.
Treasury bond market, where more than $100 billion of bonds
trade daily. But if such a trade were to sour, it could be
devastating for a single securities firm.
   Even after a decade, dealers haven't forgotten the
problems they had when the U.S. froze Iranian assets during
the hostage crisis. In some cases, it was two years before
dealers were compensated for cash and securities owed them by
Iranian accounts.
   Late in the day, the British government froze Kuwaiti
assets as did the U.S. and several other countries.
   Today, "in a period where securities firms and brokers are
going out of business" because of tough conditions in the
Treasury market, "everybody was worried about doing business
with Kuwait," said an economist at a British securities firm.
   Kuwait's government has been a big buyer of U.S. Treasury
notes and bonds, which are viewed by U.S. and foreign
investors alike as the safest securities in the world. The
market for U.S. government securities is also the largest
securities market in the world, which tends to make it easy
for investors to liquidate the securities at a moment's
notice to raise cash. This was Kuwait's plan.
   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent prices of U.S. Treasury
bonds spiraling lower yesterday.
   The rout began in Tokyo, where the price of U.S. Treasury
bonds fell 3/4 point, or about $7.50 for each $1,000 face
amount. The rout spilled over into London, where heavy
selling among U.S., Japanese, Saudi Arabian and other foreign
investors caused prices of U.S. bonds to fall as much as 1
1/8 point.
   "The Saudis were selling a large amount of seven-year and
10-year Treasurys to raise money," said Capel's Mr. Binder.
   Fears that rising oil prices would spur inflation were
also a major factor behind yesterday's rout.
   Kuwait's efforts to sell U.S. Treasurys added more
confusion to an already deteriorating market in London and
caused U.S. Treasury prices there to fall even further. At
one point trading came almost to a standstill, as traders
scrutinized their books for names of other firms they didn't
want to do business with because of possible heavy exposure
to Kuwait.
   Said one economist for a British firm: "Traders were
saying, anybody who does business with Kuwait, we are not
going to do business with. Then, for a moment, they didn't
want to do business with anyone."

   Thomson McKinnon Asset Management L.P., a New York-based
mutual-fund adviser, settled with findings by the Securities
and Exchange Commission that it failed to properly disclose
certain fees charged customers.
   Without admitting or denying the charges, Thomson McKinnon
agreed to comply with required internal procedures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SEC asserted Thomson McKinnon didn't adequately
disclose multiple fees or that it benefited from the "float"
-- or interest earned -- on customer funds before the funds
were invested for customers.
   The SEC noted that the retail business has been sold and
the company no longer earns float benefits on customer
transactions.

   Trading in Fund American Prior to News
   Of Deal Raises Suspicion of Insider Moves

   Unusually heavy trading in Fund American Cos. stock and
options before yesterday's announcement of the sale of its
insurance unit to Allianz AG suggests there was trading on
inside information as early as three days before the deal was
disclosed.
   The sharp moves in Fund American securities are the latest
in a series of suspicious jumps in the shares of U.S.
takeover targets involving either foreign companies or
foreign investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission
already has charged a number of investors in connection with
several other deals -- notably, Rorer Group Inc.'s purchase
by Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Contel Corp.'s merger accord with
GTE Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SEC began an inquiry into the Fund American trading,
though the agency wouldn't comment.
   The apparent insider trading in Fund American indicates
that despite three years of tough prosecutions of inside
trading and related crimes, U.S. regulators and law
enforcement officials haven't frightened away many
individuals who abuse inside information to make trading
profits.
   "Greed is as American as apple pie," said Bruce Baird,
former chief of the securities and commodities fraud unit in
the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, who prosecuted major
insider-trading cases. Mr. Baird is now an attorney at the
Washington law firm of Covington &amp; Burling.
   Allianz AG, Europe's largest insurance company, announced
a $3.3 billion purchase of Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. from
Fund American. But trading in stock and options of Fund
American suggests that some investors knew by Monday that a
transaction was pending. Under terms of the agreenment, Fund
American will buy back Fireman's non-insurance assets for
$2.2 billion, making the net cost to Allianz of the insurance
business $1.1 billion.
   On the Chicago Board Options Exchange, volume in September
40 call options on Fund American stock began an explosive
rise Monday. Trading in these calls surged from 41 contracts
Friday to 415 Monday, 897 contracts Tuesday and 1,891
Wednesday, according to CBOE records. The options give a
holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares
of Fund American at $40 each.
   On Wednesday, $133,000 of September 40 calls were
purchased in two large blocks near the close of trading. When
the market opened yesterday, and the Allianz deal was
announced, the value of the two blocks leaped-creating an
instant profit of $450,000.
   "There was above-average volume in an illiquid option,
reflecting speculation that a takeover price would come above
$42.50 in the next six weeks," said Michael Schwartz, chief
options strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Yesterday, Fund
American stock closed at $49.75, up $11.625.
   Said Harrison Roth, senior options strategist at Cowen &amp;
Co., "It certainly looks as if somebody knew or thought they
knew something was going to happen to the stock."
   A CBOE spokesperson said the exchange has begun a routine
investigation on recent trading in Fund American options.
   Meanwhile, on the New York Stock Exchange, Fund American's
stock climbed $3.125 a share in the three days prior to
yesterday's announcement. On Tuesday, the stock traded
611,900 shares, and on Wednesday, 511,800 shares; volume on
both days was about four times Fund American's average daily
volume of 138,000 shares. There was no significant news
released about the company during the three days prior to the
announcement.
   A Big Board spokesman said the unusual price and volume
activity has triggered a routine probe by the exchange.
Typically, the Big Board determines within six weeks whether
the trading warrants further investigation.
   Fireman's Fund is only the latest in a series of recent
takeovers that have been marred by unusual, and possibly
illegal, trading patterns, according to regulators and
traders.
   In January, the SEC charged several foreign firms and
investors with insider trading in the securities of Rorer
Group before an announcement that the drug company would be
acquired by French chemical company Rhone-Poulenc. Those
trades allegedly were done through Swiss banks.
   Just two weeks ago, the agency again pressed
insider-trading charges, this time in connection with options
and stock trading of Contel before the phone company's
announcement of a $6.2 billion merger with GTE. Again, the
SEC said the trades were made through Swiss accounts. The SEC
acted quickly to freeze accounts and charged "an unknown"
group of investors with insider trading.
   Around the same time, options traders at the American
Stock Exchange noticed sharp moves in the price of Motel 6
Limited Partnership options well before that company
announced a plan to be acquired by France's Accor S.A. But
published reports about a rumored deal preceded that
announcement, and no SEC charges have been brought.
   Recent SEC enforcement actions spotlight frequent foreign
involvement in alleged insider trading cases. "Europeans just
haven't gotten the message that they may be subject to U.S.
securities laws even though they maybe sitting in Switzerland
or Liechtenstein or someplace," said John Olson, a Washington
securities lawyer. "We don't see as many domestic people
involved because I think the message is pretty well out
here," he said.
   He and other lawyers said that in many foreign countries,
investors don't necessarily think it is wrong to trade on
confidential information.
   "The sensitivity of foreigners to the nuances of our
market is still evolving," said Harvey Pitt, another
Washington securities lawyer. "It has only been in the last
five or six years that most European countries have changed
their views on insider trading" to move closer to U.S.
regulations.
   Mr. Olson said he expects it will be several years before
the SEC and other countries' enforcement organizations are
able to start slowing the pace of insider trading. "The real
problem is that it takes time to get that message across,"
Mr. Olson said. "You just have to charge more crooks."
   Illegal foreign trades in U.S. stocks are among the
toughest for the agency to prove, though. The SEC has been
successful at convincing courts to freeze the assets of
alleged wrongdoers before they can complete the sales of
securities and take the funds out. But after that, the agency
is forced to rely on agreements with foreign countries for
cooperation to prosecute those individuals.

   Mutual Funds:
   Benham to Offer
   Fund Transactions
   At Preset Prices
   ----

<LP>
   Benham Capital Management Group is hoping to lead the
mutual fund industry into the future by drawing on its
chairman's past.
   The chairman, James Benham, spent seven years as a Merrill
Lynch stockbroker before launching the Mountain View, Calif.,
fund company in 1972. As a broker, he found that limit orders
-- buy and sell orders that are triggered if a stock hits a
predetermined price -- were a favorite trading technique with
some customers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now Mr. Benham is hoping limit orders will prove equally
popular with mutual fund investors. On Aug. 13, Benham, which
has $6.3 billion in assets, will launch its "open order"
service, which will allow investors to buy and sell mutual
fund shares at predetermined prices.
   Mr. Benham reckons the open order service will catch on
with investors in Benham's gold stock index fund and its
seven zero-coupon bond funds. "We probably have share prices
as volatile as anybody's," Mr. Benham says. "Some of those
{zero-coupon} funds move as much as 5% in one day." A
zero-coupon bond pays no interest, so the investor instead
can make gains from the narrowing of the bond's discount as
the redemption date approaches.
   Here is how the open order system will work. If a Benham
money market investor wants to buy, say, one of the fund
group's volatile zero-coupon bond funds, he will specify a
buy price that is lower than the bond fund's current share
price. If the bond fund falls to the specified price, money
is automatically switched out of the shareholder's money
market fund and into the bond fund.
   Benham also will allow shareholders in its gold and bond
funds to sell at predetermined prices that are above the
current fund share price. If the fund share price hits this
predetermined price, Benham will switch the shareholder's
money into one of its five money market funds.
   There will be no charge for switching among Benham's 21
no-load funds, though shareholders will be limited each year
to six round-trip exchanges for each fund. Mr. Benham says,
"We're not trying to turn people into traders."
   Mr. Benham had also hoped to introduce a variation on the
stop-loss order, which stock investors use to limit their
losses in the stock market. With a stop-loss order, a stock
position is automatically sold if the share price falls to a
specified level.
   But the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had
some concerns about stop-loss orders, so Mr. Benham decided
to seek approval only for the open order system. "In perhaps
six months or a year, we'll go back and apply for stop-loss
orders," he says.
   News of the innovation has received a tepid response from
others in the fund industry. "It is very innovative," says
Neal Litvack, a marketing vice president with Fidelity
Investments of Boston. "We'll be watching it very carefully.
But from a conceptual standpoint, it does run contrary to the
investment approach that we advocate to our investors, which
is a buy-and-hold approach."
   Kurt Brouwer, president of Brouwer &amp; Janachowski, a San
Francisco investment advisory firm, doubts that the idea will
catch on. "You're kind of encouraging people to trade, and
most fund groups don't want to do that," Mr. Brouwer says.
   "I don't think we're going to lose any shareholders over
this," says a spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates,
Baltimore, who reckons the open order system will encourage
needless short-term trading.

   It's a Real Jungle
   In Merc's Oil Pits
   On Invasion Day

   NEW YORK -- Far from the Middle East battle lines, the
front lines at the New York Mercantile Exchange's oil pits
got mighty rough yesterday.
   Traders, their arms flailing, bumped and bulldozed for
position as the closing bell capped one of the most volatile
days ever in the Merc's crude-oil pits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most traders, hoarse and sweaty, were in no mood to gab as
they sized up their trading positions.
   "Your throat hurts, your feet hurt -- you take a real
physical pounding," said George Gero, a 20-year veteran
commodity trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   When the dust settled, the September crude-oil contract
had jumped $1.57 a barrel, to $23.11, after leaping as high
as $23.80. That's the biggest one-day rise since April 1989,
and the highest closing price for crude oil since January.
   Oil traders thrive on gyrating prices, and there was
plenty of that yesterday as the markets reacted to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. There is fear that world oil supplies
will be disrupted; the two countries are among the biggest
oil producers. Together, Iraq and Kuwait represent more than
20% of the output of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   But the Merc's rough-and-tumble local traders, who jump in
and out of the market trading for their own accounts, don't
keep their eyes glued to the newswires that flash above their
heads on electronic screens..
   "The best way to do it is to go with your instincts, to go
with the trading flow," says Lee Fader, a local trader at the
Merc. "You try to keep rumors out of your head," he says,
adding: "Rumors get you hurt."
   Some locals, for instance, trade on the basis of the price
spreads between oil contracts expiring months apart. Others
use byzantine technical charts to determine when they buy and
sell. Still others size up the feel of the trading pits for
clues, watching other traders' body language or facial
expressions to sense a change in price direction.
   Trading volume of 121,893 contracts at the Merc's
crude-oil ring fell far short of a record, however. That's
because many contracts quickly jumped the daily $1-a-barrel
limit; only the nearby September contract was free to move
more than $1. This means that many traders who had positions
in other contract months weren't able to wiggle out of them.
   On the elevator at the Merc, traders shook their heads and
sized up the damage. "I'm not a happy puppy," said one
glum-faced trader to his buddy. "Don't worry," chirped his
companion. "You're young."
   But oil wasn't the only hot spot in New York's commodity
pits yesterday. Gold prices, after surging more than $13
during the day, closed at $376.80 an ounce, up $3.50 at the
nearby Commodity Exchange here. Volume was a heavy 65,000
contracts.
   Many traders were betting that rising oil prices would
lead to higher inflation. And many people view gold as an
inflation hedge.
   "The first flight {by nervous investors} came into gold,"
says Prudential-Bache's Mr. Gero.
   What about tomorrow's trading? Look for somewhat lower
prices, some traders said, partly because oil and gold closed
well off their highs for the day. But no one was quite
willing to bet big on it yet.
   Says Mr. Fader, the local trader: "It's a crapshoot."

   Meredith Corp.
   Reports a Deficit
   Of $49.9 Million

   DES MOINES, Iowa -- Meredith Corp., hurt by special
charges, reported a loss of $49.9 million, or $2.70 a share,
for its fourth quarter ended June 30.
   The results contrast sharply with the net income of $7.4
million, or 40 cents a share, the publishing and broadcasting
concern posted a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue rose to $185 million from $182.4 million.
   Meredith, publisher of Ladies Home Journal, Better Homes &amp;
Gardens and a host of other largely craft-oriented magazines,
announced in May that it would take pretax charges of $64
million to cover the write-down of certain assets and a loss
from the planned sale of a unit. The final charges totaled
$69 million.
   Meredith took charges of $31.1 million to write down
discontinued operations, including its holdings in the MMT
Sales Inc. television-advertising operation, which it is
selling to a management group; and Meredith's two real estate
operations, which the parent intends to shed.
   Meredith is also carrying as a discontinued operation its
50% interest in a commercial-printing joint venture, which it
has agreed to sell to R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. Federal
antitrust regulators last month sought to block that
transaction, and the final resolution isn't yet clear.
   The company also took $36.8 million in charges to cover,
among other things, the write-down of certain syndicated
television programming purchased by its seven TV stations,
and a $5 million reserve for "outstanding claims," which it
wouldn't identify further.
   Earnings at the magazine group were off from the year-ago
period, Meredith said, in part because a one-time accounting
adjustment boosted last year's results. Also depressing the
magazine operation in the latest quarter were expenses for
"new magazine development costs and soft newsstand sales,"
Meredith said.
   For the year, Meredith had a net loss of $26.4 million, or
$1.43 a share, compared with earnings of $33.2 million, or
$1.75 a share, in fiscal 1989. Sales rose 5.9% to $735.4
million from $694.2 million.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Polaroid Corp. said the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit dismissed a class-action suit
brought against it by Irving Backman, on behalf of investors
who purchased stock and options in early 1979.
   In January, a majority of three judges on the court voted
to overturn a $30 million judgment against the company for
not promptly disclosing material information, and ordered the
case retried in a lower court.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid appealed that decision, and in today's ruling a
majority of the full U.S. Court voted to dismiss the suit.
   As reported, Irving Backman alleged the company didn't
promptly disclose news of problems with its Polavision
product. The product was withdrawn from the market in the
fourth quarter of 1979, after the company took a $68 million
write-off.
   The court ruled that Polaroid "did not, at any material
time, know that Polavision was a commercial failure."
   In July 1987, a federal jury awarded $9.75 a share in
damages to shareholders who had bought stock in January and
February of 1979, for a total of $30 million.

   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved a $300 million loan
to Poland, primarily to help the Eastern European country pay
for essential imports as it moves ahead with its economic
reform program.
   The international agency said the loan, which will be
disbursed in two installments, also would support an
expansion of Poland's so-called safety-net programs,
including unemployment compensation and retraining of workers
displaced during the current effort to restructure various
industries.

   World Bank President Barber Conable promised earlier that
the bank would provide loans to Poland to support the
country's economic reforms. The $300 million loan is its
first credit of this type to the country, according to bank
officials.
   In another action, the World Bank cleared a $125 million
loan to Indonesia to help provide credits to small borrowers,
primarily in rural areas.
   The bank also approved a $75 million loan for rural
development projects in Colombia's Andean and coastal areas.
   The World Bank loans carry a variable interest rate,
currently 7.72% annually.

   Of '70s-Style Economic Slowdown

   NEW YORK -- Saddam Hussein's war is bad news on Wall
Street.
   Although oil and defense stocks rallied yesterday, the
market sank on fears that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will lead
to sustained higher oil prices, dragging down broad swatches
of the economy as the oil shocks of the 1970s did.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts warned that the outlook for corporate earnings,
inflation and economic growth has darkened appreciably.
   "Fundamentally, it's not good for bonds. It's not good for
corporate earnings. And therefore, it's not good for stocks,"
says Steven Einhorn, the investment strategist at Goldman,
Sachs.
   According to Mr. Einhorn, only about 15% of the issues in
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index are energy-related and
could benefit from yesterday's news. For the other 85%, war
news was bad news.
   And Wall Street, which had seemed to be laughing off one
piece of bad news after another, was gloomy yesterday on the
general economic outlook. "The economy was teetering on a
cliff anyway," says Michael Harkins, an investor in New York
who isn't new to bearishness. "This could push it over" into
recession.
   Though the jury is out on that one, few dispute that
higher oil prices raise the risk of recession. Put simply,
because the U.S. is an importer, a rise in prices "siphons
purchasing power to external sources," says Richard Rippe,
economist at Dean Witter.
   And in some sense that goes deeper than the impact on oil
prices, Wall Street seems to fear that the invasion marked a
turning point.
   The invasion and higher oil prices, for instance, could
revive both the expectation and the reality of inflation,
worsen the U.S. trade deficit and make it tougher for
Congress to cut defense spending and arrive at a budget
agreement. And for all those reasons, the Federal Reserve may
be less apt to loosen credit.
   Call it a nest egg for less certain times: John Connolly,
chief investment strategist at Dean Witter, yesterday
recommended that the firm's clients move 20% of their
investment portfolios into cash.
   "This is not a passing event," Mr. Connolly says. "This is
not something that is going to go away this afternoon. It is
a basic change in oil politics in the Middle East."
   But while it never hurts to have some liquid assets, in
general, the notion that one should realign assets according
to the morning's headlines is highly suspect. So much, in
this case, depends on the actions of an Iraqi dictator who is
unlikely to tip off your broker before he changes course.
   And oil prices have had a history of doing the unexpected.
As Shad Rowe, an investor in Dallas, points out, "although
everybody is getting excited, that doesn't alter the fact
that oil is in oversupply."
   Iraq intends to cut back on supply. The question, as Mr.
Rowe frames it, is: "Is the Iraqi army more powerful than
supply and demand?"
   If the crisis is resolved quickly, says Stefan Abrams,
chief investment strategist at Kidder Peabody, "all we're
looking at is a moderate increase in the price of oil." That
would be disruptive, he says, but not catastrophic.
   However, Abby Joseph Cohen, U.S. strategist for Barclays
de Zoete Wedd, says the invasion comes at an especially bad
time for the stock market.
   "The way the market has been priced {relative to earnings
and interest rates}, you had to believe the bullish story" to
invest, she says. Wall Street, she notes, has been
forecasting earnings of about $25 a share for the S&amp;P 500 for
1990.
   But if oil prices rise, that figure will be tough to reach
-- it may have been out of reach anyway. Rising oil prices
thus make the stock market look even more dicey.
   "Until recently, the market put a positive spin on every
piece of news," Ms. Cohen says. But it is hard to put a
positive spin on Saddam Hussein.
   One area for which the invasion is bullish is defense. "It
does show that the world isn't quite the halcyon place that
some might have you believe," says Wolfgang H. Demisch, an
analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Just maybe, then, Congress
will think twice before cutting back spending on conventional
weapons.
   And suppliers to the Middle East will probably find their
customers a bit more ready to do business. Raytheon is one
possible beneficiary; analysts say Raytheon is planning or is
in the process of selling its Patriot defense missile system
to Israel, Saudi Arabia and Italy. Raytheon's shares rose 2
3/4 yesterday to 60 3/4.
   General Dynamics, which is selling tanks to Saudi Arabia,
also could benefit from stepped-up tensions in the Middle
East, but analysts say the overall impact on the company is
likely to be small. The stock closed at 28 1/4, up 1 1/2.
   And as a result of the past year's lessening of tensions
in Europe, Congress and the U.S. public seem agreed that
defense spending should be cut back. Analysts doubt that the
invasion will be enough to deter Congress from that general
course.
   "Under Carter and Reagan, we had nine years of 20% annual
growth in {defense} procurement," says Judith Comeau of
Goldman Sachs. The U.S., therefore, has "an inventory of
aircraft, ships and electronics" that could be deployed in a
regional crisis, she says.
   "Playing" oil stocks is similarly chancy. Although oil and
oil-service, natural gas and other energy stocks rose
yesterday, that is old news as far as investors are
concerned.
   Stephen A. Smith, oil analyst with Bear Stearns, sees a
"tendency" toward higher oil prices. But Mr. Smith, and just
about every other oil analyst, was caught off guard by Iraq's
strike. Its next step is apt to be no less surprising.
   Plenty of stocks -- railroads, airlines and even companies
dependent on airline travel such as Walt Disney -- were
rocked yesterday.
   However, Michael Sherman, chief strategist for Shearson
Lehman Hutton, cautioned against making rapid portfolio
changes such as dumping airline stocks.
   One problem with that strategy, he says, is that airlines
are more dependent on the level of travel than just on the
price of oil.
   And more fundamentally, investors who sell on such widely
known bad news end up selling when everyone else is selling
-- usually the worst time to do it.

   Wexler, High-Profile Lobbyist,
   Is Acquired by Hill &amp; Knowlton

   Hill &amp; Knowlton, the public relations giant that has made
a major push into lobbying, is trying to boost its Washington
presence by acquiring high-profile lobbyists Wexler,
Reynolds, Fuller, Harrison and Schule.
   The move plunges Hill &amp; Knowlton into grass-roots
lobbying, a particularly fashionable brand of
influence-peddling that is Wexler Reynolds's specialty.
Grass-roots lobbying basically involves organizing local
groups so that the lobbying firms' clients appear to have
widespread local support. Among Wexler Reynolds clients are
AMR's American Airlines, the Insurance Information Institute
and the Motion Picture Association.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The merger doesn't involve cash or stock changing hands;
rather, Wexler Reynolds's staff simply will join that of Hill
&amp; Knowlton, said Robert Dilenschneider, the PR firm's
chairman and chief executive officer. He said Wexler
Reynolds, with billings of about $7 million, will boost Hill
&amp; Knowlton's Washington office to over $30 million, making it
the second-largest office after New York.
   "They're excellent in some specialties, one of which is
coalition-building. We see that as the future," Mr.
Dilenschneider said.
   Wexler Reynolds's principals hail from the Nixon, Carter
and Reagan administrations. Principal Craig L. Fuller, who
had been chief of staff to then-Vice President George Bush,
becomes president and chief operating officer of Hill &amp;
Knowlton's public affairs unit. He will report to Robert
Gray, the unit's chairman.
   Mr. Gray, who forged his political ties while acting as
communications director for the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign,
sold his own lobbying firm to Hill &amp; Knowlton in 1986.
   The acquisition comes as Hill &amp; Knowlton, a unit of
London-based WPP Group, is about to announce a major
reorganization. Today, the PR firm, the nation's
second-largest, expects to name Thomas E. Eidson, 46 years
old and currently president and chief operating officer of
U.S. operations, as president and chief executive of Hill &amp;
Knowlton International, a new unit responsible for operations
outside the U.S. He will be replaced by John D. Bergen, 47,
who had been executive vice president and head of the New
York office.
   The New York office, meanwhile, will be divided into three
different offices, headed by Peter Rae, 36; Kenneth Altman,
38; and Christopher P.A. Komisarjevsky, 45.
   Several executives outside the U.S. will also be
reshuffled, including David Wynne-Morgan, chairman of the
London office, who becomes chairman and chief executive of
European operations, succeeding Claudio Belli.
   Noting that the newly promoted executives, including Mr.
Fuller, are relatively young, Mr. Dilenschneider said, "We've
begun to put players in place who will have a run at running
the company over the next 10 years." At 46, though, Mr.
Dilenschneider isn't near retirement age himself.
   With the Wexler Reynolds affiliation, Hill &amp; Knowlton is
trying to reinforce its lobbying prowess. It isn't the only
PR firm to buy up Washington lobbyists; its sister WPP
company, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, has also been quite active,
acquiring, among others, Targeted Communications Corp., a
direct-mail firm, and a 30% stake in Charls E. Walker
Associates Inc. But Hill &amp; Knowlton is undoubtedly among the
most aggressive buyers.
   Already the company has built something of a lobbying
supermarket. It has traditional lobbyists who buttonhole
lawmakers. But it also has researchers, economists, political
analysts, publicists, graphic artists, speechwriters and
managers of campaign contributions. It even houses an
electronic broadcast studio, and produces radio and
television spots ranging from video news releases to
documentaries.
   The Wexler Reynolds merger gives Hill &amp; Knowlton even more
clout. Anne Wexler, a former Carter aide who founded the firm
10 years ago, is considered one of the most powerful
Democratic lobbyists in town. She will become vice chairman
of Hill &amp; Knowlton Public Affairs and chairman of the newly
named Wexler Group. Nancy Clark Reynolds, who had been close
to Nancy Reagan during the Reagan administration, will be
Wexler Group's vice chairman.
   Mr. Fuller said Wexler Reynolds decided on the Hill &amp;
Knowlton alliance after discussions with "three or four of
these large organizations." He said the 45-person firm is
merging in part because it's expanding the scope of its
business and working with some international clients that
could be helped by Hill &amp; Knowlton's 64 offices in 23
countries. The lobbying firm, for example, has been
representing American Airlines in its bid to get federal
approval to expand in Latin America, Europe and Japan.
American is also a Hill &amp; Knowlton client.
   Mr. Dilenschneider said that Wexler Reynolds had just one
client conflict with Hill &amp; Knowlton: Wexler Reynolds handled
Coke, which it had to give up because Hill &amp; Knowlton handles
Pepsi.

   Advances in Race
   For Tokyo Route

<LP>
   A Transportation Department administrative law judge
recommended that United Airlines be selected to fly the
highly sought Chicago-Tokyo route, saying the carrier's
proposal is "substantially superior" to one by its arch
rival, American Airlines.
   The recommendation by John Mathias, the administrative law
judge, was a big boost for the unit of Chicago-based UAL
Corp. and a stinging disappointment for American, a unit of
AMR Corp., Fort Worth, Texas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the contest for the potentially lucrative route is far
from over. The case now goes to Patrick Murphy, deputy
secretary for policy and international affairs, who will
review Mr. Mathias's recommendation and consider any appeals
that are filed. His decision, in turn, will be reviewed by
top department officials.
   The Chicago-Tokyo route is one of six to be handed out by
the Transportation Department by Nov. 3. Under a pact with
Japan signed last November, the U.S. may grant passenger and
cargo flying rights between six U.S. cities and Japan. Three
routes will involve Tokyo.
   Mr. Mathias made the following recommendations yesterday
for the other routes: Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, Los
Angeles-Tokyo and Portland, Ore.-Nagoya, Japan; American, San
Jose, Calif.-Tokyo; Phoenix, Ariz.-based American West
Airlines, Honolulu-Nagoya; and the Continental Airlines unit
of Houston-based Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.,
Seattle-Nagoya.
   Airline industry officials have been closely watching the
Japan route case, particularly because of the financial
stakes involved. The six routes up for grabs -- especially
the three to Tokyo -- are considered hefty revenue
generators. Traffic in the Pacific Rim is expanding about 20%
annually, more than twice the rate of domestic growth, and
passengers who travel on these long flights usually are
business travelers willing to pay high fares. UAL has
projected it would gain $300 million in revenue annually from
the Chicago-Tokyo route alone.
   The administrative law judge, in his recommendation on the
Chicago-Tokyo route, said United would be a stronger
competitor than American. "The record evidence shows that on
an international market level, American cannot compete with
JAL (Japan Air Lines) and Northwest out of the Chicago market
to the extent United can," he said. Northwest Airlines is a
unit of NWA Inc., St. Paul, Minn.
   Mr. Mathias also said that "American is totally unable to
match" service provided beyond Tokyo to other Asian cities by
JAL and Northwest. He did recommend that backup authority be
granted to American, but such authority is rarely used.
   The administrative law judge's recommendation was
especially disappointing for American, because the
department's public counsel had endorsed the airline for the
route. The public counsel is a department lawyer charged with
representing the "public interest." In this case, Public
Counsel Thomas Mahoney concluded that awarding American the
route would foster competition, because United already has a
strong presence in the Pacific Rim.
   American has been counting on getting the route to boost
its ambitious plans to become a global carrier. The airline
already has expansions of its trans-Atlantic and Latin
American route systems in the works. Routes to the Pacific
would have completed the picture.
   "We're bitterly disappointed," American said in a
statement that was highly critical of yesterday's
recommendation, because of United's existing route network in
the Pacific. "We can only conclude that the plethora of
political endorsements United was able to secure were given
greater weight than we believe were appropriate."
   American had tentatively agreed, subject to a favorable
recommendation from the administrative law judge, to buy two
new Boeing Co. 747-400 aircraft, a bow to the department's
preference to award routes to the airline that can fly the
most passengers. At $330 million for the pair of jets,
American was to pay a hefty premium for the planes,
especially as it usually prefers smaller, more cost-efficient
jetliners.
   American also lost out in its bid to fly between Los
Angeles and Nagoya, dimming its Pacific ambitions. The route
recommendations, American said, "will have a profoundly
adverse impact on our company."
   Stephen Wolf, UAL chairman, said that if United is chosen,
"the ability of the U.S. to compete in the international
marketplace will be strengthened."

   SEATTLE -- The National Labor Relations Board said it will
charge Nordstrom Inc. with several violations of federal
labor law in its handling of a dispute with the United Food &amp;
Commercial Workers union if the retailer doesn't agree to
settle the case by Aug. 10.
   The labor board already has charged Nordstrom with
violations stemming from a yearlong dispute with United Food

the two locals, whose pacts covering Seattle-area salespeople
expired last year, broke down after the company proposed
making union membership optional.

   In the latest case, Larry McCargar, assistant to the labor
board's regional director in Seattle, said the agency found
merit to union allegations that Nordstrom illegally assisted
some employees' efforts to decertify the union, disciplined
and discriminated against employees who supported the union
and promised employees additional benefits if the unions are
decertified, among other things.
   A spokesman for Nordstrom said the company is "not
agreeing with what the NLRB has said, but we are going to
move to settle."

   WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said there have been politically motivated
attempts to influence the agency's decisions regarding
regulation of financial institutions.
   The FDIC chief, William Seidman, in testimony before the
Senate Banking Committee, said there have been "maybe two or
three instances where it would appear that people were trying
to push us to a decision" regarding "particular
transactions."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In answer to a question by Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.),
Mr. Seidman said he had been subject to such pressure, but
that it had been "a very minor factor." He didn't explain
what form the pressure took, how he responded, or what
decisions or financial institutions were involved. Neither
Mr. Bryan nor any of his colleagues pressed the bank and
thrift regulator to elaborate on his response.
   The issue of political influence of thrift regulation has
been raised in recent weeks by the case of Arizona
businessman James Fail, who purchased 15 insolvent Texas S&amp;Ls
from the government in 1988. An investigation by a Senate
Judiciary subcommittee has revealed that Mr. Fail, who had a
number of previous legal problems, made the purchase under
extremely favorable financial terms after a former adviser to
then-Vice President George Bush lobbied regulators on his
behalf.
   In yesterday's hearing, Mr. Seidman admitted that in a
separate government sale to Mr. Fail of an Oklahoma bank,
federal regulators "didn't have all the information on him we
should have had."
   Mr. Seidman said the FDIC and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation were jointly reviewing Mr. Fail's purchases in
Texas for possible civil fraud and criminal violations. Mr.
Fail has previously denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Seidman
reiterated that the FDIC is reviewing a large number of
government sales of failed thrifts in the Southwest in 1988
and would consider trying to undo transactions found to have
been tainted by fraud. The regulator conceded that there were
opportunities for speculative and fraudulent profits in the
government's heavily subsidized sales of insolvent S&amp;Ls. "We
live in terror of what is going on out there," he said.

   Usinor Sacilor's Overseas Acquisitions
   Spark Criticism of Unfair Advantages

<LP>
   PARIS -- Usinor Sacilor S.A.'s aggressive foreign
expansion strategy is provoking criticism from abroad that
the steel group's state-owned status has given it an unfair
advantage over private companies.
   The French group has spun itself a web of cross-border
alliances in recent years through a series of takeovers and
partnerships that have made it the world's second-largest
steel producer after Japan's Nippon Steel Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Usinor's latest move came last week when it announced
plans for a friendly takeover of New York-based Edgcomb
Corp., one of the biggest steel-trading concerns in the U.S.,
for an undisclosed amount.
   Edgcomb is the latest in a string of acquisitions by
Usinor in the U.S., where it is now the biggest producer of
stainless steel and has reached a critical mass in long steel
products.
   With a solid U.S. trading and distribution network now
under its belt, analysts say, Usinor is now poised to carve
itself a niche in flat products, the steel industry's
mainstay.
   LTV Corp., another large U.S. steelmaker, disclosed a few
months ago that Usinor Sacilor had indicated it was
interested in discussing the acquisition of a minority
interest in LTV's steel unit, which produced 8.4 million tons
of raw steel and had revenue of $4.1 billion in 1989.
Officials at the French group say the talks remain at a very
preliminary stage, however.
   But Francis Mer, chairman of the steel group, rejects
suggestions that Usinor has delusions of grandeur and says
Usinor isn't expanding for the sake of size alone. "If one
day we become the world's biggest steel producer it won't be
because we set out to do so," he said in an interview.
   Mr. Mer doesn't believe that Usinor will ever catch up
with its Japanese competitor. Although Nippon Steel claims to
have production capacity of 28 million tons, compared with
Usinor's 23 million tons, the figure is nearer to 40 million
tons if all Nippon's affiliated companies are included.
   Usinor Sacilor's biggest foreign takeover to date was its
acquisition last year of a controlling stake in West
Germany's Saarstahl in a move that made the French group the
second-biggest German producer after Thyssen AG.
   Usinor's expansion plans got a boost this week, when the
European Community Commission cleared the way for Usinor and
British Steel PLC of the U.K. to expand further into
specialist markets. Usinor's Sollac unit will be allowed to
purchase two units from their parent company, Anglo-French
packaging specialist CMB S.A.
   "Usinor reflects the imperialistic style that appears to
be in vogue in France at the present time," commented Peter
Dupont, a steel-industry analyst with UBS-Philips &amp; Drew Ltd.
of London, referring to the wave of foreign takeovers by
French state-controlled industrial concerns in recent months.
   Usinor's chief executive says he would prefer to be in a
position to issue common shares rather than nonvoting
securities, as many nationalized companies have done in
recent years.
   Analysts say it's significant that during the difficult
years, Usinor Sacilor was able to maintain its expenditure on
improving productivity when private-owned concerns couldn't.
   "Part of the reason may be that with the state's backing,
Usinor could take out loans on more-favorable terms than its
competitors. This raises the question of whether or not the
playing field was level," comments Mr. Dupont of Philips &amp;
Drew.
   Vincent Mordrel, an analyst with Parisian brokerage DLP
James Capel, points out that unlike steel companies in the
U.S., Usinor didn't have to worry about shareholder reaction
to quarterly earnings reports.
   Usinor Sacilor returned to profitability in 1988 after 12
straight years of losses, but Mr. Mer says it's unlikely that
the 1990 earnings performance will match that of 1989, when
consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests
climbed to 7.592 billion francs ($1.41 billion) from 4.633
billion a year earlier.
   He explained that steel demand was boosted artificially
last year by stockbuilding linked to the inability of
producers to meet rapidly rising demand. Right now there's a
stock depletion trend that has pushed production levels below
those of actual consumption, but this phenomenon is
temporary, and production should start moving in line with
demand next year.
   Mr. Mer says steel demand in Europe is projected to rise
by between 2% and 3% annually in volume terms over the next
four or five years, provided that interest rates don't rise
significantly.

   Nynex Seeks
   FCC Approval
   For Digital Test

   Nynex Corp. has asked the Federal Communications
Commission for an experimental license to test whether new
digital radio technologies could replace wire links between
homes and telephone company locations.
   The test, which is scheduled to start next year, will be
the first time a U.S. phone company has tried to use digital
radio transmission in its "local loop" to deliver
conventional telephone service in metropolitan areas. Nynex
said a wireless system eventually could improve service at a
significant cost savings. Currently, some phone companies
provide radio links to remote farms, ranches and tiny
mountain communities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The regional Bell company said it plans to use radio
transmission between New York Telephone facilities and
residential areas of New York City, Boston and White Plains,
N.Y. Nynex said it will test two different digital radio
technologies known as Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). The digital
technologies increase the capacity of transmissions over
radio frequencies compared with current analog technology.
   The FCC generally approves experimental licenses as long
as the tests don't interfere with existing service. But the
agency makes no guarantee that spectrum allocated for a test
of new technology will be made available on a permanent
basis.
   "This is along the same lines as our investigation of
fiber optics," said Ken Raymond, director at the Nynex
Science and Technology Center. "Given the population density
of an area and the age of the existing telephone plant, we're
trying to determine whether a wireless application might make
sense."
   Mr. Raymond said that later this year the company will ask
equipment suppliers for proposals on building the wireless
system. The company, he said, is trying to find out if
customers would receive better service, or at least the same
service as they currently receive, if the link from their
building or neighborhood to the New York Telephone facility
is made over radio waves. Initially customers should notice
no difference in their phone service, he said. But in 1992,
the company may introduce a portable phone that customers
could use around their neighborhoods, much like a cordless
phone with an extended range of a block or so.
   On Wednesday, Nynex announced that its Mobile
Communications Co. unit plans to roll out the nation's first
wireless personal telephone service in Manhattan. That
service will rely on the emerging CDMA technology.
   CDMA systems can offer up to 20 times the call-handling
capacity of current cellular telephone systems. The CDMA
systems assign an electronic code to each call signal,
allowing more calls to occupy the same space and be spread
over an entire frequency band.
   TDMA, the generally accepted standard for future digital
transmission, places each call signal into a time slot and
transmits it within a single frequency. TDMA offers three to
seven times the capacity of current cellular systems.
   Nynex didn't disclose the amount it expects to spend on
the experiment.

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a $20.8 billion energy
and water bill incorporating major increases in funding for
the cleanup of nuclear weapons plants and providing $318
million toward the Energy Department's massive
superconducting supercollider.
   Defense waste management and environmental funding would
grow by almost two-thirds to $2.68 billion in fiscal 1991,
and an additional $513.7 million is allocated for the cleanup
of civilian facilities. Though more modest, the money for the
ambitious supercollider atom smasher further commits the
government to the ever-costlier project, which is now priced
at $8.6 billion, according to the most recent estimates by
Energy Department officials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Adopted by a simple voice vote, the underlying measure is
the first of the fiscal 1991 appropriations bills to clear
the Senate, and its swift passage testifies to the continued
power of the chamber's Western and Southern interests, which
have a major stake in the science and water projects funded
in the bill. Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd
(D., W.Va.) hastened the debate along from his vantage point
as the presiding officer in the Senate, and Republicans
offered little resistance despite the Bush administration's
reservations about the total spending.
   In the most striking case, only a single Republican, Sen.
William Roth of Delaware, opposed a $1 million amendment
ordering the Interior Department to pay what amounts to a tax
credit on a hydroelectric project in southeast Idaho. Delayed
by environmental reviews, the power project failed to qualify
in time for energy tax credits that expired in late 1988. And
the thrust of the amendment, adopted 76-23, was to make the
project whole by forcing a compensating payment now from the
Treasury.
   Western environmentalists and sportsmen opposed to the
project lobbied against the provision, which critics argue
would most directly benefit Salt Lake City-based Bonneville
Pacific Corp., which would develop the project for a rural
electric cooperative. The administration opposed similar
legislation passed by the House in a separate bill. And Sen.
Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), a member of the Senate Finance
Committee and chairman of the water and power subcommittee of
the Senate Energy Committee, warned that the chamber was
setting an extraordinary tax precedent by using the
appropriations process in this manner.
   Total spending in the bill represents an estimated $580.2
million increase above the administration's request, and at a
time when Senate Appropriations subcommittees are being asked
to cut back, the energy and water measure has enjoyed a
charmed life. Sen. Pete Domenici, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Budget Committee, used his position to help ensure
the allocation would be as generous as the one approved by
the House. Within these limits, the New Mexico senator
protected tens of millions of dollars for the Los Alamos
national laboratory in his home state.
   Among the university projects funded in the bill is $4
million for Fort Hays State University near the home town of
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole. In recent months, the
Kansas Republican has shown a new appetite for steering money
back home. Mr. Dole recalled Mr. Byrd once telling him: "You
never ask for anything around this place." Now the senator is
asking -- and getting. Pittsburg State University in Kansas
would receive $6 million under a Treasury and Postal Service
bill approved this week by Mr. Byrd's panel, and Mr. Dole
secured at least $4.3 million for a Kansas highway project in
a separate transportation bill.

   The Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait:
   Kuwait's Big Foreign Assets
   Likely to Elude Iraq's Grasp

   LONDON -- Saddam Hussein may have grabbed control of
Kuwait's revenue source -- oil -- but not its huge financial
assets.
   Over the past 30 years, tiny Kuwait has poured its oil
wealth into an investment portfolio spread around the world.
Yesterday, the U.S., Britain and France froze Kuwaiti assets
in their respective countries to prevent their seizure by
Iraq. And Switzerland moved in that direction by ordering
Swiss banks to reject any withdrawals of Kuwaiti assets that
seem suspicious.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Much of Kuwait's global portfolio is controlled by the
London-based Kuwait Investment Office, renowned as much for
its secrecy as for its wealth. The investment office has
never disclosed finances, but analysts peg the value of its
assets at about $100 billion.
   They range from major stakes in big German industrial
companies to Malaysian plantations to smaller positions in
U.S. concerns. In an uncharacteristically bold move, the
investment office rocked British political and business
circles in 1987 when it began amassing a stake of almost 22%
in British Petroleum Co., since cut to 9.8%. The Kuwaitis
also have been the most prominent foreign investors in Spain.
   "They've been one of the largest single, identifiable
investors in world markets," says Richard O'Brien, chief
economist at American Express Bank in London. Aside from the
BP foray, he adds, the Kuwaitis generally have been passive,
long-term investors. "They're not just a short-term,
hot-money speculator."
   Kuwait established the investment office in London in the
1950s, with a mission to invest oil profits for the benefit
of future generations when the oil runs out. The office grew
into a heavyweight in the 1970s, as then-booming oil prices
poured billions into its coffers. In recent years, investment
income has contributed more to national revenue than has oil.
   The fund's growth was masterminded from nondescript
offices in the City, London's financial district. Nothing on
the outside of the Kuwait Investment Office's headquarters
building facing St. Paul's Cathedral indicates it is home for
anything other than a tuxedo-rental shop. The entrance to the
lavishly furnished offices above the shop is marked only with
the building's address.
   Yesterday, a heavyset security guard stood in front of the
entrance, turning away visitors. He refused to say whether
anyone was inside. The curtains at every window in the
seven-story structure were drawn.
   The office's most visible investment was the BP stake,
amassed in late 1987 and early 1988. The Kuwaitis snapped up
shares in Britain's biggest company after the U.K.
government's disastrous public offering of its 31.7% BP stake
in late 1987. Although the Kuwaiti office initially insisted
it was a long-term investor in BP, British officials fretted
that the oil-rich Arab country eventually might try to
control the U.K.'s main oil producer.
   The row threatened the two nations' historically close
diplomatic and trading relations. Eventually, the British
government ordered a partial divestiture of the stake, a
decision the Kuwaiti spokesmen greeted with "extreme regret
and astonishment." Shortly afterward, in January 1989, BP
agreed to buy most of the stake back from the Kuwaitis for
#2.41 billion (valued at $4.37 billion at the time). The
Kuwaitis retain 9.8% of BP.
   The BP imbroglio may well account for the Kuwaiti office's
recent management shake-up, its biggest in years. In
February, longtime London-based director Fouad Jaffar -- an
urbane, Western-educated Kuwaiti who had masterminded the
fund's growth -- was succeeded by Sheikh Fahd Mohammed
al-Sabah, a member of the royal family. Under Mr. Jaffar's
leadership, the investment office had become more aggressive,
moving in and out of stocks quickly.
   In the U.S., the Kuwait Investment Office has tended to
hold its investments below disclosure thresholds. But reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicate
that, as of February 1989, the investment office had a 5.8%
stake in Knogo Corp., a Hauppauge, N.Y., maker of security
devices. Santa Fe International Corp., a San Francisco-based
oil and gas concern, is a subsidiary of state-owned Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. Santa Fe officials said operations were
normal yesterday.
   Among other assets in Britain, the Kuwaiti office owns
11.3% of travel and financial-services concern Hogg Robinson
PLC, 10.5% of Midland Bank PLC and 10% of hoteliers Mount
Charlotte Investments PLC. The office also owns St. Martins
Property Corp., builders of London Bridge City -- a huge
riverfront office complex across the Thames from the
capital's financial district.
   Elsewhere in Europe, the Kuwaitis own major stakes in some
of West Germany's biggest companies. They own roughly 20% of
metals concern Metallgesellschaft AG, and just under 20% of
chemicals giant Hoechst AG. They also have about 14% of
Daimler-Benz AG. These German investments have been generally
passive.
   The Kuwait Investment Office has moved more aggressively
in Spain, a hotbed of investment since its 1986 entry into
the European Community. In that year, the Kuwaitis took on
ailing paper concern Torras SA, since then building it into
one of Spain's largest industrial holding companies. The
Kuwaitis own 72% of Torras, with the remaining 28% held by
management and Javier de la Rosa, the company's vice
chairman.
   Torras has direct and indirect interests in some 170
companies in the chemical, food, paper and financial services
sectors. Its chemical concern, Ercros S.A., is Spain's
largest. Torras also owns 24.9% of property concern Prima
S.A.
   The Kuwaitis also have extensive holdings in southeast
Asia. Singapore's G.K. Goh Securities estimates the Kuwait
Investment Office's biggest investment in the Singapore and
Malaysian stock markets is Malaysian plantation, property and
manufacturing conglomerate Sime Darby Bhd. Sime says the
Kuwaiti office's holding is 5.4%.
   Among other assets, analysts say the Kuwaiti office also
holds 49% of Singapore-based brokers J.M. Sassoon; 19% of
Singapore's Cycle &amp; Carriage Ltd., an automobile-industry
concern; and one-third of Singapore's OUB Centre, the city's
tallest office block.
   In Hong Kong, the Kuwaiti office owns about 37% of Dao
Heng Holdings Ltd., holding company for Dao Heng Bank. Dao
Heng Holdings is capitalized at US$312 million on Hong Kong's
stock exchange. Dao Heng Bank is among the six biggest of the
territory's 30 or so local banks. Kuwait also has about US$8
billion invested in Japan, according to the Japan-Kuwait
Friendship Society.
   The Kuwaitis have kept a lower profile in North America.
In Canada, the Kuwait Investment Office has a stake in the
partnership led by Gordon Investment Corp. that plans to buy
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan's $3-billion junk-bond portfolio.

   THE KUWAIT INVESTMENT OFFICE sold its 5.8% stake in Knogo
Corp. in August 1989, according to Knogo officials. In
Friday's edition, it was reported that the Kuwaiti office
owned the stake as of February 1989, according to reports
filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a
passive investor, the Kuwaiti office is only required to file
notification of the sale to the SEC annually.

   W.R. Grace Names Bolduc as President,
   Operating Chief of Chemical Company

   J.P. Bolduc, who has played a major role in restructuring
the varied business lines of W.R. Grace &amp; Co., was named
president and chief operating officer at the diversified
chemical concern.
   Mr. Bolduc, 51 years old, has been one of the three vice
chairmen at Grace whom Chief Executive Officer J. Peter Grace
has been considering as possible successors. Mr. Bolduc thus
appears to have won an edge, though Mr. Grace, 77, gave no
indication that he's preparing to step down.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bolduc, who joined Grace in 1983, succeeds Charles H.
Erhart Jr., who is retiring as president and will remain a
director. Mr. Erhart, 65, was elected president last year,
but he wasn't considered a potential successor to Mr. Grace.
   Mr. Bolduc has been deeply involved in the company's
restructuring efforts and recently has been responsible for
the company's business groups outside its core specialty
chemicals segment. Although the restructuring has already
resulted in asset sales totaling some $2.3 billion since
1986, still more changes are widely expected.
   "We're looking for continued restructuring at Grace. J.P.
Bolduc has been the quarterback in that," said Mark R.
Gulley, a chemical-industry analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   In an interview, Mr. Bolduc said his role in those efforts
will expand. He didn't disclose which of the company's
businesses -- which range from fireproofing materials to
kidney dialysis to artificial insemination of dairy herds --
may be affected. But he said the company is no longer
limiting the possibilities to businesses outside its
specialty chemicals stronghold.
   Mr. Bolduc also emphasized that Grace will consider not
only sales but spinoffs to shareholders, public offerings,
partnerships and joint ventures. The company, in fact, has
already started along that route, having sold 17% of its oil
and coal operations to the public last year.
   He disclosed that Grace last year rejected an offer from
an unidentified bidder for its entire specialty businesses
group, whose interests include cocoa products, book
distribution and textiles, and whose total sales in 1989 were
$1.69 billion. Grace had sales of $6.11 billion last year.
   He explained that Grace had doubts about the offer, partly
because at about the same time Grace was selling a single
industrial-equipment rental business for what it considered a
high price, $305 million, or 25 times the 1988 earnings of
the business. The buyer was Compagnie Francaise de l'Afrique
Occidentale, Paris. That led Grace to think it wouldn't get a
premium for its specialty businesses if it sold them as a
group rather than selling or otherwise restructuring them
separately.
   "It became obvious that while we could have sold the
businesses at a good price and for a good gain, we'd be
better off if we handled it differently," he said.
   How well Grace fares in additional restructuring will
doubtless figure in whether Mr. Bolduc ultimately succeeds
Mr. Grace, who has held the top post at the company since
1945. Mr. Grace himself said the board didn't say anything
about any succession issues while electing Mr. Buldoc as
president. But Mr. Grace, the company's chairman, added,
"It's a good move up."

   But Gold's Run
   May Be Over

   Gold, the historic haven for investors in times of
calamity, is back in the spotlight because of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   But investors who didn't buy in time to catch the
$20-an-ounce price spike the past week or so should probably
wait. Gold's price over the near term is more likely to be
weak than strong, the pros say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Historically, politically inspired moves in gold rarely
last more than a few hours," says Ronald Shorr, mining and
metals analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. "Usually these
political events are pretty good times to sell, not buy
gold."
   Gold prices, which rose to around $420 an ounce a few
months ago, were hammered down below $350 by mid-June on
heavy selling from Saudi Arabia, the Soviet Union, Japan and
Brazil. This week, the metal's price had crawled back to the
$360-$370 level just before Iraqi troops moved into Kuwait.
   News of the invasion sent the price soaring yesterday to
above $386 a ounce, up more than $12 from Wednesday's close.
But gold then spent most of the day giving up its initial
gains. The spot price settled at $376.80, up $3.50.
   Prices are apt to remain jumpy in days ahead. But assuming
the Kuwait conflict doesn't spread, most gold experts expect
prices to weaken as traders take profits and cooler heads
prevail.
   "I really don't expect gold to explode from here -- if
that's what you're looking for, I think you'll be
disappointed," says John Charles Potvin, senior precious
metals analyst at Burns Fry Ltd. In any case, he says,
"you've got to have a much stronger argument to buy gold or
gold shares than just this one little Iraqi spark."
   During the political ups and downs of the past decade,
investors who looked to gold as a hedge against disaster
usually ended up wishing they had stayed in safe,
interest-bearing U.S. Treasury bills. Nowadays, even
individuals who are dubious about the dollar have other ways
to hedge, thanks to the availability of fixed-income mutual
funds that invest in short-term foreign-government
securities.
   "Even though gold has this `safe haven' power to gain
attention for short periods of time, it has not proved itself
competitive or sustainable with alternatives such as the
dollar, deutsche mark or Swiss franc," says Amy Gassman, who
analyzes gold stocks at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
   As a result, she says, "we really emphasize that people
should look at gold as a trading vehicle: There are
opportunities to enter when the market is depressed, and it
makes sense to become a seller as gold becomes ebullient."
   With that in mind, investors who have strong stomachs and
a speculative bent may be able to profit from gold if they
wait for prices to pull back, or if they're willing to bet
that the Mideast conflict is going to spread.
   "If you have a trading orientation, it may be a time to
take a fling in gold," says Michael Sherman, chief investment
strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. However, he adds,
"I'd keep very tight limits on my position -- I wouldn't want
to be exposed even overnight."
   Ms. Gassman says speculators may find gold stocks a better
trading vehicle than bullion, since they typically rack up
greater percentage gains for a given rise in gold's price.
But she adds a few caveats.
   "I'd wait for a 5% pullback in these stocks' prices," she
says, "and since some gold stocks have already had dramatic
run-ups in price recently, I'd look at the laggards." Lastly,
she says, "don't be greedy -- start taking profits once these
stocks move 10%."
   The Iraqi invasion fanned the modestly bullish sentiment
on gold that had been gaining ground on Wall Street in recent
weeks. It's not that price forecasts have altered -- most
analysts are still predicting prices will fluctuate between
$400 and $450 an ounce next year, with a few mavericks more
bearish or more bullish than that. But positive sentiment is
less apologetic than it was a week ago.
   "I think the most important Iraqi impact {on gold} is that
it's helping turn the psychology that tended to be negative
to neutral or slightly positive," says Burns Fry's Mr.
Potvin.
   One of the strongest factors revving bullish sentiment is
the supply-and-demand outlook for the gold market itself.
South African gold producers remain threatened -- not only by
political uncertainty but also by high and rising costs that
make a significant portion of their output uneconomic at
current prices and exchange rates.
   What's more, "the percentage growth in gold-mine
production in the U.S., Canada and Australia has been very
high in the last decade, and in the next few years that will
drop," says Leanne Baker, manager of commodity research of
Philipp Brothers, a unit of Salomon Inc.
   For some analysts, that makes North American gold stocks
look like good investments for the longer term.
   The most bullish view comes from John Tumazos, metals
analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.: "I
think this is the first time in the last 15 years when it's
been possible to buy gold at close to its production cost,
which makes this a unique and fortuitous time in the gold
market." His forecast is for gold to "spike up next year to
$550, with $450 as a long-term average."
   Maybe. But widows and orphans -- and even investors with
normal appetites for risk -- will probably want to sit this
one out, at least for now. Not only is gold itself
notoriously hard to predict, but gold stocks are by no means
cheap. They are already selling at prices that are roughly
twice as high relative to earnings as the market as a whole.
   Beside the risk of a falling stock market, there are
significant fundamentals working against gold that could
undercut gold stock investors in the months ahead. Chief
among them is the fact that interest rates on most major
currencies remain at levels that compete very effectively
with gold.
   For gold to be worthwhile, therefore, investors must
assume that prices will rise enough to make up for that
forgone interest -- as well as to cover storage and other
costs associated with holding gold.
   Meanwhile, despite the impression in some quarters that
the Federal Reserve System is being forced to relax its
vigilance on inflation to prop up banks and the economy,
inflation in the U.S. and other major countries is still
tightly in check. Until there is clear evidence that
situation is changing, gold probably won't go far for long.
While Mideast instability will undoubtedly fan fears about
higher oil prices, buoying gold's fundamentals, most analysts
feel its real consequences for inflation will be modest.
   Based on such fundamentals, Bear Stearns's Mr. Shorr sees
gold plummeting to a new low of about $325 an ounce in late
1990 or early 1991 and fluctuating between $325 and $375 for
most of next year. "Longer term I see some prospects, but I
think it's very tough to make a bullish case in the near
term," he says.

   Market Dives to Lowest Level Since May;
   Growth Stocks Continue Nagging Slump

   Over-the-counter stocks plunged to the lowest level since
early May on news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The OTC market's leaders extended their losses as
investors' ardor for growth stocks continued to cool.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday's session extended the string of OTC market
losses to 12 out of the past 13 trading days. The Nasdaq
Composite Index fell 7.02, or 1.6%, to 428,99.
   OTC losers swamped winners, 1,548 to 641. Volume rose to
146.5 million shares from 129 million shares on Wednesday.
   Trucking, technology and consumer stocks fell farthest.
But investors paid higher prices for energy-related shares
that could benefit from sharply higher oil prices and the
American Depositary Receipts of some South African gold
companies.
   William R. Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons, Baltimore, said the Kuwaiti situation clouded a horizon
already burdened by an apparent deadlock on the federal
budget and a looming possibility of recession. He added: "You
really didn't see massive selling pressure today as much as
you did a slow and inexorable downward drift as buyers
decided to sit on the sidelines."
   Growth stocks continued to slide. Microsoft eased 3/4 to
66, Intel tumbled 2 1/4 to 40 1/4, Sun Microsystems dropped 1
to 30 1/2, Quantum slid 1 1/4 to 20 1/2, Conner Peripherals
eased 3/4 to 26 3/8, AST Research fell 1 3/8 to 19 3/4 and
Nike lost 3/4 to 84 3/4.
   "They clearly threw the towel in on the growth stocks,"
said Jack Laporte, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price
Associates New Horizons Fund. Mr. Laporte suggested that
continued selling in those stocks was partly triggered by
yesterday's "Heard on the Street" column in this newspaper
reporting that some growth stocks have been ebbing steadily
in recent days.
   Robert O'Toole Sr., head of institutional OTC sales
trading at Shearson Lehman, said he saw some bargain hunting
near the close of the market. But he said prices remained
soft enough for him to expect smaller stocks to open lower in
the morning, with a "technical bounce" higher later in
today's session after the sellers exhaust themselves.
   A number of energy and gold stocks benefited from the
developments in the Mideast. Baker Hughes warrants, which
trade over the counter, surged 1 1/8 to 8 3/4; Forest Oil
gained 1 3/4 to 11 3/4; Dekalb Energy jumped 1 1/2 to 27 1/2;
Energy Ventures rose 1 1/4 to 19 3/4 and Tejas Gas climbed 1
1/4 to 29 1/4.
   Among gold shares, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa
added 3/8 to 31 3/8 and Buffelsfontein Gold Mining rose 3/8
to 15 7/8.
   Tele-Communications eased 1/4 to 13 1/8 on 976,800 shares
after the Denver cable operator announced it will invest $5
million in Video Jukebox Network and help expand that
company's interactive music television channel.
Tele-Communications' planned purchase of one million Video
Jukebox shares at $5 apiece will complete the first phase of
a planned $10 million Video Jukebox private placement. Video
Jukebox closed at 7 bid.
   Earnings news and outlooks again propelled some shares.
   Sierra On-Line jumped 2 to 23 after the Oakhurst, Calif.,
maker of interactive entertainment software for personal
computers reported late Wednesday that net income for the
first quarter ended June 30 rose to 18 cents a share, from 17
cents a year earlier.
   Statewide Bancorp tumbled 1 1/4 to 4 3/4 after the Toms
River, N.J.-based company reported a loss for the second
quarter ended June 30 of $9.43 a share, after an $83.4
million loan-loss provision, compared with net income of 49
cents a share a year earlier. However, Douglas Johnson,
president and chief executive officer, said he believes the
bank can return to profitability "immediately."
   Centex Telemanagement lost 7/8 to 25 3/4, although the San
Francisco provider of telecommunications management services
reported net income for the second quarter ended June 30 rose
to 25 cents a share from 17 cents a year earlier.
   Pointing to Centex's profit gain, Morgan Stanley emerging
growth analyst L. Keith Mullins said in an interview that the
stock's decline shows how the market is indiscriminately
pounding shares of smaller companies, regardless of how
strong their earnings may be.
   Cellcom added 3/8 to 2 5/8 after the Fairfield, N.J.,
communications company said it gained an exemption from the
listing requirements of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory body that operates
Nasdaq. Cellcom, which didn't meet NASD's listing
requirements as of March 30, said it will meet those
standards after it closes a previously announced sale of its
franchise to operate a rural service area in Oklahoma. Its
stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq.

   Americans' Love
   Of IBM Typewriters
   Outlasts Company's

   Firm Is Selling the Division
   That Made Its Selectrics;
   But Millions Still Exist

   NEW YORK -- Around International Business Machines Corp.
in the 1960s, typewriter salesmen were known for spending so
much time sweet-talking secretaries that the typewriter
business became known as "the romance division."
   These days, IBMers sometimes call it "the pots and pans
division," and the employees in Lexington, Ky., who make the
machines "the boat people." Typewriters aren't the wave of
the future.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So maybe it was inevitable that IBM would get out of the
typewriter business, and this week, the computer giant
announced its intention to sell it. The buyer is Clayton &amp;
Dubilier, a New York investment firm. For IBM, the sale will
end its already moribund Selectric Era, when its typewriters
were found everywhere in corporate America and even in many
homes and college dormitories.
   From the 1960s on, IBM sold 15 million Selectrics, the
most popular typewriters ever. For much of that period IBM,
with 80% of the total American typewriter market, dominated
it more than it does the computer industry today.
   A generation of typists loved the ease with which they
could change the Selectric's typeface by removing the
"golfball," its round typing element. They loved the way the
golf ball moved across the page, so that the carriage needed
no return, making it unlikely to knock over a cup of coffee
or a stack of paper. The keyboard of the heavy, long-lived
Selectric had a rock-solid feel; even today,
personal-computer makers tout their "Selectric-style
keyboards." And when a fast typist worked the Selectric, he
-- or she -- made music, a muted clatter of wordwork done
well.
   Even today, a lot of people won't give up their
Selectrics. Ron Javers, editor of Philadelphia magazine, says
he still does almost all his work on the Correcting Selectric
that sits next to his personal computer. He says the staff
kids him that he turns on the computer only to get some light
on the Selectric. "I've never lost a story on the
typewriter," he says. "I've lost a few on the computer."
   Gibson Carothers, a Minneapolis gag writer who used a
Selectric to produce such coffee-mug lines as "Life's a
beach" and "Life's a bitch, and then you die," says he's been
using a Selectric for 25 years and isn't about to stop now.
"I love it," he says. Now he's using the machine to write
messages for wastebaskets -- such as "Thank you for your
suggestion."
   The Selectric has made history. When the Soviets managed
to eavesdrop on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in the mid-1980s,
they did it by slipping bugs into hollowed-out parts of the
embassy's Selectrics. Stephen Cannell, a Hollywood producer
known for his devotion to the Selectric, used one to produce
the scripts for such series as "The A-Team" and "Hunter" --
either a point for, or a point against, the Selectric,
depending on your tastes. Tom Clancy used his Selectric to
write "The Hunt for Red October," although he has since
defected to a Macintosh computer.
   IBM's electric typewriter business actually began during
the Depression, when IBM became the first company to
successfully market an electric model. Many companies had
spent decades trying to perfect one. The first IBM was an
ugly black machine with red keys. Other ugly machines
succeeded it. Attachments to hold ribbons made one look as if
it had ears.
   The typewriter business got a bit of pizazz in the 1950s.
Among other things, IBM made a white machine, for the
chairman to present to Pope Pius XII. Not until the Selectric
appeared 29 years ago this week, however, did IBM achieve its
near monopoly.
   IBM made the Selectric in a variety of colors, and
emphasized color in its marketing so much that the company
sometimes seemed to be in the office-decor business. Amy
Wohl, now a consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., says that when
she was a secretary at an ad agency she once ordered emerald
green Selectrics to match the office furniture.
   Shari Dunston, an IBM marketing executive, says someone in
Tennessee once ordered a Selectric in University of Tennessee
orange. The customer sent IBM a pennant to show the exact
color. As the machine went down the IBM assembly line, the
pennant went with it.
   In football, Kentucky and Tennessee are archrivals. And
IBM's Kentucky employees, Ms. Dunston says, were tempted to
ruin the Tennessee orange. Good humor prevailed. When the
Tennessee fan got his Selectric and lifted the top off, he
found the message "Go Big Blue" inside -- Big Blue, in this
case, meaning Kentucky, not IBM.
   In the early 1970s, IBM introduced the Correcting
Selectric. It came with a kind of sticky ribbon to lift
errors from the page. That really clinched IBM's control of
the market. When Exxon Corp. tried to make a splash in the
office equipment market in the late 1970s, Ms. Wohl says,
some Exxon executives bragged to her that they had hired a
well-regarded IBM Selectric salesman. "I just laughed," she
says. IBM had the market so sewn up that, she says, "the IBM
salesman didn't have to sell these things at all. They just
took orders for them."
   IBM held patents that kept anyone else from cloning a
Selectric. Exxon never succeeded in office equipment and gave
up in the mid-1980s after spending $500 million on its
effort. By this time, however, electronic word processing had
begun to spread, and Selectric sales peaked. By the
mid-1980s, typing classes at many high schools had been
replaced by "keyboarding" classes.
   IBM fought back by adding electronic features to the
typewriters -- a spelling checker, memory, a digital display
and others. That helped to keep the typewriter business
profitable even though its growth had stopped.
   Still, IBM lost more than half its share of the typing (or
word-processing) market as new technologies took hold. IBM
tried to double the Selectric's speed to keep up with some
computer printers but never managed it. IBM introduced a
typewriter that displayed a page of type on a tiny screen,
but typists were accustomed to seeing a full-size page. The
machine became, in IBM parlance, a "boat anchor" -- which
nobody can type with.
   The buyer of IBM's typewriter business will be able to use
the IBM name for some years, so the logo will remain on store
shelves for a while yet. It will take longer for the 15
million existing Selectrics to give up the ghost, although
they will be used mainly for typing envelopes. IBM has
already dropped the Selectric name. It did so in 1987, after
the typewriter had evolved beyond much resemblance to the
orginal.
   Larry Bacon, a senior vice president in charge of data
processing at Travelers Corp., says it has been ages since he
has seen a typewriter in daily use at the insurance company.
He does know of one Selectric that's still around, tucked
behind a pillar in a data center. Sometimes, late at night
when things are quiet, over the hum of the millions of
dollars of mainframes, you can still hear someone hunting and
pecking out a note on the old machine.

   Video Jukebox Sells
   Stake for $5 Million
   To Cable Concern

   Video Jukebox Network Inc. said Tele-Communications Inc.
has agreed to invest $5 million in the company for a roughly
10% stake, lending credibility to the fledgling pay-per-view
concern.
   Miami-based Video Jukebox operates a so-called interactive
cable-TV network that lets viewers select music videos they
want to watch by making a telephone call to a 900 number.
Phone companies bill callers $2.50 per request, keep as much
as 70 cents a call for themselves, and pay Video Jukebox the
rest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Video Jukebox, in turn, shares 20% to 25% of its "jukebox"
revenue with cable operators that carry the network.
   Denver-based Tele-Communications is the largest cable
operator in the U.S., controlling about 12 million
subscribers. Its cable system in Miami was the nation's first
system to carry the Video Jukebox Network, which now has
about 9.5 million subscribers. But since the network first
aired in 1985, no other Tele-Communications-owned systems
have added the channel to their offerings.
   Hence, in addition to the equity investment,
Tele-Communications is now in an excellent position to boost
Video Jukebox's growth by distributing the channel to a wider
audience.
   "I love this interactive stuff," said Peter Barton,
Tele-Communications' senior vice president of programming.
"It enhances the audience's relationship with the TV set.
Customers like it. We're very bullish on it."
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Video Jukebox's
shares rose $1.25 to close at $7 bid.
   Though Video Jukebox is the most interactive of cable
networks on the air today, its technology is still a long way
from where media analysts and the company's own executives
say the industry is headed. Its 9.5 million subscribers are
divided among 109 separate "jukeboxes" nationally, meaning
that viewers must wait while the requests of other
subscribers connected to a given system are played before
their own request comes on.
   Eventually, with the spread of fiber-optic networks that
can carry massive amounts of data, Video Jukebox and others
will be able to sell customized TV programs to individual
homes.
   Currently, said Andrew Orgel, Video Jukebox's president
and chief executive officer, the average wait per Jukebox
Video request is about 25 minutes, depending on the market
and time of day.
   "We feel somebody should have to wait no more than 40
minutes to see a video," said Mr. Orgel. The channel, he
said, wants to develop one "jukebox" system for every 30,000
to 40,000 subscribers. The ratio is currently one for every
87,000 viewers.
   Mr. Orgel said the company also wants to sell between
three minutes and six minutes per hour of advertising time,
beginning later this year. And he said Video Jukebox is
planning to test a non-music network, using the same
technology, in the fourth quarter.
   John Reddan, an analyst with John Moran &amp; Associates, said
Video Jukebox's revenue per "jukebox" system has grown 12% in
the past 18 months. He estimates the company now collects
$11,000 per system per month, compared with $9,800 in the
beginning of 1989 -- without having advertised the channel.
   "The future of TV is interactive, but that's really many
years away," said Mr. Reddan. "This is interactive today."
   For the first quarter, Video Jukebox posted a loss of
$322,147, or three cents a share, compared with a loss of
$680,804, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Its revenue
climbed in the quarter to $2.6 million from $376,986.

   Allianz AG agreed to acquire the Fireman's Fund Insurance
Co. unit of Fund American Cos. in a transaction with a net
value of $1.1 billion.
   The acquisition fulfills the Munich-based insurer's
long-held objective of gaining a major position in the U.S.
insurance market. Fireman's Fund, based in Novato, Calif.,
operates in all 50 U.S. states, specializing in
property/casualty insurance. The company is ranked 15th
world-wide in terms of premiums, which last year totaled $3.4
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under terms of the agreement, Allianz will pay Fund
American $3.3 billion -- but will get back $2.2 billion of
the purchase price by spinning off non-insurance assets,
including its common stock portfolio, back to Fund American.
Allianz officials say the $2.2 billion will be plowed into
Fireman's Fund to strengthen the company.
   This unusual structure was devised because Allianz didn't
want to acquire the common stock portfolio, which contains
mostly oil and gas holdings. Allianz puts most of its
investment funds in bonds.
   The news of the sale sent Fund American shares soaring
$11.625 to close at $49.75 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday.
   Until now, Allianz operated in just 20 U.S. states through
six U.S. subsidiaries, including several life insurance
companies. But they represented only a tiny part of Allianz's
world-wide business.
   The Fireman's Fund acquisition "is a recognition that the
insurance market is a global one. Clients are branching out
internationally, so insurance companies and brokers have to
be there as well," said Ira Malis, an insurance industry
analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore.
   Jack Byrne, chairman of both Fund American and Fireman's
Fund, acknowledged that "too many of our clients were going
global and we couldn't follow them."
   In a statement, Allianz said the purchase will give it
"the desired strengthening of its strategic position in the
largest insurance market in the world."
   For Allianz, already Europe's largest insurer, the
acquisition of Fireman's Fund fits neatly into the firm's
global strategy. Since the early 1970s, when company
officials realized they could no longer expand inside their
home market because of West German antitrust restrictions,
the company has moved aggressively into new markets -- buying
or building up local companies in virtually every Western
European nation.
   Last month, Allianz sparked an uproar when it agreed to
purchase 51% of the East German insurance monopoly, Deutsche
Versicherung AG, thus assuring itself the same overwhelming
dominance in a unified German insurance market as it has in
West Germany.
   Allianz, which has 223 subsidiaries world-wide and posted
consolidated group net profit of 1.16 billion marks ($730
million) in 1989, is also pushing into other parts of Eastern
Europe. Earlier this year, the company bought a 49% stake in
Hungaria Bistozito of Hungary.
   Having conquered Europe, it was only a matter of time
before Allianz found a suitable U.S. partner. "What's
surprising is that they took so very long to finally get
their match," said a London-based insurance industry analyst.
   Indeed, this isn't the first time that Allianz has looked
at Fireman's Fund. Company officials acknowledge that they
made an offer to buy the U.S. company as early as 1985, when
it was owned by American Express Co. The Germans balked at
the price tag. American Express eventually spun off the
insurance firm to the public through a stock offering.
   This time, investment bankers at Lehman Brothers, a unit
of the American Express subsidiary Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., brought the two companies together. Serious talks began
in early June. "We didn't start talking about price until
last Thursday. We didn't arrive at a meeting of the minds
until Tuesday," said Fund American's Mr. Byrne, who
negotiated with the Germans. Fund American's board approved
the sale Wednesday.
   In the five years since Allianz first looked at Fireman's
Fund, the U.S. company has retrenched rather than branched
out globally. The company sold its operations in Asia in the
early 1980s. Since Mr. Byrne became chairman in 1985, he has
pumped $1.7 billion into the company's reserves for future
claims from old health-liability and general-liability
business written on its books in the early 1980s. Fireman's
Fund premiums and market share have declined in the past
three years because it refused to match its competitors'
aggressive price-cutting tactics.
   After the sale, Fund American will basically be a
closed-end investment company. It will hold some cash,
interests in a mortgage company and Municipal Bond Assurance
Corp., which insures municipal bond issues, and a stock
portfolio with sizable positions in oil and gas companies.
   After the closing -- probably in January -- Mr. Byrne said
he expects to distribute about $800 million to shareholders,
with the bulk of the remaining assets expected to be
liquidated within three to five years. "We're going to be a
melting ice cube now," he said. Analysts put book value of
the new company at around $60 a share. Fund American's book
value at the end of June was $35 a share.
   Fund American also plans to repurchase all 300,000 shares
of Fund American convertible preferred stock currently owned
by Ifint S.A., a Luxembourg corporation, for $434 million in
cash plus unpaid dividends.
   Some critics say Allianz is overpaying for a company that
will largely be stripped of many supporting assets. "I'm glad
I'm not an Allianz shareholder," says David Anthony, a senior
insurance industry analyst at Fox, Pitt &amp; Kelton in New York.
"The only people that will be happy after this is over are
the shareholders of Fund American."
   But other observers say the price compares well with
Allianz's other acquisitions and is in line with what other
U.S. insurers have sold for in recent years. In addition, the
weak dollar makes the price more attractive when calculated
in marks.
   Allianz shares dropped 35 marks to 2,910 marks on the
Frankfurt stock exchange yesterday. But trading had already
closed before the acquisition was announced.
   American Express, which acquired Fireman's Fund in 1968,
currently owns $342 million in Fireman's Fund preferred
stock, but it owns none of the common stock, having sold its
100% ownership of the company between 1985 and 1989. An
American Express spokesman said the company received about
$2.1 billion of pretax proceeds from the sale of Fireman's
Fund in various transactions. He said American Express
believes it received "comparable value" to the $3.3 billion
figure after considering American Express's ability to
reinvest the proceeds in the past five years.
   Separately, Fund American said second-quarter earnings
rose 62% to $73 million, or $1.41 a share, from $45 million,
or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. The company said much of
the growth was due to an increase in realized investment
gains. Revenue rose 45% to $189.7 million from $131 million.

nine violations of applicable environmental regulations. Five
of these violations were corrected within one week of the
inspection and another one was corrected in July, Rockwell
said. The company said it is working with the EPA to resolve
the remaining issues to insure full compliance with federal
regulations.

   Coast Guard Takes
   A Financial Role
   In Texas Oil Spill

   GALVESTON, Texas -- The U.S. Coast Guard assumed financial
responsibility for cleaning up a 500,000-gallon oil spill
after the company whose barges leaked the crude stopped
footing the bills.
   "The barge company essentially said the money's gone, we
quit," said Chief Warrant Officer Richard M. Meidt, from the
Coast Guard's Pollution Response Division in Washington, D.C.
"If they're not going to clean it up, we will," he said. "Now
the Coast Guard is paying the bills and calling the shots."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a statement, Apex Towing Co., the owner of the barges,
said its insurer, Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association
(Bermuda) Ltd., advised it to relinquish control of the spill
control effort to the Coast Guard "so as not to jeopardize
our insurance coverage." The Coast Guard said it will attempt
to recover costs from Apex, in court if necessary.
   While the Coast Guard routinely picks up the tab for small
"mystery spills of unknown origin," rarely is it forced to
pay for such a large cleanup when the source is known.
Sanford E. Gaines, director of the University of Houston
Environmental Liability Law Program, said, the action "arises
out of a sense of frustration" on the part of the Coast
Guard, which has been roundly critized for its lack of
coordination and slow response. The Coast Guard yesterday
expressed some unhappiness with the speed at which equipment
arrived on the scene.
   Apex Towing, a division of Apex Oil Co., St. Louis, had
assumed sole financial responsibility for the cleanup until
now. Richard Golob, publisher of an industry newsletter, said
Apex probably agreed to shoulder costs initially because the
spill had been underestimated -- at 50,000 gallons -- by the
Coast Guard. Estimates were revised to 500,000 gallons after
divers assessed the leakage Monday.
   "A tenfold increase in amount spilled makes a big
difference" in clean up costs, Mr. Golob said. The company
has spent about $500,000 so far. The Coast Guard had no
estimate of how much more would be spent, but Chief Warrant
Officer Meidt said, "We're not looking at a great big massive
cleanup."
   Two Apex Towing barges collided with a Greek tanker, the
Shinoussa, Saturday, spilling a half million gallons of
partially refined crude oil into the bay. Since then, Apex
has gone to court to have liability for the accident placed
on the tanker owners. Officials for the Greek shipping
concern weren't immediately available to comment. A
spokeswoman for Apex wouldn't elaborate.
   Separately, the Houston Ship Channel was closed again
yesterday to all traffic, while the Coast Guard tried to move
the barge that spilled most of the oil into the bay. The
Texas Department of Health also closed off all fishing and
shrimping in the Bay pending testing for contamination.

   Montgomery Ward,
   Sears Held Talks,
   Didn't Reach Pact

   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.,
mass merchandising rivals for more than a century, said they
held discussions about "certain joint opportunities," but
that the talks had ended.
   The two retailers, run by brothers Edward Brennan at Sears
and Bernard Brennan at Montgomery Ward, added only that they
each affirmed "their intention to remain independent."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But analysts speculated that the two companies may have
been considering a merger and that Montgomery Ward initiated
the talks. Any such combination would have faced big
regulatory hurdles. Sears, with 850 stores and 1989
merchandise group revenue of $31.6 billion, is the nation's
largest retailer. Montgomery Ward, with 336 stores and 1989
revenue of $5.03 billion, is the nation's ninth largest
retailer.
   At the very least, the fact that Sears would enter into
talks underscores the problems it faces as it tries to revive
its core retailing operation. The company has tried several
new strategies in recent years, including last year's
"everyday low pricing" policy, but retail earnings have
hovered far below their 1984 peak. "It's clear that they are
now stymied and looking for alternatives," said Leo Shapiro,
a market researcher in Chicago.
   Investors, meanwhile, are growing increasingly impatient
with the company's slow progress. Sears isn't considered a
takeover target because of its size. But lately some industry
experts have suggested that Sears consider selling its
merchandise group and concentrate on its financial service
operations. They include its Allstate insurance, Dean Witter
brokerage and Coldwell Banker real estate operations.
   The talks with Montgomery Ward "raise the possibility that
the Sears merchandise group is quietly up for sale," said
Margo McGlade, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. "But," she
added, "who besides Ward would want it?"
   Of all of its competitors, Montgomery Ward most closely
mirrors Sears. Both companies once sold only house brands,
but decided recently to add name-brand goods to compete more
effectively with specialty stores and discounters stealing
market share. Both serve middle-income shoppers, often in the
same mall.
   But Ward is further along with the strategy than Sears.
One reason is that Bernard Brennan, who got his start at
Sears but left in 1976 with a boast that the company wasn't
big enough for two Brennans, has cut costs more deeply than
his brother. He closed Ward's unprofitable catalog operation
in 1985 and sold its Jefferson Ward chain of discount stores.
He also started adding brand names in earnest earlier than
Sears.
   The result: Ward's annual profit nearly tripled to $150
million last year from $53 million in 1985, when Mr. Brennan
was recruited as president. Two years ago, he led a
management buy-out of Ward from its former parent, Mobil
Corp.
   Analysts nevertheless were surprised to learn that the two
companies were talking. "This is Ford talking to General
Motors," said Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities. "Who
would have believed it?"
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Sears closed at $32.875, down 37.5 cents.
Montgomery Ward does not trade publicly.

   Chrysler Expects
   U.S. Market Share
   To Be 10% in '91

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. expects its share
of the U.S. car market to increase to about 10% next year
with the help of lower prices on some vehicles, the addition
of two economy-priced models and improved business with fleet
buyers.
   In the first half, Chrysler's share of the car market fell
to 8.9% from 10.6% a year earlier, putting the No. 3 U.S. car
maker in danger of falling behind Honda Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. for the year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler announced preliminary 1991 retail prices that
include Jeep Cherokee prices as much as 5.8% below 1990
prices prior to July. Chrysler raised Cherokee prices $118
this summer. The Cherokee has been one of Chrysler's most
popular and profitable vehicles in recent years, but new
competitive models from other auto makers, notably Ford Motor
Co., have chipped away at Chrysler's lead with the four-door
Jeeps.
   In response, Chrysler dropped the base price of the
mid-level Cherokee Laredo models to as low as $16,166 from
$17,535. It also added an even less costly four-door Sport
model with a base price of $14,863. But the auto maker also
raised the base price of the entry-level Cherokees nearly 4%.
The cheapest 1991-model Cherokee will cost $13,822, compared
with $13,295 before the July price rise.
   Chrysler also dropped 1991 retail prices on its
poor-selling Eagle Premier and Dodge Monaco sedans as much as
5.7% in hopes of sparking consumer interest. The base 1991
Eagle Premier will cost $15,250, compared with $15,350 for
the 1990 models. The base 1991 Monaco will cost $13,895,
compared with $14,995 for the 1990 model. Chrysler must sell
300,000 of the cars by 1992 or pay a penalty to French auto
maker Renault under a parts agreement.
   "We're trying to shift some of the windfall from Renault
to the customers," Bennett E. Bidwell, chairman of the auto
maker's Chrysler Motors unit, said about the Premier and
Monaco prices.
   Another aim of Chrysler's strategy is to reduce the
reliance on rebates and incentives that have become confusing
to consumers, Mr. Bidwell said.
   But not all 1991 Chrysler vehicles will have lower base
prices. Chrysler's redesigned 1991 minivans, for example,
will cost between 5% and 13% more than the base 1990 models
cost before July. The price of the 1991 minivans will range
from $13,195 to $25,905 for the luxury-packaged Chrysler Town
&amp; Country version. The 1990 prices for the minivans ranged
from $11,995 to $23,500 prior to the July price rise.
   Mr. Bidwell, however, called such price comparisons
"unfair," because Chrysler added more than $800 of previously
optional equipment as standard features on the 1991 models.
Adjusting for the new standard features, Mr. Bidwell said
minivan base prices increased 2.6% from similarly equipped
1990 models.
   The new standard equipment includes automatic
transmissions, which Mr. Bidwell said 95% of all minivan
owners selected instead of the base manual transmission on
the 1990 minivans. But the standard engines remain the same.
   Overall, the company argued that when new standard
equipment is factored in, its 1991 base prices rose 0.9% from
similarly equipped 1990 models. That number also reflects an
adjustment that gives more weight to high-volume,
lower-priced cars.
   Mr. Bidwell said Chrysler expects to build market share
several ways. The company will be "more competitive" in
selling cars to fleet customers, such as rental car
companies. Chrysler scaled back its fleet sales this year,
saying it wasn't making enough profit on the business.
   And Chrysler expects to add sales when it gets back into
the entry-level car business with the Dodge Shadow America
and Plymouth Sundance America compact cars. Base prices on
the Shadow and Sundance America models will begin at $7,599.
The company hasn't had a low-priced subcompact since it
stopped making its Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon
subcompacts earlier this year.
   Separately, Chrysler extended discounts on remaining 1989
and 1990 vehicles through Aug. 10.

   At the Ballpark: An Old Fan's Notes

   New York -- The Mets were hot, very hot, so one recent
Thursday evening 43,647 people paid to enter Shea Stadium.
Among them was an old fan who hadn't attended a Major League
baseball game for 15 years.
   No, he hadn't been in jail -- he'd just been living all
that time in London and Jerusalem, where the closest thing to
the real thing is softball, played in Regent's Park and the
Hebrew University's soccer bowl by nostalgic, aging
expatriates like himself.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ex-American paid his $6 and was relieved to see that
the grass at Shea, glowing under the arc lights, still was
genuine. The flag in centerfield for which the crowd rose to
sing the national anthem still was unburned. It still looked
like 90 feet between the bases and the umpires wore blue. The
727s taking off from LaGuardia still shook the guts the way
they always had in the past.
   At first, however, the ex-American was more impressed by
what had changed for the worse than by what had stayed the
same or, even, arguably changed for the better.
   The Cincinatti batters who came to the plate to face
Dwight Gooden, most of whom earn upward of $1 million a year,
looked like Little Leaguers due to their batting helmets.
Gooden's fame and news of his salary had spread world-wide.
So had teammate Darryl Strawberry's. But the other young
heroes and journeymen of the Mets and Reds were strangers to
the ex-American.
   If these were the Mets, where was Tom Seaver? If these
were the Reds, where were Johnny Bench and Pete Rose? Well,
he knew where they were -- in Cooperstown or in disgrace --
but their absence made it a whole new ball game, and, at
first, a less pleasing one.
   The scoreboard also made him cranky. It could and did do
so much more than the scoreboards he remembered. It cued the
cheering. It thundered disco music between innings. It
displayed mug shots of batters on a mammoth screen. It
provided instant replays, and also images in real time of
Gooden expectorating after getting strikeouts, something he
did five times on his way to victory.
   And whoever was presiding over the new, improved
scoreboard warned that anyone using "abusive language,"
drinking in a no-drinking section or otherwise interfering
with the general enjoyment would be arrested.
   What was all this?
   But the ex-American soon got over his first impressions.
All he had to do to get his money's worth was relax and
concentrate on two things: the game and the crowd.
   "C'mon ball, come to us]" It was a seven-year-old pounding
a grown-up glove. He had been brought to the game with his
sister by their parents. Indeed, all the ages, sexes, races
and classes met and mixed and hollered together here, and
once he relaxed this gave the ex-American a cozy, romantic
feeling.
   He could see, out in the parking lot, row upon row of
Hondas and Toyotas in which the middle class had arrived from
the suburbs. He had seen the stretch Cadillacs idled at the
gates for the box seats. He himself, together with the
masses, had come by subway. He noticed Bengalis in the crowd.
And other Asians. There were babes in arms, there were even
WASPs. Looking around him, he could see all these born and
naturalized Americans having a good, non-menacing time.
   For three hours, anyway, the U.S. was an optimistic
democracy again, a winner, something it had ceased being more
than 15 years ago, and baseball was as the ex-American liked
to remember it, the great engine of Americanization and
tolerance. As if to emphasize the obvious, the Mets
management on its triple-threat scoreboard welcomed New York
Bank's foreign exchange traders and Our Lady of the Snow
altar servers and wished happy birthday to Sarah Grossman.
   Maybe it helped that the home team scored first and never
relinquished the lead. There was joy in the bottom of the
second, when Kevin Elster doubled with two on. The game after
that stayed close enough to be interesting, but the Mets had
victory written on them so clearly that their fans could
indulge in all sorts of pleasures besides watching two
collections of highly gifted and very hard-working men,
perhaps even more gifted and better conditioned than in the
past, make a living.
   "Far as I'm concerned," the ex-American overheard one fan
tell his date, "Gorbachev is OK." And then the human wave
business started, very good-humored, very social. It must
have been picked up from TV coverage of World Cup soccer.
"The wave sucks]" shouted someone with a bare chest and a
foaming cup in a no-drinking section.
   He wasn't taken in by the cops, not for his language and
not for his beer. Indeed, though the scene at Shea was
democratic, it was never really rowdy, let alone violent --
the closest thing to an incident came in the fifth, when the
Reds' Eric Davis hammered a homer into the upper deck and
some fan, in a nice touch, threw the ball back onto the
field.
   The ex-American, chewing a high-cholesterol hot dog for
old time's sake, was favorably impressed. After all, at pro
soccer matches in Israel, the fans are separated from the
players, referees and each other by barbed wire, while in
England the riot squad and ambulances are always on hand and
often needed.
   By the sixth, the waves had gone and the air controllers
at LaGuardia were using another runway. It was almost
possible to forget everything, all the years that had passed
and the changes that had come over America, and imagine on
this balmy summer evening that this game was taking place out
of time, floating free of a fairly ugly world.
   Definitely, it was an error for whoever was in charge of
the scoreboard to flash the following headline on it: "DC
jurors see Barry smoke crack on video." But it's possible
that the ex-American was the only one in that happy, gentle
crowd who took notice of such news before the game was over.

   Slap Saddam Hussein Down Now

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the post-Cold War era's first
global crisis, is a turning point in Middle East history and
a true challenge to the Bush administration.
   While the U.S. government cannot be blamed for Iraq's
aggression, America's too-soft, too-slow response to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's earlier threats must have made the
dictator think he could push further. Making this mistake the
first time was costly enough. A passive U.S. policy now will
encourage Iraq to occupy Kuwait permanently or even --
someday soon -- attack Saudi Arabia or Israel. Such a next
step could make direct U.S. involvement inescapable.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One may cite here no less an expert than Iraq's deputy
foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoon: "Aggressors thrive on
appeasement. The world learned that at tremendous cost from
the Munich agreement of 1938. . . . How could the German
generals oppose Hitler once he had proven himself successful?
Indeed, aggressors are usually clever at putting their
demands in a way that seems reasonable." The deputy foreign
minister was of course speaking in a different context. But
the message is clear.
   Fortunately, the U.S. has many options for dealing with
the crisis: threats, U.S.-regional cooperation, new
alliances, U.S.-Soviet collaboration and sanctions. But its
secret weapon is the fact that Mideast states, including
Iraq, tend to overrate American power. With the U.S. as the
world's only superpower, Saddam Hussein (like other Arab
leaders) expects Washington to do what he would in that
position: be aggressive and imperialistic. He should have
reason to fear American strength. It would be most dangerous
if, like the Iranians during the 1979-1981 hostage crisis, he
were to conclude that the U.S. is a paper tiger. Thus, the
first thing needed is tough talk.
   Next, the U.S. must reassess its regional alliances.
Egypt, Iraq's only probable rival for Arab leadership, must
know that it can rely on U.S. support in building an
anti-Saddam coalition. The recent tensions marking
U.S.-Israel relations must be discarded in the face of this
crisis. Last week the Bush administration was in the
ridiculous position of threatening to withhold $400 million
in housing credits to Israel while refusing to cut off $400
million in agricultural credits to Iraq. Any slackness in
U.S.-Israeli bilateral relations may give Iraq the impression
that it can get away with attacking Israel.
   The Kuwait crisis also affects the Arab-Israeli peace
process. Israel will be less inclined than ever to yield
territory in such an unstable situation. The Palestine
Liberation Organization has moved away from Egypt and toward
Iraq, and Yasser Arafat's migration from an alignment with
America's best Arab friend to its worst Arab enemy ought to
discourage the U.S. from reopening the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
   One of the main questions is how the Gulf Arabs,
particularly Saudi Arabia, will react. Iraq has broken all
the rules of Middle East politics. Will the Gulf Arabs
continue their pattern of appeasing Saddam Hussein in public
and requesting U.S. protection in private, or will they ask
openly for U.S. assistance -- as they did during the
Iran-Iraq war? If the latter is the case, the U.S. will have
to decide how far it will go in sending them aid and military
forces.
   Another critical issue will be the U.S. attitude toward
Iraq's enemy neighbors, Iran and Syria. Both countries have
been radical and anti-American, supporting terrorism and
opposing U.S. policy. Faced with Iraq's aggression and their
own weaknesses (Syria has been crippled by losing its Soviet
ally), they may well want to improve relations with
Washington. Damascus has already begun to move in this
direction. There are many barriers, however, to ending these
enmities. Most of all, the Bush administration must remember
that the U.S. would be doing Syria and Iran a favor by
improving relations -- not the other way around. Syria and
Iran must change their behavior and help release American
hostages if they want U.S. help.
   Iraq's action also creates a prime opportunity for
U.S.-Soviet collaboration. Indeed, Secretary of State James
Baker plans to fly to Moscow to issue a joint statement
Friday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze about
the invasion. The Soviet Union (along with France) has been
Iraq's prime weapons supplier and (next to Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait) is among its largest creditors. Bilateral teamwork
can organize the international community for sanctions and
diplomatic pressure against Iraq.
   Sanctions, it is often said, never work. Yet their prime
importance here is not merely to inflict economic and
military costs on Baghdad but to send a signal to Saddam
Hussein. The freezing of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets in the U.S.
is a welcome first step. The absence of sanctions -- as
happened after Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Kurdish
civilians -- will prove aggression successful. Is the world
so craven that it will continue buying Kuwaiti oil pumped by
Iraqi occupiers?
   Given the large strategic oil reserves possessed by the
U.S. and other countries, the world can sustain an extended
embargo against Iraqi and Iraqi-exported Kuwaiti oil. It will
require cooperation from the two countries traversed by
Iraq's pipelines -- Saudi Arabia and Turkey -- for this
embargo to work, and they may refuse. The Saudis fear Iraqi
reprisal; the Turks are major trading partners of Iraq. But
the effort is worth making. Even if only partially effective,
this campaign would give Iraq another incentive to withdraw.
   Saddam Hussein likes the additional money from Kuwaiti oil
exports, but the invasion was not prompted by economic needs
alone. Iraq wants billions for reconstruction, yet it could
have obtained a big cash infusion merely by threatening
Kuwait. The principal factor here is Saddam Hussein's
determination to prove that Iraq is the most powerful state
in the Persian Gulf and the Arab world. For eight years Iraq
fought Iran, suffering hundreds of thousands of casualties to
determine who would dominate the oil-rich Persian Gulf. Iraq
won. It is now claiming the prize.
   Kuwait and Saudi Arabia gave Iraq an estimated $50 billion
to fight the war with Iran. But that was last year, and
Saddam Hussein is not known for being grateful. Similarly,
the U.S. helped him against Iran. But the day before the
invasion of Kuwait, Iraq demanded that U.S. naval forces be
withdrawn from the Persian Gulf.
   The methodology fits Saddam Hussein's self-image. He is
the type of ruler who deliberately spreads stories about his
toughness in order to frighten neighboring states. For
example, he likes people to think he personally executed foes
with his bare hands. He has invited foreign military attaches
to the border so they could observe the buildup of his army.
   The invasion of Kuwait is only the latest in a series of
steps the Iraqi leader has taken to make Iraq the most
powerful Arab nation in the Mideast. First, he ran a crash
program to obtain nuclear and chemical weapons. Second, he
threatened to destroy "half of Israel" if it attacked any
Arab state. Next, he nominated himself leader of an
anti-American alliance. Publicly, other Arab leaders cheered;
privately, they trembled.
   Now, however, Saddam Hussein has smashed the taboos of
pan-Arabism that governed the Arab world for four decades. He
is acting openly as an Iraqi nationalist, and he is
indifferent to whether he has any allies. This may prove a
costly mistake.
   After cooperating with Iraq to defend Gulf Arab states
from Iranian aggression in the 1980s, the U.S. must now help
to defend Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others in the 1990s from
Iraq. Otherwise the Iraqi leader may be able to dictate oil
production volumes and therefore prices, start wars and drive
U.S. interests out of the Gulf.
   The good news is that the world has been given another
chance. It is a new 1945, the end of a long global conflict
when victors and losers are ready to work together in peace.
This time, however, there is no Cold War to drag on the
suffering. If the U.S. takes leadership and organizes
international cooperation against Saddam Hussein, the new era
can be among the best in history. If the U.S. fails in this
task, historians will record Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as the
first in a series of international depredations and crises
that shook the 1990s.

   MIAMI -- A federal judge ruled that Eastern Airlines
couldn't give preferential treatment to pilot trainees over
returning strikers in filling permanent cockpit jobs.
   The narrow ruling, by U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis
of Miami, affects only about 180 replacement pilots who
hadn't yet flown paying passengers, not all 800 or so hired
to fly Eastern through an eight-month-long strike.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for the Air Line Pilots Association, James
Linsey, said damages and back pay for the displaced union
pilots could total $100 million. Eastern, however, said it
would appeal, and didn't anticipate any immediate effect on
the airline or its pilots.
   At issue was the method Eastern used to fill its cockpits
after the pilots union struck Eastern in sympathy with
machinists in March 1989. Some striking pilots asked to
return to work last August, after Eastern had filled many
positions. Eastern then began keeping two lists, filling job
openings from its roster of newly hired pilots over those
pilots who crossed the picket line. After the strike ended,
Eastern continued to fill openings from its list of
replacement pilots, including those who were in its training
program at the time.
   Eastern had filed suit last August against the pilots
union to have the company's hiring of replacement workers
declared legal. But Judge Davis ruled that replacement pilots
flying regular, revenue-generating flights before the union
pilots offered to return can be accorded permanent status;
that status can't be extended to the trainees, he said.

   Great Country Bank said it had a $2.3 million loss in its
fourth quarter, ended May 31, after increasing its loan-loss
reserves.
   The Ansonia, Conn., savings bank said it added $3.3
million to reserves, boosting fiscal year provisions for loan
losses to $15.1 million. For the year, the bank reported a
loss of $9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Great Country said the added reserves reflect its
expectations of problem loans related to a weakened
Connecticut real estate market. Property values have been
dropping, leaving many banks with difficult-to-sell real
estate after foreclosing on delinquent mortgages.
   In the 1989 fiscal fourth quarter, Great Country had net
income of $677,000, or 31 cents a share. For all of fiscal
1989, it had net of $3.2 million, or $1.45 a share.

   Simmons's Baroid Corp.

   HOUSTON -- Harold Simmons' holdings, like an amoeba, keep
multiplying by dividing.
   One of the companies controlled by the Dallas financier,
Baroid Corp., has said that it is considering a plan to
separate into two publicly traded companies through a
tax-free spinoff. Baroid itself was created in December 1988,
when it was spun off from NL Industries, also controlled by
Mr. Simmons through his Valhi Inc. holding company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Baroid said that under the plan, which would be considered
during a board meeting scheduled the week of Aug. 20, one
company would consist of its existing petroleum services
business while the other would comprise the company's
Titanium Metals Corp. of America, its titanium metals
business and certain mining operations.
   In March, Baroid acquired the 30% of Titanium Metals that
it didn't already own from Allegheny International Inc. for
$50 million.
   Robert J. Leidich, Baroid's vice president and general
counsel, said the company is considering the spinoff because
the two businesses are different. The company hopes that,
separately, the two would be more highly valued by the
market.
   Valhi currently holds 43% of Baroid and about 63% of NL.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Valhi
closed yesterday at $12, down 25 cents.

   Lau Brothers'

   Of $1.1 Billion

   But Market in Hong Kong
   Is Skeptical of Chances
   Of Taiwan Businessman

   HONG KONG -- A Taiwan businessman is stalking two of Hong
Kong's best-known corporate raiders, but the stock market is
skeptical that his HK$8.63 billion (US$1.1 billion) takeover
bid will succeed.
   The bidder, Hwang Chou Shiuan, chairman of Ming Ren
Investment &amp; Enterprises Ltd. and owner of a sprawling luxury
residential complex called Hongkong Parkview, is facing an
uphill battle in his offer for two companies controlled by
Thomas and Joseph Lau. The brothers hold 48% of one of the
targets, Evergo International Holdings Co., which is an
investment-holding group. Evergo, in turn, controls 50% of
the other target, the property concern Chinese Estates
Holdings Ltd.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some observers would be happy to see the Laus lose control
of their holdings, which include two separately listed units
of Chinese Estates that aren't included in the offer. The
brothers have rankled many market participants with their
takeover attempts and have frequently been criticized for
taking advantage of minority shareholders by giving
themselves hefty directors' fees and rejuggling their
holdings for their own benefit.
   "I think there are a lot of people who'd be happy to see
the Laus leave the corporate scene," said Philip Niem,
research chief at Hoare Govett Asia Ltd. "But the markets are
saying it doesn't really expect this to happen."
   Although Mr. Hwang's offer -- which had been awaited for
about three weeks and was made public late Tuesday -- was
viewed as valuing the two companies fairly, the companies'
share prices showed little immediate reaction. Evergo closed
yesterday at HK$3.775, down 10 Hong Kong cents and below Mr.
Hwang's offer of HK$4.80 a share, or a total of HK$3.03
billion. Chinese Estates closed at HK$2.275, down 12.5 cents
on the day and below Mr. Hwang's offer of HK$3.35 a share, or
HK$5.6 billion. Each offer is 26% below the net asset value
of the targeted company.
   Some traders said Mr. Hwang's bid was regarded as possibly
ushering in a new round of takeover activity. But several
analysts expressed surprise that the bid was launched at all.
When Mr. Hwang first publicly aired his interest in the
companies three weeks ago, some believed the talk was just a
ruse to boost the share prices, allowing Mr. Hwang and the
Laus to make a quick profit. However, many are now convinced
of the bid's sincerity, noting that the financing
arrangements, made through Wardley Corporate Finance Ltd.,
already have involved hefty costs.
   Mr. Hwang's statement accompanying the offer said he was
interested in the companies because he could produce improved
results by better using assets and reducing administrative
costs. He said he would retain the companies' public
listings.
   Neither the Laus nor Mr. Hwang was available for comment.
Evergo and Chinese Estates said holders should exercise
extreme caution regarding the bid and should take no action
until they have considered the advice of directors and
Peregrine Capital Ltd., which has been appointed as
independent financial adviser.
   Adrian Ngan, a property analyst at Citicorp Scrimgeour
Vickers Hong Kong Ltd., said Mr. Hwang is offering fair
prices for the companies, which own a number of large,
high-quality office buildings in the British colony. The
Chinese Estates offer is more than 25% above the HK$2.65
initially offered late last year by the Laus themselves when
Evergo sought to privatize the unit. That bid, later raised
to HK$2.80, drew little interest and was scrapped.
   "The {Hwang} offer is still below the net asset value, but
for minority shareholders it's attractive enough," Mr. Ngan
said, adding that some holders might be grateful for the
opportunity to bail out of the Lau vehicles. Much grumbling
has stemmed from a decision by Evergo's directors, which
include four members of the Lau family, to award themselves
HK$46 million in fees last year, equivalent to about half the
group's profits.
   Analysts weren't overly impressed by Mr. Hwang's
statement, in which he indicated that parties associated with
him own 5% of Evergo and that Chinese Estate's largest
minority shareholder, Asia Securities International Ltd., has
agreed to sell him its 8% stake. These represent only a
fraction of the Laus' holdings, analysts said, adding that
Mr. Hwang's only hope for winning control of the companies
rests in buying up their warrants outstanding. The Laus own
relatively few warrants.
   Mr. Ngan estimated that the family's total control of
Evergo, when diluted to account for the warrants, amounts to
only 32%, according to the latest figures provided by the
company in December. "The big question now is whether the
Laus have bought more than half the outstanding warrants
during this year," he said. "If they have, the deal will turn
sour" for Mr. Hwang.
   While there have been rumors that the Laus have secured a
credit line with which to make a counteroffer for their
companies, several observers said they doubted that a battle
would arise.
   Vincent Kwan, assistant research director at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Securities (HK) Ltd., said it would probably be
easier for the Laus to buy up warrants in the market if a
defensive tack is necessary.
   "If the Laus decide they don't want to lose control of
their companies, this could be over quite soon," he said.

   The Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait:
   U.S. Emergency Stockpile of Oil
   Might Be Increased Significantly

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. emergency oil stockpile already is
big enough to counter any temporary supply disruption from
the Mideast conflict, and Iraq's invasion increases the
chances that it will get significantly bigger.
   The "strategic petroleum reserve," placed in salt domes in
Texas and Louisiana, now contains almost 590 million barrels
of crude that the government began stockpiling in response to
the Arab oil embargo of 1973-1974. That's enough to offset
all imports for 75 days at current import levels. Plans call
for the reserve to reach 750 million barrels by the
mid-1990s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate conferees have been debating a proposal
to increase the flow of oil into the reserve to bring it to
one billion barrels, and the Mideast war gives the provision
a boost. Until now, the Bush administration had opposed the
higher level partly on the grounds that the likelihood of a
supply disruption was minimal. At a news conference late
yesterday afternoon, Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore
said the government "has seen nothing to cause us to rethink
that decision." But many people on Capitol Hill expect the
higher level to be approved.
   Mr. Moore told reporters that he expects neither the
invasion nor the U.S. embargo of Iraqi oil to result in a
"long-term, significant increase" in oil prices or a
disruption in supplies to the U.S. Thus, he said, the Bush
administration has no plans to tap the reserve. He cited the
current oversupply of oil on world markets and high levels of
domestic commercial stocks of crude oil and refined products.
   The invasion of Kuwait sparked a debate on whether to use
the reserve to ease the supply disruption that would ensue if
the U.S. and several of its allies tried to impose a world
quarantine on Iraqi oil. Philip K. Verleger, a visiting
fellow at the Institute for International Economics, called
for using the reserve oil to help ease the impact of sharply
higher prices that would occur if such an embargo worked.
With an effective embargo, he predicted, prices could reach
$45 a barrel.
   But Mr. Moore said no thought has been given to using the
oil in that way. The reserve "isn't designed as a pricing
mechanism," he said.
   Currently all the oil in the reserve is owned by the U.S.
But under pending legislation required to authorize the
continued build-up of the strategic reserve, the U.S. would
be allowed to begin leasing some of the crude as a way to
reduce the cost of filling the reserve. Under this plan, an
oil supplier would lease the oil to the U.S. for a fee that
proponents say could be as low as 50 cents to $1 a barrel.
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have expressed interest in such an
arrangement, according to congressional aides.
   Under the leasing plan, the U.S. in case of an emergency
would take possession of the oil and be free to use it. When
and if any was sold, the supplying nation would get the
proceeds.
   The president can decide to draw down oil from the reserve
after determining there is a serious disruption to the flow
of imported oil or the potential for such an interruption.
The Bush administration also would determine the rate at
which the oil could be used, based on an estimate of how long
the disruption is likely to last.
   The 75-day supply of imported oil that the reserve could
offset compares with more than 100 days in the early 1980s.
The number of days has declined even as the reserve has grown
because U.S. consumption of foreign oil has shot up in recent
years.

   Delta Air Lines reached an agreement on a new contract
with its pilots that will make them the most highly paid in
the airline industry, a union official said.
   The agreement, which still must be ratified by Delta union
leaders, shortens to three years the length of time new
pilots are paid at lower wages than higher-seniority pilots.
That hotly contested issue had been the main sticking point
in contract talks, which had dragged on for 19 months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed contract also calls for wage increases of
12.5% over its three years, with newer pilots receiving on
average a 40% increase over the life of the contract.
   A spokesman for the airline said Delta was pleased to
reach an agreement, but declined further comment.
   Officials of the pilots union said they were satisfied
with the new terms. "We have the best contract in the
industry," said a union spokesman. The union hailed the
contract as a significant step toward eliminating the lower
"B-scale." Previously, pilots had to work at the lower wage
rate for five years before jumping to the higher wages in
effect for pilots with more seniority.

   WASHINGTON -- Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of
the House Banking Committee, isn't tired of savings and loan
associations yet.
   The maverick Texan populist said he will hold hearings in
September to shed light on the role of government officials
in the late 1970s and early 1980s on the deregulation of
thrifts. Those called to testify include: former Treasury
Secretaries Donald Regan and G. William Miller, and former
top thrift regulators, including Richard Pratt, Edwin Gray
and Danny Wall.
</LP>

   The hearings, which begin Sept. 12, occur as Congress, the
Bush administration and both political parties frantically
look for something or someone to blame for the mess, which
will cost more than $130 billion, without including hundreds
of billions of dollars more in interest and other costs.
Fraud has received the most blame, and Congress is winding up
the current session with legislation to punish future S&amp;L
looters more harshly.
   Less has been said about the culpability of
decision-makers, who deregulated thrifts while slashing
budgets of examiners who were to police the newly freed
institutions.
   "Today there is mass confusion and mounds of
misinformation about what did and did not contribute to the
savings and loan problem," Rep. Gonzalez said. "We have an
obligation to establish a clear record."

   Industrials Drop 34.66 in Response

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices dropped sharply amid the heaviest
trading since last October's "minicrash" as the market
responded to news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Market players flocked to buy a broad range of energy
stocks as oil prices surged following the invasion, while
precious-metals and defense issues also attracted buying
interest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the Dow Jones Industrial Average went down 34.66
points to 2864.60 despite a strong showing by its oil
components, and the recent slump in consumer and other growth
stocks accelerated.
   Three oil issues -- Exxon, Chevron and Texaco -- lifted
the industrial average by a total of more than 11 points. USX
and Du Pont, which also have substantial oil operations,
recorded modest gains as well.
   Brisk activity in those and other oil stocks boosted
volume on the New York Stock Exchange to 253,090,000 shares
from 176,810,000 Wednesday. The latest total was the highest
since 416.3 million shares were traded last Oct. 13, when the
industrial average plummeted more than 190 points.
   This time around, the U.S. followed the lead of overseas
stock markets, which dropped sharply in response to reports
of the invasion. For example, the Nikkei index of 225
Japanese issues dropped 1.9% and the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-Share Index, a measure of prices on the London
stock market, fell 1.5%.
   On Wall Street, the developments in the Middle East
further unsettled a market that has been unnerved recently by
disappointments in second-quarter corporate earnings reports
and indications that the latest union-led buy-out offer for
UAL might fail to get financing.
   "We were in a nervous market before," said Thomas
Callahan, senior vice president of U.S. equities at Yamaichi
International (America), "and now we've had something that
obviously caught a lot of people by surprise."
   In the sell-off that followed, declining stocks outpaced
advancers on the Big Board by 1,211 to 464. Standard &amp; Poor's
500-Stock Index tumbled 4.04 to 351.48, the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index dropped 2.02 to 192.36 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index fell 3.86 to 325.63.
   Prices fell sharply from the opening bell and then tumbled
to their session lows at late morning amid bursts of
futures-related program selling related to stock-index
arbitrage. The industrial average hit bottom just about the
2850 mark with a loss of more than 47 points.
   Chevron, which went up 1 5/8 to 80 3/8 on Big Board
composite volume of 12 million shares, and Texaco, which
climbed 2 5/8 to 66 5/8 on 6.2 million shares, were one-two
on the Big Board's list of most active issues.
Dividend-related trading by institutions boosted the activity
in both stocks.
   Exxon rose 1 1/8 to 53 1/4 as four million shares were
traded. USX, the parent company of Marathon Oil, added 1/2 to
34 5/8 on 3.2 million shares; Du Pont, the parent of Conoco,
rose 3/8 to 41 3/8 on 1.2 million.
   Composite volume in five other oil issues exceeded two
million shares each: Mobil, which advanced 1 7/8 to 67 1/4;
Unocal, which climbed 2 1/8 to 33 1/4, Phillips Petroleum,
which rose 7/8 to 29 5/8; Occidental Petroleum, which rose
3/8 to 26 1/4, and Amoco, which added 2 7/8 to 58 1/4.
   Global Marine added 1/8 to 5 1/4 on 3.4 million shares.
Elsewhere in the oil-services sector, Schlumberger tacked on
2 1/4 to 68 3/4, Halliburton went up 1 3/4 to 57 3/8 and
Baker Hughes rose 1 3/8 to 33 3/8.
   Trading in precious-metals and defense stocks wasn't
nearly as brisk, although the Iraqi action served as a
catalyst for solid performances from both groups.
   Among gold stocks, a traditional hedge against inflation,
Battle Mountain Gold added 1/4 to 12 1/8, Newmont Mining
climbed 1 1/4 to 50 7/8, Hecla Mining rose 1/4 to 12 1/8 and
ASA Ltd. gained 3/4 to 49 1/2. In the defense sector, which
has been under pressure recently in anticipation of cutbacks
in U.S. military spending, Raytheon gained 2 3/4 to 60 3/4,
General Dynamics gained 1 1/2 to 28 1/4, Martin Marietta rose
5/8 to 38 5/8 and McDonnell Douglas climbed 1 to 44.
   Oil-refining stocks were an exception to the energy
sector's rally. Sun Co. lost 1 3/8 to 35 1/2, Mapco fell 1
3/8 to 43 and Ashland Oil went down 1 5/8 to 32 1/4; Dean
Witter Reynolds analyst Eugene Nowak recommended that
investors avoid the issues, as higher oil prices raise
refining costs.
   Although the market avoided a steep drop, further weakness
can be expected based on the increase in oil prices, said
Suresh L. Bhirud, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer
&amp; Co.
   "The risk here is that the price of oil can go up much
higher than people are willing to believe," Mr. Bhirud said,
putting further pressure on a world economy that already is
showing the strain of sluggish growth and rising inflation.
   For stocks, the results of such a move in oil could be
what he labeled as "a prolonged, painful Chinese torture" in
which share prices go down gradually rather than plunging and
then rebounding immediately, as was the case in the
"minicrash" last October.
   "The key thing is that you've taken a lot of bullish
arguments out of the game," Mr. Bhirud said, including the
possibility that interest rates will head lower and that
inflationary pressure won't become excessive.
   But Edward M. Kerschner, chairman of the investment policy
committee at PaineWebber, said the "war dance" in response to
the Iraq-Kuwait hostilities hasn't changed his opinion that
the Dow industrials will remain within 10% on either side of
2900 in the next few months.
   The Dow Jones index of casino stocks plunged 7.3%, more
sharply than any other industry group. Circus Circus
Enterprises set the pace for the downturn by plunging 6 3/4
to 54 1/2 in active trading; the stock had surged to a
52-week high of 70 7/8 in mid-July.
   Consumer stocks were generally hit hard in the sell-off as
the sharp increase in oil prices heightened concerns about
the economic outlook. Eli Lilly went down 2 to 82 5/8 on 2.6
million shares, while Philip Morris retreated 1 1/4 to 46
5/8, Coca-Cola Co. dropped 1 1/4 to 44 1/8, PepsiCo slid 1
1/8 to 76,  Procter &amp; Gamble tumbled 3 1/4 to 82 1/4, Merck
dropped 2 5/8 to 87 1/4, Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 2 3/4 to
62 1/4 and Colgate-Palmolive lost 2 3/8 to 68 3/8.
   Shares of the Big Three auto makers slumped in brisk
trading. General Motors fell 1 1/2 to 43 7/8, Ford Motor went
down 1 1/4 to 39 7/8 and Chrysler lost 5/8 to 14 3/8.
   Fund American soared 11 5/8 to 49 3/4 on 2.7 million
shares after agreeing to sell its main subsidiary, Fireman's
Fund Insurance, to West Germany's Allianz. The company said
it plans to spend more than $800 million on a self-tender
offer or distribution after completing the sale and to
liquidate the rest of its assets over a three- to five-year
period.
   But other insurance stocks generally fell along with the
market. American International Group lost 3 to 71 and Capital
Holding dropped 1 to 46 3/4 after their second-quarter
earnings reports, while General Re fell 3 to 82 7/8, American
General slid 1 to 45 and Unum dropped 7/8 to 53 3/4.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
1.15 to 352.15 despite gains in oil and gold issues, both
heavily weighted in the index. Volume totaled 20,300,000
shares.

   WASHINGTON -- Iraqi troops invading Kuwait picked up a
small group of American oil workers and moved them to an
unknown location, U.S. officials said.
   It wasn't clear whether the Iraqi troops intended to
capture the workers, who were near the Iraq-Kuwait border, or
merely were moving them out of the way of the invasion,
officials said. But American diplomats in Iraq were being
ordered by the State Department to ask the Iraqi foreign
ministry to locate the workers, and to tell Iraq's leaders
that they would be considered responsible for the workers'
fate.

if Americans were "threatened or harmed."

   Lauder Hopes
   To Make Up
   To the Young

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Next week, Estee Lauder Cos., long known for
the regal, if somewhat stuffy, image of its flagship brand,
will start trying to win over a new generation of cosmetics
buyers: younger, hipper and greener.
   With the introduction next week of Origins, an earthy
botanical line, Lauder is trying to grapple with the problems
of its maturing core lines, including Estee Lauder and
Aramis, and increased competition from upstarts such as Body
Shop International PLC of the U.K. Origins will make its
debut at a Nordstrom Inc.'s department store in Seattle. But
Lauder plans to sell the new line through its own retail
stores eventually, a radical departure from company
tradition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We consider ourselves explorers," says Leonard Lauder,
chief executive of the company. "This line is a good gamble
for us."
   Although Estee Lauder, which also markets the Clinique and
Prescriptives lines, continues to rule department store
cosmetics counters with an estimated 38.5% share, that domain
is increasingly troubled. A spate of retail mergers, combined
with the bankruptcy-protection filings earlier this year of
Campeau Corp.'s U.S. department store units, have cast a long
shadow over the retail industry.
   To sidestep those difficulties, Lauder has taken action.
The company rejuvenated the image of the company's flagship
line by repackaging the products, boosting prices by as much
as 50% and hiring Robin Burns, former president of Calvin
Klein cosmetics, to run the division. While at Calvin Klein,
Ms. Burns worked with Mr. Klein to develop the company's
torrid -- and highly successful -- perfume advertising.
   With Origins, Lauder is bent on attracting consumers who
may shop more in boutiques than in department stores. The new
products, which range in price from $8.50 to about $25, are
funkier than the company's traditional fare. The line is made
mostly from natural ingredients, which are neither derived
from nor tested on animals. It also includes so-called
aroma-therapy products, which promise their fragrance will
boost energy or ease tension when they are poured into a
bath. The company will even sell a small dose of potion
called "Peace of Mind" for only $10.
   It may sound a bit kooky, but the marketing clout of the
closely held Lauder, where revenue is believed to top $2
billion, gives the initiative credibility. "It's the first
real effort on the part of the industry to develop a new
customer base, young people who are put off by the glitzy
image of the business," says Allan Mottus, a consultant to
the cosmetics industry. "But if they really want to reach
younger consumers, they'll have to look outside department
stores."
   Lauder plans to do just that. Origins was initially
designed to be sold exclusively through free-standing,
company-owned stores, according to Leonard Lauder. But the
plan was scrapped because it would have taken as long as
three years to open just 30 locations, plenty of time for a
competitor to slip a similar line into department stores.
   People familiar with the project say Lauder is still
proceeding with the plan, albeit more cautiously. "With one
of the largest retail chains in the country in bankruptcy,"
says William Lauder, Leonard Lauder's son, who is running the
company's Origins unit, "we're keeping our options open." For
now, Lauder is keeping mum on the details. Insiders say the
company plans to open its own stores slowly, starting on the
East Coast.
   Although many clothing manufacturers, including Ralph
Lauren, Liz Claiborne Inc., and Anne Klein &amp; Co., have opened
their own stores, few cosmetics companies have followed their
lead. Elizabeth Arden, owned by the Anglo-Dutch
consumer-products marketer Unilever Group, operates 11 beauty
salons, but says it has no plans to expand its retailing
operations. "We view cosmetics as part of a fashion
portfolio," says James Miner, vice president of marketing for
Elizabeth Arden. "It's part of a total look, and the place
you get the rest of the look is a department store."
   But many in the cosmetics industry are reconsidering that
focus. "I can almost guarantee that any major manufacturer
that has depended primarily on upscale department stores is
looking for alternative methods of distribution," says Ken
Galloway, president of Retail Planning Associates' specialty
retailing unit.
   The transition to retailing won't be easy for Estee
Lauder. In addition to running the risk of irritating its
existing retailers, the company has no experience outside the
glitzy world of department-store cosmetics counters. Intent
on protecting its tony image, the company eschews selling
through drugstores. And people familiar with the project say
the company has had difficulties developing a team to manage
a retail unit and designing the individual stores.
   For now, however, the company will focus on making Origins
a success in U.S. department stores. In that respect, the
family-owned business has certain advantages, namely deep
pockets and lots of patience. Lauder's Prescriptives line of
cosmetics, for example, was introduced in department stores
in 1979, and is now among the fastest growing brands in
department stores. But the line took 10 years of tinkering
and nearly $40 million to perfect, and it is just starting to
turn a profit.

   To-and-Fro Budget Talks Recess With Hopes Dim
   For Reaching a Meaningful Pact by Election Day

   WASHINGTON -- The bipartisan budget talks sputtered to a
temporary halt as political maneuvering reduced the chances
for a substantial deficit-reduction accord before Election
Day.
   In a fitting conclusion to 12 weeks of unfruitful
bickering, negotiators spent days trying to agree on a choice
of secluded location where talks can resume after Labor Day
for a last try at reaching a compromise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If several days of hard bargaining in September fail, then
President Bush and the Democrats in Congess will probably be
forced to choose:
   They can accept $85 billion or $100 billion in painful
spending cuts triggered by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
law, which could cripple the government just before the
elections. Or they can make the more likely choice of
agreeing on a "fig leaf," somehow altering the Gramm-Rudman
law to lighten the pain of spending cuts and delay the hard
choices until a lame-duck session or even next year.
   As the talks recess for a month, a tug-of-war between the
urge to seek partisan advantage and the imperative to shrink
the deficit continues -- both within the two parties and
between them. House Democrats want to put forward a
deficit-reduction plan; Senate Democrats block them. Mr. Bush
concedes that tax increases are necessary; House Republicans
vow to oppose them. Republicans demand that the
Democratic-controlled Congress surrender some power over
spending; powerful Democrats, particularly Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, say they will never go along.
   If the talks are to succeed in September, the partisan
urges will have to give way. But as the congressional
elections approach, that seems unlikely. Indeed, some
negotiators say only a new atmosphere of urgency -- perhaps
prompted by looming automatic spending cuts or a
deteriorating economy or an extraordinary presidential plea
-- will force a compromise that wipes out the deficit over
five years, which is the goal of the talks.
   "Ultimately, there needs to be concurrence this really
needs to be done," says House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta of California, who is among the Democrats most eager
to cut a deal with the White House. "If that's not there,
it's not going to happen."
   It's certainly not there yet. "There is not a sense of
crisis in the land," says Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.). "I do
not sense that -- outside of Washington -- they are waiting
with bated breath."
   The familiar obstacles to a compromise remain. Democrats
want to tax the rich; Republicans don't. Republicans want to
cut government benefit programs deeply; Democrats are
reluctant. Democrats want a quick reduction in the Pentagon
budget; Republicans don't.
   A less prominent issue also stands in the way, namely Mr.
Bush's insistence that Congress alter the budget process so
the appropriations committees have less freedom to spend.
   "Without process change, I don't know how you get
something," says Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of
Kansas. But powerful Sen. Byrd, the former majority leader
who now chairs the Appropriations Committee, is warning
privately that he will fight any erosion of Congress's power
over spending.
   He has made the issue such a cause within Democratic
caucuses that fellow Democrats have grown weary of his
lectures, one of which he actually read. As his committee
considers fiscal 1991 spending bills, Sen. Byrd's leverage is
strengthened. He recently asked subcommittee chairmen to keep
a list of those who ask for home-state projects while
supporting Mr. Bush's proposal to give the president the
ability to knock out individual items from spending bills. He
was only half-joking.
   The net result of all this politicking is that President
Bush's attempt to negotiate a deficit accord with Democrats
well in advance of a crisis and the fall election season has
failed.
   The administration tried to cajole the Democrats, but the
bipartisan spirit was dissipated by anti-tax Republicans in
the House. It tried to scare the Democrats with frightening
figures about the spending cuts that loom should the budget
talks fail, but that just persuaded them that Mr. Bush won't
allow the cuts to take effect. And, most recently, the
administration threatened a barrage of partisan rhetoric, but
the message got garbled when House Minority Whip Newt
Gingrich (R., Ga.) delivered it so harshly that the White
House had to tone it down.
   As a result, the Democrats have had a free ride for months
-- and they are enjoying it. "The president and the
Republican budget negotiators can't agree on what they want,
and it shows," Sen. Fowler said on the very day that the
administration was trying to put Democrats on the defensive.
   Rep. Panetta and Sen. Fowler represent the two ends of the
tug-of-war within the Democratic camp. Rep. Panetta has been
arguing for months that Democrats ought to make concessions
and begin bargaining.
   Sen. Fowler, more of a poker player, figures Mr. Bush
needs a budget agreement more than the Democrats do. He and
his allies argue that their sit-on-our-hands strategy
prompted the only significant move in the past 12 weeks: Mr.
Bush's abandonment of his campaign promise not to raise
taxes.
   Among congressional Republicans, the roles are reversed.
Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), who has been wrestling with
the deficit for a decade now, keeps refining the
deficit-reduction plan in the thick red binders his staff has
been carrying around for weeks. But so far, it hasn't been
endorsed by Republicans, let alone offered to Democrats.
   His antagonist within the GOP is Rep. Gingrich, the No. 2
House Republican. "The White House has been far more patient
than I would be," Rep. Gingrich says, explaining that Mr.
Bush "truly believes that other people can be convinced to be
reasonable." He adds: "The Democrats in Congress are doing
what they can to convince him that that's not a very smart
assessment."

   Stark Calls Health Chief
   A `Disgrace to His Race'

   WASHINGTON -- Rep. Fortney Stark charged that Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who is black, is "a
disgrace to his profession and his race" because of his
opposition to national health care and abortion.
   Dr. Sullivan demanded an apology from the California
Democrat, who made his remarks twice yesterday, once in front
of cameras. "I wish he had the guts to make his comments to
my face," Dr. Sullivan said in a statement. "It's too bad
ultraliberals like Pete Stark haven't progressed to the point
that they can accept the independent thinking of a black man
that does not conform to their own stereotyped views."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The White House issued a statement saying that Rep.
Stark's "bigoted assault on the integrity and ability of
Secretary Sullivan is an affront to the Congress and the
Democratic party. We trust that the Democratic party and its
chairman, Ron Brown, will disassociate themselves from
Congressman Stark's ill-tempered and shameful remarks." Mr.
Brown is also black.
   Mr. Stark, a leader on health issues, is pushing a costly
national health plan that the Bush administration opposes.
"The people who are going to suffer because of the policies
he's blindly accepting from the administration are the
minorities in this country," Mr. Stark said of Dr. Sullivan.
   Mr. Stark made his remarks at a time when racial tensions
in the capital already are unusually high because of the drug
trial of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry. Some of the
mayor's supporters assert that the charges against him were
racially motivated.

   First Profit Is Reported

   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., Houston, recorded its
first profitable quarter since late 1986, but it would have
posted another loss without special gains totaling $123.2
million at its Continental unit.
   In addition, the parent, which recently changed its name
from Texas Air Corp., lost control of its Eastern Airlines
unit early in the second quarter and no longer has to report
that troubled carrier's losses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the quarter, Continental Airlines Holdings had net
income of $98.3 million, or $2.21 a share, on revenue of
$1.51 billion. In the year-ago quarter, it reported a net
loss of $109.3 million, or a loss of $2.88 a share on revenue
of $1.4 billion.
   The company said it was excluding the results of Eastern
Airlines from April 19 on, when a bankruptcy judge appointed
a trustee to take control of the unit. As a result of an
accounting change, then, the Continental Holdings'
second-quarter results include only 18 days of Eastern
results, in which the financially ailing carrier had a loss
of $12.6 million on revenue of $115.9 million.
   For the six months, the parent company reported a net loss
of $8.8 million, or 51 cents a share, on revenue of $3.37
billion, compared with a net loss of $364.9 million on
revenue of $3.28 billion.

   West Germany's largest banking group, Deutsche Bank AG,
reported yesterday that its partial operating profit in the
first half of 1990 rose 18% to 2.2 billion marks ($1.39
million) from 1.869 billion marks in the first six months of
last year.
   Deutsche Bank was the third major West German banking
group to report firm first half growth in its partial
operating profit, which is before taxes and excludes results
from the bank's trading activities for its own account.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Deutsche Bank didn't provide specific figures over
earnings that include results from its own trading
activities. But the company said such full operating profit
in the first half rose 17% when compared with one-half of the
full-year total in all 1989.
   West German banks usually don't publish what their full
operating profit is. They simply characterize it or disclose
percentage changes. That is because the banks claim that the
results of their trading activities should be confidential.
   Deutsche Bank said that its 1990 first-half world-wide
group results were aided by the first-time inclusion of
recent acquisitions. Most notable of these were U.K. merchant
bankers Morgan Grenfell and German specialty banking group
Grunelius KG, among others.

   Accountants' Body
   Is Moving Toward
   Limiting Liability

   NEW YORK -- The American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the profession's chief U.S. body, took a step
toward limiting accountants' individual liability in some
circumstances.
   The group's board recommended that members vote on a
proposal to allow accountants to form their practices as
commercial corporations. That form of organization would
effectively limit the liability exposure of individuals in
the firm. A more controversial proposal to allow non-CPAs to
own stock in such corporations was dropped from the board's
recommendation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The recommendation isn't likely to be submitted to the
group's entire 300,000 members before next year, but it faces
major hurdles even if approved. Such a change would also need
endorsement by state accounting bodies or state statutes,
which could take years to accomplish.
   "It is highly doubtful the states will go along with
this," asserted Dan L. Goldwasser, counsel on professional
liability matters to the New York State Society of CPAs.
"State regulators feel very strongly they're there to protect
the public and that professionals should be responsible for
their actions."
   The proposal comes at a time when accountants find
themselves involved in a sharply rising number of lawsuits
accusing them of failing to detect or disclose financial
problems at companies they audit. At the same time, Congress
is considering legislation to require accountants to more
aggressively identify and disclose potential illegalities to
company management and directors or, if necessary, to the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Currently, institute rules allow accountants to practice
only as proprietors, in a partnership, or a professional
corporation. In those circumstances, individuals are exposed
to unlimited liability. In a partnership, members also are
individually liable for other members, and rules on liability
of members in a professional corporation vary according to
state law. None of the big U.S. accounting firms has
organized as a professional corporation, largely because they
operate across state lines.
   "The thinking {behind the proposal} is to relieve
individuals of their unlimited liability in practice . . .
even for their own mistakes," said Donald J. Schneeman,
secretary and general counsel of the accounting institute. He
said that in a corporation its assets would be at risk rather
than the assets of individuals.
   James Emerson, editor of Professional Services Review, an
industry newsletter, said: "I can't imagine any state
permitting the practice of public accounting under the shield
of a regular corporation."
   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of a House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee that has held hearings on the
accounting profession, said he "would be concerned with any
effort to change or reduce the professional responsibilities
of accountants."

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. adopted a shareholder rights plan
to guard against unwanted takeovers.
   Although the aerospace giant said the plan "isn't being
adopted in response to any effort to acquire control" of the
company, its balance sheet has been weakened of late by cost
overruns on several military programs and continued
development expenditures on the MD-11 commercial jet. The
company last month announced it will eliminate up to 17,000
jobs by year-end in an effort to cut costs by as much as $700
million annually.

   First Boston Corp. is managing the underwriting syndicate.
   Each debenture is offered at $313.93 per $1,000 principal

   Bayerische Motoren Werke AG said its group net profit rose
8% in the first half of 1990, to 352 million German marks
($221.5 million) from 325 million marks a year earlier.
   Sales increased 2%, to 13.84 billion marks from 13.54
billion marks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   BMW attributed the relatively modest rise in group sales
to the mark's strength, which reduced foreign-currency sales
revenue when converted into marks.
   The West German auto maker said earnings were helped by a
decline in raw-materials prices, but noted that these prices
have started to rise again. Nevertheless, it said suppliers'
rationalization measures had managed to keep prices paid for
components and parts stable.
   BMW's car production rose 2% to 278,470 from 272,217 a
year earlier.
   Earnings and sales for the year are likely to develop
"satisfactorily," the company said. It said increases in
people's real income warrant expectations of continuing good
business for the car industry.
   BMW expects to produce more than 500,000 cars this year.
It produced 511,476 last year.

   Midland Bank PLC posted pretax profit for the six months
ended June 30 of #36 million ($66.8 million); profit was
weaker than expected, although it reversed a year-earlier
loss of #531 million.
   Midland, a major British commercial bank, was expected to
post pretax profit somewhere between #150 million and #203
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pretax profit was curbed by #300 million in loan
provisions, #234 million of which was to cover exposure in
the U.K. market. It had only #90 million in provisions in the
year-earlier period to cover domestic loans.
   Midland's profit was also cut by a #38 million charge
against interest-rate swaps with U.K. municipalities that
have been voided by the British courts.
   Pretax profit before provisions, however, fell in the
latest half to #363 million, down 19% from #449 million.
   The bank said profitability was also hurt by narrower U.K.
interest margins, reduced interest payments by Third World
debtors and the continued effects of its misjudging the
direction of U.K. interest rates last year.

   In a lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan,
Mr. Steiner charged Chairman Arnold J. Friedhoff and
directors Howard M. Pack and Luis Menocal III with
"unjustified and improper acts" designed to "(entrench)
themselves in control" of Clinical Technologies.

   On Tuesday, the company announced that its board had voted
3-2 to dismiss Mr. Steiner and name Michael M. Goldberg,
founding partner of an investment firm specializing in
health-care companies, to the top operating posts.
   The Elmsford, N.Y., company is developing a technology by
which drugs that presently can be administered only by
injection -- such as insulin for diabetics -- can be taken
orally. Mr. Steiner, who has a doctorate in physiological
psychology, founded Clinical Technologies in 1985.
   Messrs. Friedhoff, Pack and Menocal couldn't be reached

company filed a countersuit against Mr. Steiner. He said the
company denies the charges, and is "confident the parties
will work out their disputes."

   WASHINGTON -- Seizing on the turmoil in the Middle East to
buttress their arguments, supporters of the B-2 Stealth
bomber won a narrow victory on the Senate floor to keep the
embattled plane alive.
   By defeating a pair of amendments to end or delay
production of additional radar-eluding B-2s, the Senate set
the stage for a historic test of wills with the House over
the kind of military forces the U.S. needs to cope with
Soviet nuclear threats and Third World crises in the late
1990s and beyond. The margin of victory was eight votes or
fewer in both instances.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In spite of the fact that saving the B-2 remains President
Bush's highest military priority, the House is almost certain
to reject additional purchases of the bat-shaped bomber when
it approves its version of the defense authorization bill in
September.
   Reflecting sharp erosion of bipartisan support even in the
Senate, lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to withhold any more
production funds until the Air Force and Northrop Corp., the
prime contractor on the B-2, present convincing new test
results showing that its performance in the air has matched
its billing.
   "This horse is heavy enough already," said Sen. Sam Nunn
(D., Ga.), adding that significant further delays will make
it "very, very difficult to ever sell it to the American
people."
   Still, yesterday's dramatic series of votes was a victory
for both President Bush and Sen. Nunn, chairman of the Armed
Services Committee. Sen. Nunn staked his reputation as the
Senate's leading voice on defense matters on the outcome of
the B-2 battle. Last year, only 29 senators voted to cut off
B-2 production. This time, 43 senators voted to halt
purchases and begin closing down the assembly line, while 56
opposed the amendment.
   Acknowledging that "the popular decision in the United
States today {would be} to cancel the B-2," Sen. James Exon
(D., Neb.), another outspoken supporter, urged the Senate to
salvage the "quantum leap forward" in technology.
   The lengthy debate originally was expected to focus on
arms-control issues, the B-2s huge price of more than $850
million a plane, and disputes about Soviet military
capabilities and intentions. Instead, Iraq's bloody invasion
of Kuwait altered the tone of the entire debate. Supporters
of the B-2, who clearly had been on the defensive before,
gained momentum and fresh ammunition by attacking Iraq's
moves and pointing out the B-2's capabilities to respond to
such an emergency.
   The unexpected Iraqi attack "reminded {lawmakers} there is
a lot of mischief in the world," Senate Minority Leader
Robert Dole (R., Kan.) said. "We ought to err on the side of
being prepared."
   Almost every lawmaker who joined in the debate -- from
staunch supporters of the B-2 to newly converted opponents
such as Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio) -- tried to capitalize on
the Middle Eastern development to help make their case. Sen.
Glenn, a former astronaut and advocate of new aviation
technology, took the Senate floor to announce that after
weeks of "agonizing" he concluded that the B-2 would siphon
off badly needed funds from conventional weapons and military
personnel accounts. The Air Force, he said, simply hasn't
"been willing to address that {issue} head on," adding that
the B-2 "isn't what we need to go against the situation in
the Persian Gulf."
   All told, the Senate approved almost $2 billion for
procurement of two more B-2 bombers and at least that much
for continued research and testing during the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1. The Pentagon has spent about $27 billion for
15 planes already authorized or currently being built. The
total price is expected to be well over $65 billion if the
fleet of 75 B-2s proposed by the White House is built. Barely
a few months ago, the Pentagon insisted it needed 132 of the
planes to fulfill its nuclear-deterrent mission.
   In his spirited defense of the plane, Sen. Nunn argued
that terminating production would send U.S. arms-control
negotiators "back to the drawing board" and leave the U.S.
vulnerable to continued improvements in the Soviet's nuclear
arsenal. "All of us are suffering from sticker shock" with
the B-2, he acknowledged. But if Soviet advances eventually
force the U.S. to begin investing in a new network of
super-sophisticated air defenses, he said, "it will make the
. . . B-2 look like the biggest bargain we ever killed."
   The anti-B-2 amendment that garnered the most
votes-introduced by Sens. William Cohen (R., Maine) and
Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) -- sought to withhold all new
production money until at least 1992, pending the outcome of
flight tests. "The biggest stealth characteristic of this
plane has been its mission," Sen. Leahy asserted, adding:
"Unfortunately, it's not stealth dollars." The amendment
failed on a 53-45 vote.
   B-2 supporters insisted that a one-year disruption in
production could be tantamount to killing the entire program,
by adding $4.7 billion to the already skyrocketing cost of
the B-2 and prompting layoffs of some assembly-line workers.
   In a speech to the Aspen Institute in Colorado, President
Bush echoed that sentiment. "To maintain clear and confident
strategic deterrence into the next century, we need the B-2.
. . . further delay will only increase cost." The president
also urged Congress to fund continued development of the
Midgetman and mobile MX missiles.
   Working late into the evening, the Senate also defeated an
amendment that would bar construction of an airbase in
Crotone, Italy.

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. intelligence officials had been
sounding alarms in recent days about a possible Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   Emphasizing that the Central Intelligence Agency wasn't
surprised by the Iraqi action, an agency spokesman said
yesterday, "We provided policy makers with very useful and
timely information on these events and we continue to do so."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Administration and congressional officials agree that the
CIA did its job. Since last week, President Bush had been
warned by intelligence analysts that what originally looked
like a military bluff was quickly turning into the kind of
troop deployment that could be used to invade Kuwait or even
Saudi Arabia.
   Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster even
hand-delivered certain fresh details on the Iraqi buildup to
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Among the
assessments he conveyed was a conclusion that, by this week,
President Saddam Hussein's force would be capable of
penetrating Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
   The agency lacked hard evidence of an intent to invade,
intelligence officials say. But as the buildup grew, the CIA
became more alarmed, partly because Mr. Hussein is so
unpredictable, and partly because, unlike many other Arab
leaders, he has been known to carry out his threats.

   NEW YORK -- Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent bond investors
scrambling for cover yesterday on fears that war between the
two Middle East nations will cause oil prices -- and
inflation -- to soar.
   The sell-off started during overnight trading in Tokyo and
continued in London and New York. Traders said activity was
busiest in London, where dealers reported heavy selling by
investors from all around the world, including those in the
U.S., Britain, Saudi Arabia and Japan.
</LP>

   Even investors in smaller countries were big sellers. "We
were extremely busy in Singapore," said Lawrence Leuzzi, a
managing director at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co.
   The prospects of higher oil prices not only increase the
odds that inflation will accelerate, but could force the
Federal Reserve to change monetary policy.
   News that oil prices are rising, "is coming at the worst
possible time, when the economy is already extremely weak and
when there is a major effort underway to reduce the size of
the budget deficit," said Norman Robertson, chief economist
at Mellon Bank Corp. He said that rising oil prices will make
it difficult for the Federal Reserve to further reduce
interest rates. At the same time, high oil prices will drag
down already weak business activity.
   "If not recession, this certainly carries the threat of
stagflation, where oil prices rise and exacerbates inflation
and at the same time reduces the economic growth rate. It's a
very vicious brew here," said Mr. Robertson. The economist
estimates that if oil prices rise to $25 a barrel, the
nation's inflation could rise about 1/2 of a percentage point
to between 4.5% and 5%.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, September crude
settled at $23.11 a barrel, up $1.57 on the day. The contract
traded as high at $23.80.
   The yield curve steepened in reaction to yesterday's news,
as prices of short-term securities ended unchanged to
slightly lower while prices of long-term bonds were
clobbered.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 1/4 point, a
loss of about $12.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of
its price, jumped to 8.45%.
   Two-year notes, on the other hand, fell less than 1/8
point to yield 7.88% while three-month bills ended unchanged
to yield 7.66%.
   Some traders detected signs of "flight-to-quality" buying
of short-term Treasury bills yesterday, but were surprised
there wasn't more of this, in view of the financial market's
reaction to the Iraqi invasion. Because U.S. Treasury bills
are considered the safest securities in the world, investors
often sell out of other securities and aggressively buy
Treasury bills when there is political or economic upheaval
in other parts of the world.
   But trading yesterday was dominated by investors making
"yield-curve trades," essentially selling long-term Treasurys
while buying short-term securities on expectations that these
securities will outperform the market in the coming weeks and
months.
   In the wake of the Iraqi invasion, economic data released
yesterday passed more-or-less unnoticed. Those reports were
the latest data on claims for unemployment and factory
orders. As trading quieted late yesterday afternoon, however,
the market began to focus on the July employment report due
this morning.
   The market is looking for the report -- the first official
indication of the economy during July -- to confirm signs of
marked economic deterioration.
   "The question is, if it is a good number, how high can the
market go, now that they've fallen like this," says one
trader.
   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
estimate on average that nonfarm payrolls increased by 5,300,
or by 130,000 excluding layoffs of census workers.
Unemployment is seen rising 0.1% to 5.3% during July.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
103 2/32, down from 104 8/32. The issue's yield climbed to
8.45% from 8.35%. Two-year notes were quoted at 100 6/32 to
yield 7.88% compared with 100 9/32 to yield 7.83%.
   Short-term rates were little changed. The discount rate on
three-month bills was unchanged at 7.43% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.66% while the rate on six-month
bills was modestly higher at 7.31% to yield 7.67%.
   The Treasury Department auctioned $4 billion of 44-day
cash management bills yesterday. The average rate was set at
7.60%.
   Here are details of the auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds ended between 1/2 and 3/4 point lower. Trading
was limited, however, and junk-bond dealers said that in most
cases prices were simply quoted lower. Junk bonds are
speculative-grade issues that carry low ratings or no ratings
at all.
   Among the high-yield bonds that suffered losses were
pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc., which staged a partial
rebound after falling more than two points earlier.
Pay-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of more securities
instead of cash.
   RJR Nabisco 17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures
fell one point to 113 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
RJR's 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures finished one
point lower at 91 3/4.
   Despite yesterday's declines, First Boston Corp. said its
junk-bond index showed a positive return of 3.23% in the
month of July.
   Advancers outpaced decliners by more than four to one, and
the value of the First Boston high-yield index reached 149.45
in July, surpassing its July 1989 peak of 147.91.
   "This is the first time the market has recouped all the
losses from mid-1989 till February," said Sam DeRosa-Farag, a
high-yield analyst at First Boston.
   In addition, Mr. DeRosa-Farag pointed out that bonds,
which are trading at between 60 to 80 cents on the dollar,
are beginning to outperform bonds trading at par and above.
   Bonds in the 60-cents to 80-cents on the dollar range
produced positive returns of 4.6% in July compared with a
2.1% positive return generated by bonds trading at par and
above, said Mr. DeRosa-Farag.
   In the investment-grade market, prices of high-grade
corporate bonds ended between 3/4 point to one point lower.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds finished 1/4 to 1/2 point lower in calm
dealings.
   Despite the slight losses, traders said the supply
shortage in municipals continues to provide solid support and
foster bullish sentiment.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 finished 1/4
point lower at 99 1/2, pushing the yield up to 7.23% from
7.21% late Wednesday.
   In the new issue sector, the Pennsylvania Housing Finance
Authority's $80 million single-family mortgage revenue bonds
were priced by a PaineWebber Inc. group.
   The bonds, which are subject to the alternative minimum
tax, were priced at par to yield from 6.30% in 1994 to 7.65%
in 2023.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities ended lower.
   Among actively traded issues:
   Government National Mortgage Association 8.5% securities
were down 13/32 at 95 17/32, and the 9.5% issues, at 100
12/32, were down 10/32.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were off 9/32
at 99 25/32, and Federal National Mortgage Association 9%
issues were down 11/32 at 97 31/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Iraq's overnight invasion of Kuwait caused global bond
prices to tumble.
   In West Germany, prices were sharply lower. But traders
said there has been little panic-selling. The trend much of
the day was set in the Bund futures pit in London.
   Bonn's 8.75% benchmark bond due 2000 fell 0.63 point to
100.32 to yield 8.69%.
   British government bonds, called gilts, ended with losses
of as much as 3/4 point, but they had been down by well over
a point at midday.
   Britain's benchmark 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 was quoted
late at 102 15/32, down 22/32 to yield 11.37%.
   In Tokyo, dealers said the market closely followed the
movement of the U.S. dollar, with yen bonds recovering from
their lows whenever the the dollar retreated from its highs.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
yield on Japan's benchmark No. 119 bond was 7.575%. The price
was down 0.34 point to 85.29.

   Hilton Hotels Corp., prompted by the volatile stock
market, said it temporarily suspended its offering of liquid
yield option notes due in 2005 with a principal amount of
$650 million.
   Barron Hilton, the hotel and casino company's chairman,
said Hilton's stock doesn't reflect the company's value.
Hilton's stock has been pushed down in recent days by
disappointing second-quarter earnings, concerns about the
casino industry and a lackluster travel market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The offering of zero-coupon notes would result in proceeds
of about $270 million to the Beverly Hills, Calif., company,
which Hilton had said it planned to use for general corporate
purposes. The notes would be subordinated and convertible
into Hilton common. A company spokesman said Hilton will
proceed with the offering if the stock recovers sufficiently.

   WASHINGTON -- A housing-rights group sued the government's
savings-and-loan bailout agency, contending that the agency
isn't adhering to procedures to promote low-income housing.
   The suit, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleged that
the Resolution Trust Corp. isn't sufficiently publicizing
homes made available when it sells off the assets of sick
thrifts, hasn't appointed certain groups as "clearinghouses"
for the real estate information, and is restricting the flow
of houses into the program.

   ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for
Reform Now, said it is seeking a preliminary injunction to
award ACORN funds for homes that were sold "improperly" and
to appoint ACORN as a clearinghouse for the information.
   The savings and loan cleanup law called for public housing
agencies and those with low incomes to have a 90-day first
look at homes and apartments appraised at below-average
prices.
   A spokesman for the RTC said the agency hadn't yet seen
the suit and couldn't comment in detail. But he said that
ACORN hadn't yet officially requested to be designated a
clearinghouse for the information and that the RTC had made
catalogs of the property available to ACORN. "We're sorry
they're unhappy," he said.

   The Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait:
   U.S. Asset Freeze, Trade Embargo
   Likely to Do Little Harm to Iraq

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush's economic retaliation for
the invasion of Kuwait isn't likely to hurt Iraq much.
   Mr. Bush issued two executive orders early yesterday, one
imposing an asset freeze and trade embargo against Iraq, the
other blocking transfers of official Kuwaiti assets in the
U.S. to shield them from Iraqi takeover.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The combination of sanctions against Iraq is the most
severe economic penalty the U.S. can impose against a nation.
The order severs all transportation and financial links
between the two countries and bars U.S. citizens from working
in Iraq. But unlike the similar sanctions the U.S. placed on
Iran in 1979 during the hostage crisis, the moves against
Iraq aren't expected to have much impact on the Arab nation.
   A Commerce Department official said there is a "limited"
U.S. business presence in Iraq. He estimated there are less
than 100 Americans working there now, mainly as technicians
and engineers.
   Also, U.S. officials say that Iraq has only minimal assets
in the U.S., and U.S. companies export only about $1.2
billion in goods -- mostly farm products -- to Iraq. Iraq can
quickly make up for the $2.3 billion in oil it ships to the
U.S. from the price increases it will cause by taking over
Kuwait's oil fields.
   In the U.S., banks acted quickly on the president's
orders. The manager of international money transfer at a
major New York bank said that by 6 a.m. yesterday, his bank,
and presumably other big U.S. banks, had shut down the
transfers of Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets.
   Handling the freeze against Iraq won't be a problem
because of the country's small holdings in the U.S. Thomas
Sams, who runs the Iraq desk at the Commerce Department,
called Baghdad's holdings here "minuscule."
   But dealing with Kuwait's huge assets could be more
complicated, because they are divided between official, or
government holdings, which are blocked, and private assets,
which aren't covered by the president's order. U.S. officials
say they don't know how big Kuwait's U.S. holdings are.
According to the Commerce Department's tabulation of holdings
in real estate and major corporate shares, Kuwait's direct
investment in the U.S. totaled $4.2 billion last year.
   But officials estimate that private and official Kuwaiti
"portfolio" investment in stocks and bonds could amount to an
additional $35 billion to $55 billion, for total U.S.
holdings of about $40 billion to $60 billion. However, some
private analysts estimate that the holdings are far smaller.
Sharif Ghalib at the Institute for International Finance, for
example, says his calculations show total Kuwaiti assets of
$15 billion in the U.S.
   Michael Bradfield, an attorney in the Washington office of
Jones Day Reavis &amp; Pogue who specializes in banking, says
that "sorting out what's public and what's private in a place
like Kuwait is extremely difficult. It will put judgmental
burdens on banks that they certainly would rather not have.
The Kuwaitis have assets all over the place and sorting all
that out is going to be a long-term problem, assuming the
situation remains as it is."
   The Kuwaiti Investment Office, the financial arm of the
government, has major stockholdings in a number of companies,
including British Petroleum Co. In addition, private Kuwaiti
investors have broad interests in real estate, retailing and
other U.S. assets.
   Santa Fe International Corp., Alhambra, Calif., a
petroleum concern acquired by the Kuwaitis in 1981 for $2.5
billion, said it continues normal business operations.
   John J. Mika, vice president administration, said in an
interview that communications with the State and Treasury
departments indicate that "the freeze isn't intended to be
punitive to companies such as Santa Fe International." Mr.
Mika said the company, with about 2,000 employees world-wide,
issued its normal payroll yesterday.
   Commercial relations between the U.S. and Iraq have been
relatively slow to develop, aside from oil purchases and
annual shipments of about $1 billion of rice, wheat, corn and
soybean products to Iraq. Washington and Baghdad didn't have
full relations until 1984, and then Iraq's bitter war with
Iran limited commercial opportunity. After the war ended two
years ago, U.S. interest began to pick up. General Motors
Corp. negotiated to assemble cars in Iraq, and construction,
irrigation and other companies began to look for business
there.
   The sanctions will end about $200 million in short-term
Export-Import Bank insurance for shipments of U.S.
manufactured goods, and agricultural credits that have ranged
from $500 million to $1 billion a year recently. But
yesterday, Iraq announced that it was suspending repayments
on $2.2 billion of credits it owes the U.S.
   Yesterday the House voted 416-0 to authorize an embargo on
virtually all trade with Iraq and to impose new sanctions,
including tighter standards on the export of manufactured
goods and technology to Baghdad. The bill goes beyond the
administration in some areas and would give Congress greater
leverage in reviewing any future decision by Mr. Bush to lift
the restrictions.

              How the Crisis Boiled Over
                                                                                                       

   July 17 -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein denounces
Persian Gulf countries that exceed their production quotas,
accusing them of stabbing Iraq in the back.
                                                                                                       

   July 18 -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Tareq Aziz tells the
Arab League Kuwait has stolen $2.4 billion worth of Iraqi oil
and has built military posts on Iraqi land. The U.A.E. says
it will cut oil output as promised. Kuwait's parliament
denounces Iraq's tirade.
                                                                                                       

   July 22 -- Iraqi foreign minister flies to Cairo; Egypt
says Gulf Crisis will soon be over.
                                                                                                       

   July 23 -- Baghdad papers call Kuwait's foreign minister
"a U.S. agent." Kuwait denies it seeks to draw foreign powers
into the dispute and says it wants Arabs to settle it.
                                                                                                       

   July 24 -- Iraq reportedly deploys thousands of troops to
the Kuwait border and U.S. warships in Gulf are said to be
put on state of alert. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak visits
Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Iraq says oil prices should
rise to $25 per barrel.
                                                                                                       

   July 25 -- Iraq demands $2.4 billion in compensation from
Kuwait. Egyptian President Mubarak says Kuwait and Iraq will
meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss the crisis. Arab
diplomats say Iraq has given Egypt assurances it will not
attack Kuwait.
                                                                                                       

   July 27 -- OPEC agrees to raise the cartel's target price
to $21 per barrel of oil. Iraq warns Kuwait it must meet
Baghdad's "legitimate rights" at the planned Jeddah talks.
                                                                                                       

   July 31 -- Senior Iraqi and Kuwait officials meet for two
hours in Jeddah; reports say that Iraq has almost 100,000

   Iraq's Saddam Hussein has redrawn the map of the Middle
East, and underscored how difficult it is for the superpowers
-- even when they agree -- to control world events in the
post-Cold War era.
   The Iraqi president already had the Arab world's biggest
army. Now, his lightning conquest of Kuwait has in one stroke
doubled the oil under his control -- to fully 20% of the
world's reserves.

   But while his invasion of neighboring oil fields and
territory may ease Iraq's immediate economic and strategic
concerns, the political fallout from his aggression has
clearly isolated Mr. Hussein in the international community.
The U.S., the Soviet Union and numerous other countries
swiftly condemned the invasion, and a few, including the U.S.
and France, froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets on their
territory.
   Mr. Hussein's actions smashed any traditional notion of
Arab brotherhood governing politics in the region. His attack
humbled Egypt, which had sought a negotiated end to tensions
between Iraq and Kuwait, and threatened to push Syria closer
to the moderate Arab camp. It left Saudi Arabia, with its
infant military, particularly anxious about Mr. Hussein's
further designs.
   "I think he {Mr. Hussein} has finally convinced everyone
that he is incorrigible and a threat to regional peace," says
Michael Dewar, deputy director of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London.
   Still, most notable in the events in the Mideast this week
is the influence -- or the lack thereof -- exercised by the
superpowers.
   No longer is there a predictable East-West world order to
guide U.S. responses to world events. A new, more complicated
order reigns. The inability of the Bush administration to do
much about the Iraqi invasion shows just how difficult and
frustrating it will be for the U.S. to control events.
   "We've ended the Cold War and we've now begun the new era,
the war over resources," suggests Judith Kipper, an analyst
at the Brookings Institution. "This is over money and oil."
   There are few attractive American responses. The American
military presence in the region -- eight warships in the
Persian Gulf and the aircraft carrier Independence and its
contingent in the distant Indian Ocean -- isn't an adequate
force to roll back Iraq's enormous, war-hardened army.
   President Bush initially said that military intervention
wasn't under consideration, though Kuwait had asked the U.S.
to send troops. Later yesterday, he declined to rule various
options either in or out.
   Even if the U.S. wanted to move to prevent Iraq's forces
from moving farther, into Saudi Arabia, the task would be
difficult. The U.S. would have to send a large chunk of its
European-based ground forces and their support equipment to
the kingdom. That could take weeks and would require a
request from a Saudi government that wants American
protection but always has been reluctant to ask for it
publicly. President Bush and Saudi King Fahd talked by phone
for half an hour last night and discussed "possible options
for dealing with the situation," the White House said.
   "In the past neither the Kuwaitis nor Saudis have been
inclined to allow American bases or forces on their soil,"
says former Energy and Defense Secretary James Schlesinger.
"I think that it would be desirable from a Saudi point of
view and an American point of view that there be an American
presence."
   The U.S. also doesn't have attractive nonmilitary options
for stopping Iraq. President Bush yesterday banned most
transactions with Iraq, which Treasury officials said include
the import of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The House of
Representatives voiced its support by voting to cut off all
trade with Iraq.
   But a boycott by the U.S. alone will be meaningless. Iraq
can find other buyers for its oil. Only a boycott with wide
international participation would be effective, and in the
past, such boycotts have collapsed because some countries
inevitably buy from -- or sell to -- the target country.
   The Bush administration yesterday was contacting its
allies, urging them to emulate its economic sanctions against
Iraq. But there were few signs that the State Department was
actively lobbying yet for an international embargo of Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil, which by some estimates could cause world
oil prices to double.
   President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher suggested at a joint press conference in Colorado,
where they held a previously scheduled meeting, that
international restrictions on the purchase of Iraqi oil might
be considered in the United Nations Security Council within
days. (The Council yesterday condemned the Iraqi invasion.)
   This isn't the first time that a Third World conflict has
spun out of the reach of the superpowers, of course. But
Iraq's move may signal that such uncontrollable crises will
become more of a rule than an exception. Unlike at times in
the past, the U.S. and the Soviet Union can't negotiate over
the heads of their regional proxies to reach a settlement, as
they did in the 1973 Middle East war.
   Rather, Iraq's Saddam Hussein represents precisely the
kind of Third World leader -- independent-minded and armed
far beyond what would have seemed possible just a few years
back -- who may pose the clearest threat to international
stability in the 1990s. The shift in the longstanding world
order may well embolden such leaders to act on their own to
help shape the new global power structure. "Without the
East-West alignments, countries feel freer to move," says Ms.
Kipper.
   As if to underscore the irrelevance of the superpowers
during events in the Mideast Thursday morning, the news of
Iraq's invasion reached Secretary of State James Baker and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze while they were
meeting in remote Siberia. Mr. Shevardnadze didn't know of
the attack until Mr. Baker told him. Later, the Soviet Union
announced it would cease arm sales to Iraq.
   Another option under discussion last night would require
far more than simple Soviet and American action. Officials of
several nations have discussed the possibility of strangling
Iraqi oil sales by choking off export routes. That would
require cutting off two large pipelines, one which runs from
Iraq through Saudi Arabia, another that runs through Turkey.
It would also require the U.S. Navy to block Iraqi shipments
from the Persian Gulf.
   Such a blockade might be feasible, some diplomats say, in
light of the widespread dissatisfaction with Iraq. But it
would call for strong political resolve from all sides,
including the Arab League, which, as of late last night,
hadn't taken a stand on the invasion despite Kuwait's demand
that it send an Arab liberation force. Many in the League,
which has long been a disunified and ineffective
organization, fear Iraq's military might themselves. In fact,
most Arab leaders, at least initially, failed to either
condemn or condone the attack. Mr. Bush said he is being
cautioned to go slow by Arab leaders such as Egypt's Hosni
Mubarak.
   With no clear, practical steps to take, the U.S. and the
Soviet Union resorted to dramatic political symbolism. Mr.
Baker was flying to Moscow late yesterday to issue a joint
statement criticizing the invasion with Mr. Shevardnadze.
   The Bush administration has known for more than a week
that an Iraqi invasion was possible. Some members of Congress
criticized the White House for failing to head off the Iraqi
move. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne
Pell, for example, called Mr. Hussein "the Adolf Hitler of
the Middle East," and said if "the administration had acted
earlier, Hussein may have gotten the message that his
lawlessness wouldn't be tolerated."
   But the White House has been reluctant to mount a
pre-emptive move without an explicit request from the nations
involved. The best response the U.S. could muster was a
modest, hastily assembled joint naval exercise with the
United Arab Emirates. The Iraqis were evidently not
impressed.
   "We will turn Kuwait into a graveyard if any outside power
intervenes," Mr. Hussein said after claiming that Iraqi
troops had entered Kuwait at the request of a revolutionary
group that had overthrown the government. Asked for evidence
of this, Iraqi officials declined to comment.
   Thursday's invasion gives back to Mr. Hussein two assets
he squandered in his eight-year war with Iran: oil wealth and
access to the sea. By raising the price of oil and possibly
securing some or all of Kuwait's vast fields he will be able
to free himself of a crippling war debt estimated at over $50
billion.
   That could free Mr. Hussein to pursue his grander regional
ambitions. Among them: settling scores with Syria, and
championing the cause of Palestinians, particularly in
Israeli-occupied lands. Earlier this year, fearing an Israeli
strike against a vast military buildup that has made Iraq the
world's biggest arms buyer over the last five years, Mr.
Hussein threatened to "scorch half of Israel" with chemical
weapons if it attacked him.
   "Israel is his target. He's preparing himself better,"
contends Ofra Benja, an Iraq specialist at the Dayan
Institute in Tel Aviv. "But the danger is there for everybody
-- Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria."
   Indeed, until two weeks ago, Kuwait seemed low on the list
of Iraq's potential enemies. The emirate bankrolled Iraq
through its war with Iran, lending between $10 billion and
$20 billion, and pumped oil on Iraq's behalf. It also has
generously funded the Palestinian cause and is home to some
300,000 Palestinian refugees.
   But Iraq never accepted Kuwait's borders, opposing the
state's independence from Britain in 1961 and engaging in
armed clashes with it in 1973 and 1976. Resentment grew as
Kuwait, with only 750,000 nationals, became ever richer.
   Explains a diplomat from a nearby Gulf emirate: "Arabs
have been asking why should a power like Iraq have to put up
with borders that were a colonial invention? It is possible
to see all these countries -- the United Arab Emirates,
Bahrain, Qatar -- as imperialist creations that allow the
West to play one against the other in the interests of cheap
oil."
   In Iraq, Mr. Hussein was faced with a postwar economy
ravaged by 45% inflation, lack of foreign exchange and
shortages of even the most basic foodstuffs. Mr. Hussein had
little experience as a peacetime manager: Since becoming
president in 1979 he has been constantly at war, with Iran,
his own Kurdish minority and, by proxy, with Syria in
Lebanon. Yet another campaign -- this time against weak,
oil-rich neighbors -- must have seemed an easy way to divert
attention from domestic ills.
   Indirectly, the invasion of Kuwait also is a way for Mr.
Hussein to thumb his nose at the small state's ally, America.
The U.S. has disappointed Mr. Hussein by not pouring aid into
his country after the war. More important, Iraqi isolation
has been deepened by Western criticism of its brutal domestic
policies and bully-boy tactics abroad. Last Saturday, in an
interview with this newspaper, an Iraqi diplomat threatened:
"If you want Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait, just keep up
that boycott talk in the U.S."
   Mr. Hussein has attacked a sophisticated city-state, in
which even student leftists drive gold Mercedeses with car
phones and "I love democracy" bumper stickers. Kuwait's
citizens enjoyed far more rights than Mr. Hussein's bitterly
repressed population of 14 million. Kuwait's press is among
the freest in the Arab world, and its well-educated
population has been agitating for a more open political
system, although calls for the overthrow of the al-Sabah
family, which has ruled Kuwait since 1752, were extremely
rare.
   Nevertheless, Iraq claimed it had come to the aid of
"youth in Kuwait" to end "the rule of corruption and
terrorism exercised by the clique of the former government."
Iraqi troops and tanks poured across the border Thursday in a
blitzkreig assault as warplanes and helicopters bombed
Kuwait's airport and royal palaces. The surprise assault met
sporadic resistance from the greatly outgunned Kuwaiti
forces, an estimated 200 of whom were killed or wounded by
Thursday afternoon. Among the reported dead was one of the
brothers of the Kuwaiti emir. Others of the royal family are
reported to have fled to safety in Saudi Arabia. The 3,000 to
4,000 Americans living in Kuwait didn't appear to be in
danger, although a few U.S. oil workers apparently were moved
by Iraqi troops.
   Kuwait's future remains unclear. Some 60% of Kuwait's
population is imported labor, principally from poorer Arab
countries and the Indian subcontinent. These people don't
have the vote or a large share in the state's wealth, and
could be manipulated by Iraqi largess to support a puppet
government. Kuwait's Shiite minority also may be won over
with promises of a greater share of power.
   If Iraq stays in Kuwait, it will gain control of numerous
oil refineries and almost 4,000 Kuwaiti service stations in
Europe, which market gasoline under the Q8 brand. Iraq, until
now, has had to stick to crude-oil production alone because
it lacked the funds to buy such "downstream" facilities
abroad. With its greater control over OPEC production under
current quotas, Iraq also would have a commanding say over
oil pricing. And it will gain a new shipping channel. Iraq's
only other outlet -- the Shatt al-Arab waterway -- is choked
with sunken vessels from the Iran-Iraq war, and remains the
subject of a territorial dispute with Iran.
   While Western countries condemn the invasion, and Arab
diplomats scramble to defuse tensions, Kuwaitis themselves
wonder whether their country will ever be the same. "He has a
giant piggy bank in his hands. Why should he give it back?"
asks Naser al-Marri, an official with the Kuwaiti Investment
Authority, now working in London. "He won't, unless the world
makes him."
   In the short term, then, it seems Mr. Hussein has gambled
again and won. But in the process, he has sown dangerous
seeds of distrust and instability in the Arab world. Some
pressure also may be off Israel's new right-wing government,
which already is saying that Mr. Hussein's actions show that
Iraq, not Israel, is the threat to stability in the region.
Yesterday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens denounced
Iraq's actions but said Israel planned no military response.
He added that Kuwait's "occupation by Iraq doesn't change our
strategic situation."
   If Mr. Hussein decides to remain in control of Kuwait, he
also may find the citizens of that land less pliant than
those in his own country. On Thursday, hundreds of anxious
Kuwaitis stranded in London swarmed their country's embassy,
waving posters of their deposed emir and shouting "Kuwait is
for Kuwaitis]" and "Down with Saddam]"
   Khalid Juma, a 25-year-old law student in London for a
one-month summer course, wondered if his chosen career made
sense any more. "The only law that matters now comes in a
tank," he said. "I should be training for guerrilla warfare."

   Dollar Rises in Hectic Day,

   The dollar quickly soared as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
raised the specter of war, but the advance slowly eroded as
traders turned their attention back to weak U.S. economic
growth.
   This wild ride produced hectic trading, and left many
traders confused if not frightened.

<TEXT>
   "It was a very, very bloody day for most traders," said
Manfred Totzauer, a senior trader at Citibank in Frankfurt.
He explained that many of the market's large players had
positioned themselves for further declines in the dollar, and
the invasion news caught them off-guard.
   Because these players -- large banks, institutional
investors and multinational corporations -- have positions
amounting to tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars,
some losses yesterday easily ran into millions of dollars,
traders said.
   Initially, "there was panic; the market was caught short
dollars and people had to buy," said Peter Stein, a trader at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. "It's always like this when
there are international shocks."
   In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.5915 marks
and 149.25 yen, up from 1.5885 marks and 147.18 yen late
Wednesday. The British pound fell marginally to $1.8545 from
$1.8555 late the day before.
   But over the preceding 24 hours, the volatile dollar
rocketed from a low of 1.5818 marks and 146.50 yen in very
early Thursday trading in the Far East to intraday highs of
1.6215 marks, and 151.58 yen -- up 2.5% and 3.5%,
respectively -- in early European activity. By late afternoon
in New York, the dollar had fallen back 1.9% from its high
against the mark and 1.5% from its high against the yen.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
149.75 yen almost an hour after the opening; it closed in
Tokyo Thursday at 148.90 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency
was trading at about 1.5955 marks, down from Tokyo's Thursday
close of 1.6038 marks.
   Many traders expect the dollar to resume its recent
decline unless the Iraq-Kuwait situation escalates. "The
Iraq-Kuwaiti incident will not break the basic trend for the
dollar," which has been falling recently because of a
weakening U.S. economy, lower U.S. interest rates and higher
rates abroad, said Friedrich W. Menzel, a risk manager for
Citibank in Frankfurt. "What we are seeing will probably be
very short-lived."
   But some analysts think such interpretation is
short-sighted or simplistic. "This isn't just an increase in
prices," argued Lawrence A. Veit, an international economist
at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. "The territorial integrity
of every state in the Middle East is now threatened. In a
sense, there's a natural alliance between Iraq and Iran. This
is a confrontation between the high-population countries in
the Middle East that want higher oil prices in the near term
and the low-population countries that want lower prices in
the short term."
   The dollar typically jumps during periods of international
tension as international investors flee into the U.S.
currency and dollar-denominated investments as a "safe
haven." Yesterday, the dollar's initial climb was
exaggerated. Many traders and investors, who had sold dollars
in expectation that the currency would keep falling, began
scrambling to buy them back either to cut losses or to lock
in profits. Those purchases, in turn, triggered so-called
stop-loss orders -- instructions that traders, investors and
corporations leave with banks to buy or sell currencies at
specific levels -- driving the dollar further upward.
   "It kept going as each market opened; each market had to
have a chance to react to the invasion," said Ian Spence,
chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Eventually, however, traders ended up holding more dollars
than they wanted to, said Mr. Spence, "and following the
invasion, nothing else really happened: The U.S. didn't
declare war; Russia didn't declare war." Moreover, Iraq's
embassy in Washington said the invasion forces might withdraw
from Kuwait in a few weeks. As a consequence, traders and
others spent the rest of the U.S. trading day undoing some of
their previous purchases.
   Roberto Bianchi, a first vice president at Union Bank of
Switzerland in Zurich, said, "At the {dollar's} higher
levels, there was selling by people who had missed the move
in the past week and looked at this as an opportunity to sell
dollars."
   Meanwhile, traders began reassessing the consequences of
higher oil prices that would result from Iraq's ability to
control roughly 20% of the world's oil reserves. "With their
strong currencies, the European economies look better
equipped to handle stronger oil prices than the U.S.
economy," said Mr. Bianchi of Union Bank. He added that
higher prices would also make it more difficult for the U.S.
to boost gasoline taxes as a means of closing the budget gap,
as has been suggested.
   The U.S. currency has been plagued by a softening economy,
lower U.S. interest rates plus rising rates abroad. Such a
combination normally reduces the dollar's allure to
international investors and speculators. In addition, the
large U.S. budget and trade deficits have hurt the dollar.
   Despite the renewed bearish dollar sentiment, the yen
remained relatively weak against the U.S. currency. "The yen
should be the largest loser {from higher oil prices}. The
Japanese are totally dependent on oil imports, and any
threats to supply are going to be very threatening to the
Japanese," said Jeremy Rumble, assistant chief dealer at
Royal Bank of Canada in London. Because oil is priced in
dollars, any weakness in the yen further increases petroleum
costs to Japanese buyers and adds to Japanese inflation,
which the Bank of Japan is already concerned about.
   Some traders contended that while continental European
countries and Japan could withstand higher oil prices better
than the U.S. -- because their economies are more buoyant --
an actual cut in supply would hurt them more and also their
currencies.
   "Although the U.S. is a 50% importer," that's much less
than most of Continental Europe and Japan imports, said Mr.
Rumble. "The mark, yen and Swiss franc will be hurt." By
contrast, the dollar and sterling would benefit. Britain as
well as Norway control oil reserves in the North Sea.
   Mr. Veit of Brown Brothers added that with West German
production labor costs equal to $19.89 an hour compared with
$14.88 in the U.S., "the mark is an overvalued currency."
   Furthermore, "the potential impact of inflation is going
to be a lot worse in Japan and Germany, particularly in
Japan, where you also have a weak yen," said Mr. Veit. At
current exchange rates and with Brent North Sea oil at $25 a
barrel, he said that the cost of a barrel of oil in yen terms
will be 50% higher than its 1989 average. That compares with
a 37% rise for U.S., a 22% boost for Britain and only 18% for
West Germany.
   Nonetheless, "the fact remains that the U.S. economy is
still fundamentally weak. There are a lot of fundamentals
that argue for a weaker dollar, and those just don't go away
because there's a war in the Middle East," said Mr. Spence of
Manufacturers Hanover. "We can pretend today never happened.
We had this one-day blowout; we're back to basics."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $376.80 an ounce, up $3.50. Estimated
volume was a heavy 6.5 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$374.95 an ounce.

   OIL PRICES SOARED and stock and bond markets tumbled
world-wide in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Crude
prices rose as much as $3.50 a barrel and some analysts
forecast a $30 price. Oil and defense stocks rallied but most
issues sank on fears that costly petroleum will drag down the
economy. The Dow Jones industrials fell 34.66 points, and
Tokyo stocks plunged. The dollar surged against the yen, but
gained little against the mark. Gold prices rose.

   The Rise and Fall
   Of Family Incomes
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   FOR THREE out of four Americans, median family income rose
or fell at least 5% during 1985 and 1986. For one out of
three, the change was big enough to move them to a different
income quintile.
   In a new study, the Census Bureau divided the U.S. into
five equal-sized family income groups, with each quintile
comprising roughly 45 million Americans (the number grows
each year with the population). At the end of 1986,
two-thirds were in the same relative position that they had
been in at the beginning of 1985.
   Of the one-third that changed quintiles, 18% moved to a
lower quintile, and 16% moved up to a higher one. (The upward
and downward moves don't necessarily balance because of
population additions and subtractions during the study
period.)
   Young people were most likely to move to a different
income quintile. Nineteen percent of 18- to 24-year-olds
moved up, and 20% moved down. Elderly people had the most
stable incomes. Only 8% of those age 65 or older moved to a
higher income quintile, and 16% moved down.
   Being at the top -- or bottom -- doesn't mean staying
there. One out of four people who were in the top income
quintile in 1985 had fallen to a lower quintile in 1986.
Likewise, 18% of those who started at the bottom moved up.
                                                                                                       

   Roles in the Home
   Can Vary Over Time
                                                                                                       

   AGE AND SEX have a lot to do with people's family roles.
   Young adults have the greatest variety of household roles.
Thirty-nine percent of young men age 18 to 34 head their own
families, while 3% are married to family heads. The
designation "head of household" was self-defined by the
people surveyed in a Census Bureau study.
   For young women, the situation is reversed. Fourteen
percent head families, while 44% are spouses of heads.
Thirty-one percent of young men live with their parents, 5%
live with other relatives, and 23% don't live in families at
all (most of them live alone). Since so many young women are
spouses, only 23% live with mom and dad, and 3% with other
relatives; 15% don't live in a family.
   By middle age, 73% of men are family heads. Five percent
of men ages 35 to 54 are spouses of heads, and 6% live with
parents or other relatives. The share living alone or with
nonrelatives is down to 16%. Two-thirds of middle-aged women
are spouses, and 19% head families. Four percent live in some
other relative's household, and 11% live outside of a family
group.
   Men's head-of-household status peaks in the mature years.
Fully 76% of men age 55 or older head families. Four percent
are spouses of heads, 4% live with other relatives, and 16%
don't live in families. For older women, widowhood vies with
spousehood. Nearly half of older women are still spouses, but
34% are no longer in families (many are widows living alone).
Twelve percent of women age 55 or older head families, and 5%
live with other relatives.
                                                                                                       

   Romance in America,
   And How It Pans Out
                                                                                                       

   ONE DIVORCE occurs for every two marriages in the U.S.,
but this doesn't mean that half of people are divorced.
   A Census Bureau report shows that 8% of Americans age 15
or older are currently divorced. Seven percent are widowed,
26% haven't been married and 59% are married (including 2%
who are separated and 1% who have a spouse absent for other
reasons, such as military duty).
   It takes two to marry, but men are more likely than women
to be married, 58% vs. 53%. This is because there are more
women than men in the population, especially at the top end
of the age spectrum. Twelve percent of women are widows,
while only 3% of men are widowers.
   Since the male population is slightly younger than the
female population, men are more likely than women to be
single. Thirty percent of men have never married, compared
with 23% of women. The difference in age may also explain why
9% of women are divorced, compared with less than 7% of men.
Also, because the married category includes remarriages, and
because men are more likely to get remarried, that leaves
fewer of them in the divorce pool.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   ONLY ONE out of five Americans trust the way insurance
companies collect and use personal information about
customers. A Louis Harris study on consumer attitudes
regarding privacy issues, sponsored by Equifax Inc. of
Atlanta, found that hospitals are most trusted to use
personal data responsibly, followed by the Census Bureau and
the Social Security Administration. Consumers are most
distrustful of direct-marketing companies; only 6% think that
such businesses collect and use information about people in a
responsible way. . . . College students are busy people.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 87% of the 1.3
million part-time college students enrolled in the fall of
1989 were working, and another 4% were looking for work.
Among the nearly seven million full-time college students,
46% had jobs and 7% were looking for them. . . . Mexican food
has gone mainstream, with 41% of homemakers buying the
fixings for it in food stores. According to Mediamark
Research of New York, college-educated women, people under
age 45 and working parents are most likely to buy taco
shells, nachos and other Mexican foods. Mediamark also finds
that light beer drinkers are better-educated and more
affluent than the average regular beer drinker.

   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. affirmed its
current ratings on $21 billion of RJR Nabisco Inc. debt,
despite RJR's plans to overhaul its balance sheet.
   The rating firm also assigned a below-investment-grade
rating, B-3, to the $1.8 billion of convertible preferred
stock RJR plans to issue as part of its $6.9 million
refinancing.
</LP>

   Moody's, which has generally rated RJR's bonds below the
ratings given them by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., said RJR's
recapitalization should favorably impact the food and tobacco
giant's capital structure over the long term. However, it
said potential increases in sales and excise taxes at the
federal and state levels could hamper RJR's ability to boost
its free cash flow from raising cigarette prices in the U.S.
   Moody's said its existing ratings on RJR's debt, most of
which are below investment grade, or junk, "continue to
accurately reflect" the risks RJR faces.

   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency, in a
policy switch, said it wouldn't oppose legislation aimed at
limiting the liability of banks and thrifts for environmental
cleanups on foreclosed properties.
   But an EPA official, testifying before a House Energy and
Commerce Subcommittee, said the agency will try to craft a
regulation in the next few weeks that would make legislation
unnecessary.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James Strock, EPA assistant administrator for enforcement,
said the regulation would clarify EPA's opinion that under
the 1980 Superfund law, financial institutions are liable for
environmental cleanups of a borrower's property only if they
were involved in operating the property. Financial
institution trade groups are fearful that some recent court
decisions have expanded that liability.
   Congress currently is considering legislation that would
more broadly exempt banks and thrifts from environmental
liability, but the EPA said it had concerns about such
"blanket immunity." Nevertheless, Mr. Strock said the
administration wouldn't oppose legislation that is "narrowly
focused on the lender-liability issue" and that still
required banks to consider environmental liability in making
loans.
   The issue is particularly sensitive now, while the
government is taking over hundreds of ailing thrifts and
assuming responsibility for their properties. Officials of
the main bailout agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., said
they have identified about 300 properties on which the agency
may have some liability. Mr. Strock said the EPA is
discussing the issue with the RTC.

   LOS ANGELES -- Heritage Entertainment Inc. said it
received a proposal "for a capital investment" and
"restructuring" from an investment group including
Adelson-Baumgarten Productions, Braintree Partners and
East-West Capital Associates.
   Heritage, a maker of low-budget films, wouldn't provide
any details about the proposal or the potential investors.
Heritage said that a committee of its board is considering
the proposal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Heritage
shares closed yesterday at $1.625, off 25 cents. The
announcement came before the start of trading.
   On Wednesday, the company said that the committee
recommended rejection of a proposal from Roger Corman,
president of Concorde/New Horizons Corp., a closely held film
production company specializing in low-budget horror movies,
and his longtime associate, Brad Krevoy.
   Heritage also said it tentatively agreed with City
National Bank to extend the company's revolving credit
agreement to Nov. 1 from last Tuesday. The commitment amount
was reduced to $12.5 million from $15 million.
   Last week, Heritage said it expected to post "significant
losses" for its year ended March 31 because of its
re-evaluation of certain unamortized film costs. In fiscal
1989, Heritage reported losses of $5.6 million.

   IRAQI TROOPS SEIZED control of Kuwait after two weeks of
threats.
   Iraq's President Hussein, saying his forces entered at the
request of a group that overthrew the government, warned, "We
will turn Kuwait into a graveyard if any outside power
intervenes." The State Department called the coup report
"patent fraud." Kuwait's leader fled to Saudi Arabia as Iraqi
forces occupied the capital's government buildings and
reportedly moved south toward oil installations. U.S.
officials said the Iraqis took a group of American oil
workers to an unknown site. Diplomats said over 200 Kuwaitis
were killed or wounded.

   MONTREAL -- Pierre Jeanniot, president and chief executive
officer of Air Canada, resigned unexpectedly.
   Air Canada said Mr. Jeanniot, 57 years old, decided to
take early retirement effective immediately. The airline said
Claude Taylor, 65, chairman, will assume Mr. Jeanniot's
duties for the time being. An Air Canada spokesman said there
isn't a timetable for choosing a successor to Mr. Jeanniot
but added that "it is a priority." Through a spokesman Mr.
Jeanniot and Mr. Taylor declined to comment.

   The spokesman said Mr. Jeanniot "felt it was time to take
early retirement."
   Mr. Jeanniot was considered a likely successor to Mr.
Taylor as chairman. A 35-year veteran of the airline, Mr.
Jeanniot was named chief operating officer in 1983 and
president and chief executive in 1984.
   Air Canada, the country's largest airline, was a
government-owned corporation until recently. It was
privatized in two steps in 1988 and 1989. Since privatization
the airline has been putting emphasis on developing its
international operations, expanding service in Europe and
Asia. It also wants to increase service in the U.S. market.
   Possible internal candidates for Mr. Jeanniot's job
include Leo Desrochers, executive vice-president, marketing,
an analyst said. One possible outside candidate is Donald
Carty, an executive at AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit,
the analyst added. Mr. Carty was president of a predecessor
company of PWA Corp.'s Canadian Airlines International unit,
Air Canada's main competitor. Mr. Desrochers and Mr. Carty
couldn't be reached for comment.

   WICHITA, Kan. -- Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co. said its board
recommended that shareholders reject the $27-a-share, or
about $857 million, hostile tender offer launched last month
by Kansas City Power &amp; Light Inc.
   The utility's response wasn't unexpected; earlier this
week, it filed suit to, among other things, block its
unwanted suitor from looking at its holder list.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric said its financial adviser, Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., considered the offer price inadequate.
Directors cited reservations about the "many conditions"
Kansas City P&amp;L placed on its offer, and the "many months,
perhaps more than a year, that could be required in
attempting to satisfy those conditions, if indeed they can
all be satisfied."
   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric said the offer "doesn't reflect the
values inherent in the company," and "raises substantial and
serious legal questions and numerous uncertainties under
federal and state statutes." Kansas City P&amp;L has said its bid
is in "full compliance with all applicable laws."
   The two neighboring utilities already jointly own 94% of a
big nuclear plant. Kansas City P&amp;L launched its unusual
hostile bid after repeated overtures for a friendly deal
failed.
   Kansas City P&amp;L said yesterday it believes the bid price
is "full and fair." It added, "We continue to emphasize our
strong desire to achieve a negotiated transaction."

   Benefits-Law Violation Found in Layoffs

   A federal appeals court ruled that Continental Can Co.'s
dismissal of workers approaching qualification for two
pension plans violated the federal statute regulating
employee benefits known as the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.
   The Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia
upheld a lower court order barring the Norwalk, Conn.,
company from continuing the practice in the future.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers said the case could affect thousands
of workers and cost Continental millions of dollars.
Continental is now a subsidiary of Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., a
construction company based in Omaha, Neb. A lawyer for Kiewit
could not be reached for comment.
   The class action suit was filed in 1983 by four former
steelworkers at Continental plants in Passaic, N.J., and
Chicago. The suit alleges that Continental implemented a plan
at its 46 plants to fire employees before they reached the
so-called "Magic Number," a combination of the workers' age
and years of service that qualified them for layoff benefits.
The benefits were adopted under a collective bargaining
agreement reached with the United Steelworkers of America,
AFL-CIO, in 1977.
   Continental has argued that it began laying off workers in
the 1970s due to adverse economic conditions in the steel can
industry. The company says that its actions do not violate
ERISA and that few of the plaintiffs were close to qualifying
for the benefits when they were laid off.
   Trials in the case are proceeding plant by plant. The
current decision involves the St. Louis plant, which produced
food, beverage and general packaging cans and employed the
largest number of plaintiffs in the case.
   In June 1989, a lower court found that 315 St. Louis
workers had been victims of Continental's plan and could seek
monetary damages against the company. George L. Priest, a
professor at Yale Law School, was appointed by the court to
handle those damage claims, which are still pending and can
be appealed later by Continental.
   The plaintiffs are also seeking damages under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO.
Those claims are scheduled to be tried in April 1991.
   The appeals panel found that Continental failed to prove
that, absent the plan, the workers at the St. Louis plant
would have been fired anyway. But the panel did find that the
lower court erred by precluding Continental from making the
same defense at future trials involving the other plants. In
order for those workers to collect damages, the panel wrote,
they must show that Continental's plan was implemented at
their plant and led to their layoff.
   Edwin C. Thomas, a lawyer for Continental with the Chicago
firm of Bell, Boyd &amp; Lloyd, said the decision could affect
other companies with similar collective bargaining
arrangements. "What this means is that companies would be
operating at risk if they considered the cost of this layoff
benefit in any way in taking management actions. That is an
enormous change in business practices not anticipated by
Congress when they passed ERISA."
   But plaintiffs' lawyers said that under ERISA employers
would still be free to consider costs when designing pension
plans and to change them if they prove too expensive. "But it
should be done across the bargaining table," says Dan
McIntyre, a solo practitioner in Falmouth, Maine, who is
representing the plaintiffs. "You can't do it in an
underhanded way by pretending a benefit exists but making
sure people don't get it."

   CONGRESSMAN INDICTED for tax evasion, embezzlement from
HUD project.
   A federal grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., charged Rep. Floyd
Flake (D., N.Y.) with 17 counts of conspiracy, fraud, tax
evasion, and filing false returns and financial statements.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney in Brooklyn said the congressman
and his wife failed to report $141,700 in income from 1983 to
1987 -- including $75,000 embezzled from a senior citizens
home and $66,700 in personal expenses paid by the Allen
A.M.E. Church, where Mr. Flake is pastor.
   Mr. Flake, 45 years old, issued a statement saying he and
his wife are innocent and that they expect to be acquitted.
His wife, Margarett, was charged with nine counts. "The
prosecutor is attempting to substitute his judgment on how a
church should manage its affairs and how a pastor should
fulfill his special duties in an inner city, minority
community," Mr. Flake said in his statement.
   Some of the charges involve an $11 million senior-citizens
home that the Allen church built in 1981 under Mr. Flake's
leadership. The center was largely paid for with a grant from
the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department, and its
day-to-day operations are paid for primarily with HUD
subsidies. Rep. Flake, elected in 1981, became pastor at the
6,000-member church in Queens in 1976.
   The Flakes are accused of misappropriating money from the
home by having the church overbill the project for
transportation costs and then pocketing the excess amount.

   PRIVACY OF CORDLESS phone conversations is protected in
New York.
   A state appellate court in Manhattan ruled that New York's
eavesdropping law prohibits the government from intentionally
listening in on such conversations, which are broadcast over
radio waves and can be easily monitored.
   The decision grants greater protection than federal courts
have provided to cordless-phone users. The U.S. Supreme Court
earlier this year declined to hear an appeal of a lower
court's ruling that citizens have no right to expect that
their conversations on such phones will be private. Lower
courts also have ruled that the federal law against
unauthorized wiretapping doesn't apply to cordless phones.
   "This is another example of where New York courts are
becoming more protective of individual rights than the
federal courts," said Arthur Eisenberg, legal director of the
New York Civil Liberties Union.
   In the appeals court case, a man was convicted of drug
possession after an off-duty police officer reported
overhearing suspicious conversations through his cordless
phone at home. The officer determined that the conversations
were coming from a nearby apartment, and he gave prosecutors
tapes of what he heard.
   While ruling that cordless-phone calls are protected under
New York law, the appeals court upheld the defendant's
conviction, ruling that enough additional evidence was
gathered independent of the eavesdropping.
   Ronald L. Kuby, who with attorney William M. Kunstler
represented the defendant, said he plans to appeal. "The
whole case got started on the basis of this illegal
eavesdropping," Mr. Kuby said.

   SENATE COMMITTEE warns nominees to quit discriminatory
clubs.
   The Judiciary Committee unanimously approved a resolution
declaring that it considers it "inappropriate" for nominees
for federal bench or Justice Department posts to belong to
clubs that discriminate on the basis of race, color,
religion, sex, disability or national origin. Such
memberships have been the subject of debate in a number of
recent confirmation hearings, including those of Supreme
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and John Dunne, the Justice
Department's civil rights chief.
   The resolution, sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.,
Mass.) isn't binding, however, and doesn't require that a
nominee who belongs to a discriminatory organization
automatically be rejected by the committee. Continued
membership in such clubs is an "important factor senators
should consider in evaluating nominees," the resolution
states. There also is a loophole excusing nominees who "are
actively engaged in bona fide efforts to eliminate the
discriminatory practices" in a club to which they belong.
   Despite these qualifications, civil rights advocates
praised the committee's action. The Kennedy resolution "will
contribute significantly to breaking down one of the most
pernicious barriers to the advancement of women and
minorities," the Alliance for Justice, a liberal advocacy
group in Washington said.
   In an aside, the resolution urges lawmakers to get their
own house in order. "So as to promote a consistent policy on
this issue," it states, "any senator belonging to such a club
should resign."

   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Northeast Utilities said it and the
committees representing investors and creditors of Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire agreed to extend to Sept. 30 the
target date for the first step of Northeast Utilities'
proposed $2.3 billion acquisition of PS New Hampshire.
   Northeast Utilities, based in Hartford, Conn., is
currently managing PS New Hampshire, which has been operating
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code since 1988. Under
Chapter 11, a company can continue operating while protected
from creditors' claims.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the bankruptcy reorganization plan, PS New Hampshire
will replace its existing financial obligations with new debt
and preferred and common stock. Northeast Utilities had
expected to complete the refinancing by Aug. 1.
   The reorganization plan, under which Northeast Utilities
will ultimately acquire PS New Hampshire has already been
approved by shareholders, creditors and the federal
bankruptcy court.
   Northeast Utilities said the delay in the target date for
the refinancing was needed primarily to assess appeals that
may be filed as a result of the New Hampshire Public
Utilities Commission's approval last month of a rate plan
filed in connection with the reorganization.
   Parties to the rate case have 20 days to ask that the
commission reconsider its decision and the commission has 10
days to respond. If the commission denies requests for
reconsideration, the parties have 30 days to appeal to the
state supreme court.
   If the rate plan approval is appealed in court, Northeast
Utilities said a further delay of the reorganization could
occur.
   Final federal regulatory approval of the acquisition of PS
New Hampshire is expected by late spring.

   Help-Wanted Ads
   Post Decline for June

   NEW YORK -- Help-wanted advertising continued its steady
decline, slipping in June to its lowest level since the
mid-1980s.
   But the Conference Board, which compiles the advertising
index, said it was optimistic that help-wanted advertising
will pick up in the second half as the labor market improves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The help-wanted index fell to 133 from May's 134 and from
a year-earlier 147. The index, a seasonally adjusted
indicator of hiring plans, uses 1967 as a base of 100.
   The independent business research group said it projects a
sustained growth of at least 2% in the gross national product
in the second half, which is expected to boost the job growth
rate, and in turn, advertising for jobs.
   "I'm not looking for a huge bounce back, but rather a
subdued one," said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the
Conference Board.
   Still, that's good news for job-seekers who have seen
help-wanted ads steadily decline. The index in October
reached a high of 150, but now is at its lowest point since
1985. The index is compiled from surveys of advertising
volume in 51 major newspapers every month. However, the
Conference Board noted that 37% of the newspapers reported
rising want-ad volume, compared with a revised 22% in May and
24% in June 1989.
   Much of the improvement in the job market is expected to
come from growth in export-driven industries in the second
half, Mr. Goldstein said. "And it remains a feature of this
outlook that the turnaround is likely to show up earliest in
the Western labor markets and then sweep eastward."
   The Conference Board said ad volume rose modestly in four
regions while five regions had declines. Ad volume increased
in the West South Central region, 1.7%; South Atlantic, 0.8%;
New England, 0.5%; and Mountain region, 0.4%.

   Student-Loan Guarantor Claims U.S.
   Blocked Attempts to Refuse Risky Loans

<LP>
   The U.S. Department of Education blocked several attempts
by a troubled student-loan guarantor to stop accepting
high-risk loans that later defaulted, the chairman of the
guarantee concern said.
   Richard C. Hawk, chairman and founder of Higher Education
Assistance Foundation, also said that pressures from
BankAmerica Corp. and the Education Department to settle the
bank's claims on HEAF for defaults in a $565 million loan
portfolio helped precipitate HEAF's financial crisis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't immediately clear how much exposure -- if any --
BankAmerica has as lender of record, as a result of HEAF's
inability to pay on the claims.
   Peter Magnani, a BankAmerica spokesman, said any
"suggestion that BankAmerica is responsible for HEAF's
problems is false." Mr. Magnani said the Education Department
recently determined that all but $100 million of the
portfolio in question qualified for reimbursement from HEAF.
Mr. Magnani said that BankAmerica doesn't believe it is
liable for any claims HEAF can't pay, although the matter of
liability is still subject to a legal dispute.
   An Education Department spokeswoman said HEAF's proposals
to cut back its guarantees weren't allowable under federal
law.
   Mr. Hawk, who will give testimony today to a congressional
subcommittee about HEAF's troubles, said in an interview that
HEAF made repeated attempts from 1987 on to curb its loan
guarantees to students at for-profit trade schools. These
students' high default rates are raising costs and may lead
to curbs in the $51 billion federal student loan program,
which is also the largest source of financial aid for college
tuition.
   Mr. Hawk said his proposals to limit HEAF's exposure to
losses from the BankAmerica portfolio also were rebuffed.
HEAF claims that irregularities, including poor collection
attempts, disqualify all, or most, of the BankAmerica
portfolio from repayment under the loan program. BankAmerica
holds the portfolio as trustee, and has said in the past that
the company it hired to service the loans botched the
collection process.
   "I am a little bit frustrated that there is no
institutional memory" at the Education Department, said Mr.
Hawk. "The difficulty I have with the Department of Education
{people} is that they express surprise and amazement that
we'd have these arrangements {to make trade-school
guarantees}, but when we tried to do something about it, they
wouldn't let us."
   HEAF, a not-for-profit corporation based in Overland Park,
Kan., is guarantor for about $9 billion in student loans.
After declaring two weeks ago that HEAF is having "serious
financial problems," the Bush administration has been working
on a rescue plan aimed at maintaining confidence in the loan
program.
   HEAF "made some errors in judgment" in evaluating the
risks of guaranteeing so many loans for trade-school tuition,
Mr. Hawk acknowledged. He said HEAF's current cash-reserve
position is "about a negative $100 million" as the result of
default claims on these and other loans. HEAF is obligated to
pay lenders 100% when students default, but is receiving only
80% in repayment from the federal government because of a
high loan default rate in HEAF's portfolio.
   When it began to realize it had a serious problem in 1987,
Mr. Hawk says, HEAF changed its loan fee-structure to
discourage trade students and also required that students
from high-default schools have a co-signer for their loans.
The Education Department, he said, objected to the rate
structure and told HEAF it couldn't require co-signers under
federal law. The department has since said that co-signers
might be a good idea. HEAF kept its altered rate structure in
place.
   In early 1988, HEAF proposed canceling guarantee
agreements with high-default schools and "seven or eight"
banks generating high volumes of trade-school paper,
according to Mr. Hawk. Again, Mr. Hawk says the Education
Department overruled him, saying the banks and schools could
be cut off only through administrative proceedings, and only
then if they were guilty of program violations.
   Although many trade schools and their owners since have
been convicted or charged with defrauding students, Mr. Hawk
says such transgressions weren't known to HEAF at the time,
so proceedings weren't pursued. Students remain in default
even when they were fraud victims.
   The Education Department ultimately allowed HEAF to drop
out of 18 states in July 1988; that has curbed its overall
guarantee volume. Had HEAF been successful in stemming
trade-school lending from early 1987, Mr. Hawk said, it would
have avoided insuring $1.5 billion in paper currently
defaulting at a 50% rate.
   Default claims paid by HEAF have been about $750 million
in the fiscal nine months ended June 30. They were $751
million in the year ended last Sept. 30, and $548 million in
the prior year. Mr. Hawk also disclosed that HEAF owes the
federal government $55 million that it is currently unable to
pay, mostly for advances granted by the government against
future claims.
   One of Mr. Hawk's biggest problems is a dispute over
default liability involving HEAF, the government, San
Francisco-based BankAmerica and HEAF's largest creditor,
Student Loan Marketing Association. Also with an interest in
the dispute are New York's Citicorp, seven Japanese banks and
one Dutch concern, all of which issued letter-of-credit
guarantees as additional security for the loans BankAmerica
holds as trustee.
   The loans were sold and repackaged into bonds. The
letter-of-credit banks have acknowledged at least $350
million in payments to bondholders to cover students'
defaults. The letter-of-credit banks have also sued
BankAmerica, alleging it is liable for their losses.
   Mr. Hawk said HEAF this year has rejected $85 million in
BankAmerica claims because it doesn't regard them as
legitimate. "We're shipping them back in boxes," he said.
   An Education Department determination that BankAmerica was
entitled to refunds from HEAF, Mr. Hawk said, was reached
without HEAF's assent and gave BankAmerica special exemptions
to loan-program rules.
   Mr. Hawk proposed to solve the problem by merging with
another loan guarantor that qualified for 100% federal
reimbursement, which would provide resources to pay the bank.
The Education Department rejected this solution.

   ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. -- Charles R. Shoemate, president
of CPC International Inc. was elected to the added post of
chief executive officer, succeeding James R. Eiszner, who
will continue as chairman of the board.
   Mr. Eiszner, who is 62 years old and has been undergoing
cancer treatment, said the change is part of the food
products company's "succession plan and is being made at this
time to continue the orderly transition of the company's
leadership."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The appointment of 50-year-old Mr. Shoemate was widely
expected but not this soon, some analysts said, adding that
Mr. Eiszner's bout with cancer may have precipitated the
move.
   As the new chief executive, Mr. Shoemate isn't expected to
sway from Mr. Eiszner's business strategy. "The goals of CPC
are fairly well established," said Lawrence Adelman, analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds. "The focus is going to be on
developing its international packaged food business."
   CPC, with sales of $5.1 billion in 1989, sells brands such
as Hellmann's and Best Foods mayonnaise, Skippy peanut
butter, Mazola corn oil, Thomas's English muffins and Knorr
Soups. It also is a major corn refiner.
   In an interview yesterday, Mr. Shoemate said his challenge
will be to "keep CPC following the strategy that was set by
Mr. Eiszner." He referred to the transition as a "smooth
passing of the baton," and noted that Mr. Eiszner had been
steadily taking a less active role in the running of the
company.
   Mr. Shoemate, who, beginning in 1962, has spent most of
his career with CPC, rose through the ranks, eventually
heading CPC's Canadian operations in 1981. He served as
president of CPC's corn refining unit in 1987, before being
appointed president of the parent in 1988.

   NEW YORK -- The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
plans to name Stanley Brezenoff, a former New York City
deputy mayor, as its next executive director.
   The Port Authority said Mr. Brezenoff is subject to
approval by the bi-state agency's 12 commissioners, who may
consider his appointment at their next scheduled public
meeting Thursday. He would succeed Stephen Berger, who
resigned last month after five years as Port Authority
executive director. Mr. Brezenoff, 52 years old, currently
senior program adviser at the Commonwealth Fund, a New
York-based health care foundation, declined to comment until
the commissioners consider his nomination.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Local transportation officials said Mr. Brezenoff earned a
reputation for consensus building as first deputy mayor in
the Koch administration. Previously, he was president of the
city's Health and Hospitals Corp. and a program officer at
the Ford Foundation. He is a "skillful diplomat who knows the
transportation field," said Robert Kiley, chairman of New
York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, on whose board
Mr. Brezenoff has served since 1985.
   Mr. Brezenoff, if approved for the $170,000-a-year job,
would face many challenges. He must secure desperately needed
funds to continue the big modernization of the Port
Authority's airports, river crossings, rail facilities and
cargo docks started by Mr. Berger.
   The rebuilding program lately has been stalled by the
slowdown in New York's regional economy and the Port
Authority's failure last year to win approval for a boost in
trans-Hudson bridge and tunnel tolls and rail fares. Critics
blamed the defeat on Mr. Berger's decision to announce plans
for the increases without first securing support from the
governors of New York and New Jersey.

   LOS ANGELES -- Times Mirror Co. is expected to announce
that it purchased a 50% interest in La Opinion, one of the
nation's largest Spanish-language newspapers.
   A spokeswoman for Times Mirror, which publishes The Los
Angeles Times and other newspapers, said last night that she
couldn't confirm the report. La Opinion is based in Los
Angeles.

   The Los Angeles Times already publishes a monthly
Spanish-English section that circulates in Spanish-speaking
neighborhoods. Newspaper executives had been rumored to be
considering making the section weekly.
   Besides the Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror publishes
Newsday and New York Newsday, the Baltimore Sun newspapers,
the Hartford (Conn.) Courant, the (Allentown, Pa.) Morning
Call, the (Stamford, Conn.) Advocate and Greenwich (Conn.)
Time. Times Mirror also has interests in cable television,
book publishing and other businesses.
   La Opinion was founded Sept. 16, 1926, Mexico's
independence day, by Ignacio Lozano Sr. and has become one of
the largest and one of the most financially successful
Spanish-language dailies in the U.S. Ignacio Lozano Jr.
serves as chairman and editor in chief, while his son and
daughter, Jose Ignacio Lozano and Monica Lozano Centanino,
serve as publisher and managing editor, respectively.
   Jose Lozano did not immediately respond to telephone calls
late Thursday.
   La Opinion's circulation is about 100,000, nearly all of
which is sold on newsstands. Over the years, it has broadened
its coverage beyond the Mexican-American community to serve
the growing Central American community in the Los Angeles
area.
   According to internal Times projections, Southern
California's Hispanic population will swell from about 29% of
the region's population currently to 40% by 2010.

   WASHINGTON -- A compromise designed to resolve the
regulatory dispute over commodities regulation could be
facing trouble after a key senator said he was considering
backing away from the accord.
   The compromise agreement, aimed at settling a squabble
over stock-index futures regulation, has gotten "bogged down"
as staff members try to work out the details of the plan,
said Sen. Christopher Bond, who has been a catalyst of the
compromise.

   The Missouri Republican said that if details of the
compromise can't be reached among Senate aides drafting the
legislation, he would withdraw his support for the agreement
and back the original proposal put forth by the Bush
administration. That plan would shift regulatory authority
for stock-index futures to the Securities and Exchange
Commission from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   As currently discussed, the compromise would leave
stock-index futures oversight with the CFTC but grant
authority to the Federal Reserve Board for stock-index
futures margins, the good-faith money needed to trade the
product. Margins have become a key issue because they
determine the amount of leverage traders can use.
   "I would prefer the compromise," Sen. Bond said. "But if
we continue to bog down in the specifics, we'll have to go
back to the original proposal. We have to do something." Sen.
Bond said he probably would make his decision when the Senate
returns from its recess after Labor Day.
   Stock-index futures allow investors to bet on the movement
of a basket of stocks without buying the actual shares. They
often are cited as pushing around the stock and options
markets, which are regulated by the SEC.
