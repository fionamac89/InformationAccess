   Attorneys opposing Eagle-Picher Industries Inc.'s
controversial settlement of 175,000 asbestos claims say they
have been told that the plan may be open to renegotiation.
   The attorneys said an adviser to the federal judge
overseeing the case approached them about the possible
renegotiation. In return, the attorneys were asked to
withdraw their appeals and drop plans to ask the judge to
remove himself from the case, said Frederick Baron, an
asbestos plaintiffs' attorney in Dallas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Baron and other plaintiffs' attorneys have claimed
U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn overstepped his
authority by approving the $505 million settlement earlier
this month. They claim the judge doesn't have the power to
order a mandatory class action for cases in other
jurisdictions, and that the settlement was reached without
the participation of attorneys actually representing asbestos
victims.
   Mr. Baron said he was contacted by Leon Silverman, a
special adviser to Judge Weinstein in negotiating a recent
restructuring of the Manville asbestos personal-injury trust.
Mr. Baron said he was told by Mr. Silverman that an
arrangement could be made to renegotiate the settlement if
the attorneys dropped their challenges against Judge
Weinstein.
   "He told us maybe we could cut a better deal" with the
company, Mr. Baron said.
   As part of the proposal, Eagle-Picher would also drop a
racketeering suit it filed against Mr. Baron and two other
plaintiffs attorneys, Mr. Baron said. The suit accuses the
attorneys of "malicious prosecution" in an effort to put
Eagle-Picher into involuntary bankruptcy earlier this month.
   Mr. Silverman confirmed that he has spoken to the
attorneys about the Eagle-Picher litigation, but said he was
acting as a volunteer. "No one has invited me," he said.
"This is not being done under the aegis of Judge Weinstein."
   Mr. Silverman declined to comment on what he suggested to
the attorneys, and he stressed that he has no official role
in the Eagle-Picher case. The Eagle-Picher settlement and Mr.
Silverman's work on the Manville case are considered
important steps in Judge Weinstein's plan for grappling with
asbestos litigation nationwide.
   Eagle-Picher declined to comment. Judge Weinstein's office
also declined to comment.
   Mr. Baron said he isn't willing to withdraw his appeal of
the Eagle-Picher settlement. He said a motion to have Judge
Weinstein removed from the litigation may be made next week.
   Ronald Motley, another plaintiffs' attorney contacted by
Mr. Silverman, said, "It is not my practice to comment on
settlement negotiations."

   PENNSYLVANIA HIGH COURT to decide if caller ID service
invades privacy.
   The state supreme court will be the first in the nation to
decide whether the service, which allows customers to view
phone numbers of incoming calls, should be banned on privacy
grounds. The outcome will have broad implications; phone
companies across the country are lining up to offer the
service to residential customers.
   Last May, a Pennsylvania appeals court ruled that Bell of
Pennsylvania's Caller ID Service violated state wiretap laws
and constitutional provisions protecting privacy. Ruling in
favor of the state Consumer Advocate's office and privacy and
civil rights groups, the court overturned a decision by the
state Public Utilities Commission allowing the Bell Atlantic
Corp. unit to offer the service, so long as certain agencies,
including police and shelters for abused women and children,
were able to block transmission of their numbers.
   The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled that the service
violates the state's ban on so-called trap and trace devices
and said the service is illegal whether or not customers can
block transmission.
   The supreme court is not expected to rule before next
spring.

   FOUR MEN CONVICTED of laundering drug money in
jewelry-store scheme.
   A federal jury in Los Angeles convicted the four men of
laundering $350 million in Colombian drug profits through
companies doing business in the city's jewelry district.
Charges were still pending against a fifth defendant
yesterday.
   Three of the defendants, brothers Nazareth and Vahe
Andonian, and Juan Carlos Seresi, were also found guilty of
conspiring to launder money in the scheme, which involved
shipments of drug money to jewelry shops owned by Messrs.
Andonian and others. The money was then deposited in
California banks. Subsequently, funds were wired to South
America. The fourth man convicted was gold dealer Raul Silvio
Vivas, the alleged mastermind of the scheme.
   The convictions grew out of a 13-month investigation that
the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles called "the largest
drug-money laundering investigation ever conducted by U.S.
law enforcement agencies." The trial set a record as the
longest criminal trial in Los Angeles federal court.
   Attorneys for the defendants couldn't be reached for
comment.

   Andrew Frey will join the Iran-Contra special prosecutor's
office as chief appellate counsel responsible for the appeal
of John Poindexter and the continuing proceedings in the case
against Oliver North. Mr. Frey succeeds Gerard Lynch, who is
now chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's
office in Manhattan.
   Mr. Poindexter is appealing his April conviction on
charges related to the concealment of secret Reagan
administration dealings with Iran and the Nicaraguan
insurgents. Mr. North's May 1989 conviction on charges
related to the Iran-contra affair was set aside by an appeals
court in July.
   The special prosecutor is expected to appeal the North
ruling to the Supreme Court.

   FDA Plans a Nationwide Test of Milk
   For Antibiotics, Other Drug Residues

   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration said it
will launch a nationwide program in February to test the milk
supply for antibiotics and other veterinary drug residues.
   While the FDA has monitored state milk-testing programs
and conducted a few surveys of its own, this will be the
first time the agency has engaged in routine testing of milk
for illegal drug residues. But some critics challenged the
agency's claim that the new program "will add another layer
of protection for consumers."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency has been under pressure from consumer groups
and Congress to step up its surveillance of the dairy
industry since December 1989, when The Wall Street Journal
conducted a milk survey in 10 U.S. cities and reported
finding 38% of 50 skim and low-fat milk samples tainted with
antibiotics or sulfa drugs. The Journal also reported that
the testing method used by state officials, though effective
in detecting penicillin and penicillin-related drugs, was all
but blind to sulfamethazine, a suspected carcinogen banned
from agricultural use, and numerous other drugs.
   Another impetus for greater surveillance is the apparent
misuse of veterinary drugs in dairying. In a recent survey,
FDA officials found illegal drugs in 27% of some 1,800 dairy
barns they checked -- despite drug-education efforts by the
milk industry and regulatory agencies. "That's pretty
shocking," said consumer advocate Lisa Lefferts of the
Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   Under the new program, raw milk will be tested for eight
sulfa drugs, including sulfamethazine, and three tetracycline
drugs. FDA spokeswoman Bonnie Aikman said these are the drugs
"of most concern because they have been widely misused" by
dairy farmers and veterinarians.
   But critics, including Rep. Ted Weiss (D., N.Y.), weren't
impressed with the FDA plan to test five samples each week
that will be collected from milk trucks making deliveries at
250 randomly selected milk-processing plants.
   This approach "means that each processing location in the
FDA's program will be visited only once a year," complained
Mr. Weiss, chairman of the House Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources. "FDA's attempt to describe
this as a `nationwide program' is ludicrous. . . . The
subcommittee will need to examine whether the agency
purposely designed a plan that would not find any residues."
   Ms. Lefferts agreed, saying, "Testing five samples a week
isn't going to solve the problem of illegal and potentially
dangerous drugs in our milk."
   But Gerald Guest, director of the FDA's Center for
Veterinary Medicine, defended the program. "Without extra
resources, this is the best we can do in the first year," he
said. The samples "are going to give us pretty good coverage
across the country. It's a modest effort, but it's
meaningful."
   The milk samples will be collected by state officials and
tested at FDA laboratories. When violative residues are
found, the agency will alert state officials and help them
trace the source of the problem. As new analytical methods
are developed, samples will be tested for more than 11 drugs.
   The program will supplement routine state testing of raw
and processed milk for penicillins, FDA officials said. At
the same time, the agency will continue to monitor the
efforts of state regulators.
   The FDA has only done three milk surveys of its own,
beginning in 1988. In a report last month, the General
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
dismissed the surveys as statistically invalid, calling them
"snapshots in time of a small number of milk samples tested
for the presence of a small number of drug residues."
   The GAO concluded that the agency couldn't substantiate
its assertions that the nation's milk supply is safe to
drink.

   FDA Approves Du Pont Imaging Agent
   That Can Detect Heart-Attack Damage
   ----

</GV>
<LP>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new
imaging agent that can help doctors diagnose and treat the
damage caused by heart attacks without using invasive
procedures.
   The product, called Cardiolite, is an injectable chemical
tracing agent that can produce images of blood flow in the
heart when viewed under certain medical imaging cameras. It
was developed by Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del., and will be
sold by Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., a joint venture put
together earlier this year by Du Pont and Merck &amp; Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Officials at Du Pont Merck said Cardiolite may be
especially useful in helping to diagnose the exact nature of
a heart attack within hours after it occurs. Unlike other
imaging products, Cardiolite can be injected during the
attack and the blood flow can be recorded immediately, giving
a doctor an instant picture of the attack. Other techniques
can't be used until a patient's condition has been
stabilized.
   "The availability of {Cardiolite} is an important step
forward in cardiac imaging and the treatment and prevention
of heart disease," said Daniel Berman, director of nuclear
cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles. "I'm
certain it will allow many medical centers to significantly
upgrade their ability to diagnose heart problems."
   Cardiolite is composed of a chemical called sestamibi that
migrates quickly to undamaged heart muscle cells after it's
injected into the bloodstream. The product also includes a
radioisotope called technetium 99 that allows an imaging
camera to pick up the sestamibi. Thus doctors can trace the
flow of blood as it moves through undamaged portions of the
heart. They also can use the product to illuminate the
heart's pumping action, blood flow through the heart's
arteries and areas in the heart where blood can't flow
because of damage from the attack.
   Currently, such images are most often produced by cardiac
catheterization, a technique in which a thin optical wire is
threaded into the groin or arm and snaked through blood
vessels to the heart. Some doctors believe that advances in
cardiac imaging eventually may reduce the need for some
invasive catheterizations.
   Doctors also can view such damage by injecting a chemical
called thallium and tracing it with medical cameras. But
thallium doesn't produce as strong a signal as technetium 99.
"Only a handful of very specialized medical centers can
produce truly useful pictures with thallium," Dr. Berman
said. "{Cardiolite} will be much easier for most hospitals to
use."
   Thallium is used most often in a stress test that's
designed to detect if arteries carrying blood to the heart
are blocked. Du Pont is one of several companies that makes
thallium for cardiac testing. Du Pont officials said
Cardiolite is an advance over its thallium products because
thallium's radioactivity is more difficult to handle. Also,
Cardiolite is longer acting than thallium and can produce
images for four hours after being injected, while thallium
images last only 15 minutes.
   Cardiolite is one of two new cardiac imaging products
developed in recent years by scientists. Last week, the FDA
also approved a product called Cardiotec that will be
marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Cardiotec also uses
technetium 99 to light up an image, but involves a different
agent, called teboroxime, for getting to the heart muscle
cells.
   Some doctors think Cardiolite may be the more widely used
of the two products, because it lasts longer in the body,
producing images for a longer period of study.
   Cardiolite is the first new product to be marketed by the
Du Pont Merck venture. The company will market other products
developed by Du Pont's drug and diagnostics research
programs.

   Taiwan Opens

   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The government approved regulations
opening Taiwan's stock market to direct investment by foreign
institutions, and fund managers may be able to apply to
invest next week.
   The decision, which is expected to generate widespread
interest despite restrictions on capital movement and
rigorous settlement rules, opens the way for foreign
institutional investors to buy a total of $2.5 billion in
Taiwan shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Approved by a cabinet vote on Thursday, the regulations
are expected to be implemented Friday or Saturday, an
official with Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission
said. Under Taiwan law they will become effective three days
later. At that point, foreigners will be allowed to apply for
investment quotas of between $5 million and $50 million.
   The final rules differ only slightly from the draft
regulations announced in September. They retain restrictions
on capital movement that will prevent many funds from
entering the market because such limitations contravene their
trust agreements. Still, the rule that many foreigners
considered most onerous -- a period in which investment
principal must remain in Taiwan -- has been reduced to three
months from one year.
   Foreign brokers expect substantial interest in Taiwan
shares once the market opens, particularly from Hong Kong,
Japanese and British fund managers. "The response will really
be quite good," says Chris Ruffle, Taiwan representative of
S.G. Warburg Securities. "I recently did a tour, making 60
presentations in three weeks in Hong Kong, Europe and the
U.S., and was pleasantly surprised by the level of interest."
   But brokers say that investors preparing to enter the
market also are girding themselves for the arduous task of
dealing with Taiwan's settlement procedures, which are among
the most demanding in the world. The requirement that all
transactions be settled within 24 hours may prove a
logistical nightmare for fund managers halfway around the
world and may even scare off some institutions.
   The market-opening measure represents a historic step in
the government's efforts to integrate Taiwan's financial
system with global markets. Foreign investors have been able
to invest indirectly in Taiwan shares for several years
through four investment trusts that are listed on the New
York and London stock exchanges. But this will be the first
opportunity for foreign institutions to gain direct access to
the market.
   Government officials hope that foreign fund managers will
help stabilize the volatile Taiwan market by making long-term
investments in shares. But with a current market
capitalization of about $100 billion and the value of trading
averaging between 40% and 60% of that capitalization in
recent months, $2.5 billion in foreign investment isn't
likely to have much impact on the market, many brokers say.
   Among the institutions that will be permitted to apply to
invest in the market will be fund-management companies,
insurance companies, banks and pension funds. The SEC
official said that the only group that will have minimum
capital requirements will be pension funds, which will be
required to have at least $500 million under management.
   Individual funds will be limited to a 5% maximum holding
in a company, while the ceiling on total foreign investment
in a single listed concern will be 10%.

   And the Second Thing We Do,
   Let's Kill All Those Economists

   So who's to blame for the nation's economic funk? How
about lawyers?
   That's what Stephen P. Magee, a University of Texas
finance professor, argues. According to his calculations, the
average lawyer drains $1 million a year from the country's
output of goods and services. And can that add up: The
500,000 U.S. lawyers sap the economy of a half-trillion
dollars, or 10% of the country's gross national product, he
maintains.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prof. Magee contends the crux of the problem is
redistribution of wealth created by "litigation-specific
economic predation." (Read that the loss of money to a person
armed with an attorney.) This, he says, is different from
"crime" -- the loss of money to a person armed with a weapon
-- in few material respects.
   Costs of such predation, he maintains, include time wasted
fighting spurious claims; loss of potential engineers,
doctors and executives to the legal profession; and
discouragement of innovation because of excessive
product-liability litigation.
   Prof. Magee apparently isn't worried about a lawsuit. He
divulged his thesis with two co-authors in a book called
"Black Hole Tariffs and Endogenous Policy Theory" and will
refine it in another tome, "The Negative Effect of Lawyers on
the U.S. Economy."
   To support his theory, he offers a statistical study of 34
countries that compares the number of lawyers in each with
that country's GNP for the past 20 years. The analysis
reveals that GNP growth is better in countries with fewer
lawyers per capita, such as South Korea and Japan, than in
those where lawyers proliferate, including India and the U.S.
   Lawyers, naturally, dismiss Mr. Magee's conclusions as "ex
parte," i.e. one-sided. "Res ipsa loquitor," they plead, the
thing speaks for itself.
   "In the past people have resolved disputes by killing one
another in duels," says James McGurk, a Chicago-based
securities lawyer. "Is it wiser to have them defending
themselves with guns than with lawyers?" Besides, says Mr.
McGurk, litigation is the product of legislation -- and laws
are created by Congress. "In other words," he says, "this
system is the will of the people." "Prima facie," before
further examination, that might appear true, allows Mr.
Magee. Yet deeper analysis, he contends, disproves this
defense of the legal profession: Some 62% of U.S. senators
and 42% of U.S. representatives are lawyers.

   BALTIMORE -- The National Aquarium in Baltimore on
Wednesday unveiled a $35 million belated Christmas gift: a
spectacular new home for its expanded collection of six
Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and three beluga whales.
   But not everyone is celebrating.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Animal-protection groups are expressing opinions ranging
from qualms to downright anger over what they see as the new
facility's emphasis on glitz and entertainment rather than
education. And some are wondering whether it is proper to
keep marine mammals -- which are thought to be highly
intelligent -- in captivity at all. A small group of
picketers was on hand at the opening; the demonstrators said
the protests will continue.
   "Baltimore is a microcosm for a lot of the issues about
{whales and dolphins in} captivity," says Nancy Daves of the
Animal Protection Institute, based in Sacramento, Calif. The
result is increasing tensions between two groups --
supporters of aquariums and animal preservationists -- who
might otherwise have been expected to make common cause.
   Aquarium officials say the new facility -- which has a
circular tank 110 feet wide and 24 feet deep, surrounded by a
1,300-seat amphitheater and multimedia screens -- will
educate the public about how these animals behave in the wild
and the increasing dangers they face from man. "We were
incomplete in showing {visitors} the world of water," says
Nicholas Brown, the aquarium's executive director.
   Currently, three of the dolphins -- the rest of the
animals will join the show sometime in 1991 -- are featured
in presentations showcasing such abilities as tailwalking and
communication skills.
   Aquarium professionals praise the facility. "I've seen
quite a few dolphin demonstrations but this was one of the
best I've seen," says David Jenkins, deputy director of the
American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums. "I
think you are going to see people come away from the program
who will have a keener appreciation of the dolphin and whale
but also a keener appreciation of what to do to save the
marine environment in general."
   But Ben White of the Sea Shepherd Society, an
environmental-activist group, says, "These centers are
educational in entirely the wrong way. I don't buy the
argument that people who see captive whales and dolphins come
away as defenders of them."
   Paula Jewell, an official with the Humane Society of the
U.S., says, "I have mixed feelings about the show. I thought
it had the potential to be educationally useful . . . but the
Humane Society is always opposed to frivolous, entertaining
routines."
   Adding to critics' unhappiness is the fact that
Baltimore's aquarium doesn't have the best track record with
marine mammals. One of its four original bottlenose dolphins
died in the aquarium's first year and the others had to be
evacuated after developing ulcers attributed to the stressful
environment. A guest dolphin died soon after visiting in 1984
and a beluga whale contracted a fatal bacterial infection in
1989.
   In a textbook case of bad public relations, the aquarium
captured two dolphins off the Florida coast last year without
obtaining proper paperwork from that state. Despite intense
pressure, the aquarium held on to the animals: One died
within months of its capture, while the other has yet to be
removed from Florida.
   Mr. Brown says his institution has learned from past
mistakes. For example, the original dolphins were bothered by
the noise of the aquarium. Now, the tank walls are
soundproofed and the pumps and filtration system are isolated
from the exhibit so that the animals won't be bothered by
vibrations.
   But those changes haven't silenced critics. Many wonder
how the animals will do in a still tank that is 110 feet
wide, when they normally range over hundreds of miles of
ocean. All of Baltimore's dolphins and whales were born in
the wild, a situation that's distressing many involved with
animal protection.
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an
animal-rights group, has already sponsored a protest at the
aquarium, and more may be coming. "We have a problem with
aquariums in general . . . they amount to prisons for free
roaming animals," explains a spokeswoman.
   Aquarium supporters say holding some marine mammals in
captivity is vital to the survival of their brethren in the
wild. "A lot of the political support for protecting these
animals comes from the direct experience the public has of
seeing them," says Peter Tyack, associate scientist with the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

   FRANKFURT, Germany -- The cost of living in western
Germany in December was unchanged from November, the
Wiesbaden-based Federal Statistics Office said in a
preliminary report, which was mostly in line with economists'
expectations.
   Living costs in the 11 states that make up what was
formerly West Germany, however, rose 2.7% from December 1989.
The preliminary index is based on data supplied last week by
four western German states: Hesse, Bavaria,
Baden-Wuerttemburg and North Rhine-Westphalia. Final results
will be published in the middle of January, after all 11 of
these states report their price data.

   Tensions With Military Mount in South America

   SANTIAGO, Chile -- "It was just a security training
exercise," Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile's ex-dictator and
current armed forces commander-in-chief, said sheepishly. "No
troops even went out into the street."
   But as soon as he put Chile's army in a state of alert
last week, the country's democratically elected government
went into a frenzy. Top officials huddled late into the night
around President Patricio Aylwin, wondering whether the
exercises weren't really the start of a military rebellion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   They weren't -- but they were more than exercises.
Although the incident ended without a shot being fired, it
wasn't just a tempest in a tea-pot: It underlines the
lingering mistrust between armed forces and civilian
governments that reign throughout South America, testing the
solidity of the democratic revolution that swept the region
in the past few years.
   Military restlessness has appeared in several South
American countries, underscoring the difficulty of
subordinating the military to civilian governments and the
need to redefine the role of the armed forces in the
post-dictatorship, post-Cold War era, military analysts say.
While they say conditions aren't right for a military coup in
any major South American country, the threat of military
destabilization will be a permanent feature of transition
processes while governments and armed forces try to build up
mutual trust.
   Indeed, the military might be out of the presidential
palaces they once occupied, but they aren't out of the minds
of the democratically elected presidents who now sit in them.
A series of events this past month have brought the military
back into the forefront of South American political life:
   -- In Argentina, an arch-nationalistic army faction staged
its fourth -- and bloodiest -- rebellion in three years. In
what President Carlos Menem described as a coup attempt, the
mutineers seized five buildings, including armed forces
headquarters in central Buenos Aires; the short-lived
rebellion left 14 people dead and 53 wounded.
   -- In the tiny former Dutch colony of Suriname, the army
toppled elected president Ramsewak Shankar in an apparently
bloodless Christmas-day coup that makes Suriname the only
South American nation with a military regime. The coup leader
pledged to hold elections within 100 days.
   -- In Brazil, there is widespread discontent over
declining salaries and government spending cuts.
   Many analysts say a common thread runs through the
stirrings: they all are signs of the difficulties experienced
by the armed forces in adjusting to a new domestic and
international context, and of the civilian governments'
slowness in formulating new security policies.
   "Latin American armed forces have an identity problem,"
says Genaro Arriagada, vice president of Chile's Christian
Democratic party and an expert on the military. "We're going
to have to discover a new role for the armed forces, and this
isn't just a theoretical problem."
   Indeed, South America has undergone a change as dramatic
as Eastern Europe's over the past decade. Only a few years
ago, military men were in power in almost all of South
America. Armed forces were geared toward fighting internal
subversion. Border conflicts flared.
   Today, democracy is largely the rule. The external threat
of Communism has subsided, and "there is no {internal} threat
to democracy from the left," says Edgardo Boeninger, a top
adviser to Chile's President Aylwin. The idea of open borders
and economic integration is catching on throughout the
region.
   This change has stripped the military of much of their
reason for being and has required a re-evaluation of their
size and functions, analysts say. The world trend toward
disarmament and lower defense spending, combined with the
return of democracy in South America, should lead to a
smaller, professional military whose tasks could include
waging war on drugs and terrorism, patrolling South America's
vast and porous borders and helping rebuild the region's
antiquated infrastructure.
   But this redefining of the military's functions requires
efforts by both sides. "You can define the role of the armed
forces, but the armed forces may not like it," says Andres
Fontana, an Argentine sociologist specializing in the
military. "It's like cat food: it may have all the vitamins
necessary, but the cat may prefer eating fish. It takes time
to get used to a new system, new values and new roles. It
will need flexibility on both sides. We have to use this
moment productively, reintegrate and reprofessionalize the
armed forces, so that when the hard times come -- which you
have to think of in Latin America -- people don't look to the
military as an alternative and they {the military} don't see
themselves as one."
   Argentina and Chile will provide quick tests. Argentina's
Mr. Menem has been seeking to placate the military by
granting controversial amnesties to members of the armed
forces involved in human-rights abuses when they were in
power and dispatching two warships to the Persian Gulf. But
the recent rebellion shows this isn't enough. Mr. Menem is
now seeking to restructure the armed forces by concentrating
units and closing down installations, but military expert
Rosendo Fraga calls the plan "inefficient and insufficient."
   At the same time, he is grappling with the after-effects
of the recent rebellion. After first urging the death penalty
for the leaders, he told reporters yesterday he no longer
supports such severity. "There won't be any executions," he
said.
   Chile's transition is complicated by Gen. Pinochet's
continued role as commander-in-chief. The recent "exercises"
he ordered were seen as an effort to slow congressional
inquiries into alleged corruption under his former
dictatorship as well as investigations into the widespread
human-rights abuses committed under his rule. Mr. Aylwin is
playing a delicate balancing act between punishment and
maintaining stability and the next months are expected to be
tense.
   Still, analysts see signs of hope in the recent events.
The Argentine rebellion and Chilean tensions ended quickly
and a majority of the armed forces sided with the government.
Moreover, although countries like Peru, Brazil and Argentina
are going through severe economic and social problems, no one
looks to the military as an alternative.
   "The fact that there wasn't a military reaction {in those
countries} is very significant," says Mr. Arriagada. "A
decade ago, with 10% of these problems, they would have taken
power."

   TOKYO -- Hitachi Ltd., a maker of computers and
semiconductors, said it started building a plant for mass
production of 16-megabit dynamic random-access memory, or
DRAM, chips. The construction cost and the plant's expected
output weren't disclosed. One megabit is equal to one million
units of digital information.
   The plant is next to Hitachi's four-megabit DRAM chip
plant in Ibaragi Prefecture northeast of Tokyo. Construction
is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1991 and chip
production is to start in 1992, a spokesmen said. Hitachi has
already begun mass production of four-megabit chips, which
are expected to become widely used starting next year.

   Recession talk has cast a pall on the computer industry,
but some desktop-computer makers are still shining.
   Analysts say results for the December quarter will
illustrate a continued split of the industry, in which many
makers of mainframes and minicomputers post smaller gains
while makers of personal computers and workstations prosper.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., based in Maynard, Mass. -- once a
highflier that used its minicomputers to tweak the noses of
oldline makers of more expensive mainframes -- is getting
some nose-tweaking of its own by the likes of Mountain View,
Calif.-based Sun Microsystems Inc. with less expensive, fast
workstations. Thus analysts say DEC profit will drop as much
as 60% in its fiscal second quarter ending Monday.
   A big part of the problem for DEC and other companies such
as Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp., which analysts expect
to post a fourth-quarter net loss, is the rapidly growing
trend toward open systems -- computers that use standard
software such as programs written for Unix operating systems.
That hurts makers of proprietary systems -- those that run
software written only for them.
   But it's a boon for Sun and large PC makers such as
Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., which, despite recession
signs, continue to post strong gains. Analyst Bruce Lupatkin
of Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc. expects Compaq to post a 70% rise
in fourth-quarter earnings to $133 million, or $1.55 a share,
from the year-earlier $79 million, or 92 cents a share, on a
40% revenue gain to $1.1 billion from $788 million.
   Compaq's growth is outpacing other leading
desktop-computer makers mainly because of its huge presence
in the booming market for laptop and notebook computers, said
Mr. Lupatkin.
   Sun Microsystems is expected to post strong gains in
profit and revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending
Monday. Peter Rogers, an analyst with Robertson Stephens &amp;
Co., expects Sun's profit to increase 73% to $35 million, or
34 cents a share, from $20.2 million, or 23 cents a share, on
a 22% rise in revenue to $725 million from $595 million a
year earlier.
   Not all desktop makers are in the pink. Cupertino,
Calif.-based Apple Computer Inc., for instance, is expected
to post roughly flat results for its fiscal first quarter
ending Monday. Mr. Lupatkin, of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, expects
slightly lower profit of $115 million, or $1 a share, vs.
$125 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales are
expected to exceed $1.5 billion vs. $1.49 billion. For Apple
to see stronger sales, it needs to enter the laptop and
notebook market, Mr. Lupatkin says.
   Some old-line makers -- including DEC -- have bigger
problems as recession fears slow capital spending. Robert
Herwick of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, who admits he is "a rip-roaring
bear" on Digital, expects the company to post lower net
income of about $60 million, or 50 cents a share, for the
quarter, compared with $155.4 million, or $1.25 a share, a
year earlier. He expects sales of $3.1 billion vs. $3.18
billion.
   Also, Mr. Herwick says, "the shift away from proprietary
systems to Unix systems in the workstation market is costing
DEC market share." That has hurt Unisys, too, says analyst
Stephen Cohen of SoundView Financial Group. He expects Unisys
to post a net loss of $46 million, or 29 cents a share, for
the quarter on lower revenue of $2.8 billion. A year earlier,
Unisys earned $34 million, or five cents a share, on revenue
of $2.97 billion.
   Unisys is struggling because of a heavy debt load and
users defecting to open systems, Mr. Cohen says. "The old
core business is declining in profitability and the new
open-systems business they're growing to replace that with
has inherently lower margins," says Mr. Cohen.
   Spending slowdowns in the security and banking industries
have hurt Cupertino, Calif.-based Tandem Computers Inc. more
than expected, says analyst John Jones of Montgomery
Securities. He recently lowered his earnings estimates for
the company and now expects net income in its fiscal first
quarter ending Monday to fall 74% to $8 million, or seven
cents a share, from $30.7 million, or 29 cents a share, a
year earlier. He sees sales rising 4.7% to $457 million from
$436.5 million.
   A general slowdown in capital spending could be helping
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Amdahl Corp., because its
IBM-compatible mainframes are less expensive than
International Business Machines Corp.'s own machines, Mr.
Jones says. He expects Amdahl's fourth-quarter net income to
rise 49% to $62 million, or 55 cents a share, from $41.6
million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. He expects
revenue to decline to $615 million from $625.8 million,
partly because of a product transition.
   Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, meanwhile, is expected to have a
respectable fourth quarter, in part because of the success of
its new air-cooled mainframes, says Mr. Cohen of SoundView.
He expects higher net income of $2.3 billion, or $4 a share,
vs. the year-earlier $591 million, or $1.04 a share,
including a $2.42 billion pretax charge. Mr. Cohen expects
sales of $22 billion vs. $20.4 billion last year. He says
IBM's introduction of ES/9000 computers last fall spurred
sales.

   MINNEAPOLIS -- Best Buy Co., with its expanded operations
and a reduced cost structure more than offsetting a tough
selling environment, said net income for its fiscal third
quarter ended Dec. 1 jumped 47%, on a 29% increase in
revenue.
   The consumer electronics and appliance retailer warned,
however, that it may take a hefty charge against earnings in
the near future, to cover changes in an accounting
requirement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Best Buy's third-quarter net climbed in the latest quarter
to $1.3 million, or 16 cents a share, from the year-earlier
$888,000, or 11 cents a share. Revenue rose to $170.8 million
from $132.7 million.
   "Competitive conditions," such as heavy discounting in a
sluggish economic environment, worked against profit margins,
and same-store sales declined by 1%, Best Buy said. In
addition, profitability was squeezed in the latest quarter by
narrower margins at "new concept" self-service stores the
company has recently opened.
   Despite those pressures, earnings improved, "mainly due to
sales from eight new stores opened this year," as well as
lower operating expenses.
   But Best Buy cautioned that a recent decision by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board could require a charge
of $14.3 million, or $1.73 a share, in the current fiscal
year.
   The FASB's Technical Bulletin 90-I, issued this month,
requires companies to defer the initial recognition of
revenue from the sale of extended service plans, on plans
sold after Dec. 15, 1990. In general, such revenue is to be
recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the period
of the service contract, which generally runs from three to
five years.
   Currently, such contacts are recorded in their entirety in
the period in which they are sold.
   Best Buy said that if it decides to apply the provisions
of the new accounting pronouncement to existing contracts,
the move would generate the $14.3 million pretax charge; that
figure would include an approximately $14 million cumulative
effect adjustment for the prior years ended March 4, 1990,
and a charge of about $300,000, or four cents a share, for
the current year. A company official said, "I would expect
that we'll go ahead with the cumulative charge" in the
current fourth quarter.
   The company stressed that the anticipated accounting
change "has no impact on the cash flow aspects of the service
plans."
   For the nine months, Best Buy's net was $928,000, or 11
cents a share, compared with the year-earlier period's loss
of $246,000, or three cents a share. Nine-month revenue was
up 26%, to $449.1 million from $355.5 million.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Best Buy shares closed unchanged at $5.125.

   Berkeley, Calif. -- Seven years after its Paris Opera
premiere, Olivier Messiaen's monumental, five-hour-long
religious opera/oratorio, "St. Francois d'Assise," was to
have had its first full American performance in Berkeley this
holiday season, conducted by Kent Nagano. But then the Los
Angeles Philharmonic decided it wanted to do a fully staged
version (to appear first at the 1992 Salzburg Festival), and
Mr. Nagano was persuaded to yield up the rights.
   What we got instead at Berkeley were three scenes (two
hours, with intermission) taken from the gigantic eight-scene
work: "The Kiss of the Leper," "The Stigmata" and "Death and
New Life," three episodes from the saint's life, like
Giotto's murals at Assisi, set to overpowering 20th-century
music. In one of the missing episodes (which was included in
the selection Seiji Ozawa conducted at Boston and New York in
1986), St. Francis preaches to the birds, for whom the
composer wrote some of the exotic ornithological music he so
loves. The feathered brothers and sisters respond to
Francis's sermon with a 40-minute explosion of their own.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One of the reasons Mr. Messiaen's masterwork (which
resembles but surpasses his voluptuous "Turangalila Symphony"
of 1949) has been so rarely performed is that it calls for
such lavish resources. Filling every square inch of the
Zellerbach Hall stage, the Berkeley Symphony came up with the
required soloists, a chorus of 66 (the composer wanted 150),
and a total of 107 musicians. Five busy bangers on xylophone,
xylorimba, marimba, glockenspiel and vibraphone were squeezed
along the back wall. At the left, five percussionists, each
surrounded by his own cage of toys (like a mini-gamelan),
hammered, banged, chimed and rattled away at a total of 38
things. The Berkeley Symphony came up with the requisite
three Ondes Martenot, a kind of electronic sound-generator on
which the performer, seated at a tiny keyboard, can twist
single notes into strange and affecting shapes. The
composer's sister-in-law, Jeanne Loriod, flew over to help
fill out (and train) a complement of ondeurs.
   Mr. Nagano, 39, who now directs the Lyon Opera as well as
the Berkeley Symphony, knows this work well; he has been
performing and promoting Messiaen for years; he assisted Mr.
Ozawa (his onetime mentor) at the world premiere; he has
conducted the full-length "St. Francois" in both London and
Lyon. The Berkeley Symphony isn't the London Philharmonic,
and the vocal resources of both soloists and chorus (the
Pacific Mozart Ensemble) were stretched. But the grandeur,
dazzling tone colors and endless variety of the work shone
through. James Wood, as St. Francis, lacked the ability to
soften or nuance a workman-like, not particularly warm
baritone; Susan Narucki was a properly celestial angel,
singing from odd places about the hall. Stephen Guggenheim as
the angry leper and David Cox as a fellow Franciscan were
fine in lesser roles.
   But this is really the instrumentalists' show. They
generally shut up for the singers' lines, then answer them
clearly. The short choral numbers -- the voice of God, as
often as not -- are woven into the orchestral texture like
one more section or sound timbre. The music is often loud but
never ugly, listenable and tender to the senses, whether
dulcet or jangling. It pulses in short, discrete breaths that
feature and challenge different combinations of instruments
in turn; the marimba gang, the platoon of percussionists and
the shrieking, underlining ondes are almost perpetually at
work, defining the Messiaen "sound." The simple saint's life
story attains supernatural dimensions through Mr. Messiaen's
master manipulation of dynamics (including silence),
expressive chords and orchestral/choral voices. Between
bursts of orchestral brilliance, the soloists evoke good,
faithful 13th-century people who happen to live in an
astonishing world of sound. As St. Francis dies, the angel
tells him, "Today, in a few minutes, you will hear the music
of the invisible," and we do -- carillon chords, clusters of
birdsong, a stupendous finale. "Music and poetry have led me
to Thee," cries Francis, on behalf of the devout, 82-year-old
composer.

   The San Francisco Opera wound down a respectable if less
than triumphant season with a potent, somber revival of
Mussorgsky's "Khovanshchina" and a new production of
Monteverdi's "Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria" that was vivid
and theatricalist, sometimes moving, sometimes overblown.
   The 1641 Monteverdi was done in the Malipiero-Leppard
version, with its lush, dense, distinctly
non-17th-century-sounding score. No original orchestration
survives, so all performances of "Ulisse" depend on someone's
reconstruction. A month earlier, Alan Curtis had conducted a
sparsely staged, semi-amateur production of his new version
of the same opera at Berkeley. Opting for "authentic"
austerity, Mr. Curtis offered nothing beneath the declamatory
vocal line but a thin layer of plucked harpsichords and
lutes, a couple of small period organs and an occasional
flourish of bowed viols.
   Though I balked now and then at the reedy organs and
twinkling harps in San Francisco, Edwardian Muzak in the pit,
on the whole I'll vote for the jazzier production. For two
things, it offered Thomas Hampson (singing his first Ulisse)
and Frederica von Stade, as the returning Homeric hero and
his ever-patient wife. He is tall, genuinely heroic, a
commanding vocal actor; she has never seemed in more absolute
control of that glorious voice, or more expressive of the
emotions it conveys.
   Then, after pumping up the orchestra and pulling in the
stars, San Francisco imported Michael Hampe's
Salzburg/Cologne production, to make tolerable this 3
1/2-hour pageant of moral abstraction and classical mythology
-- with no arias] -- to 3,300 people a night, each paying $25
to $80. In Mr. Hampe's production, gods float or descend via
cloud-shaped ski-gondolas dangling from wires, or rise up
from the floor out of make-believe waves. (At the fifth
performance, which I saw, all this machinery worked
perfectly; earlier, stage lifts had refused to budge and gods
got stuck.) Monteverdi doesn't need all this, of course; but
17th-century Venetian audiences loved this sort of thing too,
so perhaps Mauro Pagano's elaborate sets and costumes could
be considered at least semi-authentic.

   LONDON -- Isosceles PLC, the takeover vehicle created for
the 1989 leveraged buy-out of British grocery chain Gateway
Corp. PLC, has secured a debt-refinancing package including
as much as #237 million ($446.1 million) in fresh equity
capital.
   The refinancing, which has been under negotiation since
mid-1990, calls for the issue of 12.99 million new shares
based on units of values at #18.27 each. For every 30
ordinary shares held, 19 units will be issued.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of the issue, #222 million has been underwritten by U.S.
investment boutique Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. and a
consortium of U.K. investors, including Isosceles creditors.
   Under the share offering, Wasserstein Perella's stake in
Isosceles will rise to 40% from 19.9%, with the U.K.
consortium holding as much as 46.5% compared with its current
19.9% holding. The U.S. investment firm's contribution to the
refinancing is #115 million against #107 million from the
U.K. consortium led by Mercury Asset Management PLC, a fund
management unit of S.G. Warburg &amp; Co.
   Proceeds will be used to retire company debt, dropping its
total indebtedness to #1.2 billion from about #1.4 billion
presently.
   Besides the fresh capital, creditors have also agreed to
reschedule payments on #592 million of senior debt initially
due in 1991 and 1992 to August 1996. Also, creditors agreed
to defer #48 million in interest due on subordinated debt
over the next two years.
   Isosceles said it has also agreed to buy back about #87
million of the subordinated, or so-called mezzanine debt,
while mezzanine financers have agreed to waive certain equity
warrants held against the company.
   U.K. merchant bank S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. has also agreed to
provide Isosceles with #15 million in working capital once
shareholder approval of the refinancing plan is secured.
   Other members of the U.K. consortium are: Standard
Chartered PLC, a major British commercial bank; 3i PLC, a
British investment firm owned by major British banks and the
Bank of England; Globe Venture Nominees Ltd., a fund
management group; and Murray Johnstone Ltd., a U.K.
investment firm.
   Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., the U.S. grocery chain
that was among the initial Isosceles investors at a 19.9%
stake, isn't participating in the fresh equity portion of the
refinancing, Isosceles said.

   NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence in December remained
virtually unchanged from November but still much lower than a
year ago, as concerns about the economy and the Middle East
persist, according to the Conference Board, an independent
business research organization.
   Meanwhile, help-wanted advertising volume reached a
five-year low in November, the board said, as its seasonally
adjusted help-wanted ad index fell eight points.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index stood at
61.3 in December, slightly lower than a revised 61.7 for
November. The results of a nationwide survey of consumers
show that Americans are more worried today than they were a
month ago about economic conditions. And confidence has
plummeted compared with a year ago when the index registered
above 113.
   The biggest single monthly drop came in October during the
U.S. budget debate, when the confidence index fell to 62.6
from 85.6 in September. Since then, the index has been
hovering in the low 60s. The index uses 1985 as a base year
of 100.
   "Consumers' continuing disenchantment with prevailing
business conditions and their low expectations for the
immediate future reflect the increasingly soft economy," says
Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer
Research Center.
   The employment situation clearly remains a big worry.
About 33% of those surveyed complained that jobs are "hard to
get," up from 29% in November. Looking ahead, 34% expect few
jobs to be available over the next six months, while only 10%
expect there to be more jobs. On the other hand, only 26%
said they expect business conditions to worsen, down from
about 30% last month.
   Concern about jobs, along with expectations for little or
no real personal income growth, is prompting many consumers
to keep their hands on their wallets. In the December survey,
only 5.9% said they intend to purchase a car, down from 6.5%
last month. In December 1989, over 7% said they planned to
buy a car. Home-buying interest is also weak at 2.6%. And
many consumers are shelving plans for a vacation. Less than
47% of those surveyed said they plan to take a vacation in
the next six months, down from more than 52% a year ago.
   The index is based on a survey of 5,000 households across
the U.S. conducted for the Conference Board by National
Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio. The decline in
help-wanted advertising reflects the fact that "the labor
market has been weakening for the last six months, and it may
be another six months before it turns around," said Ken
Goldstein, the Conference Board's economist. The nation's
unemployment rose to 5.9% in November, from 5.7% in October.
The rate stood at 5.3% a year ago.
   But he said help-wanted volume is unlikely to fall another
20% over the next six months, as it has done over the
previous six months. The index, which fell last month to 108
from 116 in October, is currently 37 points below the
year-ago level of 145. The index uses 1967 as a base year of
100.
   Help-wanted advertising volume declined in all nine major
regions of the country, particularly in the Pacific, where it
fell 10.8%. The East North Central and Middle Atlantic
regions followed, recording drops of 8.1% and 7.4%
respectively. The Conference Board said the best news is that
labor conditions in the West South Central oil patch, held up
better than anywhere else in the country.
   Mr. Goldstein said the downward trend that began in the
Northeast more than a year ago has spread to the South
Atlantic, Pacific, and more recently into the Midwestern
regions. Still, he expects signs of improvement in labor
market conditions soon.
   The survey measures help-wanted ad volume in 51 major
newspapers in the nation.

   TOKYO -- Chemical Trust &amp; Banking Co. (Japan), a
subsidiary of New York-based Chemical Banking Corp., was
chosen over eight Japanese bidders to build and manage a
10-story building on a site here that is used as a postal
warehouse.
   The contract was granted by Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, in one of the first such projects
arranged by the Japanese government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the award involves less than 2,300 square feet of
land, the choice of a U.S.-owned company rather than Japanese
trust banks is likely to attract attention. U.S. officials
have been watching Japanese government procurement practices
in areas ranging from construction to computer systems. And
the financial services area is among the industries in which
the U.S. has been pushing hardest for fair access to the
Japanese market.
   The Japanese government in the mid-1980s proposed
developing public property through trust arrangements, but
only two such projects have been arranged so far, the
Ministry of Finance said.
   The Ministry of Posts said the winning bid was based on
projections for total dividends and estimated value of the
building when it is handed over to the government at the end
of the 20-year contract. Total projected dividends for the
ministry are 8.68 billion yen ($63.8 million) under
Chemical's plan, which calls for the first eight floors to be
rented as office space and the two top floors as residential
units. Estimated value of the building at the end of the
contract is 864.8 million yen ($6.4 milllion).
   A spokesman for Chemical in Tokyo declined to estimate the
value of the contract, saying details of the agreement are
expected to be negotiated by April 1. The 20-year life of the
project means there are many uncertainties in calculating its
profitability, he said.
   Under the arrangement, Chemical will borrow as much as two
billion yen to finance construction, and manage the building
for 18 years after its scheduled completion in 1993. Chemical
is to extract costs, interest and its own fees from tenants'
rents, and pay the remainder to the ministry as dividends.

   Rockefeller Fund
   Says David White
   To Be Treasurer

   NEW YORK -- David A. White, head of Unisys Corp.'s pension
fund known for aggressively using new investment techniques,
was named treasurer and chief investment officer of the
Rockefeller Foundation.
   Mr. White, 45 years old, will assume investment duties for
the $1.9 billion foundation on Jan. 14. He succeeds Jack R.
Meyer, who took over the top investment job for the $5
billion Harvard University endowment in June.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We think we are going into a very difficult, troubled
decade and we wanted someone who had sailed rough seas in the
past," said Peter Goldmark, president of the Rockefeller
Foundation. He described Mr. White as a "tough, modern
portfolio manager primarily from the quantitative school."
   Mr. White has spent his entire career at Unisys, the
loss-plagued computer maker, and its predecessor, Burroughs
Corp., which he joined in 1971. As head of pension operations
since 1983, Mr. White became known for using a variety of
leading-edge investment strategies for the $2.9 billion fund,
including risk arbitrage, currency investing and stock short
sales as part of so-called market-neutral portfolios.
   "He wants to be at the cutting edge and was not at all shy
to try new things," said W. Michael Blumenthal, former
chairman of Unisys and once a Rockefeller Foundation board
member and now a limited partner with the investment banking
firm of Lazard Freres &amp; Co.
   Other investment people agreed with that assessment. "He
has a reputation in this business that if you have a new
investment idea, you ought to take it to him," said George
Hambrecht, a money manager with Paradigm Partners Inc.
   Mr. White said that the Rockefeller Foundation's
willingness to use new investment approaches attracted him to
one of the investment community's most prestigious posts.
   "They certainly have been innovative in the past and I
hope they will continue to be so," he said.
   As for changes he plans at the foundation, "I see it as
evolutionary," Mr. White said. Still, he said, the
foundation's portfolio "could be more aggressive with their
indexing" of securities to track market barometers such as
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   Mr. White attended the University of Michigan, where he
received an undergraduate degree and a master's degree in
business administration. He was recruited to the Rockefeller
Foundation by Russell Reynolds Inc., which earlier had been
Harvard's recruiter in finding Mr. Meyer for its endowment
post.

   Midway through Michael Cunningham's "A Home at the End of
the World" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 343 pages, $18.95), a
son confronts his father on a lonely stretch of Arizona
desert. Jonathan, a gay man approaching his 30s, feels
detached and alone. Why, he asks, can't he make a life for
himself?
   But the conversation is cut short when his father suffers
a sudden, agonizing attack of emphysema. As the two slowly
make their way back toward the lights of the parental
condominium, Jonathan muses: "They were like holes punched in
the night, leaking light from another, more animated world.
For a moment I could imagine what it would be like to be a
ghost -- to walk forever through a silence deeper than
silence, to apprehend but never quite reach the lights of
home."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A yearning for home -- for a secure and fixed place in the
world -- is what drives this sad, eloquent work of fiction.
For the characters whose stories are told here, it is a place
just beyond reach. Families -- at worst something to escape
-- are makeshift alliances at best, poor defense against the
forces of age, illness and disaffection.
   This novel began attracting attention well before its
publication date, when excerpted chapters appeared in the New
Yorker. Mr. Cunningham, a 38-year-old writer who has yet to
quit his day job at Carnegie Corp., is no writing-workshop
upstart. This, his second novel, took six years to write. His
first, the 1984 "Golden States," has since gone out of print
-- the author having decided that it fell short of his own
standards.
   One hopes that a different fate awaits "A Home at the End
of the World." Told in four different voices, this is the
story of Jonathan and Bobby, who become boyhood friends in
Cleveland during the 1970s. Jonathan, a pensive outsider,
feels stifled by his close relationship with his mother. The
drug-dazed and disheveled Bobby is the casualty of a family
tragedy that begins with the death of his adored older
brother. The two boys escape their unhappy home lives by
smoking dope, playing rock records and engaging in furtive
sex.
   Standing just outside this charmed circle are two women.
Jonathan's mother, Alice, a dissatisfied housewife, sees
Bobby as a threat, but takes him in out of pity and her own
boredom. As the novel shifts to the boys' East Coast
adulthood, the mother role is picked up by Clare, an older
woman who becomes Jonathan's East Village roommate during his
stint as restaurant critic for a hip Manhattan paper.
   The pair play at keeping house: Clare is the "half-lover"
Jonathan lives with and confides in, but for sex -- and
nothing else -- Jonathan turns to Erich, a lonely would-be
actor. When the now-orphaned Bobby moves in -- having been
gently pushed from the nest by his surrogate mother, Alice --
Clare and Jonathan acquire a token son.
   This offbeat family takes a step closer to reality when
Clare, desperate for a more literal kind of motherhood, takes
Bobby into her bed and conceives a child with him. The three
set up camp in a dilapidated Woodstock house, with both men
playing father to the infant Rebecca.
   What keeps the novel from degenerating into a paean to the
nontraditional family is Mr. Cunningham's surgeon-like
detachment from his characters' confused longings. This New
Age family cracks just like a traditional one. "At least we
love each other. Didn't you say that first?" Bobby asks, only
to be told by an increasingly moody Clare: "Maybe I did.
About a thousand years ago."
   Nor does the novel lapse into sentimentality when the
household acquires a token grandfather in Erich, who is dying
of AIDS. Here, the virus -- which is never mentioned by name
-- just seems like another form of the alienation that each
of the trio seems to suffer from. Jonathan, who is probably
infected himself, remarks on a "a floating sensation, as if
your hours didn't add up to whole days and your presence . .
. didn't affect the landscape as human presences ordinarily
do." And AIDS fails to bring the characters closer together.
Nursing Erich with "the tenderness I hoped I might inspire in
others if my vigor leaked away and my body started to
change," Jonathan keeps his distance from his "half-lover"
until the end.
   The territory Mr. Cunningham claims here is fairly
well-traveled: a gay man dying of AIDS, a middle-aged woman
rushing to beat her biological clock, a son estranged from
his parents. But the unsparing clarity of his prose makes
them seem fresh and interesting. Even the toddler Rebecca,
who at the age of two discovers "the lush possibility of
saying no," is satisfyingly unpredictable.
   The only time the novel jars is when it shifts from the
characters' speaking voices to their more meditative
narrational ones. This is most glaring with Bobby, who goes
from inarticulate sentences studded with "likes" and
"reallys" to eloquent, even lyrical passages of prose.
   But it's hard to complain about prose so finely pitched.
Bobby, bathing a dying Erich, sees him as "lost in his own
mystery, staring into a hole that keeps opening and opening."
Even the smallest details are sharp-edged and vivid:
Rebecca's abandoned doll lies "grinning with stony rapture at
the sky."
   Images like these, which fuse the taut, distilled imagery
of a poem with the immediacy of a snapshot are what make this
novel so memorable.

   Eldepryl (R) is being investigated as a possible treatment
for other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly
Alzheimer's.

   Congratulations for printing the page-one articles about
Dr. Homes Morton and the Amish/Mennonites in Lancaster
County, Pa., on Sept. 20 and Nov. 18.
   In a world of selfishness, Dr. Morton's work is truly the
epitome of the Hippocratic Oath. Your first article so moved
me that I wanted to donate funds for his work. Unfortunately,
I lost the article but now I have been redeemed. Please tell
your readers that his Clinic for Special Children Inc. is at
P.O. Box 128 in Strasburg, Pa. And thank you again for this
wonderful article on human dedication.

   WEST CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. -- U.S. Bioscience Inc. said it
received its first drug approval from the Food and Drug
Administration for Hexalen, an anti-cancer agent used in the
treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.
   U.S. Bioscience officials hailed the drug's approval as a
significant step in the pharmaceutical company's development.
An FDA spokeswoman said the drug shows "significant
theraputic gains."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders quickly reacted to news of the drug's
approval. In American Stock Exchange trading Thursday, U.S.
Bioscience closed at $19.875, up 87.5 cents. "We were pleased
to see that the market hadn't already discounted the drug's
approval," said Larry Longeacre, the company's chief
financial officer.
   U.S. Bioscience said it plans to launch Hexalan, an agent
formerly known as Hexamethylmelamine, in the U.S. in late
January 1991. In addition, officials said the company plans
to file a product license application in the United Kingdom
in early 1991. It already has several agreements with other
companies for markets in Scandinavia, Eastern Europe,
Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Africa.
   A company official said the cost of the drug for a five to
six month treatment runs about $1,000 per patient. U.S.
Bioscience said Hexalan has shown the ability to eliminate
evidence of tumors in cases where other treatments have
failed.
   Originally formed as a subsidiary of U.S. Health Care,
U.S. Bioscience was spun off as an independent drug company
in 1987. In addition to Hexalen, the company currently has
nine other anti-cancer drugs in various stages of
development.

   Bank Start-Ups
   Draw Interest
   Of Small Firms

   PHILADELPHIA -- In today's dismal banking climate, it
might seem safe to assume nobody is starting a new bank. But
the assumption would be wrong.
   As big old banks wring their hands and slash dividends,
scores of small new banks are opening their doors. With
credit tightening, these institutions and other small banks
are attracting family-owned businesses hungry for cash and
personal service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Pennsylvania, 28 banks have opened since 1987, compared
with just six banks in the prior 20 years, state banking
regulators say. Bank formations also have been increasing in
Florida, Georgia, Texas, California and New Jersey.
Nationally, new bank charters have ranged between 200 and 300
a year for the last six years.
   "Mergers of small banks into large banks tend to lead to
an increase in the number of small-bank charters," says
financial analyst Ken E. Walsh of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Some managers deposed in the mergers, he
adds, are eager to start their own banks in their familiar,
local market.
   Nascent banks have some obvious advantages. They aren't
strapped by unwise loans made in real estate, Third World
debt or leveraged buy-outs, as many big banks are.
   Still, small banks face their own obstacles, ranging from
state lending ceilings to the inconvenience of single
locations. But Don J. Kauth, a bank analyst with First Albany
Corp. in Albany, N.Y., says the industry shakeout favors
community-oriented banks along with the efficient giants.
   Alan Armstrong, owner of Tiffany Dining Palace &amp; Gazebo in
Centre City, Pa., has discovered the pluses and minuses of
dealing with a smaller bank, Madison Bank of Blue Bell, which
has $28 million in assets.
   For Mr. Armstrong, Pennsylvania's lending limit of 15% of
a bank's capital for any one customer is a drawback in
dealing with a small bank. It means a second bank must
participate in larger loans, requiring twice the paper work
and personnel. "It's more complex, like having two bosses,"
he says.
   Yet, in a tight credit market, it helped that the local
banker knew his 20-year business history, he adds. "I could
get loans at Madison when I couldn't get loans at other
places," he says.
   Another entrepreneur, Pat T. Deon Sr., just moved some
company accounts to Madison Bank from First Pennsylvania
Bank, which had $5.2 billion in assets before being acquired
recently by CoreStates Bank NA.
   "Every time you do business with {Madison}, you don't have
to go through the torture test," says Mr. Deon, whose family
runs a commercial-development company in Fairless Hills, Pa.
He says he not only gets next-day notice on loan approvals,
but also runs ideas by Madison's president, Vito DeLisi, who
knows the local market and is easy to "get on the phone."
Such access is hard to come by in the big banks.
   Jim Hoffman, 61 years old, is a refugee from just such a
bank. When he left his post as senior vice president of
Meridian Bank, which has $10.1 billion in assets, Mr. Hoffman
was tired of the "bureaucracy of corporate giants." When
small-business owners in his community of Media, Pa.,
approached him about starting a local bank, Mr. Hoffman chose
to return to his "roots in country banking."
   With a group of seven co-founders, Mr. Hoffman raised $4
million in six months in 1988. Security First Bank, now two
years old, has assets of about $37.1 million and has been
profitable in the past four quarters. It offers loans as
small as $1,000, a sum that doesn't excite most big banks.
   At big banks, "the lines are longer and there is no
familiar face to take care of Henry or Sarah," Mr. Hoffman
says. "There are those who love the bank machines, and those
who prefer personal service."
   Anna and Carl Galantino are just the types Mr. Hoffman has
in mind. The Galantinos have run a building-supply company
for 50 years, doing business for most of that time with
Mellon Bank, which has $29.4 billion in assets. But they
recently moved their company's accounts to nearby Security
First. "We got fed up with Mellon," says Mrs. Galantino. "It
got too big to pay any attention to us. We decided to take
our business someplace else. And to this day, not a soul from
Mellon has asked why."
   A Mellon spokeswoman responds: "We're always unhappy to
lose a customer. It tells us we have to keep trying harder."
   Several of the new start-ups have targeted business people
and other borrowers in ethnic communities. In Philadelphia's
Chinatown, First Commercial Bank of Philadelphia recently
held its first anniversary gala. Teller windows became a
makeshift bar, and the cocktail chatter was mostly in
Cantonese, Mandarin or Vietnamese. First Commercial targets
Asian customers, as well as food purveyors at nearby street
kiosks and farmers' markets.
   "We have an advantage over competitors in that we speak
the language of our customers," says Chairwoman Julie Wong,
whose bilingual agents translate documents for clients.
   First Commercial's customized service approach also has
drawn interest outside the Asian-American community. Raymond
Wyszynski, president of Wyszynski Provision, meat packers,
appreciates the caliber of loan officers at First Commercial,
where he is negotiating a loan.
   His company has several accounts at CoreStates Financial
Corp., which has $23.3 billion in assets, but Mr. Wyszynski
says: "Our contact only has a limited amount of authority.
I've seen an influx of younger kids being groomed for higher
positions. I'm irritated by personal things -- a young loan
officer who probably can't manage his personal savings having
a say in my business."
   Spokesmen for Mellon and CoreStates say they welcome
competition, and argue they aren't losing many customers to
niche banks, especially when it comes to lending. Large
banks, they say, offer more services, locations and
technological support.
   Smaller banks do face obstacles. They tend to confine
lending to one geographic area and are vulnerable to swings
in the local economy. Community banks should be especially
careful to diversify by borrower, industry and type of loan,
says First Albany's Mr. Kauth.
   The personal touch can inspire faith even in investors,
which is especially important because of the unorthodox
methods some bank entrepreneurs use to get started. Effie
Holloman, a retiree who lives on $12,000 a year, recently
signed on as an investor in United Bank of Philadelphia with
a check for $1,000. She was just one investor tapped by
United Bank Chairwoman Emma Chappell at a gathering at the
Prayer Chapel God in Christ in northwest Philadelphia.
   If United Bank, which has acquired about $3.5 million in
capital, can raise $1.5 million more, it will get a full
charter from the state and become the first black-controlled
bank here since 1956, designed to "empower" minority
businesses as well as wean clients away from check-cashing
agencies, says Mrs. Chappell.
   Mrs. Holloman thinks that's a worthy cause. "I think we
need an Afro-American bank in this city, and I have
confidence in God that it will survive."

   Qume Corp. said write-downs and other unusual costs
totaling $8.4 million resulted in a loss of $12.7 million, or
$1.13 a share, for the third quarter ended Nov. 30.
   In the year-earlier period, the Milpitas, Calif., maker of
computer printers and other peripheral equipment earned $1
million, or nine cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The loss reflects the cost of a failed buy-out
transaction, inventory write-downs and other costs, Qume
said.
   The failed buy-out of the company by David S. Lee, Qume's
chairman and chief executive officer, and a group of
investors cost $1.4 million, the company said. For the nine
months ended Nov. 30, buy-out costs were $2 million. Net
inventory declined $10.5 million during the quarter, which
included an inventory write-down of $5.7 million.
   Quarterly revenue dipped 2.3% to $54.7 million from $55.9
million.

   Defendants Seek $2 Billion,
   Saying Firms Dumped
   Dioxin in Three Rivers

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. and International Paper Co. were
named defendants in a $2 billion lawsuit filed in Mississippi
that alleges the two paper companies dumped dioxin and other
pollutants into three state rivers.
   The suit, which includes more than 1,800 plaintiffs,
states that the companies knew that their plants were dumping
toxins into the waters -- but continued to do so, posing a
"health risk to human beings, wildlife, aquatic life and the
environment in general."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The action comes on the heels of a setback for
Georgia-Pacific, based in Atlanta, in a similar suit. In late
October, a jury in Leakesville, Miss., awarded $1 million in
punitive damages to a man who lived along the Leaf River, one
of the three waterways in the current action, and who claimed
that Georgia-Pacific had contaminated the river with dioxin
and other chemicals.
   That decision, as well as the latest filing, are only the
tip of the litigation iceberg, insisted John Deakle, a
Hattiesburg, Miss., lawyer who represented the original
plaintiff in Leakesville. As many as 60 people a day are now
crowding his office, he said, seeking to file similar suits
against Georgia-Pacific and International Paper.
   "You ain't seen nothing yet," he said, estimating his firm
may eventually represent as many as 4,300 plaintiffs. "The
next wave will be massive."
   Georgia-Pacific, which already has said it will appeal the
Leakesville case, said it hadn't seen the current suit and
couldn't comment on the particular allegations. But a
spokeswoman said the company's Leaf River plant hasn't
"adversely impacted the environment of southern Mississippi."
She added that dioxin is present in the plant's effluent, but
said levels of the chemical have been "reduced by 98% in the
past two years." Moreover, she said, dioxin levels in the
river's fish "fall within guidelines set by the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration."
   Officials at International Paper, based in Purchase, N.Y.,
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Georgia-Pacific's Leaf River plant was originally owned by
Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., which Georgia-Pacific acquired
in February. The six-year-old facility, situated in New
Augusta, Miss., produces bleach/kraft pulp, which is used to
make several paper products. The bleaching process, which
makes paper white, involves the use of chlorine gas that, in
turn, results in the production of dioxin.
   International Paper's plant, which sits on the Escatawpa
River in Moss Point, Miss., also manufactures bleached pulp
and paper products, according to the suit.
   The 1,800 plaintiffs, said Irwin W. Stolz, an Atlanta
attorney and one of five lawyers representing the group,
either live along the rivers or consume fish from the rivers
as a major part of their diet.
   Evidence of damage to the river and wildlife is "graphic,"
Mr. Stolz said. There are "fish with sores and bulges all
over them {as well as} beaches covered with dead mussels and
various colors of stain as broad as the colors of the
rainbow." Moreover, he said, "We don't have any indication
that {the pollution} has abated at all."
   The rivers, which flow through southeastern Mississippi to
the Gulf of Mexico, pass through some of the most
economically depressed areas in the country, said Mr. Deakle,
the Hattiesburg attorney. "It's the same old story," he said.
"You put the pollutants on the poor and the powerless."
   The latest suit was filed in Jackson County (Miss.)
chancery court. It seeks to enjoin the companies from
continuing the alleged practices, and asks for a judgment of
$150,000, plus $1 million in punitive damages, for each
plaintiff.
   Mississippi law forbids class-action suits. Thus, each
plaintiff's case might have to be tried separately. "This is
not something that's going to go away," Mr. Deakle said.

   Economy:
   November Durables Orders Sank 10.5%,
   Matching Record Drop Set Last January

   WASHINGTON -- New orders for durable goods plummeted 10.5%
in November, the Commerce Department reported, matching the
record drop set last January and offering further
confirmation that the economy took a steep downturn in the
fourth quarter.
   Though the plunge was led by a big slide in the volatile
transportation category, declines in orders were widespread.
Excluding transportation, the decline was 3.5%. The report
was doleful news for the beleaguered manufacturing sector,
which cut payrolls by 200,000 workers in November, according
to figures released earlier this month by the Labor
Department.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This clearly shows the economy to be in the free-fall
stages of a recession," said Gordon Richards, an economist
with the National Association of Manufacturers.
   The November decline in orders -- to $115.94 billion --
put orders at about the same level as in early 1988. The drop
followed an increase of 3.6% in October and a decline of 1.6%
in September.
   Orders in the transportation sector fell 27.4% in November
after increasing 14.1% in the previous month. Aircraft
orders, particularly big orders to Boeing Co., have made the
transportation order figures erratic in the last few months.
Aircraft orders in November dropped 38.8%, after a 20.4%
increase that included a major Boeing order in October.
   The record decline set last January also was led by
decreases in orders for aircraft and autos. Orders
subsequently moved slowly upward, increasing about 10%
between January and October.
   Orders for nondefense capital goods, which economists view
as a sign of business investment plans, fell 16.4% in
November after rising 8.7% in October. Excluding aircraft,
nondefense capital goods orders dropped 6%, as electrical
machinery orders were off 7.6% to their lowest level since
March 1989. Orders for nonelectrical machinery were flat
after a 1.4% decline in October, while orders for primary
metals sank 9.8% in November, after a 5% increase the
previous month. All figures are adjusted for seasonal
variations.
   "There's an unusually rapid decline in economic activity
going on," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. "Both production and orders are down. The
question now is whether this will continue or whether the
sharp declines now can pre-empt further declines later."
   Many economists have been revising their estimates of
fourth-quarter economic growth in response to the last few
weeks' parade of bleak economic statistics. Many Wall Street
economists are now predicting that real gross national
product -- the inflation-adjusted output in goods and
services -- could contract 3% or more in the fourth quarter.
Merrill Lynch's estimate is that GNP will shrink 3.5%.
   "That's sobering," Mr. Steinberg said, because in all
recessions going back to the 1950s, the first quarter of
decline was followed by other quarters in which the decline
was even bigger. But some economists are coming to the view
that managers have become more cautious and began slowing
down orders and production in this business cycle earlier
than usual. That could mean that a rebound from the sharp
drop in the fourth quarter will come more quickly.
   Shipments of durable goods in November were down 3.6%
after a 1.5% increase in October. Unfilled orders slipped
1.1%, following a 0.7% rise the previous month.

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government won a contract valued at
600 million Canadian dollars (US$517.3 million) to build a
second nuclear power reactor in South Korea.
   The sale, Canada's first in almost 10 years, is expected
to give a boost to Canada's nuclear industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., a government agency, said it
signed a contract with state-owned Korea Electric Power Corp.
to build a 700,000-kilowatt Candu reactor, a Canadian design,
next to an existing Candu power plant in Wolsong.
   Atomic Energy Chairman Robert Ferchat said the sale
demonstrates "that Canada has the leading nuclear technology
in the world." He said the contract will help boost sales of
Candu reactors to other countries with which Canada is
negotiating.
   Engineering work on South Korea's new power station is to
start immediately and the plant is expected to be in
operation by 1997. The cost of the entire power plant is
estimated at C$1.2 billion. About two-thirds of Canada's
C$600 million contract will go to Canadian engineering
companies and manufacturers of reactor parts. The rest will
go to South Korean subcontractors.
   South Korea announced plans last year to proceed with a
second plant at Wolsong, located on the eastern coast. The
country's first Candu reactor has been in operation there
since 1983.
   Canada's energy minister, Jake Epp, said Canada currently
is negotiating a C$100 million contract with South Korea to
provide heavy water for use with the Candu reactor.
   The Candu design uses heavy water as the power plant's
moderator and natural uranium as its fuel. U.S. reactors, by
comparison, use light water and enriched uranium.
   Atomic Energy received its last nuclear plant order in
1981. Earlier this year, Ontario's newly elected socialist
government announced a three-year freeze on nuclear power
plant construction in the province.
   Atomic Energy holds about 6% of the world's nuclear
reactor market, the third-largest share after General
Electric Co. and Westinghouse Electric Corp. Outside Canada,
there are 12 Candu systems in operation or under
construction.
   South Korea currently has nine nuclear power plants in
operation, which generate about 50% of the country's
electricity. The new plant is needed to meet the country's
rising demand for electricity, which has been growing more
than 14% a year.

   Your Nov. 28 editorial "Scientific Fraud?" discussed a
Soviet scientific presentation made at the National Academy
of Sciences in April 1987 (not 1986 as the editorial states).
It is important to clarify for your readers that the visit of
the Soviet doctors was not an event sponsored by the National
Academy of Sciences. Rather, it was privately sponsored by
Matthew Meselson, who is an NAS member. Dr. Meselson was
permitted to hold the Washington session at the NAS,
consistent with academy policy to allow its members to use
academy facilities for scientific meetings. This does not,
however, imply any academy endorsement of the information or
viewpoints expressed in the meetings.
   Neither the academy nor any of its committees have taken a
stand on the veracity of the Soviet doctors' explanation of
the events in Sverdlovsk in 1979. We do, of course, urge and
welcome complete openness from the Soviet Union to address
any lingering concerns regarding past and current Soviet
compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention to which it
is a party.

   Procter &amp; Gamble
   Creates Division
   For East Europe

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., seeking to expand its presence in
the potentially lucrative Eastern European market, created a
new division to oversee its sales operations there.
   The Cincinnati consumer products giant said that effective
Jan. 1, it would also subdivide its European Health and
Beauty Care operation into three divisions, each responsible
for different regions within Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In recent months, Procter &amp; Gamble has been laying the
groundwork for a more aggressive stance in Eastern Europe by
installing sales managers in Hungary, Poland and
Czechoslovakia. Procter &amp; Gamble had been cautious about
expanding into the region, but that's changed as the Eastern
bloc has moved to a more market-oriented economy. The
company's ties to the region have been strictly through
exports, but analysts speculate the company may also want to
eventually build manufacturing plants there. The company
won't comment.
   Analysts believe Procter &amp; Gamble and other consumer
products concerns, such as Colgate-Palmolive Co., Unilever
N.V. and Gillette Co., can take advantage of huge untapped
markets in Eastern Europe, particularly after currency
problems are ironed out.
   "A lot of people in those countries don't have access to
the type of high quality products that Procter &amp; Gamble
makes, and it doesn't take a lot of money to buy things like
bath soap, detergent, toothpaste and diapers," said Bonita
Austin, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.
   Procter &amp; Gamble named Herbert Schmitz, 54 years old and
currently vice president of the company's Central Europe
Health and Beauty Care unit, to head the newly created
Eastern European division.
   The company also named three executives to newly created
positions in its European Health and Beauty Care division,
effective Jan. 1. They are:
   -- Michael A. Thompson, 48, currently division manager,
Western Europe Health and Beauty Care, was named division
manager, Northern Europe Health and Beauty Care, with
responsibility for business in Belgium, the Netherlands,
Scandinavia, the U.K. and the European Noxell shaving cream
and Shulton personal-care operations.
   -- Bernd E. Beetz, 40, currently general manager, Procter
&amp; Gamble Germany, was appointed division manager, Southern
Europe Health and Beauty Care, with responsibility for
business in Italy, France, Spain and Portugal.
   -- Hans J. Honigfort, 44, currently general manager,
Health and Beauty Care, Germany, was named division manager,
Central Europe Health and Beauty Care, with responsibility
for business in Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

   Japan's Steel Exports
   Fell in November
   Prices Rose to Record

   TOKYO -- Japan's steel exports in November fell 5.7% to
1,356,000 metric tons from a year earlier, marking a
continuing decline as manufacturers struggled to meet strong
domestic demand, Japan's Iron and Steel Federation said.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Export prices for the month soared to $818 a ton, climbing
above the $800 level for the first time in history. A
federation official said the surge indicates that a large
part of exports consists of expensive items such as seamless
pipes and galvanized iron products.
   Aside from such profitable, high value-added items,
"Makers have completely shifted to domestic demand-oriented
production," the official said.
   Reflecting continued expansion of the Japanese economy,
orders from domestic auto makers, construction companies,
industrial machinery makers and shipbuilding firms remained
at "an extremely high level," he said.
   While domestic steel production is expected to mark a
record high in 1990, steel exports for the year are likely to
drop to the lowest level in 20 years, the official said.
   By market, exports to the U.S. posted their first
year-to-year gain in six months, up 8.2% at 237,000 metric
tons, helped by increases in exports of seamless pipe and
other oil drilling-related products, the official said.
   Exports to the Soviet Union continued to improve, though
the total amount remained small. Exports rose 15% to 40,000
tons, as shipments of oil-drilling products resumed, after
price negotiations between producers and the Soviet
government were successfully concluded earlier this year.

   Trying to Unload
   Homes With a Past

   LEONARD Rinallo may have the toughest real-estate job in
the nation: He's trying to sell 236 abandoned homes in the
Niagara Falls, N.Y., area known as Love Canal, which became a
national symbol of environmental contamination in the 1970s.
   Years of toxic-waste dumping by Hooker Chemical, now part
of Occidental Petroleum, led the state to buy and evacuate
230 homes in 1978. In 1980, state and federal authorities
formed the Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency, to buy out
500 more homeowners on the perimeter. Since then, about 350
homes have been demolished, and the canal itself has been
sealed off.
   Mr. Rinallo's challenge is to find buyers for the houses
left standing, at prices of $48,000 to $81,000, roughly 20%
less than similar houses in nearby neighborhoods, he says.
Because the homes sat vacant for a decade, up to $20,000 of
renovations have been made on each.
   "We're selling homes that were never proven contaminated,
that were taken out because of the panic," says Mr. Rinallo.
   Since the homes went on sale in August, 15 have gone to
contract, he says. But only one has sold. "The banks are
redlining," Mr. Rinallo says. "They aren't taking {mortgage}
applications, and they aren't telling us why."
   James E. Carr, the agency's planning director, says, "The
banks won't lend because they won't be able to sell {the
mortgages} on the secondary market." Many mortgage
repurchasers, he says, worry about selling homes or being
liable for further cleanup in the event of foreclosures. The
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and the State of New York
Mortgage Agency are among the agencies that haven't agreed to
repurchase the mortgages.
   Maurice Hinchey, chairman of the state Legislature's
environmental conservation committee, says selling the homes
seems "a foolhardy thing to do. The banks are understandably
reluctant to get involved."
   Mr. Carr argues that Love Canal "is the most-tested area
in the nation." He adds that the homes have received a clean
bill of health from state and federal environmental
authorities.
   Still, six environmental groups have filed suit to block
the resettlement, challenging the government claims that the
site is safe.
                                                                                                       

   Smaller Japanese Banks
   Fund Purchases in U.S.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S largest institutional investors have a diminished
appetite for U.S. real estate this year, but a new wave of
investment from customers of Japan's regional banks has kept
Japan the No. 1 foreign purchaser of American real estate.
   The plunge of Japan's stock market has hurt the capital
bases of the nation's largest banks, says Jack Rodman of the
Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. Japan's
regional banks, however, are not as heavily invested in
stocks. In addition, their clients are flush with cash due to
soaring land values outside of Japan's largest cities.
   These new buyers are broadening their horizons beyond
Hawaii, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York. Of 60 U.S.
properties acquired by Japanese investors in the first nine
months of 1990, 39 were located in the West, 10 in the Middle
Atlantic states, three in the Midwest, five in the Southwest
and three in the South, according to the U.S. real-estate arm
of France's Banque Indosuez.
   Buyers are also steering clear of "trophy" properties.
Thirty-five of the deals were valued at less than $50
million, and only one -- Pebble Beach resort -- topped $200
million, the report says.
   Mr. Rodman estimates that Japanese investment in U.S. real
estate this year will total $10 billion to $13 billion, down
from $14.8 billion in 1989.
                                                                                                       

   Will `Wealth Effect'
   Become Poverty Effect?
                                                                                                       

   SOME ECONOMISTS worry that the erosion of home values will
damp consumer spending, further undermining the national
economy.
   They derive this scenario from the "wealth effect," which
holds that for every $1 drop in a consumer's net worth,
consumption falls by three to six cents.
   In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, doomsayers
cited the wealth effect to support dire economic forecasts.
But the middle class was unfazed by the crash, in part
because only 20% of all households own stock.
   University of Michigan economist F. Thomas Juster says
preliminary data from 1984 to 1989 suggest that housing
capital gains and losses directly affect savings, which in
turn affect consumption. When home values slide, homeowners
save more and buy less.
   Older homeowners are particularly prone to such behavior,
because home equity often represents the largest portion of
their wealth, says Daniel McFadden, an economics professor at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
                                                                                                       

   Real-Estate Pros' Pay
   Follows Market South
                                                                                                       

   THE PAY of top real-estate executives plunged this year,
according to a survey by Ferguson Partners, a Chicago
consulting firm.
   Among the biggest losers: real-estate department heads at
big investment banks (off 20%) and big commercial banks (off
25%), and CEOs of commercial mortgage banks (off 20%).
   Nevertheless, department heads at major investment banks
remained the No. 1 wage earners, with average base salaries
of $250,000, plus a bonus of 100% to 200% of their salaries.
Major pension fund advisers boasted the second-highest
compensations, with average base pay of $225,000, plus a 100%
bonus.
   William Ferguson, managing partner of Ferguson Partners,
predicts that in the coming year, base salaries in virtually
all sectors of real estate will remain unchanged or decline
slightly.

   To suggest that Nigerians supply 25% of the $15 billion
U.S. heroin market is absurd; to state that 200 Nigerians
bring heroin to the U.S. daily and that Nigerians supply up
to 50% of Washington, D.C.'s, heroin has to be patently
false.
   Pieces like this suggest that the assumption is fine that
any Nigerian at any U.S. airport is carrying heroin until the
contrary is proven. Many Nigerian dignitaries, including the
winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Prof. Wole Soyinka,
and a former head of state, Olusegun Obasanjo, have been
subjected to embarrassing intrusive searches at American
airports.
   When was the last time someone screamed, "American heroin
smugglers . . ." "Italian heroin smugglers . . . etc"? Or are
we to assume that other drug dealers have no nationalities?
If some Nigerians are bad, why must our country suffer so?

   MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev spent
Thursday trying to hold his government together.
   Late in the day, Mr. Gorbachev's choice for vice president
was confirmed by the country's largest law-making body, but
only after he was defeated in a first round of voting and Mr.
Gorbachev pleaded for the congress to reconsider. Meanwhile,
the parliament of the Russian Federation voted to slash its
contribution to the national budget.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gennady Yanayev, the only candidate on the ballot for vice
president, is considered a longtime Communist bureaucrat. His
nomination was a surprise to those who expected a more
moderate choice who might smooth over at least some of the
nation's complex problems.
   The session of the Congress of People's Deputies,
adjourning after 10 days, left Mr. Gorbachev embarrassed and
embattled. It began last week with the unexpected resignation
of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who said he was
leaving the government because a "dictatorship was coming."
But it ended with the impression that while Mr. Gorbachev
might be tilting toward a more orthodox communist stance, he
faces resistance and may have to compromise to keep the union
together.
   Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev himself warned that if the Russian
Federation persists in withholding 119 billion rubles from
the central Soviet budget of about 250 billion rubles, "there
will be disintegration, not only of the economy, but of the
country as well."
   The Russian Federation, headed by Boris Yeltsin, is the
largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics and holds key
natural resources of oil, gas and gold. The federation
declared its sovereignty in May and has adopted its own
reforms leading toward a market economy. Its parliament voted
Wednesday to allocate only 23 billion rubles to the national
budget. It is possible that other restless republics and
regions, such as the Baltic states, might also try to
withhold funds.
   Mr. Gorbachev pleaded with the congress to pass a
temporary economic cooperation agreement, and the lawmakers
abided with a resolution that gave Mr. Gorbachev and the
republic leaders until Jan. 10 to complete a plan. It isn't
known how the Russian Federation will respond.
   The lawmakers also reconsidered their initial rejection of
Mr. Yanayev, who at first fell 31 votes short of the 1,120
votes needed for a simple majority of the 2,239 registered
deputies. On the second vote, he received 1,239 votes, with
563 deputies voting against him. Election Commission Chairman
Yuri Osipyan said the difference in the vote could be
attributed to 107 deputies who received ballots but hadn't
voted the first time, and 113 ballots that were found to be
invalid.
   The conservative Mr. Yanayev, 53 years old, is a lawyer
who most recently served as secretary of the policy-making
Communist Central Committee. He was elected to the party's
ruling Politburo in July after a party shake-up that
significantly reduced its authority, and is a leader of the
parliament's 730-member Communist bloc.
   Deputies said Mr. Yanayev's initial defeat was a protest
against his conservatism and relative obscurity. "The choice
is an insult to the people because he is such a minor figure
for this position," said Feodor Burlatsky, editor of the
liberal newsweekly, Literatyrnaya Gazyeta.
   Others said they had voted against Mr. Yanayev because he
is an ethnic Russian and they had wanted a representative
from one of the outlying republics. Mr. Gorbachev prevailed
upon the deputies to reconsider by telling them that he
needed "a man I have total confidence in to be by my side at
this difficult turning point in my life."
   Mr. Gorbachev hasn't yet specified what kind of role the
vice president will play. It is the first appointment in the
new government structure and system of executive power, which
the congress approved Wednesday morning. Other key posts,
including a successor for Mr. Shevardnadze as foreign
minister, have not yet been named.
   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov is recuperating from a
heart attack suffered earlier this week and isn't expected to
return to work soon, if at all.

   WASHINGTON -- Three brands of dental adhesive contain
unacceptable levels of benzene, according to the Food and
Drug Administration.
   The three products are Orafix Special and Brace, made by
Norcliff Thayer, a Philadelphia unit of Britain's SmithKline
Beecham PLC, and Cushion Grip, made by Schering-Plough
HealthCare Products, a unit of Schering-Plough Corp.,
Madison, N.J.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All three products will be voluntarily recalled by their
manufacturers, the FDA said in a statement released late
yesterday. Meanwhile, the agency is urging consumers not to
use the dental adhesives until the manufacturers resume
manufacturing them without benzene.
   Although benzene causes cancer when ingested in large
amounts, James Benson, FDA deputy commissioner said, "We
don't see this as a significant health issue at this point."
But he added that "any time you have something that's a known
or potential carcinogen you want to get rid of it."
   While SmithKline called the levels of benzene
contamination "minute" and "measured in parts per million,"
it was sufficient to warrant an immediate recall.
   A spokesman for Schering-Plough said that the company
"believes the trace concentrations do not pose a health
hazard." But he said the company would cooperate with the FDA
to revise the manufacturing process.
   The amount of benzene found in the three dental adhesive
products exceeds levels that were found by the FDA in Perrier
earlier this year. The result was a highly publicized recall
of Perrier by its French manufacturer, Source Perrier S.A.
Perrier returned to grocery shelves this past July after the
company altered its production process.
   The FDA also found low levels of benzene in Fasteeth and

benzene daily in their drinking water. A company spokesman

   Jeffrey Tannenbaum's article (Leisure &amp; Arts, Nov. 21)
makes us wish we would be on hand in Lyons for the great
Kasparov-Karpov war. But then, upon reflection, we all know
this is just another run-of-the-mill chess championship,
despite all the media hype. Now a real titanic struggle, I
submit, was seen in 1834 between Frenchman La Bourdonnais and
Englishman A. McDonnell.
   What a shame that you did not have a reporter on hand back
then. The Frenchman never stopped talking, swearing and
joking about in his games, while McDonnell apparently was
dullness incarnate as he took up to 90 minutes on a single
move. He learned to utterly ignore the antics of his opponent
as he planned strategies, sometimes involving queen
sacrifices of a kind that Kasparov would admire.

<TEXT>
   I look forward to Mr. Tannenbaum's next article, when he
puts the two Russian Ks in perspective. (Oh, by the way, La
Bourdonnais was the victor with 45 wins, 27 losses and 13
draws])

   WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 533 money-market
funds fell $1.11 billion to a total $427.90 billion, in the
week ended Wednesday, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a Washington-based trade association.
   Assets of 267 general-purpose funds fell $226.3 million to
$150.41 billion and assets of 104 broker/dealer funds fell
$251.9 million to $166.02 billion. Assets of 162
institutional funds fell $627.6 million to $111.47 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Assets of money-market funds didn't change significantly
in the general-purpose and broker/dealer categories, but
institutional assets fell moderately, after five consecutive
weeks of large increases, "probably in response to some
firming of short-term interest rates," said Jacob Dreyer,
vice president and chief economist at the institute.
   Money-market mutual fund assets for the previous week
ended Dec. 19 were revised to $429.01 billion, and the
increase in assets was revised to $1 billion.

   Mark Regains Ground as Fears Abate
   Over Soviet Political Crisis; Yen Falls

   NEW YORK -- The dollar closed mixed, with the market
leaning gently in favor of buying back the fundamentally
buoyant mark and selling off the war-vulnerable yen.
   Anxiety over the situation in the Persian Gulf, coupled
with apprehension over Soviet politics, acted as safety nets
for the dollar, preventing it from sustaining heavy losses.
The dollar is traditionally seen as a safe investment in
times of turmoil. Year-end demand for dollars also kept the
U.S. currency supported in a sparse post-holiday market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But confirmation of the U.S. economy's troubles, as well
as profit-taking, restrained dollar bulls, and made room for
a resurgence of buying interest in the mark.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5255
marks, down from 1.5368 marks late Wednesday in New York. The
U.S. currency was changing hands at 136.40 yen, up from
136.25 yen in New York late Wednesday. Sterling was trading
at $1.8895, up from $1.8823.
   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 136.58
yen.
   The yen weakened broadly, slipping against European
currencies. This trend suggested a market more concerned with
the Mideast crisis than with suggestions of instability in
the Soviet Union, traders said.
   The mark was sold heavily following the resignation of
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze late last week,
because the German currency is seen as specially vulnerable
to instability in the Soviet Union, or Eastern Europe in
general. But the worry sparked by the resignation is "not
enough to break the significant mark trends," said Keith
Raphael, second vice president for foreign exchange at Chase
Manhattan Bank in New York. People will concentrate again on
fundamentals, he said, and, when the U.S. economy again
becomes the market focus, the German currency will reassert
its strength.
   Meanwhile, the market is on edge as the Jan. 15 deadline
set by the U.N. Security Council for Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait approaches, with no apparent progress on diplomatic
meetings between Baghdad and Washington. As long as the war
fears exist, the market perceives the yen as vulnerable to a
downward plunge, said Charles Spence, vice president of
foreign exchange at First Interstate Bank of California in
Los Angeles.
   Also helping to firm the dollar, meanwhile, was a fairly
steady amount of last-minute demand for greenbacks, traders
said. Because spot-trading transactions are for delivery two
business days later, transactions made yesterday represented
the last opportunity to book deals in this calendar year.
Japanese importers were particularly active in buying the
dollar in a year-end scramble, traders in Tokyo said. On the
back of this interest, the dollar floated as high as 137.05
yen. There, however, it ran into heavy selling, primarily
from Japanese exporters.
   Sparking a brief dollar sell-off was news that U.S.
durable goods orders tumbled 10.5% in November, matching a
record drop last January and offering further evidence of an
economic downturn. The report caused a knee-jerk flight out
of dollars, but the reaction was short-lived. Because of the
nagging threat of war, it's "very difficult to go short
dollars," said Radhika Govindrajan, vice president at
Chemical Bank in New York.
   Although all three major foreign exchange centers --
Tokyo, London, and New York -- were open Thursday,
participation was slight, with almost no interbank trading
and little activity in the brokers market.
   The Federal Reserve made the unusual move of
pre-announcing one-day system repurchase agreements for
Thursday and two-day system repurchase agreements for Monday.
   The Fed's move could have had a mildly bearish impact on
the dollar if interpreted as a hint of further easing down
the road. But most participants saw the Fed's move as a
technically motivated one, intended to address year-end
liquidity needs and to smooth out what has been a rocky
period. Monday, the federal funds rate, the rate at which
banks lend to each other overnight, drifted as low as 1/16%.
Wednesday night, in an apparent credit panic, the funds rate
pushed the other extreme, soaring as high as 100%. Analysts
said the Fed's move to announce the liquidity-adding steps
was probably an attempt to reassure the market that its needs
would be met and that 7% is still the desired target for the
federal funds rate.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.30 an ounce, down 30 cents.
Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$385.40 an ounce.

   Growth-Minded Retailers
   Flock to Southern California

   LOS ANGELES -- As the going gets tougher in Southern
California, retailers are betting big that the tough still
will go shopping.
   Amid a nationwide economic slowdown, a retailing shakeout
and a commercial real estate bust, Southern California is
experiencing its greatest influx of merchants in a decade.
Retailers ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to upscale
Barneys New York are sticking with long-range plans to plunge
into one of the nation's most competitive consumer markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If you look closely at California and the individual
sectors in the retail industry, you see possibilities for
growth because it isn't homogeneous," says Sarah A. Stack, a
retail analyst for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. Still,
she says, the influx of hungry competitors will realign the
shopping scene here to the detriment of mass merchants and
other weak players.
   The lure of the area is compelling. Los Angeles County is
the nation's largest single retail market, with 1989 sales of
$63.2 billion vs. $46.6 billion for the New York metropolitan
area. The broader five-county Los Angeles region rang up
$104.6 billion in 1989 sales, U.S. Department of Commerce
data show. Furthermore, retail real estate isn't going
begging the way it is elsewhere. Experts estimate Southern
California has about 5% excess retail space; by contrast,
Denver has nearly 40% excess capacity.
   Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
the nation's biggest video-rental chain, has swept into the
entertainment industry Mecca with 85 outlets, and plans to
open at least 50 more in the area as part of a 400-store
expansion next year. Blockbuster's huge stores offer
thousands more movie titles than most competitors.
   Blockbuster, like others in its industry, faces high real
estate costs and a plethora of small competitors, not to
mention the problems of a sinking economy. But Scott A. Beck,
vice chairman and chief operating officer, points out that
the video-rental business remains strong, and sometimes even
accelerates, in tough times.
   Another retailer that is moving ahead with expansion is
Barneys New York, a high-fashion retailer that earlier this
year opened its first West Coast store in Orange County's
tony South Coast Plaza. "We don't react to short-term
business cycles," says Robert Pressman, executive vice
president.
   With its high-fashion inventory, Barneys has some built-in
protection against recession. "When the economy turns down,
rich people are still rich people," says Carl Steidtmann,
chief economist for Management Horizons, a division of Price
Waterhouse. "The true upscale market is less recession-prone,
and it's still relatively underserved."
   Barneys also has deep pockets thanks to its own cash and
the backing of Isetan Co., the Japanese retailer that has a
joint venture with Barneys. Says Mr. Pressman: "California,
and Southern California in particular, is our second-largest
customer base" after New York. Barneys plans to anchor its
West Coast expansion with a 110,000-square foot store a
diamond's throw from Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive.
   At the other end of the scale, Wal-Mart is targeting
Southern California as part of sweeping national expansion.
The Bentonville, Ark., discounter just opened a
110,000-square-foot store in Lancaster, some 50 miles from
Los Angeles, and another farther south in El Centro.
Observers expect the Wal-Mart formula of competitive pricing,
efficiency and service to give established discount chains a
run for their money.
   Another low-priced retailer, Ikea AB, is proceeding with
expansion plans, although the health of the economy will
dictate how fast and how far the Scandinavian furniture giant
moves in its new market.
   Ikea has few competitors here in the assemble-it-yourself
home-furnishings market, and is busy trying to reshape
consumers' attitudes toward knock-down furniture, but that
doesn't come cheaply. Ikea sank $2 million into a week-long
grand opening of its 240,000-square-foot store in Burbank,
north of downtown Los Angeles, which included one of the most
expensive billboard campaigns ever mounted in this car-crazy
area. The hoopla lured nearly 150,000 customers during the
launch.
   Rene Hausler, president of the Ikea West division, says
three more megastores are on the drawing board; the economy
and other factors will shape future expansion.
   Other newcomers, such as consumer electronics retailers
Silo Inc. and Good Guys Inc., are depending on deep pockets,
specialization and oceans of advertising to stake their turf.
The consumer-electronics battle will be one of the bloodiest
as the two big competitors take on market-dominant Circuit
City Stores, as well as scores of regional chains,
mom-and-pop outlets and a few struggling mass merchants.
   Silo, based in Philadelphia but owned by the U.K.'s Dixons
Group PLC, opened 15 Southern California stores in October,
all located in outlets once occupied by the defunct Federated
Group Inc. consumer electronics chain. It plans to open 15
more stores next year.
   Good Guys, San Francisco, is more narrowly focused, hoping
to skim higher-end customers by selling pricier, more
sophisticated goods and steering away from appliances. The
chain plans to have 12 Los Angeles-area outlets by the end of
next year.
   Gottschalks Inc., a Fresno, Calif., regional department
and specialty store operator, is exploiting another chink in
competitors's armor. "We're looking at secondary cities where
there's lots of growth taking place," says Joe Levy,
chairman.
   Gottschalks avoids cutting-edge trends, and brings branded
merchandise to smaller regional malls spurned by big chains
such as R.H. Macy &amp; Co. and Carter Hawley Hale Inc.
Gottschalks is targeting fast-growing areas on the periphery
of Los Angeles, and thus far the formula has been a hit.
Gottschalks is one of the few retailers anywhere to report
double-digit increases for same-store sales in 1990.
   The lure of Southern California -- and its high-end
shoppers -- has even drawn a quintessential New York
institution: The Metropolitan Museum of Art just opened shops
in Orange County and the Century City area of Los Angeles.
"We're looking for areas where the clientele is very
well-educated and has an interest in the arts," says Pat
Brugger, manager of store planning.

   Cash Didn't Bolster Stock Funds This Year

   NEW YORK -- Excuses, excuses.
   In what has become an unpleasant year-end ritual, most
stock mutual fund managers will once again have to explain
why they failed to beat the market. This year will be the
eighth in a row that the average diversified stock fund has
lagged behind the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But while 1990 may seem like just another year of
market-lagging performance, this time around fund managers
won't be able to use one of their favorite excuses. In years
past, they have often argued that their need to hold cash to
meet shareholder redemptions held them back during the raging
bull market of 1982-89. But in this year's down market,
holding cash should have helped them beat the market.
Instead, they lagged behind by 3.5 percentage points.
   "There's no getting around the fact that it's been a
dismal year for equity portfolio managers," says Gerald
Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter, a Chicago
newsletter.
   Fund managers tend to perform worse than the market for a
number of reasons. They, unlike the S&amp;P 500-stock index, are
handicapped by the annual expenses incurred by their funds.
Some managers also contend that, when it comes to rating
their performance, the S&amp;P 500 isn't the most appropriate
benchmark.
   Then there is the "cash burden." During the long climb in
stock prices from 1982 to 1989, holding any cash at all was a
drag on a fund's performance, because this prevented the fund
from being fully invested in the stock market.
   But this year, the cash-position excuse is looking flimsy.
With the stock market headed for its first down year since
1981, keeping part of a stock fund's assets in cash should
have bolstered the fund's performance this year.
   And recently, funds have held cash in record quantities.
This year, the average amount of cash held by stock funds was
never less than 10.7% of assets, according to the Investment
Company Institute, the trade group for the fund industry.
Cash holdings reached 12.9% of assets last October, the
highest level ever recorded since the institute started
gathering this data in 1961.
   Even with all that cash, the average stock fund --
excluding specialty and international funds -- still wasn't
able to beat the market. According to Lipper Analytical
Services, a Summit, N.J., fund research firm, the average
stock fund is down 6.8% so far this year, far worse than the
3.3% drop recorded by the S&amp;P 500-stock index. (These figures
are total returns, which include both share-price change and
dividends.)
   A look at fund industry history indicates that this
lackluster bear-market performance shouldn't be a great
surprise. If 1990 is included, the S&amp;P 500 has recorded a
calendar-year loss on eight occasions since 1960, which is
the first year for which Lipper Analytical has mutual fund
performance data. Of those eight years, funds beat the market
four times and trailed it in the other four.
   Why this poor performance? Holding cash is clearly a plus
when the stock market turns bearish. But it turns out that
another factor is even more important in determining whether
stock funds beat the market.
   Since 1960, the average stock fund has beaten the stock
market only 14 times in 31 years. The bulk of these
market-beating performances were clustered in two periods,
1965-68 and 1976-82. Both were stellar times for
small-company stocks.
   It seems stock funds are far more likely to beat the
market when small-company stocks are outpacing the big stocks
that make up the S&amp;P 500. "That may mean that fund managers
are risk takers, and tend to own the more aggressive stocks,"
says Mr. Perritt, the newsletter editor.
   Overall, small-company stocks have beaten the S&amp;P 500
stocks in 19 of the past 31 years, while the S&amp;P 500 stocks
have had the edge in just 12 years. (As a barometer of
small-company stocks, Ibbotson Associates' small-company
performance data were used.)
   Now take a look at when stock funds posted their 14
market-beating performances. Only one of the 14
market-beating years occurred during the 12 years when S&amp;P
500 stocks dominated -- and this happened in 1960, the first
year for which Lipper's fund data exist. By contrast, 13 of
the 14 market-beating years coincided with one of the 18
years when small-company stocks outstripped the S&amp;P 500.
   Why this pattern? Stock fund managers have a bias away
from bigger-company stocks, says A. Michael Lipper, president
of Lipper Analytical. He notes that the average fund owns
stocks with a market value of $8.7 billion, vs. a weighted
average market value of $16.3 billion for the S&amp;P 500.
   Simply looking at the average performance for all stock
funds may be misleading, says Joe Mansueto, publisher of
Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago newsletter.
   He points out that large mutual funds, because of their
size, tend to be heavily invested in larger-company stocks.
Yet when the performance of the average fund is calculated, a
$1 billion fund has as much influence on the average as a $1
million fund.
   "If you dollar-weighted the fund average, it would look a
lot more like the S&amp;P 500," Mr. Mansueto reckons.
   But he too suspects that fund managers may have
disproportionately large holdings of smaller-company stocks.
"Among professional money managers, I think they're swayed by
the studies that show that smaller companies tend to
outperform larger companies," Mr. Mansueto says.
   If this is the case, then stock funds may eventually start
beating the market once again. But for that to happen, the
much-heralded rebound in small-company stocks would also have
to occur.

   TOKYO -- Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses rose
2.8% to 469,050 units in November from 456,404 a year
earlier, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association
said.
   An association spokesman said November exports of
passenger cars to the U.S. rose 5.8% to 167,770 units,
compared with a year earlier, as the introduction of new
models continued to boost results. He said exports to the
U.S. had generally declined through September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   November's results represented an 8.8% decline from
October exports of 514,581 units. In October, vehicle exports
jumped 11% from year-earlier levels, helped by the yen's
weakness earlier in the year and the introduction of new
models.
   Shipments of passenger cars by Japanese makers rose 4% to
363,093 units from 349,048 a year earlier. Truck exports fell
1.8% to 102,559 units from 104,407. Bus exports increased 15%
to 3,398 units from 2,949.
   The value of Japanese vehicle exports rose 11% to $4.4
billion in November from $4 billion a year earlier,
reflecting the introduction by Japanese makers of
top-ofthe-line luxury models.
   Overall exports to the U.S. rose 3.3% to 196,293 units in
November from 190,099 a year earlier. The association
spokesman said the results suggest the U.S. economy, though
weak, isn't declining sharply.
   Exports by Toyota Motor Corp. rose 3.2% to 127,837 units.
Those by Nissan Motor Co. climbed 9.7% to 84,304 units. And
shipments by Mazda Motor Corp. increased 2.2% to 70,852
units.

   After spending the past eight years lying comatose in a
bed, fed by a tube running into her stomach, Nancy Cruzan has
died. For years, a fierce public debate raged over whether
the proper course of care -- keeping her alive with feeding
machinery or withdrawing it -- was moral, humane, ethical or
legal. The case was brought before a series of courts,
including the U.S. Supreme Court. For us, this is the key
revelation of the Cruzan story -- that judges and only judges
settled it.
   No one would deny that the plight of a Nancy Cruzan, and
many other hopelessly ill people, raises difficult questions
of morality and conscience. And maybe there was a time, now
gone, when these questions would be resolved by a family, its
doctor and its clergyman. However the matter was resolved,
life would go on for that family, as it would for other
families as they passed through these periods of seemingly
unbearable distress. But no more.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In America now, nothing is allowed to be merely personal.
Instead, it is a matter of "policy" that simply must be
"debated" at great length in public, no matter how grotesque
or obscene the spectacle of conducting such business around
the bent form of a woman in a vegetative state.
   Fifty cents sometimes lets you call a TV station to vote
thumbs up or down on who gets the kids, whether Nancy Cruzan
lives, whether the whale dies. Conferences are routinely held
around such issues now, with the participants boarding planes
to fly for hours to cities and spend several nights in a
hotel to argue from morning until late afternoon about the
ethics of such cases. The discussion at these events is often
interesting, too. Quite interesting.
   But in our country, talk, no matter how well argued, is
taken by the combatants to be merely talk. What they want is
a law or a judgment. They want a judge to use his authority
to posit a right, and "settle" the debate. And indeed, in
June, the Supreme Court ruled, 5 to 4, that a citizen has a
"right to die." But being jurists rather than high priests,
the Justices also ruled that the Cruzan family hadn't met
Missouri's "heightened evidentiary standards," thereby
requiring a succession of legal interventions and
counter-interventions by "right to life" advocates, before a
Missouri judge finally ruled that it was OK to stop the
feeding machine.
   In his concurrence to the Cruzan decision, Justice Scalia
warned that the Court "will destroy itself" if it continues
to take up controversies wherever human irrationality and
oppression may theoretically occur. We would take Justice
Scalia's warning to its corollary: This society will damage
its civil cohesion if it insists on making judges arbiters of
disputes that should be matters mainly of morality mediated
by conscience.
   One might answer that what could be called the "common
conscience" of American society about such matters has been
divided in our time. That is true, but our apparent inability
to reform a common conscience to any degree without resort to
lawsuits at leasts suggests the decline of institutions that
once helped individuals find their way.
   We particularly have in mind the organized churches and
their administrators and teachers, who essentially decided
during the past 20 years that people could fend for
themselves on matters of personal morality while the churches
joined the "struggle" to establish social "rights" whose
imprimatur comes from the courts, America's unique bishopric.
   About 350 years ago, when the affairs of dying at the end
of one's life were better understood, John Donne asked: "What
is so intricate, so entangling as death? Who ever got out of
a winding sheet?" Nancy Cruzan, entangled eight years in
publicity, is now in peace. As a society we somehow have to
rediscover what we already know as individuals and families
-- that death's intricacies are beyond the grasp of codes or
judges.

   Regarding your Dec. 10 article about the Department of
Justice and the House Judiciary Committee concerning the
Inslaw matter:
   The attorney general has directed that the department
cooperate fully with the committee's investigation and, as a
result, the department has provided hundreds of thousands of
documents to the committee, including documents related to
the pending litigation with Inslaw.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The department went so far as to obtain a court order to
permit the committee access to certain Inslaw software, which
culminated in the recent delivery of a truckload of material
to the committee.
   The small fraction of material the department has not
turned over to the committee is protected by a fundamental
principal of the American legal system that keeps documents
revealing the thought processes of litigators confidential.
The documents in dispute are the memos and notes of
departmental attorneys assigned to defend the U.S. in the
litigation brought by Inslaw and are not factual materials
that would be evidence in the pending case.
   By the same token, the government would be unable to
obtain comparable documents from Inslaw. In fact, such
documents, whether they belong to Inslaw or the U.S., cannot
be obtained by the opposing party in litigation. The
disclosure of the department's documents could be construed
to permit access by Inslaw, which would be fundamentally
unfair to the U.S. -- to the detriment of the American
taxpayers, who stand to lose more than $9 million in this
litigation.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Acuson Corp. said it was ordered
to pay a $6.3 million award plus legal fees and costs as the
result of an arbitrated settlement over a marketing dispute
with Advanced Technology Laboratories, a unit of Westmark
International Inc.
   At the center of the dispute are claims of false and
misleading advertising made by both companies. The Acuson ad
campaign compared the resolution of its ultrasound imaging
with ATL's ultrasound equipment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The advertisements appeared in brochures and trade
magazines, said Robert J. Gallagher, Acuson's chief financial
officer.
   "We don't think any award is justified, and we certainly
can't comprehend an award of this size," Mr. Gallagher said.
He said the compay will investigate the arbitration process
to make sure the rules were followed. Because both parties
agreed to accept the decision of the private arbitrator, the
only redress Acuson can seek against the judgment is to find
an irregularity in the process.
   Dennis C. Fill, the chairman and chief executive officer
of Westmark, said he was pleased with the verdict but was
legally enjoined from elaborating on the judgment.
   Mr. Fill said a federal judge in Seattle who approved the
arbitration will review the sales and advertising practices
of both companies.
   Acuson's stock closed at $27, down $1.625 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Westmark stock closed
at $26.25, unchanged in national over-the-counter trading.

   NEW YORK -- A group including U S West Inc., Millicom Inc.
and a Russian eye surgeon signed a preliminary agreement with
the Soviet Union's Ministry of Communications to provide
cellular phone service in Moscow.
   The companies and Millicom's Soviet partner Svyatoslaz
Fyodorov, a Moscow-based eye surgeon and entrepreneur, are
still negotiating a definitive pact, including financial
terms and a network equipment supply contract, according to a
Millicom spokeswoman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, she said the companies expect to begin service by
the third quarter of 1991 and plan to jointly bid on cellular
service projects in other Soviet cities.
   U S West, Englewood, Colo., is one of the regional Bell
telephone companies. Millicom, New York, is a cellular and
paging services company.
   Moscow's cellular plan calls for the group, including U S
West International Holdings Inc., a U S West unit, and
Millicom International Cellular S.A.R.L., a Millicom
affiliate, to run one of two networks in the Soviet capital.
The group also includes the Moscow Territorial Operational
Center for Long Distance and International Circuits, Voronezh
Research-Production Association and the Moscow Local

   Predictions '90:
   Better Luck
   Next Year

   A number of years ago a writer for a British magazine sat
down to mull over the next decade. Looking back at his
previous predictions, the only thing the writer was
absolutely sure of was that what he had predicted would not
come true.
   Nineteen-ninety was that kind of year. Looking back at my
own work, I see that I thought budget director Dick Darman
was smarter than he's proved to be, Chief of Staff John
Sununu wiser than he's proved, and (regarding Iraq, if not
Congress) George Bush less determined than he's proving.
Other than that it was a pretty good year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To the many Washingtonians I nicked during the year, I
offer revenge in the form of the following from a May 11
column:
   "To believe a Bush `sellout' on taxes you have to believe
that he, Chief of Staff John Sununu and Treasury Secretary
Nick Brady are stupid enough to give up their party's best
political issue without solving the budget problem. Only the
White House press corps could really believe this." Profuse
apologies to the White House press corps.
   Or consider the wild optimism contained in a Jan. 5
column: That month's Social Security tax increase, I wrote,
"may be the last tax hike before the tax cuts of the 1990s."
At least I still have nine more years to be vindicated on the
tax cuts.
   In November, I used the word "comfortable" to describe New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley's likely re-election -- only days
before he barely squeaked by. I had sensed his trouble, but
lapsed into conventional caution. The lesson: When in doubt,
throw the long ball.
   With that in mind (and atonement behind me), let's move on
to even bolder error in 1991:
                                                                                                       

   The next senior official to leave the Bush administration
will be? (It's fun to start with the easy ones.)
                                                                                                       

   The tax-hike troika -- Messrs. Brady, Darman and Sununu --
show no sign of leaving, much less of contrition. Everyone
says the "long knives" are out for John Sununu, but all that
matters are the short daggers held by George and Barbara
Bush. So far they're sheathed.
   The listing ship at Treasury will try for calm by reducing
the influence of its international undersecretary, David
Mulford, while Dick Darman will rebuild his influence by
privately convincing Rep. Newt Gingrich that he really wants
tax cuts. No, the likeliest departure is HUD Secretary Jack
Kemp, after his pro-growth agenda is dashed against the rocks
of "pay-as-you-go" budgeting. That is, unless Mr. Bush grants
Mr. Kemp's request to be U.S. Trade rep, succeeding the next
Supreme Court nominee, Carla Hills.
                                                                                                       

   The man running the U.S.S.R. a year from now will be?
                                                                                                       

   KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov or Russian Republican Boris
Yeltsin are obvious choices. The trick answer is no one,
since the U.S.S.R. will cease to exist. But the best answer
is Mikhail Gorbachev, fronting for the Kryuchkov policies.
                                                                                                       

   Political blame for the deep, painful recession will go
to?
                                                                                                       

   Choose your villain: Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, who denied a capital-gains tax cut; overzealous
keep-me-off-the-Senate-witness-list bank regulators; Bush
administration tax-and-spenders; or steal-the-punch-bowl
central bankers. The answer is none of the above. Washington
will finally get its long-awaited recession and blame it on
Reaganomics. Supply-siders were going to get the blame for
this one even if the recovery had lasted 20 years.
                                                                                                       

   President Bush's most formidable political challenge will
come from?
                                                                                                       

   Discount Mario Cuomo, diminished by New York's budget
implosion, and Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, who misjudged his
president's resolve to fight a war. Congressional Majority
Leaders Mitchell and Dick Gephardt will override vetoes, but
the real threat will be the looming New Hampshire
favorite-son primary candidacy of retiring GOP Sen. Gordon
Humphrey. He could win a president-embarrassing third of the
vote.
                                                                                                       

   The new non-Iraq foreign-policy crisis will be triggered
by?
                                                                                                       

   Bet on a refugee diaspora from the Soviet Union over the
Saddam Hussein-inspired murder of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak or
Indo-Pak nuclear-bomb rattling. But the big trouble will be
internal Chinese turmoil after Deng Xiaoping finally joins
the Great Helmsman in the sky. Bet on the family of military
warlord Yang Shangkun.
                                                                                                       

   The domestic political surprise of 1991 will be?
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Bush fails to renominate Alan Greenspan as Federal
Reserve chairman, in favor of a 1992 money-easer; Supreme
Court Justice David Souter stares decisis in the face and
refuses to overturn Roe v. Wade; the Senate gives a mere slap
on the wrist to four of the Keating Five (Alan Cranston is a
sacrificial lame duck), as it rallies to Hawaii Democrat
Daniel Inouye's "everyone does it" defense. The answer is all
of the above.
                                                                                                       

   The rising political star?
                                                                                                       

   House Banking Chairman Henry Gonzalez, who is chastened
enough by his warning from the Democratic Caucus to demagog
banking reform as a GOP "bailout for the rich."
                                                                                                       

   The falling political star?
                                                                                                       

   Texas Republican Phil Gramm, who tries to mediate between
conservatives and the White House but satisfies neither.
                                                                                                       

   And, of course, Iraq:
                                                                                                       

   The fashion on the right is to predict another Bush
defeat, but I'm a contrarian. The commander in chief is
serious about going to war unless Saddam pulls out of every
last inch of Kuwait; and if there is a war, the U.S. wins in
less than a month. Let's hope that, unlike 1990, this isn't
the triumph of hope over experience.

   Hamilton Urges
   Fed to Ease Up
   Further on Credit

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the congressional Joint
Economic Committee urged the Federal Reserve to cut interest
rates further to assure that the recent budget agreement
doesn't worsen the economic slowdown.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, (D., Ind.) said Congress should stick
with the agreement. Some lawmakers have suggested at least
considering breaking the agreement, which raised taxes and
cut spending in order to narrow the deficit by $500 billion
through 1995. The idea would be to pass new programs or cut
taxes to ease the effects of the downturn -- even though
doing so would increase the deficit. In fact, under the
agreement, if the government officially forecasts a recession
-- two consecutive quarters of decline in output of goods and
services -- lawmakers would have to consider setting the
budget agreement aside.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'm afraid any such stimulation of that sort would only
aggravate our problems," Mr. Hamilton said at a news
conference. He said scrapping the budget pact would "make the
credibility {problems} of the budget deficit agreement even
greater, and complicate life for the Fed in trying to ease
monetary rates."
   Mr. Hamilton, who was delivering an annual report on the
economy, said the Fed should cut short-term interest rates at
least another one-quarter of a percentage point just to
offset the chilling effects of the deficit-reduction
agreement.
   The congressman said hewing to the budget agreement would
be the best thing Congress and the Bush administration could
do to give the Fed leeway to cut rates.
   Mr. Hamilton said, however, that he believes the
government should extend unemployment benefits, as it has
done in previous recessions, "in order to cushion the human
costs." Unemployment benefit programs, which are operated by
both the federal government and the states, have been cut
back across the country in recent years. The proportion of
unemployed people receiving benefits has dropped from about
50% 10 years ago to about 33% today as requirements have
toughened.
   Mr. Hamilton said he believes the unemployment rate, which
was at 5.9% in November, could reach 8% during this
recession. He didn't offer a specific proposal for increasing
benefits, but the budget agreement allows increases in
spending if they are matched by spending cuts elsewhere.
   Mr. Hamilton said he favors looking for further ways to
reduce the deficit when the economy picks up. He said he is
concerned that the current package won't cut the deficit
enough to raise the national savings rate to its level during
the 1960s and 1970s.
   "Fully restoring the level of savings will require an
additional $80 billion of budget savings in fiscal year '95,"
Mr. Hamilton said. He didn't offer any specific budget cuts,
but he said "we will need either further spending cuts, or we
will need another package deal" including tax increases.

   Electronics Makers Are Wooing Women
   After Years of Taking Them for Granted

   After decades of picturing their customers as young men,
consumer electronics makers are waking up to the fact that
women buy gadgets, too.
   In the December issue of Elle magazine, an advertisement
for Pioneer Electronic Corp. is tucked among the pungent
perfume ads and glossy fashion spreads. Tandy Corp. is
opening a chain called the Edge in Electronics with a homey
decor designed to put female shoppers at ease. And Sharp
Corp. says it is consciously eschewing advertising in men's
magazines like Playboy and Penthouse that might offend women.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Women don't represent a new market -- just an ignored one.
Although women account for half of all sales in many product
categories, marketers have rarely bothered to sell directly
to them. Last year, the industry bought only seven pages of
ads in Working Woman magazine, up from a paltry quarter page
in 1987. "The attention the industry gives to readers of our
magazine is minimal," says Carol Taber, publisher of Working
Woman.
   One consequence of marketers' neglect: While plenty of
women buy consumer electronics products, few seem to relish
the experience. Consider Laura Matalon Waller, a theatrical
press agent and marketing consultant. Although she loves to
shop and has bought stereo components, a microwave oven and a
laptop computer, she didn't enjoy doing it. "Stereo equipment
just doesn't excite me," she says. "There's just nothing
about these products that makes you want to browse the
stores."
   When Lori Levin, director of corporate communications at
Virgin Atlantic Airways, decided she wanted a camcorder to
tape her two-month-old daughter, researching her options was
frustrating. "I was ready to spend a lot of money, but the
attitude I got when I was trying to understand how the
equipment worked was `Don't worry, your husband will figure
it out.'"
   There may also be a sociological component to women's
apathy. "It's like math fear," says Faith Popcorn, chairman
of BrainReserve, a marketing consulting firm. "We just didn't
grow up putting model airplanes together."
   Of course, plenty of women overcome that anxiety. They
accounted for a hefty 40% of all videocassette recorder sales
within the past 12 months, according to a study by New
York-based Simmons Market Research Bureau Inc. Women also
purchased 41% of all compact disk players and 58% of all
console stereo systems.
   It's no coincidence that marketers' sensitivity to women
is rising at a time when new customers are desperately
needed. After a decade of feverish new product activity,
there are no blockbuster innovations in sight. Sales of most
existing lines, including VCRs and most stereo equipment, are
flat. At the same time, competition continues to drive down
some prices.
   What's more, marketers of consumer electronics products
say the demographic profile of their consumers changes over
the life of the product. "You generally get the very upscale,
very `techie' person with a new technology, and they tend to
be male," says Stan Hametz, vice president and general
manager of Panasonic's VHS division. "When the product
becomes more of a commodity item, its appeal broadens to all
consumer segments."
   Now companies are scrambling to convert women's
indifference to the industry into an opportunity. Hachette
Publications Inc. has begun putting out a quarterly magazine
called Sound &amp; Image that's designed to appeal to women as
well as men. Hachette, which also publishes such macho
handbooks as Stereo Review and Car Stereo Review, says
advertisers are interested in a publication that will reach
well-heeled female "techies."
   When BBDO Los Angeles/San Francisco made its pitch for
Pioneer's advertising account last fall, it strongly
recommended targeting women, according to Ron Harrison,
senior vice president and director of media services for the
agency. To help cultivate brand loyalty among women, the
Omnicom Group unit encouraged the company to include Elle
magazine in its current image campaign, which is also running
in such general interest magazines as Time and Newsweek.
   To broaden its appeal, Panasonic Co., a unit of Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co., advertises in such publications as
American Baby and Gourmet and passes out brochures for its
camcorders at child birth classes. The company is also
running ads for an array of products in general interest
magazines like People.
   "Camcorders used to be men's toys, but now they are family
decisions," says Panasonic's Mr. Hametz.
   But many companies seem destined for a rough ride up the
learning curve. Even as Panasonic tries to appeal to the
family, it takes a very male perspective. In one radio spot
set in a hospital delivery room, a father-to-be and an
obstetrician become entranced by the lightweight camera, just
as mom enters the last stages of labor. Carol Colman, founder
of Colman Consulting Inc., believes that situation will turn
off women. "Nobody wants to remember the moments just before
childbirth," she says.
   And though Sharp Electronics has been aiming its ads at
women for years, some misfire. One print ad for its Wizard
series of electronic organizers shows a man and a woman, both
in business dress, sitting on a flight of steps. But while
the man pushes the buttons on the electronic gadget to get a
readout of his schedule for the day, his female companion is

   Amex to Start Campaign
                                                                                                       

   The American Stock Exchange, following the lead of the
nation's other big stock markets, next weekend will launch an
ad campaign promoting its image.
   The ads, which will run in publications like the New York
Times and The Wall Street Journal, target companies that
might be candidates for listing on the exchange --
specifically the mid-sized growth companies it specializes
in. The campaign, themed "It's time you traded up," was
developed by Follis &amp; Verdi, a New York ad agency.
   Amex, which is a distant third behind the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq in market volume, attacks Nasdaq head-on
in some of the ads, citing the advantages of market
specialists and Amex's narrower spread between "bid" and
"asked" quotes. Amex Chairman James R. Jones said he decided
a year ago that "the image of Amex -- what our strengths and
niches were -- wasn't clear."
   Both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq began similar
ad campaigns earlier this year.

   MONTREAL -- Air Canada said it will seek to sell at least
a majority interest in its enRoute corporate travel credit
card unit.
   Gary Lynch, president and chief executive of enRoute, said
the unit is profitable, but he declined to provide revenue
and net income figures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Lynch said enRoute has about 300,000 cardholders,
mainly in Canada. The enRoute credit card was introduced in
the U.S. two years ago. The card is accepted by more than 200
airlines and about 15,000 hotels, restaurants and other
concerns.
   Air Canada, the country's largest carrier, said it decided
to sell at least a majority stake in the enRoute unit to
allow it to concentrate on its core airline business. Mr.
Lynch said Air Canada hasn't indicated how large a minority
stake it would be willing to retain in enRoute.
   Air Canada recently cut about 2,900 jobs, or 12.5% of its
work force, and suspended service on three international
routes. For 1990's first nine months, Air Canada's net income
dropped 45% to C$50 million, or 68 Canadian cents a share,
from the year-earlier period. Revenue was C$3.04 billion.

   Fourth Quarter

   Big beverage companies are expected to report strong
earnings gains for the fourth quarter, as consumers continue
to drink more soft drinks and embrace new brands of beer.
   Coca-Cola Co.'s earnings may jump as much as 25% from the
1989 fourth quarter, and PepsiCo Inc.'s increase may be even
greater, analysts estimate. Anheuser-Busch Cos. is seen
posting an earnings gain of 11% to 23%. Adolph Coors Co. is
expected to report flat or reduced earnings for the fourth
quarter but a gain of 50% or more for the year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "People don't cut back on things that give them pleasure
if it's a small amount of money," said Martin Romm, a First
Boston Corp. analyst. Nevertheless, analysts are predicting
slower earnings growth for beverage concerns in 1991.
   For Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which is expected to post
fourth-quarter earnings of about 45 cents a share, the story
remains the same: strong performance overseas, where the
company gets 80% of its profits. Coca-Cola will probably meet
its goal of increasing shipments of concentrate overseas by
8% to 10% in 1990, analysts said.
   The company's investments in Japan and Europe, including a
high-speed canning facility that opened last May in Dunkirk,
France, and a high-speed canning and bottling facility that
opened last June in Wakefield, England, are paying off in
continued sales growth.
   Coca-Cola, which gets about one-fourth of its
international sales from the European Community, also
benefited from the weak dollar, analysts said.
   At home, Coca-Cola's fourth-quarter volume is up 5% or
more, according to some analysts, including a boost of one or
two percentage points from Burger King restaurants' switch to
Coke from Pepsi.
   As Wendy's restaurants start making the same conversion,
sales of Coke at the fountain may grow faster than sales of
bottled and canned Coke, despite the slowdown in the
restaurant industry, said Roy Burry, a Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
analyst.
   Analysts predict per-share earnings of $1.95 to $2.10 for
Coca-Cola in 1990, up about 20% from last year.
   For PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., analysts see
fourth-quarter earnings of 32 cents to 36 cents a share,
bringing fiscal-year earnings to about $1.35, or an increase
of 19% from 1989. The company said it is comfortable with
that estimate. In the year-earlier fourth quarter, PepsiCo
net was 27 cents a share excluding a onetime charge of two
cents a share, which means fourth-quarter per-share net could
be up by as much as 44%.
   Although volume growth for Pepsi's soft-drink business
slowed in the fourth quarter, to between 1% and 3%, the
company is reaping big benefits from new price strategies in
its restaurant chains, and from cost-control measures such as
the distribution of hand-held computers to cut down on paper
work, analysts said.
   "They're very, very good at squeezing costs out of the
business," said Emanuel Goldman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst
who sees a 24% earnings gain for PepsiCo in 1991, despite the
recession.
   PepsiCo's Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken chains have
lowered their average menu price by introducing items such as
a 59-cent taco. Taco Bell's traffic was up 14%, and Kentucky
Fried Chicken's was up 13% during the fourth quarter, making
up in volume what was lost with the lower prices, said Joseph
J. Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Mr. Burry of Kidder Peabody expects PepsiCo's restaurant
business to show a 23% profit gain, to 32 cents a share, for
the year. Next year, he said, restaurant earnings will likely
grow 18%.
   Mr. Romm of First Boston said the Frito-Lay snack division
also helped PepsiCo, with a 5% to 6% growth in volume and
rising overseas profit margins.
   Beer consumption has been rising at a snail's pace in
recent years, but Anheuser-Busch is showing strong volume
gain at year end. Mr. Goldman expects Anheuser-Busch's
fourth-quarter retail sales to rise 6%, compared with 2% or
less for the industry. Meanwhile, shipments to wholesalers
are up by about 14%.
   Analysts are split on whether the surge means that liquor
stores and drinkers are stocking up in advance of a Jan. 1
federal excise tax hike, or simply that the company didn't
make enough beer to satisfy demand this summer.
   Mr. Burry said Anheuser-Busch's sales volumes are still
benefiting from a price cut late last year. Also, Bud Dry may
have added 1.5 million barrels, or nearly 2%, to
Anheuser-Busch's volume, even after accounting for the
drinkers who switched to Bud Dry from other Anheuser-Busch
brands.
   Anheuser-Busch's food division is expected to show
improved results as Eagle snack-food losses decline, but Sea
World, a Florida water park that Anheuser-Busch bought last
year, continues to hurt the company. Analysts said the park
will cost 15 cents a share in earnings dilution this year,
adding that a recession and high gasoline prices won't help
attendance.
   Most analysts see the company posting earnings of 50 cents
a share for the quarter, bringing fiscal-year earnings to
$2.95, up 10% from last year.
   Coors, of Golden, Colo., is expected to report earnings of
anywhere from nine cents a share to 20 cents. Analysts are
unsure if the year-old Keystone beer brand will continue to
pump up sales. George Thompson of Prudential-Bache Securities
said Coors Light, like other light beers, is continuing to do
well, but Coors's total beer sales may have dropped slightly
in the fourth quarter because other Coors brands are
fizzling. Flat earnings are projected for Coors next year.

   Retailing:
   Gasoline Prices
   Fall Nine Cents
   At the Pumps

   HOUSTON -- Gasoline pump prices plunged an average of
nearly nine cents a gallon over the last week and could drop
a bit more because of weakening demand and excess supplies.
   The decline in the average price of selfservice regular
unleaded is the biggest decline since the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait Aug. 2. Gasoline fell 8.9 cents a gallon to $1.28 in
the week ended yesterday, according to a survey by the
American Automobile Association.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Gasoline is finally coming under the pressure of lower
crude prices," said Thomas Manning, a vice president of
Purvin &amp; Gertz Inc., a Houston-based oil consulting firm.
Crude prices have dropped from their peak of more than $40 in
October to finish yesterday at $27.01 a barrel in trading on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. "Gasoline prices were slow
to come down" in response to falling crude prices, Mr.
Manning acknowledged.
   In fact, an AAA spokesman in Orlando, Fla., noted that
gasoline wholesale prices have been falling for at least a
month, but dealers weren't passing along the reduction to
drivers. "To our mind this price drop was overdue," he said.
   "This follows historical trends," the AAA spokesman said.
"We had very rapid increases in the prices of fuel following
the Exxon Valdez spill and then it took many months for
prices to come down."
   Some oil companies also suggested the slow downward
movement in retail prices isn't their fault. "We don't set
pump prices," said a spokesman for Chevron Corp. in San
Francisco. The company began cutting the price it charges its
dealers in mid-November, he said. Chevron, like other major
oil companies, does own and operate some gasoline stations,
but the spokesman said prices at those outlets are based on
local competition.
   Oil company officials have previously maintained that
gasoline prices wouldn't fall sharply because they never went
up proportionately as much as crude did.
   While gasoline prices fell last week, they are still about
21 cents a gallon higher than before the invasion.
Nationally, the latest price includes a nickel-a-gallon
increase in the federal gasoline tax that went into effect
this month.
   The post-invasion peak of $1.39 a gallon was hit the week
of Dec. 4, right after the new tax was levied. Prices could
fall further, barring a Persian Gulf war. "Gasoline demand
has been down, mostly as a result of the higher prices," the
Chevron spokesman said. Mr. Manning of Purvin &amp; Gertz
estimates that gasoline demand in 1990 may have declined as
much as 0.5% and could be sluggish in 1991, too. "Next year
isn't going to be good for gasoline demand," he said. "The
weak economy cuts it down."
   In addition, gasoline inventories are high, putting more
downward pressure on prices. The American Petroleum Institute
yesterday reported that while gasoline inventories fell a bit
last week, they were 1.9 million barrels ahead of last year's
levels.
   "There's an awful lot of crude on the market, too," Mr.
Manning noted. "All the (price) pressures are pointing down,"
he said. The only upward pressure remains the possibility of
war in the Middle East.

   Computer Firm Servicing Exchanges
   Expects Partial Backup by Next Year

   NEW YORK -- When smoke forced 60 workers to evacuate two
floors of a Manhattan office building early yesterday
morning, it shut down the nerve center of the U.S. stock
market.
   The Securities Industry Automation Corp. is the generally
unseen computerized engine behind the trading of many
millions of shares on the New York, American and regional
stock exchanges.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Formed in 1972 through a merger of the data processing
facilities of the New York and American exchanges, the
company processes the stock quotations from all of the
nation's major exchanges. It puts out the consolidated tape
of prices of all exchange-listed stocks, among other
services.
   The stream of price and volume information from the
exchanges on stock trades that are processed by the company
give market makers, specialists and investors the same
information, and therefore an equal chance at bargaining for
stocks.
   When business operates as usual, the company goes
unnoticed. But disruptions such as yesterday's evacuation
emphasize how dependent the nation's stock exchanges are on
computers.
   To prevent such disruptions, the company is completing a
backup facility in downtown Brooklyn. Nearly 60,000 feet of
office space have been developed there to house facilities
similar to the two acres of office space in lower Manhattan
where the company is housed.
   By the middle of next year, enough computers should have
been moved to the Brooklyn facility to provide full backup
service to handle a normal day's trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, said Richard Leyh, executive vice president
and chief of operations. However, a complete backup system
for services to all U.S. exchanges won't be available until
1992, Mr. Leyh said.
   By next summer, he said, the Brooklyn facility should be
able to provide backup for the Big Board's SuperDot system,
which routes member firm's orders to appropriate specialists,
or market makers, and back to member firms. SuperDot accounts
for 80% to 90% of Big Board volume, Mr. Leyh said.
   Some traders complain, however, that until the company can
provide instant backup service, its owners will remain
vulnerable to competition from offshore and other trading
services.
   None of the company's computers were damaged yesterday,
and power wasn't cut off, Mr. Leyh said. Trading was delayed
because New York City environmental officials sealed the
building until tests showed there was no evidence of
contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. The
chemical is often used in electrical transformers like the
one that exploded early yesterday outside the company's Water
Street offices.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Census Data Dim Democrats' White House Hopes
   As Growth Was Greater in Republican States

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Democrats are worrying that in the past
several days the job of recapturing the White House may have
grown even more difficult.
   The population shifts that undergird the new Census Bureau
reapportionment figures have been going on for years, but
only this week has the political map been adjusted to reflect
them. The government's new decennial atlas of American
politics makes it clear that the path to the White House goes
through firmly Republican territory.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The first message from these figures is that the
Democrats' trouble just got worse," says Larry Bartels, a
University of Rochester political scientist who is an expert
in presidential elections. "They needed a new strategy even
if there weren't going to be adjustments in the Electoral
College, but it's particularly critical now that the map is
changing."
   The political changes that are being ushered in by the new
population figures go far beyond the shifts in the size of
congressional delegations in 21 states and the emergence of
California, Texas and Florida, whose combined delegations
comprise about a quarter of the House. The number of votes in
the Electoral College is the total of each state's House and
Senate members, giving increased power in presidential
elections to several states that are safely Republican and
decreasing the Electoral College votes of several states that
are within the Democrats' grasp in presidential elections.
   Presidential elections, to be sure, are shaped by
important geopolitical and economic factors, and the Persian
Gulf crisis that remains unresolved as President Bush
approaches his third year in power may be more important in
1992 than any long-term voter trends. Even so, Democrats
worry that the new figures released by the Census Bureau may
make their challenge even tougher.
   "Just by sheer population trends alone, the Republicans
gained a huge leg up in the next election," says Paul Maslin,
a Democratic political strategist. "Every 10 years that go by
is going to mean the geography is even worse."
   The states of Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina,
Arizona and Virginia, considered safe or probable Republican
states in the 1992 election and perhaps beyond, gained a
total of 11 electoral votes as a result of the figures the
Census Bureau released this week. New York, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Iowa and West Virginia, considered
safe or probable Democratic states in a reasonably close
election, lost a total of 10 electoral votes.
   That's bad news for a party that has lost all but three of
the 10 presidential elections after the Roosevelt-Truman era.
Moreover, the new geography of politics has already amplified
the cries within the Democratic Party for an overhaul of its
strategies and policies.
   "We need Democrats who can win in areas that are growing,
Democrats that are pro-growth, pro-opportunity, pro-family,
tough on crime and have a sense of limited government but who
aren't anti-government," says Alvin From, executive director
of the Democratic Leadership Council, which styles itself as
a forum for moderate Democrats. "The census only reinforces
the need for Democrats to change."
   The Census Bureau figures underline the growing importance
of California, both in the House and in presidential
elections, and it signals a glimmer of hope for Democrats
thirsty for victory in presidential elections. Nearly one out
of eight members of the House that will be elected in
November 1992 will be from California; the state's 52 seats
will be by far the largest congressional delegation in
history.
   But in the past two presidential elections, where liberal
Democrats have run against conservative Republicans, the
Democrats have done slightly better in California than in the
rest of the country. Democrats felt that if Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis had run a better campaign in 1988 the
Democrats could have won California, which hasn't fallen in
the Democratic column since Lyndon Johnson's 1964 landslide,
and taken a sweep of the Pacific coast.
   GOP political theorist Kevin Philips believes that if the
Democrats do prevail in California, they could win a
presidential election without even carrying the popular vote.
   In any case, virtually no Democratic strategy for winning
the White House can succeed without California and its 54
electoral votes. Barring a political upheaval or the
emergence of a strong issue such as an unsuccessful
resolution of the Gulf crisis that penalizes the Republicans,
the GOP can get to about 200 of the 270 electoral votes
required for victory with their natural base, which now
includes many states in the deep South. With California and
one other large state such as Ohio or Michigan, both of which
have fallen into GOP hands repeatedly, they are over the top.
   The Census Bureau figures put the population movements of
the past decade, and their political implications, in sharp
relief. As it has since the earliest days of the 19th
century, the U.S. political power center is moving west; the
northeastern states, which comprised more than half the
representation in the first Congress and more than a quarter
of the House when the western frontier officially disappeared
in 1890, will have only a fifth of the House in the 102nd
Congress.
   The population shift away from the so-called Frostbelt
states, a dramatic feature of the 1980 census, has continued.
"The balance of power is shifting to the `Sunbelt,'" says
Candis Penn, executive director of the Southern Governors
Association. "The country may not realize it now, but once
reapportionment gets under way it will be very clear."
   The implications for the House remain murky, however.
Although Democrats have had scant success in presidential
elections, they have built up large majorities in the House
while the Republicans have struggled to find credible House
candidates and to elect them.
   "The fact that Bush carried so many states in 1988 may be
overblown in these calculations," says William O'Hare,
director of policy studies for the non-partisan Population
Research Bureau. "People vote differently for Congress than
they do for president, and you can't carry the presidential
interpretation too far."
   Now that the numbers are out, the real politics gets under
way. The states begin their redistricting processes next
spring, using census data to reshape districts for the state
legislature as well as for Congress.
   And in Washington, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
must make the politically charged decision by mid-July on
whether to adjust the 1990 figures to correct for the
undercount of minorities and the poor. The latest wrinkle:
Commerce officials dread being caught in the crossfire when
it becomes clear that blacks likely would gain representation
but Hispanics probably would lose from a statistical
adjustment.

   Commodities:
   Pork-Belly Futures Prices Are Chilled by News
   That More Supplies Are Going Into Cold Storage

   CHICAGO -- Pork-belly futures prices tumbled on a report
that larger supplies of the product, which is used to make
bacon, are moving into cold storage.
   The weekly cold-storage report showed a growing number of
frozen pork bellies in stock, and this chilled the price of
the contract for February delivery 1.92 cents, just shy of
the daily limit of two cents. The contract settled at 62.87
cents a pound. The price of the hog futures contract for
February delivery, meanwhile, rose 0.10 cent to 48.82 cents a
pound as some traders unwound short positions in live hog
futures.

   One factor pressuring pork futures prices downward is the
expectation that hog slaughter will increase, said Thomas
Morgan, president of Sterling Research, of Arlington Heights,
Ill. He said cold weather in the Midwest has slowed the
movement of hogs to market, and when the weather warms large
movements of hogs are expected.
   In cattle futures, prices were down on weakness in the
wholesale market, a good gauge of how interested retailers
are in featuring beef products in their stores. Analysts said
pork is priced cheaply in relation to beef, so retailers have
tended to feature pork. The cattle contract for February
delivery declined 0.32 cents to 77.25 cents a pound.
   Analysts expect trading in pork futures to be light until
Jan. 4, when the U.S. Agriculture Department's hog and pig
report will be released. It will contain inventories of hogs
by class and weight.
   Analysts have trouble predicting the contents of these
reports with any degree of certainty, and the futures market
often moves the daily price limit up or down on the trading
day after a report is released. So traders are wary of taking
large positions in pork futures just before the reports are
due.
   News out of the Soviet Union, which is having such a
strong effect on grain markets, isn't causing much activity
in livestock and meat futures, analysts said. "There isn't
much red meat that is cheap enough for the Soviet Union to
buy," says Sterling's Mr. Morgan. "Realistically, if the U.S.
is going to export any meat to the Soviet Union, it will be
chicken legs."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude-oil prices declined as traders shunned the
holiday markets. There was little interest in either buying
or selling oil contracts, participants said. Lack of
liquidity, a paucity of fresh news about the Persian Gulf and
the approach of year end were the primary reasons for the
lackluster market. Traders are becoming convinced that war
with Iraq is inevitable, a belief that should buoy prices.
During the last 48 hours, the U.S. government has warned
American citizens remaining in Jordan to leave as soon as
possible. And there have been reports that Jordan is building
up manpower along the cease-fire border it shares with Israel
in case of a surprise attack from that country. Both actions,
as well as the purchase of additional jet fuel by the Saudi
Arabian government, are being perceived as harbingers of war.
But barring major developments in the Middle East, traders
expect quiet markets through year end. Additional tough talk
in the New Year, however, will likely spark additional buying
and higher prices, they say.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices fell. The March contract was off
0.20 cent a pound to 9.70 cents. Moderate speculative demand
developed and helped the March contract to rise above 10
cents, a key resistance level, to 10.01 cents. The rally,
which began Wednesday, couldn't be sustained, and the March
contract fell back. There were no fundamental developments,
and trading was mostly on a technical basis. There has been
little buying interest in the world market, which encouraged
dealers to sell contracts after the March contract rose above
10 cents, one analyst said.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices declined. The March contract was
down $27 a metric ton to $1,149. A rally that began last week
stalled yesterday as the March contract neared the $1,200
level, and prices fell back. After trading as high as $1,173,
the March contract slipped as low as $1,137 before recovering
slightly toward the close. There is no concern about supplies
of high-quality cocoa beans from the Ivory Coast, which is
one reason that rally attempts have quickly met resistance.

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks got off to a listless
start and never managed much forward momentum.
   The Nasdaq composite index ended the day down 1.35 points
to 371.05.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For a while yesterday morning, OTC stocks were the only
ones trading. An overnight transformer fire in lower
Manhattan prevented operation of vital computers and kept the
New York, American and other regional exchanges from opening
at the appointed time.
   The exchanges did open 90 minutes late, restrained by the
delay, holiday vacations and concerns about the economy and
possible war in the Middle East.
   OTC stocks opened on time, made an early move higher,
wavered at midday, then slipped in the afternoon. National
Market System volume was light at 83.8 million shares but
still an improvement on Wednesday's very slow 57.4 million.
   "It's just a lackluster market," said Charles Howley,
manager of OTC trading at Soundview Financial Group. Mr.
Howley said cautious investors were concerned about pressure
on profits at technology companies and trimmed some of those
stocks from their portfolios. Technology stocks often lead
the OTC market.
   Intel fell 1/2 to 37. Apple Computer lost 1/4 to 43 1/2
and Novell was down 7/8 to 32 1/8.
   Sun Microsystems dropped 3/4 to 22 1/8 and Microsoft
closed 1/4 lower at 74 3/4.
   "The market doesn't seem to want to go down, but it
doesn't have a real reason to go up," said Nelson Gold,
senior vice president for OTC trading at Interstate-Johnson
Lane.
   There were 939 OTC issues showing declines on the day and
824 that advanced.
   Losses in the abbreviated New York Stock Exchange session
were worse than among OTC stocks. While the Nasdaq composite
index was down 0.36%, the New York Stock Exchange composite
index fell 1.12 points, or 0.62%, to 179.48. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average dropped 11.63 points, or 0.44%, to close
at 2625.50.
   First Executive slipped 1/32 to close at 15/32 on news it
won't write new business in New Jersey until state regulators
there complete an analysis of the company's finances. New
Jersey regulators previously had demanded the troubled
insurer deposit $500 million with the state if it wanted to
continue to write business there.
   First Executive has the largest short position of any OTC
stock. Nasdaq said late Wednesday that short interest in
First Executive was 5.8 million shares, down 5% from
November.
   Short sellers sell borrowed shares in the hope they can
replace what they borrowed by buying shares later at a lower
price. Large short positions often are a bullish sign because
short sellers must buy shares to replace the borrowed shares
they already have sold.
   Medco Containment Service saw its short interest jump to
2.3 million shares from 1.2 million in the past month. Medco
added 1 1/8 to 31 1/2 on heavy volume.
   AST Research gained 5/8 to 34 3/4. This newspaper cited
AST as an example of a computer company able to carve out the
right market to resist an industry trend toward consolidation
and attrition. The story even suggested AST's growth is a
challenge to such computer celebrities as International
Business Machines and Compaq Computer.
   Wet Seal shares were off 1 1/8 to 7 3/4 in active trading.
The fashion retailer late Wednesday disclosed disappointing
holiday sales and said analysts have overestimated its
earnings potential.
   Nordstrom lost 3/4 to 22 1/4 amid concerns that this might
have been the worst holiday selling season in recent memory.
   Loewen Group was down 3/8 to 21 1/2. The company, based in
British Columbia, said it is comfortable with estimates its
1990 earnings would improve to one Canadian dollar (86 U.S.
cents) to C$1.10 a share from 81 Canadian cents a year ago.
   CoreStates Financial was 1/4 higher to 31 5/8 in active
trading. The stock was added to the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index this week.

   The Swiss Supreme Court has given its conditional approval
to repatriate to the Philippines about 480 million Swiss
francs ($366.4 million) of "ill-gotten wealth" allegedly
channeled to Switzerland by the late President Ferdinand E.
Marcos and his associates.
   The court ruled that the funds, frozen in several Swiss
banks since March 1986, must be returned as soon as a
criminal court in the Philippines has issued a "legally
binding" verdict in the case. It gave the Philippines a year
to open the criminal proceedings.
   The court said the trial must conform to the standards set
in the Swiss Federal Constitution and the European Human
Rights Convention, covering chiefly the independence of the
judiciary and the impartiality of judges.
   The ruling rejected 11 appeals against lower-court
decisions to release funds blocked at Credit Suisse in the
canton of Zurich and at Swiss Bank Corp. in the canton of
Fribourg. The appeals were filed by lawyers on behalf of Mr.
Marcos's widow, Imelda, and others.
                                                                                                       

   CABINET SHUFFLE IN SOUTH KOREA
                                                                                                       

   South Korea's President Roh Tae Woo changed 10 cabinet
posts in a step that analysts said was aimed largely at
improving his party's image ahead of local elections
scheduled for February. Ro Jai Bong, a chief Roh aide and a
U.S.-educated university professor, was named to succeed
Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon. The new foreign minister will
be Lee Sang Ock, now chief of a mission to international
agencies in Geneva.
                                                                                                       

   INDIA INCREASES INCOME TAXES

   India's Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha introduced a bill
to increase the surcharge on taxable annual income of over
$4,165 to 12% from 8%. He also said deductions on
depreciation would be limited to 75% of the previous maximum.
The two proposals were the second money-raising measures
announced by India's seven-week-old government, which last
week raised customs and excise duties on a range of goods.
                                                                                                       

   THE FATE OF 6,000 WOMEN
                                                                                                       

   The fate of 6,000 Japanese women married to Koreans will
be raised in next month's scheduled talks between Japanese
and North Koreans in Pyongyang. The women married Koreans who
were forced to work in Japan during its colonial rule of the
peninsula, and then migrated with their husbands to North
Korea. Since resettling, not one of the women has been
permitted by North Korea to return to Japan, even to see
dying relatives. The talks offer new hope that North Korea,
in order to establish diplomatic relations with Japan, will
agree to restore freedom of travel to these women.
                                                                                                       

   WELCOME VISITORS
                                                                                                       

   The spending power of the 14,500 European Community civil
servants in Brussels totals $978 million a year, while
Brussels-based EC institutions spend $353 million a year on
rents, utilities and taxes, according to a study commissioned
by the Brussels regional government. Brussels, locked in a
battle with Strasbourg to be chosen as the permanent home of
the European Parliament, intends to launch a campaign to make
its EC visitors feel more at home, notably by reducing the
hassles inflicted by the local bureaucracy.
                                                                                                       

   INDONESIA IS WORRIED
                                                                                                       

   Indonesia is worried that its "Visit Indonesia Year 1991"
promotion could turn Jakarta into Asia's latest sin city, a
Jakarta newspaper said. "If there are tourists who come to
Jakarta seeking `good times,' then they should not have come
here," the Observer newspaper quoted Jakarta Vice-Governor
Basofi Sudirman as saying.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN: NO SHARP SLOWDOWN
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Economic Planning Agency said in its annual report
that it sees no signs of a sharp slowdown in the Japanese
economy, but it stressed the need for maintaining price
stability in order to secure sustained growth.
   The report noted that the Japanese economy entered its
fifth uninterrupted year of growth in December, underpinned
by domestic demand such as personal consumption and corporate
capital spending. Personal spending and corporate capital
outlays both continue to grow steadily, while housing
investment remains at high levels, the report said.
   The report added, however, that rising interest rates have
started restraining housing construction and holding down
corporate sales, earnings and equipment investment by pushing
up borrowing costs.
   Yesterday, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry announced that production at Japanese factories and
mines went up 6.6% in November from a year earlier, though it
dropped 1% from the previous month. Ministry officials said
the latest statistics indicate that Japan's economic activity
remains strong.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Argentina's inflation for December will be about 5%, the
lowest in 14 months, Planning Secretary Moises Ikonicoff
said. If the cost of living increase doesn't top 5%, it will
have slowed for the fourth straight month. The nation's
inflation rate has exceeded 5% every month but four since
July 1986. . . . British and Spanish animal-rights groups
have filed a complaint with the European Community accusing
Spanish slaughterhouses of ignoring EC rules requiring that
animals be stunned before slaughter.

   Making his way uncertainly across the red carpet, King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia clutched hands with the aged emir of Abu
Dhabi. A retainer eased the frail sheik of Kuwait into a
plush leather armchair. As monarchs and ministers gathered
last weekend for a Persian Gulf parley, all had the hurt air
of men who had learned the hard lesson: Money can't buy you
love.
   Perched atop 40% of the world's oil, the Gulf sheikdoms
have long tried to purchase the loyalty of dangerous
neighbors, of imported Arab laborers and of their own
subjects. Saddam Hussein's tanks took three hours to shatter
this "riyal-politik". Now, however the crisis ends, Gulf
leaders face tasks that once seemed distant, even
unthinkable: sharing power with their people, providing their
own defense and realigning their ties with the Arab world.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Saddam has exploded our fantasy culture," says a senior
Gulf official, seated in a palace of marbled halls and
Persian carpets. "A wealthy island in a sea of poverty cannot
live securely forever."
   The future of these fragile oligarchies carries high
stakes for America as well. Although gradual liberalization
in the Gulf seems likely, there also are rumblings of a
fundamentalist backlash. Gulf leaders could kick sand in
America's face by making up with Arab radicals and with Iran.
And unless the Gulf mobilizes its defenses, the West may be
doomed to fight this region's battles indefinitely.
   An Egyptian diplomat, Tahseen Basheer, once derided other
Arab states as merely "tribes with flags." Nowhere did the
insult cut deeper than in the principalities of the Persian
Gulf. Just a generation ago, this region was the Arabs'
Appalachia -- isolated, indigent and clannish.
   In 1948, when Edward Henderson arrived in Abu Dhabi to
negotiate the first oil concessions, the ruling sheik lived
in a mud fort cut with arrow slits. "In those days, there
wasn't much to defend," says the Englishman, now an archivist
in Abu Dhabi. "The biggest pane of glass in the sheikdom was
the windscreen of my car." The mud fort still stands, dwarfed
by glittering towers of steel and glass.
   But although oil has catapulted the Gulf states into the
20th century, they remain insular societies wary of change
and of one another. Before 1960, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates didn't exist as independent nations.
Geographically, they are pimples on Saudi Arabia's vast
desert backside, and they fear domination by a Saudi regime
viewed as overbearing and religiously fanatical. The sixth
state, Oman, which once was a seafaring power with colonies
in Pakistan and Zanzibar, keeps its distance and its distinct
identity.
   These fractious states are nonetheless kin, united by the
oil beneath their sands and by their hereditary, dictatorial
rule. The United Arab Emirates phonebook offers a window into
this feudal but intimate leadership. It opens with a section
labeled "The Shaikhs," including listings for their beach
palaces, shooting ranges and, in some cases, palace bedrooms.
The government pages that follow look almost like an
afterthought; the same names appear at the head of most major
ministries.
   Ironically, it is Saddam Hussein, a far more ruthless
tyrant than any of the Gulf sheiks, who is nudging them
toward democracy. One Saudi regional governor, a brother of
King Fahd, used to end debates with his subjects by barking,
"My family took this country by the sword]" He isn't likely
to say that anymore.
   Comments one Saudi businessman: "He knows we can answer,
`Yeah? Well, now George Bush has taken it by the sword, so
your family is no better than us and you better start dealing
with us.'"
   Kuwait's resilience in exile also has shown the importance
of popular support. If Kuwaitis hadn't stood by their deposed
emir, who now has promised democratic reforms, the tiny
nation might well have vanished quickly.
   The crisis has accelerated demand for open information,
too. In Saudi Arabia, despite censorship so intense that
newspaper crossword puzzles are edited to delete references
to alcohol, Western influences get through. Cable News
Network isn't permitted outside princes' palaces, but some
citizens hide satellite dishes inside rooftop "water tanks."
Many Saudis also watch Bahraini TV, which recently began
broadcasting CNN, including uncensored reports on Israel, for
an hour a night.
   "There was pressure before to keep such things off the
air," says Bahrain's information minister, Tariq al-Moayed.
"But people are asking questions that have to be answered.
There is no going back."
   The way forward, though, is uncertain. Though denying
their citizens political rights, Gulf leaders have given
almost everyone a stake in the status quo, with free
education, medicine and generous subsidies. The huge numbers
of young people who study abroad almost invariably return
home -- in a sharp contrast to most other Arab states.
   The richest Gulf capitals, such as Abu Dhabi, are
luxurious playgrounds, their causeways busy with white-robed
men in white Mercedes-Benzes, talking to each other on car
phones. A conversation among United Arab Emirates
businessmen, over a lobster-claw dinner, quickly turns from
the Gulf crisis to a debate over whether one man should give
his son $15,000 to enter a jet-ski competition.
   "People are too immersed in the Dolce Vita to want to risk
losing it," says Aly Mahmoud, a veteran Egyptian journalist.
   In Jidda, a young manufacturer felt inspired by the Gulf
crisis to pen a newspaper article calling for more freedom.
"But I'm writing," he recalls, "and my hand starts shaking,
and I think, `Are they going to take my factory away?'"
   With no real unions, political parties or freedom of the
press, Gulf citizens have few means of expressing dissent --
short of demonstrations, which are anathema in close-knit
societies averse to public conflict. When some Saudi women
recently drove through Riyadh to protest an unofficial ban on
women driving, the reaction was vicious. The Saudis
formalized the ban and tolerated the circulation of pamphlets
inciting harassment of the women and their husbands. Nor has
the state quelled rising militancy among the religious
police, who recently broke into private homes to arrest
people drinking alcohol.
   Such actions have raised fears that a fundamentalist
backlash could spill across the region. "I'm more afraid of
the Saudis than I am of the Iraqis," says a senior official
in a neighboring state. "You can always turn from Western
values to more Islam, but it's very hard to turn the clock
back the other way."
   Any change will almost certainly filter down from the top.
But Gulf leaders don't seem ready for more than tentative
steps, such as vague promises in several states to set up
"advisory councils."
   "It is naive to apply here what you apply elsewhere," says
Sheik Mohamed Bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa, Bahrain's foreign
minister. "The Gulf is not Scandinavia." Like officials
across the region, he says change must be slow and conform to
the conservative, tribal nature of Gulf society. Officials
also say the current crisis, like the Iran-Iraq war, is no
time to talk about destabilizing moves.
   But such arguments are dismissed by those wanting change.
"Why should people here be less able to adopt democracy than
elsewhere?" asks Abdulnabi Al Sho'ala, a prominent Bahraini
businessman. "We don't need to reinvent the wheel."
   One thing the Gulf probably should reinvent is its proud
military tradition. It was from the Arabian peninsula that
Mohammed's horsemen charged forth. Here, too, Lawrence of
Arabia found his best allies against Ottoman domination.
   But urbanization and wealth have eroded the military
ethic. Though often blaming their weakness on sparse
population, the Gulf states combined have a native population
almost equal to Iraq's and three times Israel's. Yet rather
than mobilize this manpower, most Gulf leaders have opted for
fancy weapons as well as for mercenaries from neighboring
states.
   Politics aggravates the problem. Shia Muslims, distrusted
by their Sunni Muslim governments, often are excluded from
the army. Saudi Arabia, a nation of more than 10 million
people, keeps two competing armed forces numbering less than
70,000 each; it fears that a strong military could stage a
coup. Asked in November whether more young Saudis should join
the armed forces, the interior minister, Prince Naif, said
they could serve their nation in many other ways as well.
   The swift arrival of almost 500,000 foreign troops since
Aug. 2 also has made native armies seem superfluous. "You
think I want to send my teen-aged son to die for Kuwait?"
asks a senior Gulf official. He chuckles and adds, "We have
our white slaves from America to do that."
   Relying on foreigners, though, is potentially explosive in
a region only recently freed from colonial rule. When, in
1980, Oman quietly entered an agreement with the U.S. that
allowed the pre-positioning of equipment and access to
airstrips, it was harshly attacked by other Arab states --
with Kuwait among the most vocal. And America's support of
Israel makes a U.S. presence especially sensitive. In Riyadh,
a young student named Maha regales a Western guest with the
latest "news" of Israeli atrocities: An American AIDS victim
in Cairo, she says, has been recruited by Israeli agents to
molest and infect Egyptian children.
   Maha also believes that Americans are in Saudi Arabia only
to help Israel destroy Iraq -- a common theme on cassettes
circulating in the kingdom. "It is not the world against
Iraq, it is the West against Islam," Safar al-Hawali, an
Islamic scholar in Mecca, recently declared.
   To deflect such criticism, most Gulf states are making a
show of beefing up their defenses. In the United Arab
Emirates, 70,000 men have volunteered for basic training, and
the first batch of female troops now is being trained by U.S.
servicewomen. The state also is filling the airwaves with
images of camouflaged soldiers and caftaned Bedouins marching
heroically across the sand.
   "There is some guilt, having other people do our work and
defend us," says Abdul Majeed Al Fahimi, a 29-year-old banker
who recently volunteered for desert training. "I never
thought the time would come when I might need to fight, too."
   But Gulf forces, with the possible exception of Oman's,
still are a long way from providing effective defense. In the
short term, ties to the U.S. and to regional allies such as
Egypt are sure to increase. At last weekend's summit in
Qatar, Kuwait hinted that it wants a U.S.-led force in the
region for at least five years.
   The Gulf's feeble defense is a symptom of a much broader
disease: regional disunity. The few times Gulf states have
deployed forces have been to fight each other. In 1986, Qatar
landed troops and took hostages on a disputed coral island to
prevent Bahrain from building a naval station there. In the
United Arab Emirates, a shaky confederation of seven
sheikdoms, the emirate of Dubai retains its own army and
moved tanks to the Abu Dhabi border when tension flared in
1987. Five of the emirates have built their own international
airports -- in an area smaller than Maine. A sixth is under
construction.
   Such feuding has repeatedly undercut the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council, or GCC. Formed in 1981, the council has
drawn up bold plans for integration, only to have them
flouted in practice. "Our airlines can't even coordinate
their schedules," says a Saudi GCC official, who adds that it
can take two days to get from Riyadh to Muscat, the Omani
capital. The GCC had its own rapid-deployment force,
"Peninsula Shield," before the American-led "Desert Shield"
arrived, but it proved so impotent that local wags call the
GCC the "Gulf Capitulation Council."
   Although Iraq's aggression may scare the Gulf states into
putting aside petty jealousies, it also has exacerbated old
tensions. Oman, long the odd man out in the GCC, annoyed its
neighbors in November by welcoming Iraq's foreign minister
and also by holding a lavish, nine-day celebration of its
national day. Dubai, well out of Iraqi missile range and
desperate to distance itself from the conflict, issues
reports about business unaffected by "the upper Gulf
situation." And the Kuwaiti refugees flooding into
neighboring states have stirred up their traditional
unpopularity. "The Kuwaitis are too big for their robes," one
Gulf official says. "They had all that money, and still they
couldn't defend themselves."
   One area where the Gulf states do seem united is in their
changed relations with outside states. Nothing shows the
volatility of the region's alliances more clearly than the
rehabilitation of Iran and the excommunication of the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Iran's ambassador to Qatar
was invited to some GCC summit sessions last weekend, and
delegates said Iran would be included in any new regional
security plans. Bahrain's foreign minister recently visited
Tehran for the first time in 10 years, and regular freight
traffic between the countries is due to start soon.
   Such actions would have been impossible before the death
last year of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who used to call
the Gulf rulers "puppets of the Great Satan." During the
Iraq-Iran war, Tehran was implicated in a coup attempt in
Bahrain and in bombings in Kuwait. It also has boycotted the
annual haj pilgrimage ever since a shootout between Saudi
forces and militant Iranian demonstrators in 1987.
   Meanwhile, old allies, bankrolled for decades by the Gulf
states, are falling by the wayside. Customs officials in
Saudi Arabia now seize biographies of PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat; the man himself is "persona non grata" in most Gulf
states. And what was once the PLO's largest source of funding
has dried up. "As far as the PLO is concerned," a Saudi
official says, "the check is in the mail."
   Traditional bows to the Palestinian cause have become
rarer. Gulf journalists say articles on the intifada occupy
only about 20% of the news space they did before Aug. 2. On a
recent day, the only Palestinian item in the Gulf News, which
is based in the United Arab Emirates, was a small story deep
inside the paper, wedged between local reports headlined
"Sleeping Drunk Arrested" and "Two Hurt as Car Rams Camel."
   Several Gulf states have expelled Palestinian workers or
failed to renew their visas. Jordanians, Yemenis and Sudanese
also are being nudged out, and the rifts with their
governments may linger on for some time. Gulf leaders now say
that instead of pouring money into the pockets of neighboring
rulers, they will direct their aid straight to projects
aiding the people.
   Many officials also speak openly about changing the PLO
leadership. "You don't spit on the hand that is held out to
you. This is what Arafat did," says Yahya Al-Sumait, Kuwait's
minister for housing. "In my view, his turn is finished.
There are many more highly educated, motivated, couth
Palestinians than Arafat."
   Arab leaders, though, have a tradition of kissing and
making up after breaches that seem irreparable. And the
Gulf's growing closeness to the U.S. will probably force its
leaders to reaffirm their Arab credentials. "Externally, we
have to avoid reacting `To hell with Palestinians, to hell
with Iraqis,' or we'll wake up and realize we've stranded
ourselves on a desert island," says Sulaiman Al-Mutawa,
Kuwait's minister of planning. Gulf leaders also will want to
avoid alienating radical Arabs lest the Gulf become a target
of terrorism.
   Mr. Al-Mutawa, like the rest of Kuwait's government, now
works out of a Saudi hotel room hastily converted into an
office. The Kuwaitis, in exile, have been forced to think
deeply about their future and about the regional arrangements
that failed them abysmally.
   Likening the Gulf to the Soviet Union, Mr. Al-Mutawa says
change will inevitably be costly: "There will be heads that
have to be chopped. But in the long run, it will be to the
benefit of the area."

   Insurer Agrees Not to Write

   Of Demand for Deposit

   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp. agreed not to write
new insurance policies in New Jersey, a move apparently
designed to save face for both the company and state
insurance regulators, who had demanded a $500 million deposit
from the ailing company as security.
   New Jersey drew sharp criticism from insurance regulators
in other states when earlier this month it gave First
Executive a one-week deadline to post a $500 million deposit
to cover policyholders in the state in the event of any
insolvency, or face a cease-and-desist order barring it from
any new business in the state. New Jersey is one of the few
states without an industry-supported guaranty fund for life
insurance policyholders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the
guiding body for the state insurance agencies, called the New
Jersey action "irresponsible," and officials in California
and New York -- principal overseers of First Executive's two
Executive Life companies -- said they would block any deposit
demand by New Jersey.
   But yesterday's agreement averted any such showdown. "We
sought this agreement as a wise and prudent step to protect
New Jersey policyholders while we assess the financial
strength of the companies," New Jersey's insurance
commissioner, Samuel F. Fortunato, said.
   First Executive said the move had been "voluntary" on its
part, and that it is "confident" that New Jersey regulators
will find its operating units "financially capable of meeting
all obligations to policyholders of all states." First
Executive's action is somewhat academic, since its Executive
Life units aren't writing much new business anywhere,
according to company filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The New Jersey regulators didn't say how long it might be
before First Executive could resume writing policies in the
state. First Executive said it is confident it will be able
to resume business there, although it pointed out that "New
Jersey has never represented a substantial source of business
for us." Executive Life in California writes about 1.3% of
its nationwide business in New Jersey, covering 12,717
individuals, and the New York company writes about 6.5% of
its business in the state, covering 12,319 individuals.
   The agreement, however, didn't win the favor of the
alliance of state insurance regulators who have been working
together for months to contain the difficulties in First
Executive's insurance operations.
   The agreement "gives the appearance of a face-saving
gesture as opposed to really accomplishing anything," said
Larry Gorski of the Illinois Department of Insurance,
spokesman for the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners group overseeing operations of First Executive.
"There's the possibility that policyholders might become even
more concerned over the situation." The regulators had feared
that New Jersey's attempt might prompt a series of demands by
various states for deposits or other special treatment,
scuttling months of regulatory effort to contain the problems
at First Executive.
   First Executive, parent of Executive Life Insurance Co. in
California and Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York, fell
victim to plunging junk bond markets and was forced to take
$859 million in writedowns earlier this year.

   WASHINGTON -- In the secretive world where international
politics meets money, Jacques de Groote is a man of
influence.
   Suave and erudite, Mr. de Groote is a senior executive
director of both the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund -- a bridge between developed and developing
nations. He involves himself in the affairs that he chooses,
rendering advice as he sees fit while helping to channel the
$25 billion or so in international aid the organizations
annually dispense. It is a position of much autonomy, with
wide freedom from interference and scrutiny.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 63-year-old Mr. de Groote, who is paid a tax-free
$119,000 a year, lives in a style that suggests substantial
wealth. He has long been something of a bon vivant, with a
taste for the finest in clothes, restaurants and residences.
He has a $1 million house in the Georgetown section of
Washington, a $2 million working farm in Italy and a $1
million apartment in Brussels. "De Groote is an eccentric,"
says a friend, Hugues Leclercq, a professor in Brussels. "He
will go to a shop and buy 20 shirts, six pairs of shoes,
flashy ties. He loves the finer things in life."
   By his own admission, Mr. de Groote has at times been
hard-pressed for cash. In July, in fact, a court in his
native Belgium said that he was "facing serious financial
problems." Today, he acknowledges debts totaling $1 million.
   Once Mr. de Groote needed a small, tide-me-over loan; he
went to the owner of a brewery in Zaire whom he also counsels
on World Bank policy. Another time he needed big money; he
turned to the head of a mining operation in Rwanda who at the
time was seeking help from the IMF and World Bank.
   Mr. de Groote also has long advised Zaire and its
president, Mobutu Sese Seko, even though Zaire isn't one of
the countries he officially represents. His relationship has
included informing Zaire, a major recipient of IMF and World
Bank aid over the years, about the organizations'
confidential strategy for granting future aid. Mr. de Groote
acknowledges that these ties have provoked suspicions he was
on Mr. Mobutu's payroll.
   Mr. de Groote says these suspicions are false. He says
that he has never used his position for personal gain, and
that there is "no relation whatsoever" between his official
positions and his personal finances.
   Mr. de Groote's activities do not appear to violate any
policies at the World Bank and IMF. "We don't have any rules
in writing for executive directors," says Francois Gianviti,
IMF general counsel. "We have no code of ethics in writing
for executive directors." World Bank president Barber Conable
adds that a 1954 bank resolution only requires a director to
disclose any "substantial" personal interest in a matter
before the bank, though he says he would feel compelled to
urge a director's constituent countries to investigate any
allegations of improprieties.
   The lack of formal guidelines at these powerful
organizations, and the secrecy with which they conduct their
business, seem almost an invitation to engage in conflicts of
interest. They may also bear on a frequent complaint of
critics: That corrupt regimes still manage to get generous
aid from the IMF and World Bank -- institutions whose aid is
much-coveted in these times of tight capital. Zaire is often
cited in this connection. The African nation owes the IMF and
World Bank more than $1.6 billion, yet President Mobutu has
become one of the world's wealthiest men, reputedly a
billionaire.
   Mr. de Groote, Zaire's longtime adviser, explains that
corruption is simply a way of life there. "Mobutu is corrupt,
of course," says Mr. de Groote. Only corruption, he says,
could explain how many Zairean officials "drive Mercedes,
have luxurious apartments in Europe, send their children to
the best private schools and take two-month holidays." (Mr.
Mobutu has publicly denied plundering his country but didn't
respond to written questions for this article.)
   Mr. de Groote has served Zaire off and on, officially and
unofficially, for 20 years. In 1967, it was he, then a young
economist, who urged the strife-torn Congo to adopt "zaire"
as the name of its new currency. The word means river or big
water, Mr. de Groote explains, and "I thought it would be a
kind of unifying factor." Four years later the country took
"Zaire" as its name.
   Mr. de Groote, son-in-law of a former Belgian foreign
minister, was an official of the National Bank of Belgium and
chief economic adviser to the Zairean national bank. He
designed a Zairean economic overhaul, of which he says the
IMF was "the cornerstone." At one point Mr. de Groote was
ordered out of Zaire for giving tough economic advice. But by
the late 1970s, after he had joined the boards of the IMF and
the World Bank, he was back to advising the Mobutu regime.
   In precisely what capacity was Mr. de Groote serving his
old friend and client? The answer is fraught with ambiguity.
   Mr. de Groote's official duties at the IMF and World Bank
involve Belgium, several other European nations and Turkey;
other directors are responsible for Zaire. Yet when business
involving Zaire has come up, Mr. de Groote has often involved
himself. This is because of his personal commitment to the
country, he explains, as well as the long, historic ties
between Zaire and Belgium.
   When he has corresponded with Zairean leaders, Mr. de
Groote has done so on the agencies' stationery. When he has
drawn up reports on Zaire, he has used the staff and
stationery of the IMF and World Bank. But he has flown in and
out of the country at Zaire's expense.
   In 1982 and 1983, the IMF cut off Zaire's funding because
of economic mismanagement. Mr. de Groote says that he
personally urged Mr. Mobutu to rein in his personal spending
and to increase taxes -- "highly unpopular advice."
   But he went much further than rendering advice.
   In an April 1983 letter to Kengo wa Dondo, then Zaire's
prime minister, Mr. de Groote disclosed what he knew about
the confidential negotiating strategy that other IMF
officials were developing for Zaire. His purpose, he wrote,
was to share the views of "the higher echelons of the IMF and
the World Bank." At the time, a group of IMF staffers was
preparing a visit to Zaire, and their negotiating
instructions, he wrote, had been "given to no one, apart from
the team of negotiators."
   He listed the economic measures the negotiators would
expect Zaire to take, predicting that compliance would free
up $246 million from the fund -- precisely the amount
approved eight months later.
   He even pointed out that the finance ministry of his own
country, a major creditor to Zaire, would be "very reluctant"
about some aspects of the program. But not to worry, he
reported: A top foreign-affairs official in Belgium who
happened to be a good friend of Mr. de Groote was "exerting a
very useful influence to obtain a political decision"
favorable to Zaire.
   Mr. de Groote insists that what he did for Zaire was no
different "than anything I write for other countries" he
represents.
   In a series of interviews, Mr. de Groote is remarkably
blunt about the rumors swirling around him. He acknowledges
that even at the World Bank and the IMF, some believe that he
has acted as a paid Mobutu agent. He attributes such
allegations to false "street talk" spread by Mr. Mobutu's
opponents in Zaire and in Belgium, where he reports to
banking authorities. "I am not a money man," he says. "If I
wanted to obtain money, I could have done it very easily in
Zaire; I'm sure they would give me money." He adds: "I am not
a Mobutu agent."
   Nevertheless, in Belgium, the suspicions have taken a
toll. In the fall of 1980, for instance, there was talk in
Brussels of Mr. de Groote's possible appointment to the
managing board of Belgium's national bank, which might have
led to his becoming national bank governor. But according to
people familiar with the events, one board member, Roland
Beauvois, told a secret board meeting of being informed by a
high Zairean official that the official had made payments to
Mr. de Groote for Mr. Mobutu.
   The allegations, coupled with political considerations
involving Mr. de Groote's Franco-Flemish background, caused
his name to be withdrawn. Mr. de Groote says he wasn't
interested in the post anyway, and attributes the controversy
to bad blood between himself and Mr. Beauvois.
   Mr. de Groote was also mentioned in 1982 for the
governorship of the Belgian central bank. But this time
another problem arose: his personal finances. "I told Jacques
he would not get it," recalls his friend Mr. Leclercq. "He
was late on his debts."
   Mr. de Groote could, however, tap an old connection in
such lean times. That was Baron Jean-Louis van den Branden,
whose Belgian mining and real-estate company, Geomines,
operated in Zaire as well as in the African nation of Rwanda,
and which boasted advisers including prominent European and
U.S. political figures. About a decade ago, Mr. de Groote
obtained a short-term, unsecured loan of about $50,000 (at
today's exchange rates) from Banque Nagelmackers 1747 SA,
where Baron van den Branden did some business and where,
within two years, he would become chairman. Did Mr. van den
Branden, his friend of 35 years, arrange the loan? "Oh, yes,
absolutely," Mr. de Groote says. Mr. van den Branden insists,
however, that he merely gave Mr. de Groote "advice on who to
see" at the bank.
   To this day, Mr. de Groote hasn't retired the bank debt,
which has grown with interest to about $150,000. Frustrated,
the bank obtained an order last July from the Court of the
First Instance in Brussels preventing Mr. de Groote from
selling his $1 million duplex apartment in Brussels before he
repays the debt.
   Mr. de Groote maintains he isn't in financial distress.
Besides his total income of $119,000 from the IMF and World
Bank, he says he also shares income of about $120,000 with
his wife, who, he adds, will inherit money soon.
   Mr. de Groote, who lives apart from his wife, acknowledges
a reputation as one who enjoys varied female companionship
and concedes that his lavish life style has drawn the concern
of friends. "I certainly had a number of women in my life. .
. . I had stormy liaisons with well-known ladies, and it was
a matter of worry for some of my friends that I would not
manage my financial business with care," he says. As for the
bank loan, "I don't worry about that bank," he says. "I will
pay them when it suits me" -- soon, he says.
   The bank's managing director, Baudouin Nagelmackers, says
of Mr. de Groote: "He will say, `I have money coming from
Italy, I have money coming from here, coming from there.'
He's interested in art -- paintings -- and he'll say, `I am
going to sell this piece of art, that piece of art.'"
   Mr. de Groote has other bank debts as well. Mr.
Nagelmackers says he has learned, under a Belgian banking
procedure, that Mr. de Groote owes more than $300,000 to
other Belgian banks. He says his bank delayed taking legal
action against Mr. de Groote because it feared that the
Belgian national bank, to which Mr. de Groote officially
reports, "would take action against us -- put auditors on
us." But a few years ago, he says, he finally complained to
the central bank governor.
   "Normally, if I see what he is earning, he should easily
be able to pay back," Mr. Nagelmackers says. "But he lives in
high style: a villa in Italy, an apartment in Brussels, a
house in Washington."
   Besides helping Mr. de Groote get this long-unpaid bank
loan, Baron van den Branden has assisted him in other ways,
helping Mr. de Groote turn his Georgetown home into cash in a
transaction that also allowed him to continue living in it.
   "I badly needed money," Mr. de Groote recalls. "I said one
day to him {the baron}, `Since I do not wish to go to a bank,
do you have a way for me to mobilize liquidity?' He said, `I
will find a way out.'" The upshot was that in early 1982, Mr.
de Groote sold his Georgetown home to a Panamanian company,
Mapagico S.A., bringing in $380,000. Mr. de Groote says it
was agreed he could rent the house and ultimately repurchase
it at market value.
   When questioned, Mr. de Groote initially identified the
owner of Mapagico as Mr. van den Branden. And he says he knew
the Swiss managing director of Mapagico as someone "involved
in some of van den Branden's business." But the baron insists
he neither bought the house nor had anything to do with the
outfit that did. He says he simply recalls referring the
matter to his top finance man at Geomines, now deceased.
   In any case, the deal worked for Mr. de Groote. In July
1987 he repurchased the house for $550,000 -- $40,000 below
Mapagico's official appraisal, and a price representing
annual appreciation of only about 8% despite a red-hot
Washington real-estate market. Mr. de Groote now values the
house at $1 million.
   Mr. de Groote assisted the baron at about the same time of
the house deal. In 1982 Mr. van den Branden was seeking
roughly $30 million in financing from a World Bank affiliate
for his Rwanda mining operation. The company, which was in
partnership with the government of Rwanda, was struggling for
cash.
   That's where Mr. de Groote came in. "He was trying to help
us as much as he could at the World Bank," says a former
Geomines director, Bernard van Ommeslaghe. "He helped us to
make the proper introductions to find our way within that
large organization for the loan."
   Mr. de Groote says he can't procure a World Bank loan for
anyone. He acknowledges opening doors for Geomines but says
it is the same service he gives to any Belgian company. (Mr.
van den Branden, in fact, did not get the World Bank credit.)
   Mr. de Groote says that in 1982 Mr. van den Branden also
began "pestering" him to press the Rwandan government to
devalue its franc, a move that would have generated more
local currency for the cash-strapped company. Mr. de Groote's
official duties at the IMF and World Bank don't include
Rwanda, any more than they include Zaire. But he got
involved, because, he says, Rwanda was without an IMF
executive director at the time and Rwandan officials asked
him to serve as its unofficial representative.
   In a March 1982 letter to Rwandan President Juvenal
Habyarimana, Mr. de Groote cited the need to increase exports
of tin, which were managed by Mr. van den Branden's company.
He notified him that the IMF was about to recommend a
devaluation, a position behind which he was throwing his own
endorsement. He also visited Rwanda urging devaluation.
   Mr. de Groote says today that he was acting not at the
behest of Mr. van den Branden but at the request of one
official in Rwanda, the central bank governor. Officials in
Belgium also favored a devaluation, he says, adding, "It is
unfortunate . . . that I had to defend an idea" that Mr. van
den Branden happened to be promoting. (Rwanda finally
devalued the franc about 5%, though this was far less than
Mr. de Groote sought.)
   Baron van den Branden ultimately stumbled. In 1985 he
resigned as chairman of the bank that lent $50,000 to Mr. de
Groote, and Geomines finally succumbed to bankruptcy
proceedings in Brussels.
   Mr. de Groote has turned elsewhere to borrow funds. In
1986, Michel Relecom, a Brussels businessman with extensive
brewery and agricultural interests in Zaire, lent him $4,000.
"He needed immediately the money and he repaid it by check a
couple weeks later," Mr. Relecom recalls. He is open about
the fact that Mr. de Groote over the years had provided him
advice on World Bank policy, but he says that had nothing to
do with the loan.
   Mr. de Groote's more recent activities in Africa have once
again focused on his old client, Mr. Mobutu.
   He counseled Mr. Mobutu on IMF business at the ruler's
villa in the south of France in August 1986. He traveled to
Zaire in March 1987 to discuss Zaire's tattered relations
with the IMF, helping to repair ties. And in June 1989,
despite worsening Zairean corruption, government misspending
and economic decay, Mr. de Groote began promoting yet another
IMF undertaking being planned with Zaire. The board approved
the plan, and before long another $211 million in loans was
on its way to the African nation.
   Within months, alas, the reform program was a shambles.
Mr. Mobutu was again spending too much on himself and not
enough on his impoverished country. Under IMF and World Bank
regulations, the spigot was closed.
   Today, Zaire's economy is crumbling amid food riots and
inflation. Mr. Mobutu's days in power may be numbered,
according to Mr. de Groote and others. But Mr. de Groote says
that the bank and the fund needn't apologize for helping to
keep Mr. Mobutu in power for this long. "We work with
imperfect data sometimes, imperfect political systems, highly
imperfect local people sometimes," he says. "But we {try} to
make the most out of it."

   Anyone counting on wealthy foreigners and foreign
institutional investors to give U.S. stock and bond markets a
shot in the arm had better not hold their breath -- at least
judging the latest statistics.
   Private foreign investors actually sold $1.5 billion more
U.S. stocks and bonds than they bought in the third quarter.
That compares with net purchases of $3.6 billion in the
second quarter, according to U.S. Treasury data analyzed by
the Securities Industry Association.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stocks were hard hit. So far this year, foreign investors
have unloaded a net $9.2 billion of U.S. stocks -- $2.4
billion of that in the third quarter. By comparison, they
bought a net $10.8 billion in the same period last year.
   If the trend of the first nine months continues, foreign
individual and institutional investors will have bought a net
$2.3 billion of U.S. securities in all of 1990. That is a
mere 3.2% of the $71.2 billion they added to their portfolios
in the preceding year.
   "You've got fewer private foreigners stepping forward to
absorb U.S. securities," said Susan Hering, an economist at
Salomon Brothers Inc. "That shifts the burden to foreign
official investors or domestic investors."
   How much that affects U.S. markets and the financing of
the U.S. budget deficit is uncertain. Foreign investors
traditionally have influenced U.S. bond prices more than
stocks, but British and Japanese investors have at times
moved U.S. equity markets.
   In the short term, foreigners' diminishing appetite for
U.S. bonds means that U.S. interest rates would be higher and
the dollar weaker than otherwise, if other things remain
constant, said David G. Strongin, director of international
finance at the Securities Industry Association.
   He and others also pointed out, however, that while
private foreign investors sold a net $100 million of U.S.
Treasury securities in the third quarter, foreign governments
and central banks bought a net $11.3 billion.
   That's a big jump from late 1989 and early 1990, when they
were net sellers of U.S. Treasurys. Some analysts attribute
the huge shift to a flight to quality, as governments and
central banks -- particularly in Europe and the Middle East
-- sold offshore Eurodollar holdings to buy U.S. government
paper after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   No one knows whether the heavy foreign official purchases
will continue. Regardless, Ms. Hering pointed out that in a
recession, corporations borrow less to finance inventory and
capital investment, and individuals borrow less for
mortgages. In addition, "there's a flight to quality" from
stocks and corporate bonds to U.S. Treasurys. All this makes
it easier for the U.S. government to finance its budget
deficit.
   For foreign investors, the factors deterring investment in
the U.S. have been the falling dollar, interest rates that
are lower than those in most other major industrial countries
and the huge federal budget deficit.
   "The biggest problem I see in the U.S. has got to be the
state of the economy in light of the budget deficit and the
ability of the U.S. political leadership to bring it down,"
said Richard D. Muckart, director of sales and investing for
Ivory &amp; Sime PLC in Edinburgh, Scotland. "There's no
political will to face up to it, and it could get worse."
   Many analysts believe the dollar could strengthen next
year. "But I'm still concerned with the budget deficit, the
balance-of-payments deficit, and the {U.S. stock} market is
expensive on its own. At 14 times earnings, it's the most
expensive market with the exception of Japan and a few
others," said Iain Watt, investment director at Edinburgh
Fund Managers PLC in Edinburgh.
   "We aren't looking for any earnings growth next year," he
added. "There are more negatives in the U.S. market than
positives."
   All told, private foreign investors purchased only $900
million of U.S. bonds in the third quarter, down from $7.4
billion in the second quarter. Based on these trends, "we are
headed for record lows in equities, record lows in Treasurys
and a seven-year low in corporate bond purchases by
foreigners in 1990," said the Securities Industry
Association's Mr. Strongin.
   He pointed out that, after being net sellers of U.S.
stocks for eight consecutive months, foreign investors did
buy $1.4 billion in July. But they quickly switched to
selling again after the Mideast crisis erupted in early
August.
   If foreigners are taking money out of U.S. markets, so are
Americans. In the first three quarters, U.S. investors
purchased a net $7.3 billion of foreign stocks and $15.6
billion of overseas debt. While the stock purchases are
running behind the $9.4 billion for the same period last
year, foreign bond buying is double any previous full year. A
big lure was the high interest rates and strong currencies
available in several major overseas markets.
   Most surprising, said Mr. Strongin, is that Americans'
purchases abroad were unaffected by the Mideast crisis. Even
though many foreign markets fell after Iraq's invasion, U.S.
investors bought a net $90 million of foreign stocks in
August. In the same month, American institutions sold a net
$1.8 billion of U.S. stocks, according to the securities
association.
   "This trend reflects American institutions' continued
commitment to diversifying their portfolios to include
foreign securities," said Mr. Strongin. He noted that U.S.
institutions have a smaller percentage of their total
holdings invested in foreign securities than institutions in
other major countries do.

   A Cuban Solzhenitsyn Cries Out Against a Tropical Gulag

   As the days of Fidel Castro's rule seem numbered, and as
Cubans both on the island and in exile become increasingly
excited about the future, the figure of one exile as
spokesman and symbol, human rights activist and guarantor of
honesty, still looms large. Just as Alexander Solzhenitsyn's
personal and historical accounts of the Soviet gulag drew the
world's attention to that country's systemic horrors, so has
Armando Valladares's prison memories -- compiled in his
moving 1986 book "Against All Hope" -- unveiled to the world
the reality of Mr. Castro's tropical gulag.
   Mr. Valladares, 53, a handsome, charismatic poet and human
rights activist, has been living in Madrid since his release
from prison eight years ago. He had been incarcerated by
Fidel Castro for 22 years. One lasting effect of torture is
that he cannot have children (he and his Cuban-American wife
have adopted three Spanish children), but otherwise his
slender build appears remarkably strong and fit. Speaking
Spanish in a hoarse voice that he has had since childhood, he
explains, "In jail, in the worst physical situation, even
during the hunger strikes, even when I was beaten senseless,
or tied with feeding tubes, I would do daily exercises, even
if it was only moving my hands and feet. I knew that survival
required self-discipline."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Valladares, who in 1987 was named U.S. ambassador to
the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations in Geneva,
describes his greatest achievement at the U.N. as the
adoption this year of a 400-page report on the violation of
human rights in Cuba: "My objective in accepting the
ambassadorship was to put Mr. Castro on trial before world
opinion, because apologists for the regime attacked my book
as a fabrication. But the commission's report went into
greater detail and documented even worse torture and summary
executions than I witnessed." As to those who criticize him
for allowing the U.S. to use him, he answers that it is he
who has used the U.S. to achieve his goals before a world
audience.
   Too idealistic to be a politician, too impassioned to be a
diplomat, too much his own man to be a bureaucrat, it comes
as no surprise that Mr. Valladares is leaving the U.N. in
order, as he says, "to give myself more freedom of action."
(For instance, as U.S. ambassador, he cannot protest the
award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Mikhail Gorbachev.)
   Yet he believes that in the new post-Cold War era, the
U.N. will have a major role to play in shaping Cuba's future.
He predicts that the General Assembly will pass resolutions
condemning Mr. Castro's violations of human rights, further
isolating him from the world community. This explains, in his
view, why Cuba is one of the few states to refuse to condemn
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait: "Fidel identifies himself with
Saddam Hussein; Fidel lies awake at night, jealous of
Saddam's power."
   Mr. Valladares believes that the linchpin to the collapse
of Fidel Castro's dictatorship is the same economic crisis
that has rocked communist regimes in Europe. He worries that
an international effort of socialists in Venezuela, Sweden
and Spain will provide economic aid to Mr. Castro in the
false hope of enticing greater liberalization on the island.
In his view, "Economic aid would only prolong the agony of a
regime that has lost all legitimacy."
   Prison was a long road through hell for Mr. Valladares. It
was in prison that he started writing poetry; there that he
wrote and rewrote in his head entire passages of his memoirs.
"I needed to convert all that horror, the suffering, the
screams into something useful, so I began to compose poems
and short stories."
   Does he still write poetry? "No, not enough," he answers.
"But I am a poet and will die a poet. Right now I have made a
pledge to myself to help rid my nation of dictatorship; when
that is done, I will paint, I will write about things that
have nothing to do with communism."
   Most of his work these days revolves around the Valladares
Foundation, headquartered in Washington, D.C., and Resistance
International, which he co-founded with Vladimir Bukovsky in
1983. Both groups are dedicated to exposing those human
rights abuses around the world that, he claims, the press
traditionally overlooked: "I was the victim of a double
standard -- people protested abuses in Chile and South
Africa, but were silent about Cuba. I never want to let that
happen again."
   Today he takes pains to denounce those dissidents inside
Cuba and outside who are ready to participate in "false
elections" manipulated by Mr. Castro to keep himself in
power: "This is a distinct minority; some of these people are
well-intentioned innocents, some are dupes, and still others
are infiltrated stooges and agents of Fidel." Those
dissidents who desire a dialogue with Mr. Castro have
attacked Mr. Valladares for wanting to precipitate Cuba into
civil war. "This is dishonest," counters Mr. Valladares.
"Castro is using the threat of a bloodbath on the island to
scare people. But colonels, junior officers and new party
cadres have witnessed communism change in Eastern Europe
without bloodshed, and this apres nous le deluge view of
Castro's has little appeal to the younger generation."
   Clearly, Mr. Valladares is happier with a pen at a desk,
than becoming embroiled in the grubby political infighting of
rival exile groups. But his personal attractiveness and
fearlessness make him a figurehead that many Cuban
politicians try to coopt for their own aims. While there is
always a risk that he will be manipulated by others with far
less noble aspirations than he, he makes no claims to
personal political ambitions: "I have no intention of
becoming the Vaclav Havel of Havana. I want finally to enjoy
a private life with my family -- without bodyguards and
without fear."
   Mr. Valladares's main aim is not political, but moral:
"What I want is to see a world in which the dignity of the
individual will be more important than any political concern
whatsoever."
   He repeats this to make certain it is clear and
understood. "Human dignity must be respected above all." So
when it comes time to settle scores in Havana, when the huge
capital of the exile community, the drug traffickers, the
politicians with axes to grind finally bury Mr. Castro's, Mr.
Valladares plans to take a well-deserved rest. But he may not
have this luxury; there is a tradition in Latin American
politics that looks to poets to embody the people's
aspirations, and carry the soul of the nation because they
are not easily corruptible. Jose Marti, the hero of the Cuban
independence struggle, was also a poet and a dreamer.

   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico -- The smuggler's eyes dart warily as
he leads an American visitor into a concrete-walled compound
to view his cache.
   Dressed in tattered trousers and sandals, the young man
brushes past a Doberman pinscher and shoves open a door to
reveal, not cocaine, but . . . parrots. Dozens of bright
green-and-yellow spectacled amazons huddle in
stick-and-balingwire cages and squawk at the intrusion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Choose whichever ones you want," says the smuggler, who
local shopkeepers say is a big dealer's employee.
"Thirty-five dollars each on this side of the river. Sixty
dollars on the U.S. side." A Chicago pet shop might charge
$150.
   That helps explain why the business of parrot smuggling is
soaring these days. Parrots caught in the jungles of Mexico,
South America, Africa and Indonesia can be bought for only a
few dollars from the local people, who knock them from their
nests. The birds' value rises steadily as they are moved
northward; the U.S. bans some birds because they are on
endangered-species lists, and the cost of even legal imports
is raised by quarantine rules. By the time the birds reach
U.S. or European consumers, some birds, such as the large
imperial amazons of Dominica, in the Caribbean, fetch
$100,000 apiece.
   "You can make a fortune" smuggling parrots, says Donald
Bruning, the bird curator at the New York Zoological Society.
"And if you get caught with birds, you get a slap on the
wrist, but if you get caught with drugs, you get slapped in
jail."
   As with the drug trade, parrot smuggling is driven by
American buying. That demand "skyrocketed" in the 1970s, Mr.
Bruning says, largely because of the popularity of the
wisecracking pet cockatoo on the television series "Baretta."
And with more countries banning legal exports of parrots to
preserve dwindling bird populations, the proportion of
contraband birds sneaked into the U.S. is increasing.
   According to the World Wildlife Fund, at least 225,000
birds worth some $50 million at retail are either smuggled or
imported with fraudulent documentation each year -- about 17%
of the $300 million in annual retail sales in the U.S.
Excluding smaller species such as parakeets and lovebirds,
which are raised in abundance by domestic breeders, the
percentage of illicit birds is even higher.
   The illegal parrot trade isn't as victimless as it might
seem. For starters, parrots can harbor diseases fatal to
domestic poultry: An outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease,
blamed on parrots, infected the California chicken population
in 1971. Federal officials destroyed 12 million birds, mostly
laying hens, to halt the spread.
   And now, bird smuggling is so big that it threatens to
eradicate many species in the wild. Some 77 of the world's
330 parrot species are said to be in immediate danger.
Although loss of habitat has been the biggest problem,
smugglers -- and, by inference, bird lovers in the developed
world -- get plenty of blame, too.
   The carnage begins with the way parrots are gathered. When
the babies are just a few days old, peasants cut down their
trees and hack apart their nests to get at them. This not
only kills many fledglings but also may discourage their
parents from breeding again; some species use the same nests
for generations.
   Many more of the weak, defenseless birds -- perhaps 90% --
die in transit because of improper feeding and inhumane
conditions. Federal agents regularly find bags of drowned
parrots that didn't survive the smuggler's swim across the
Rio Grande from Mexico. Asphyxiated birds turn up in the
trunks of cars. Some even die from alcohol poisoning: The
time-honored way to keep a parrot quiet during smuggling is
to give it a few drops of tequila.
   "Smuggling has a devastating effect on the parrot
population," says Thomas D. Nichols, conservation officer for
the Amazon Society, a group dedicated to the preservation of
parrots.
   Yet almost everyone seems to get in on the act. Back in
the 1970s, an exotic dancer was caught with several parrots
hidden in the tire well of her recreational vehicle as she
crossed through Laredo, Texas, on her way to a performance.
In Brownsville, Texas, last October, a 79-year-old woman
pleaded guilty to a single count of smuggling 61 parrots with
an estimated street value of $48,800. And U.S. Customs agents
frequently catch American tourists who purchase birds legally
in Mexico and try to sneak them into the U.S. stuffed in
pockets or brassieres.
   "When they get caught, they always say, `I didn't know it
was there,'" says Billy McFarland, chief inspector of the
Customs Service in Hidalgo, Texas. "They'll say things like,
`I'll bet my cousin put that there and I didn't see it.'"
   Parrot smuggling also tracks the illegal drug trade in
another way: Buyers can't be sure of getting an unadulterated
product. Just as cocaine is "cut" with cheap fillers as it
moves up the distribution system, so are low-quality parrots
often disguised to resemble more expensive ones.
   A common trick is to disguise a conure, which doesn't talk
and retails for about $35 in the U.S., as a talking parrot.
Typically, the smuggler dyes the head yellow and trims the
tail, which is longer than that of other parrots. Presto,
it's a Mexican double yellowhead parrot, worth as much as
$800.
   "These ol' boys make Michelangelo look like a beginner,"
says Kay Owens, a Laredo pet-shop owner, who refuses to deal
in hot birds.
   Overwhelmed with drug cases, federal agents rarely spend
much time investigating parrot smugglers. In 1989, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the lead agency combating the
problem, seized just 592 parrots. Still, that was more than a
threefold increase from 1988.
   Lucky breaks help. Earlier this year, a confidential
informant led Customs officials to Henry Guerra, a Laredo
small-business man long suspected of dealing in illegal
birds. Following weeks of painstaking work, an undercover
agent finally made a "buy" at Mr. Guerra's suburban house.
She flashed a signal, and 10 armed customs investigators
swooped in and led the alleged smuggler away in handcuffs. As
neighbors gawked, 49 parrots were rescued from Mr. Guerra's
garage.
   Mr. Guerra pleaded guilty to knowingly receiving smuggled
parrots and was sentenced to five months in jail. But he
contends in a jailhouse interview that he was unfairly tagged
as a major bird dealer because he uses parrot-shaped covers
on his golf clubs.
   Another parrot fancier in Houston, who served two prison
terms for smuggling and is identified by a local wildlife
official as one of the biggest dealers ever, blames his
"weakness for feathers." Although asking that his name not be
used, the bearded 49-year-old discusses a life of parrot
crime spanning more than a decade.
   He says he has brought birds across from Mexico nearly
every way imaginable. One parrot, which he kept as a pet, was
named "Sandia," Spanish for "watermelon," because it was
smuggled in a hollowed-out fruit. He claims to have passed
"thousands" of birds across the border, using boats, inner
tubes, paid swimmers, planes and automobile trunks. Once, a
pilot friend used the plane of a Mexican president that was
being serviced in the U.S. to transport 200 birds to the
Houston area, he says.
   Though out of the business now, he still sees many signs
of it. On a tour of Houston pet stores, he stops in one
run-down shop to admire a baby redhead and a double
yellowhead, both natives of Mexico. The teen-ager behind the
counter says the birds were sold to the shop by a woman who
inherited them from her father. "They just need someone to
love them," he says.
   But the former smuggler notes their youth, battered
condition and lack of a leg band and sneers under his breath:
"These birds are hotter than a pistol."

   If you think your year's been tough, consider what it'd be
like to be in charge of a really big mess, say, a major U.S.
city or state. Consider these headlines, all of which
appeared yesterday morning: "Nation's Capital Faces Financial
Disaster"; "Criticizing Dinkins, Cuomo Warns of Possible
Takeover of Finances"; "Fresh Bipartisan Effort to Be Sought
to Close Big California Budget Gap."
   In America, modern government means big government. And at
every level, governments are beginning to fall apart under
the weight of their own self-created "responsibilities."
They're just too fat. Alas, Slim-Fast won't save them. Ask
Philadelphia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode's own admission his
city is "probably only a year or two ahead of other major
cities." Last week, he reported Philadelphia can't meet its
January 4 payroll without help.
   While Philadelphia's officials scream they are on the edge
of bankruptcy, they balk at the terms of a $150 million loan
offered by eight banks: Cut spending, raise fees, sell
assets, privatize services and give budget veto power to a
fiscal oversight board. If in fact unending politicking has
made tough decisions impossible today, bankruptcy might well
be the best thing that could happen to a Philadelphia or
other cities in fiscal trouble.
   Philadelphia's officials have ducked reality for years.
Since 1987, the city has run an annual deficit, which it
covered with short-term loans. That avenue is blocked now
that investors fear the city could default on its bonds.
   The city claims its fiscal woes are the result of
decreased federal aid and mandated programs that have
burdened the city. But the main factor is its responsibility:
labor costs. They account for well over half its budget. In
1987, the average city employee was paid $45,500 in wages and
benefits, 51% more than the average employee in the
metropolitan area and 66% more than the state average. Under
current contracts, a new city employee is entitled to 47 paid
days off his first year on the job. Philadelphia also has
more municipal employees than other major cities, 197 per
10,000 population compared with Pittsburgh's 153 and
Chicago's 137.
   City officials privately agree their labor costs are
outrageous, but say that union contracts tie their hands (a
refrain heard elsewhere). They certainly have perpetuated the
shoddy delivery of local services. In 1988, two private
companies offered to collect the city's garbage on time and
save $80 million a year, or half the existing costs. They
backed up their offer with $1 million performance bonds, but
the idea was shot down by the municipal unions.
   Lacking the courage to make needed reforms in America's
major cities, politicians commonly react to budget shortfalls
by cutting essential services first and using the expected
public uproar to raise taxes, further damaging the economy.
It may be that only drastic action will end this cycle of
tax-and-spend binging. Luckily, there is a model on how to
clean up a wasteful and inefficient city government.
   In 1986, Ecorse, Michigan, a working-class community of
11,000 near Detroit, was $6 million in debt and in violation
of court orders to balance its budget. A judge then placed
Ecorse in receivership, and gave Louis Schimmel, a municipal
bond expert, wide-ranging powers to clean up the city,
unhindered by politicians.
   Today, the deficit has disappeared, a model city has been
created and this year Ecorse was turned back to local
control. Mr. Schimmel's methods? "To privatize just about
everything," he says. In four years, he held the line on
taxes, cut the municipal work force almost in half and hired
private firms to handle most services. Excluding police, fire
and elected officials there are now only 18 city employees.
   Former mayor Larry Salisbury doesn't like everything Mr.
Schimmel did, but thinks much of it was necessary. "It was
painful, but we're getting our money's worth now," he says.
Outgoing State Treasurer Robert Bowman, a Democrat, also
approves of the Schimmel Solution: "The political will to
balance the budget wasn't there. Lou Schimmel did the
heavy-lifting that was required." He says the Ecorse
experience led to a new state law giving citizens the right
to petition the state government to audit a city's books.
   Mr. Schimmel is unsure how many of his reforms could be
implemented in Philadelphia, but he firmly believes municipal
bankruptcy can be an option for a city that won't control its
spending appetites. "Basic services don't stop," he says.
"They are restructured." Municipal attorneys tell us Chapter
9 of the bankruptcy law might be the only way to give
Philadelphia the power to renegotiate its bloated labor union
contracts.
   Putting a city into receivership isn't the end of the
world that local officials claim it would be. It may mean the
end of their world of ever-expanding budgets and
unaccountable government, however. If New York City had
bitten the bullet 15 years ago, and gone through a really
fundamental restructuring, it wouldn't be facing its current
fiscal nightmare. Perhaps its time the residents of New York
and other cities began thinking about putting a Lou Schimmel
into the picture, before the Philadelphia Story becomes their
story.

   Explosion at Trade-Processing Site
   Delays Session; Dow Declines 11.63

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices eased in a slow trading session
shortened by a delayed opening.
   Trading didn't begin on the Big Board or other exchanges
until 11 a.m. EST because of an early morning explosion at a
transformer in Lower Manhattan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The explosion blew out windows at the building that houses
the computers and offices of Securities Industry Automation
Corp., which processes much of the trading activity on the
exchanges. The Environmental Protection Agency denied anyone
access to the building until it tested whether the blast had
contaminated the offices. No contamination was found.
   Trading then began on a weak note, and share prices
drifted lower late in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average closed with an 11.63-point loss at 2625.50, nearly
erasing Wednesday's 16-point gain.
   Trading yesterday "was just the reverse" of Wednesday,
says Dudley A. Eppel, manager of equity trading at Donaldson
Lufkin. Trude Latimer, market strategist at Jesup Josepthal,
says that while portfolio managers may have been adding to
their year-end positions Wednesday, yesterday they were
dumping stocks they didn't want on the books.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.'s 500-Stock Index lost 2.56 to
328.29, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 1.12
to 179.48, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index dropped 2.12
to 304.43.
   On the Big Board, advancers trailed decliners 598 to 892
with 514 unchanged. Volume grew to 102.9 million shares from
Wednesday's 78.7 million.
   American Stock Exchange volume grew to 9,350,000 shares
from 7,970,000 Wednesday, with 240 issues advancing, 330
declining, and 291 unchanged.
   Some market watchers are shedding their bearskins as they
look to 1991.
   For example, Elaine Garzarelli is telling clients that a
new bull market has begun. The Lehman Brothers executive vice
president and director of sector analysis, who was credited
with predicting the October 1987 stock market crash, says
investors who buy shares now can expect total returns from
stocks of as much as 25% over the next 12 to 13 months.
   "This is an opportunity that only comes around every 8 to
10 years," Ms. Garzarelli says.
   Lehman predicts the current recession will last until
summer 1991, with the economy recovering during the second
half. The stock market already is anticipating that recovery,
Ms. Garzarelli says.
   Based on current interest rates and her earnings estimates
for 1992, she says the Dow Jones industrials should reach
3185 around the end of next year.
   Ms. Garzarelli, who uses her own system of 13 indicators
to forecast the market, turned bullish in late September. She
now says the bear market bottomed on Oct. 11 when the DJIA
closed at 2365, shortly after her indicators gave their buy
signal.
   Any pullbacks from here should be limited to between 4%
and 7%, she adds.
   She advises that investors buy shares on any market
weakness, particularly if the market dips on concern about
corporate profits when 1990 fourth-quarter earnings are
reported in mid-January.
   "Any drop below 2500" on the Dow "should be considered an
excellent gift," she says.
   Ms. Garzarelli says the best investment opportunities lie
in those cyclical industries that typically recover first
following a recession. She recommends 14 industry groups that
have performed about twice as well as the broader market
following each of the past four recessions.
   They are airlines; broadcast media; leisure-time products;
homebuilders; truckers; semiconductors; retailers;
textile/apparel; building materials; pollution control;
electronics; publishing; newspapers; and containers and
paper.
   Casino operator Caesars World fell 1 to 15 5/8 as it
closed the acquisition of all publicly held shares of Caesars
New Jersey.
   Tiffany sank 2 1/4 to 35 after falling 4 3/8 Wednesday.
Goldman Sachs and Dean Witter cut earnings estimates for the
luxurygoods company after Chairman William R. Chaney said
disappointing year-end sales would justify lowering profit
expectations for the fourth quarter.
   Acuson dropped 1 5/8 to 27. An arbitrator ordered the
company to pay $6.3 million plus attorney fees and costs to a
unit of Westmark International Inc. in a dispute over
marketing activities.
   McDonald's added 1/8 to 28 1/2. The fast-food chain is
testing a version of a low-fat burger, the Lean Deluxe, with
promising results, USA Today reported.
   Georgia Gulf jumped 1 1/8 to 9 1/4 after First Boston
raised its investment rating on the stock and boosted its
earnings estimates for the company.
   Frank B. Hall added 3/8 to 3 7/8. The activity sparked
speculation that the insurance broker's majority owner,
Reliance Group Holdings, is increasing its holdings, as it
has said it would. Reliance Group officials were unavailable,
but in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last
month, the company said it planned to buy as many as two
million of Hall's common shares periodically in the open
market. Reliance eased 1/4 to 5.
   Service Merchandise added 3/4 to 5 5/8 in active trading.
Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer and Morgan Keegan both made
positive comments about the stock yesterday.
   The Amex's Market Value Index fell 1.32 to 303.67.

   Massachusetts Follows California's Lead
   And Adopts Tough Auto-Emission Rules

   BOSTON -- Massachusetts adopted stringent auto-emission
standards modeled after recently enacted California rules,
making it the second state to clamp down harder on
car-related smog than the new federal clean-air legislation
does.
   Environmentalists, who have criticized the new federal
emissions rules as too weak, hailed Massachusetts' move as
the beginning of a trend that eventually may force the auto
industry to meet the California standards nationwide. "We
hope to create a domino effect," said Jenny Carter, an
attorney with the Massachusetts Public Interest Research
Group, an offshoot of Ralph Nader's lobbying organizations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts law, to be phased in from 1995 to 2003,
requires auto makers to cut new vehicles' hydrocarbon
emissions to levels 75% lower than those set by the new
federal law. It requires emission levels of other major smog
ingredients, nitrogen oxides, to be 50% lower than required
under the new federal standards. The Massachusetts law also
copies California's provisions that require auto makers to
continually test air-pollution control systems in randomly
selected vehicles they've previously sold and to correct
failures.
   Massachusetts' adoption of the California standards
"increases the momentum dramatically" among Northeast states
to adopt similar rules, said Michael Bradley, executive
director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use
Management, or NESCAUM, an eight-state group that coordinates
regional efforts to cut air pollution. He added that Maine
and Rhode Island "are close to proposing similar
regulations." Illinois, Texas, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin, Colorado, Washington and Oregon also "have
expressed interest in" the California standards, he said.
   "At some point, it will simply be easier for car
manufacturers to make the better car for all 50 states," said
Massachusetts state Rep. David Cohen, co-sponsor of the new
law.
   The auto industry lobbied hard against the Massachusetts'
law, arguing that it will increase car sticker prices by $500
or more. "There's no free lunch," said Thomas Joyce, a Boston
attorney representing the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association.
   But supporters of the new law estimate the improved
pollution-control devices it requires will add only $100 to
$300 to a new car's price. "Given the industry's unfulfilled
doomsday predictions about earlier emissions standards, its
credibility is sorely lacking" in predictions of fallout from
the new standards, said Mr. Cohen.
   Supporters of the Massachusetts law asserted that it
represents the cheapest way to meet air-pollution standards
mandated by the new federal law. To attain the pollution cuts
expected under the auto-emission standards by lowering
smokestack emissions instead is estimated to cost as much as
five times what the auto standards will cost, said NESCAUM's
Mr. Bradley.

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- Thomas W. Gamel said he resigned as a
director of Hollywood Park Operating Co., a race track
operator that's in the midst of a proxy and legal battle.
   In a Dec. 26 letter attached to a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Gamel said he was
resigning because he had been "shut out of the board's
deliberations and decisions" by Chairwoman and Chief
Executive Officer Marjorie Everett and her supporters on the
board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gamel became a director last year after threatening
his own proxy fight and calling for the removal of Mrs.
Everett. He subsequently withdrew his rival slate when he was
offered a seat on the board, and agreed he wouldn't acquire
more stock while he remained a director. In August, Mr. Gamel
reported that he had a 5.6% stake in the company.
   According to the SEC filing, Mr. Gamel delivered a proxy
and consent forms to investor Randall D. Hubbard, allowing
his shares to be voted in favor of Mr. Hubbard's proposal to
replace members of the board with Mr. Hubbard's own
eleven-person slate. The company has sued Mr. Hubbard,
claiming violations of the securities laws.
   Mr. Gamel remains a director of Hollywood Park Realty
Enterprises Inc., a real estate investment trust that rents
out the track site and other property. The realty and
operating companies are managed separately, but their shares
are paired for trading in the national over-the-counter
market.
   Spokesmen for Mr. Gamel and the company couldn't be

   American Air Wins Temporary Order
   Barring Its Pilots Union From Sickouts

<LP>
   American Airlines won a temporary restraining order
barring its pilots union from instigating or participating in
a sickout or other work slowdowns.
   The order, from U.S. District Judge John McBryde in Fort
Worth, Texas, comes amid a protracted contract dispute
between the Allied Pilots Association and American, a unit of
AMR Corp., Dallas. The airline alleged the union has been
waging a job action, which would be illegal under special
provisions of labor law that apply to airline workers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The union has vigorously denied such allegations before. A
spokesman yesterday reiterated that position. "It won't be
difficult for us to comply with the court order. We haven't
been doing anything illegal in the first place," he said.
   American contends heightened levels of sick leave have
been worsening operating problems at the carrier caused by
pilots being called up for military duty in Saudi Arabia.
This drain has reduced American's flexibility to respond to
pilot absences. As a result, the carrier will cut flight
schedules by about 4% beginning in February, according to
R.W. Baker, executive vice president of operations, in an
interview.
   Planning under a "worst-case assumption," Mr. Baker said
he figures 450 of American Airlines' 9,000 pilots could be
lost evenutally to the military, up from 250 currently.
   Meantime, the airline has assumed that "sick time at these
high levels will continue," Mr. Baker said. The executive
said that the number of pilots calling in sick climbed
steadily from early December, when about 323 were out, to 524
yesterday. "We would have expected something in the range of
300" based on historical patterns, he said.
   Harsh weather in the days preceding the Christmas holiday
at four of the six cities integral to American's route system
exacerbated the difficulties, he added.
   All these factors led the airline to seek the restraining
order Wednesday night, though Mr. Baker said American had
been preparing its court filing of more than 200 pages for at
least three months.
   In his order, Judge McBryde said that he granted the
request because the airline "is likely to prevail on the
merits of its claims," and that the "disruptive activity"
could "cause American Airlines to suffer a substantial loss
of revenue and passenger goodwill which it can never
recover."
   The judge scheduled a Jan. 3 hearing on American's request
for a preliminary injunction. The temporary order lasts
through Jan. 5.
   Although American's pilots have been working without a
contract since Dec. 30, 1989, they are forbidden from work
slowdowns, strikes and other actions under the Railway Labor
Act. The law, which applies to airlines and their labor
groups, requires a prolonged series of actions before airline
unions can act outside negotiations.
   First, if the two sides can't agree, they can petition for
a federally appointed mediator, who in this dispute was
called in last spring. In fact, there were talks as recently
as last Friday, and another round is scheduled for Jan. 7,
Mr. Baker said.
   If the two sides still can't agree, they can be declared
at an impasse and enter a 30-day, cooling-off period. Only if
that period ends without a new contract is the union free to
strike and the company to impose whatever work rules and pay
it chooses.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AMR shares closed at $48.375, down 50 cents.

interest in a combination of the two companys.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the filing, on Sept. 13 Westcott proposed the
merger of itself and Sandy where each Sandy share would be
exchanged for $4.125, subject to certain terms. Subsequent
conversations with representatives of Sandy led Westcott to
believe that certain conditions set forth in its Sept. 13
letters could not be readily satisfied by the company.
   On Dec. 7, Westcott received an unsolicited memorandum
from John Sheehy, a director of Sandy, which Westcott
believes was intended as a basis for new negotiations between
the company and Westcott. Westcott has not responded to such
memorandum and no discussions between Westcott and the
company are currently taking place.
   Westcott purchased 41,400 shares from Dec. 17 to Dec. 24
bringing its total holdings in Sandy to 142,900 shares.
   Sandy, Troy, Mich., is a training company for major
corporations. The company had no comment on the filing.

   Financial Security Assurance Holdings Ltd. said Tokio
Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co. of Japan purchased 9.9% of its
shares in a transaction valued at nearly $49 million. The
financial guaranty insurance company had been wholly owned by
U S West Capital Corp., a business unit of U S West Inc., a
telecommunications company based in Englewood, Colo.
   As part of the agreement, Tokio Marine and Financial
Security Assurance will market financial guaranty insurance
in Japan. Tokio Marine, the largest and oldest
property-casualty insurance company in Japan, also will have
a seat on the Financial Security Assurance board.

   The transaction marks an attempt by both companies to take
advantage of Japan's expanding asset-backed securities
market. The deal also represents the first time that a
Japanese insurer, other than a life insurance company, has
invested in a financial guarantor, a Financial Security
Assurance spokeswoman said.

   At its first meeting of shareholders yesterday, Alliance
New Europe Fund Inc., New York, postponed until early next
year a final vote on whether to convert to an open-end
investment company from a closed-end fund.
   A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares that trade
either at a discount or premium to the value of its assets.
An open-end fund issues shares continuously based on investor
demand, and redeems the shares directly from investors who
want to sell.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The meeting was adjourned until Jan. 10 to allow more time
to receive proxies from shareholders, the company said.
Management's open-end fund proposal requires the support of
75% or more of the shares outstanding for approval. At the
meeting, David H. Dievler, chairman, said 65% of the fund's
shares had voted, and of those, 62% favored converting to an
openend investment company.

   DALLAS -- McDuff Electronics &amp; Appliances Supercenters, a
division of Tandy Corp. of Fort Worth, has agreed to pay a
$15,000 fine and refrain from making misleading advertising
claims.
   In a complaint brought by the Texas attorney general's
office, McDuff was accused of advertising sales in which
products were priced as little as 0.10 of a percentage point
below the normal price. "If you advertise a sale, the
discount must be at least 10% less than the normal price,"
said Assistant Attorney General Steve Gardner.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among other practices, McDuff was also accused of calling
certain prices "the lowest of the year" when they were equal
to prices before and after the sale.
   Although the company didn't admit to any wrongdoing in
accepting the final judgment, it accepted a list of
restrictions on its advertising practices and agreed to
provide proof it is conforming with the judgment until the
end of 1992.
   In its ads McDuff must make clear all wording that
indicates a sale and must include a prominent explanation of
its pricing policy when using the legend "Nobody Undersells
McDuff." The $15,000 fine is intended to reimburse the
attorney general's office for its investigative costs.
   McDuff president Victor J. Sholis referred comment to a
spokesman, who didn't return telephone calls.

   Icahn Prepares to Add Condition to Bid:
   The Ouster of Pan Am Chairman Plaskett

   Trans World Airlines owner Carl Icahn is preparing to make
the ouster of Pan Am Corp. Chairman Thomas Plaskett a new
condition for his planned purchase of Pan Am, sources close
to the talks said.
   Such a condition would hurt chances of a friendly
acquisition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Plaskett's exit is understood to be on a laundry list
of stiff conditions that Mr. Icahn hasn't yet sent to Pan Am;
that list could still be altered before delivery. The
financier is angry at Pan Am for its repeated rebuffs of his
buy-out proposals.
   A Pan Am spokesman said, "Tom Plaskett would not stand in
the way of any offer that could benefit Pan Am or its
constituents."
   Mr. Icahn is proposing to buy Pan Am's 150 million shares
outstanding for $1.50 a share in cash. In addition, the
proposal includes an offer to pay $1 a share in subordinated
notes. The terms of those notes haven't been agreed upon, but
would most likely be valued at much less than $1 a share.
   Pan Am has indicated that it is willing to come to terms
on a merger, but that it requires bridge financing to help
carry operations through the next few months. But Mr. Icahn
has indicated he would give Pan Am such funding only if the
airline holding company first files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
court protection. Pan Am opposes that idea.
   Although he wants Mr. Plaskett removed, Mr. Icahn is
understood to favor retaining Pan Am executives such as
Richard Francis, chief financial officer, and Roger Cooke,
general counsel. Under the plan being considered, Mr. Francis
would apparently run the airline. He has been one of the
chief negotiators with Mr. Icahn and his representatives.
   Mr. Icahn is understood to lack faith in Mr. Plaskett's
management of Pan Am. The TWA camp notes that Pan Am
currently has so little cash that it's unclear whether the
ailing carrier would even have enough money to operate under
Chapter 11.
   Further, in a Christmas Eve letter to Pan Am officials,
Mr. Icahn suggested that Pan Am didn't get the best deal it
could have when it recently agreed to sell desirable
U.S.-London routes for $290 million to UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines.
   Industry observers contend any executive changes at Pan Am
would complicate a merger. "The more conditions placed on the
transaction, the more difficult it is to complete," said
Thomas Longman, an airline analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in
New York.
   Talks between the two airlines have deteriorated in recent
days, in part because of Mr. Icahn's unconventional
negotiating style, which irritates Pan Am executives. For
instance, they were annoyed when he dispatched his three-page
Christmas Eve letter after they'd left for the day, but in
time for wide distribution to the media. Pan Am officials
viewed that maneuver as a publicity stunt.
   Professional takeover speculators haven't been interested
in following the TWA/Pan Am merger effort because of the
tenuous nature and conditions of the offer as well as Mr.
Icahn's reputation for protracted haggling during
negotiation.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Pan Am shares closed unchanged at $1.375 -- less than the
cash portion of Mr. Icahn's proposal.
   Separately, Delta Air Lines said it asked the Department
of Transportation to combine and conduct a hearing on the
international route transfer applications of United and Pan
Am, and of American and TWA. The latter two have also asked
that the cases be consolidated.
   A department spokesman said officials would review the
request. But the department may be unwilling to combine the
cases because that would likely slow down the United-Pan Am
deal. With Pan Am on the ropes financially, its officials
want their transaction completed as soon as possible. The
DOT, in reviewing international route sales, isn't required
to conduct hearings; it just must give interested parties
adequate time to comment.
   Delta said it argued a hearing is necessary to weigh
possible adverse impacts on the industry's competitive
balance. "Delta does not oppose route transfer transactions
in principle," Ronald W. Allen, chairman and chief executive
maintained. "These particular transactions, however, are so
massive that they raise fundamental policy issues affecting
competition and market structure internationally and
domestically." He contended the transfers could create what
he dubbed "a duopoly across the Atlantic," in which the two
largest U.S. airlines would control two-thirds of the nonstop
U.S.-London routes.

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices jumped yesterday after the
government reported a record decline in orders for durable
goods.
   The bond market's bellwether 30-year Treasury bond ended
nearly 1/2 point higher, a gain of nearly $5 for a bond with
a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, eased to 8.24% from 8.28% on
Wednesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prices of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which usually lag
the Treasury market, posted strong gains with some general
obligation bonds issued by Massachusetts climbing as much as
one point. Traders attributed the rise in Massachusetts bonds
to short-covering, where dealers scramble to buy securities
to replace securities they borrowed at an earlier date.
   There also was a flurry of buying in the investment-grade
corporate bond market, which helped to push prices between
1/4 and 3/8 point higher. Mortgage-backed securities rose
between 1/8 and 1/4 point.
   The rally in the bond market was sparked by an extremely
weak economic report. The Department of Commerce reported
that orders for new durable goods plunged 10.5% last month,
offering further evidence that the economy is eroding.
   The decline matched a record drop set last January and was
much deeper than the 2.2% decline that had been forecast by
economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
   Bond investors react bullishly to bearish economic news
because slow economic growth often leads to lower interest
rates and lower inflation -- two trends that increase the
value of fixed-income securities.
   The report also set a positive tone for the Treasury's
$8.57 billion auction of four-year notes.
   The average yield set on the notes at yesterday's auction
was 7.66%, sharply lower than the 8.53% average yield at the
previous four-year note auction in September. The average
yield at yesterday's auction was lower than some analysts
expected and was even below the peak when-issued yield of
7.75% set Monday.
   Traders said that prices of notes and bonds were little
changed after the Federal Reserve preannounced, unexpectedly,
that it will execute two-day system repurchase agreements on
Monday. That's a technical trading maneuver designed to add
reserves to the banking system.
   Traders said the Fed made the unusual preannouncement in
an effort to relieve some of the pressures that have been
building in the federal funds market. The federal funds rate,
the rate at which banks charge each other for overnight
loans, hit 100% late Wednesday. The target for the rate is
7%.
   Although the rate often gyrates on the last day of a
two-week bank settlement period, as was yesterday,
Wednesday's spike to 100% was widely viewed in the market as
the result of a serious miscalculation of bank funding needs
by the Federal Reserve.
   While the Fed's announcement may have offered some relief
to the market, it still did not stop the Fed funds rate from
rising far above its target. The rate exceeded 10% yesterday
for some domestic transactions and was far higher on trades
involving some foreign banks.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
105 16/32, up from 105 1/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield
fell to 8.24% from 8.28%.
   Treasury bill rates were slightly higher. The discount
rate on three-month bills ended at 6.49% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 6.67%, up slightly from 6.48% to
yield 6.66% on Wednesday. The rate on six-month bills rose to
6.59% to yield 6.89% compared with 6.56% to yield 6.86% on
Wednesday.

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   Corporate &amp; Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A flurry of retail buying enlivened the investment-grade
corporate bond market, injecting a dose of excitement into an
otherwise stultifying week.
   Corporate bond traders said much of the buying was
concentrated in shorter-maturity corporates and high-quality
issues.
   The buying was unexpected since investors typically sell
corporate bonds at year end to clean up their balance sheets
and remove tainted credits.
   "This is the first time in a very long time we've gotten
year-end buying which is causing" yields to fall relative to
yields on Treasury securities, said Andrew Tarica, a
corporate bond trader at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Mr. Tarica notes that Associates Corp. of North America's
9% five-year notes, which were trading at a yield of about
1.55 percentage points above the comparable Treasury issue
earlier this month, now trade at a spread of about 1.27
percentage points.
   While high-grade corporate bonds ended between 1/4 and 3/8
point higher, junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities
with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, finished
only marginally higher.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to 3/8 higher, with some
issues up 1/2 to 1 point.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were 3/8
higher, at 99 for a return of 7.26%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended higher.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% for January
delivery were up 7/32 at 99 4/32. Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. Gold 9% issues and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9% issues were up 5/32 at 98 24/32 and 98 16/32,
respectively.
   Traders said retail participation has ground to a halt
during the year-end holiday period, as accounts have long
closed their books for the year.
   In the primary market, no new issues were announced.

   The state insurance department said the New York State
Court of Appeals upheld a fine against a subsidiary of
American International Group for overcharging taxicab owners
on liability coverage.
   As a result, the AIG unit, Insurance Co. of the State of
Pennsylvania, based in New York, must pay $425,000, the
insurance department said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In May 1988, the subsidiary was fined for overcharging
taxicab mini-fleet owners about $1.4 million over a
three-year period, starting in 1981. The state insurance
department fined the unit for improperly using a liability
conversion factor to increase premiums and increasing
premiums without state approval.
   AIG said the decision puts an end to the "old" case, but
questioned why the Court of Appeals, the state's highest
court, came to the decision without conducting a hearing.
"It's a shame," said Patrick Foley, AIG's general counsel.
"We feel the decision was wrong."

   Albert Fisher Group PLC of Britain, a food distribution
company, said it bought the European frozen-vegetable and
seafood operations of Campbell Soup Co., Camden, N.J., for
#15 million ($28.2 million).
   Albert Fisher said the purchase covers Campbell's
Freshbake frozen-vegetable operations in Britain and its
seafood operations in Britain and Belgium.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Campbell's chief executive officer, David Johnson, said,
"This sale results from our strategic decision to focus our
European efforts on branded value-added prepared foods."
Campbell said the sale also is a major step in the
restructuring and divestiture program the company announced
earlier this year.
   Albert Fisher said the acquisition is an important step in
developing the company's European food-processing and
distribution operations. It said Campbell's frozen-vegetable
assets, when combined with Albert Fisher's operations, will
form the largest frozen-vegetable business in Britain. Money
for the purchase came from cash reserves, Albert Fisher said.

   Merry-Go-Round Puts Rise
   In `Low Double Digits'
   On a Same-Store Basis

   Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc., benefitting somewhat from
the sagging fortunes of retailing giants, said same-store
sales for December are running "in the low double digits"
higher than a year ago.
   Although that falls short of the 28% increase in
Merry-Go-Round's same-store sales last December from the
previous year, it compares favorably with results of many
other retailers, whose recent sales have been depressed by
flagging consumer confidence and uncertainty over the
economy. November same-store sales for big retailers were
essentially flat with adjusted year-ago figures, analysts
say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Merry-Go-Round's increases in comparable-store
sales figures have been declining in recent months, the
company is "showing strong performances and doing
considerably better than the retail industry as a whole,"
said Robert F. Buchanan, an analyst at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons
Inc., Baltimore. Mr. Buchanan added that Merry-Go-Round is
strong in such "hot brands" as Z. Cavaricci and Get Used, as
well as its private I.O.U. label.
   "Christmas is very good; we're very pleased," Michael D.
Sullivan, president and chief executive officer of the
specialty apparel retailer, said in an interview.
   Mr. Sullivan said that analysts' estimates are "right on
target" that Merry-Go-Round will earn about $36 million, or
$1.60 a share, on sales of $600 million to $620 million, for
the year ending Feb. 2. Mr. Sullivan also said he was
comfortable with analysts' projections the company will earn
$1.80 to $1.90 a share for the fiscal year that begins Feb.
3.
   In the year ended last Feb. 3, Merry-Go-Round earned $22.2
million, or $1.04 a share, on sales of $478.9 million.
Year-ago per-share numbers were restated to reflect several
stock splits. Merry-Go-Round, whose stock is traded on the
New York Stock Exchange, had been traded over-the-counter
before March 27, 1990.
   There was a 3-for-2 stock split in August 1989 and a
4-for-3 split earlier this year. Merry-Go-Round recently
announced a 3-for-2 split, payable Jan. 4 to stock of record
Dec. 21. The company paid its first cash dividend, 2.5 cents
a share, in June. After the next split, it will pay a
dividend of two cents a share, which represents a 20%
increase in its dividend rate.
   "Our stock always reacts well after a split," said Isaac
Kaufman, chief financial officer. Mr. Kaufman said
Merry-Go-Round periodically declares a split when the stock
reaches a certain level, because it gives the company "a lot
more liquidity." In the past month, the stock has been
trading in the low 20s, to as high as $24.50, up from the
mid-to-high teens it traded at in September.
   In the past few years, the Joppa, Md., company "grew a
little faster" than it had planned, Mr. Sullivan said. Since
1988, Merry-Go-Round has added nearly 250 stores, and
currently has 677 stores.
   Some of the success of the company, which sells moderately
priced apparel to 15-to-25-year olds, comes from
merchandising strategies, Mr. Sullivan said. "Some of it was
just business coming our way" from the bigger retailers, Mr.
Sullivan said. "We took a lot of market share from department
stores that were having credit problems," he said, adding
that those stores may have cut inventory in areas where
Merry-Go-Round is strongest.
   Business has been so good, in fact, that Merry-Go-Round
recently announced a $20 million capital expansion in which
it will add about 450,000 square feet to its relatively new
distribution center in Joppa, which is about 350,000 square
feet. All told, the retailer plans to spend $40 million to
$50 million on capital programs in the next fiscal year,
including spending on new stores and renovations, Mr.
Sullivan said. That compares with the about $40 million of
capital spending estimated for the current fiscal year. The
executive expects the expanded distribution center to be "on
stream" by spring 1992. In 1989, the company, whose stores
include Cignal, Merry-Go-Round and Dejaiz, acquired 124
Silverman's stores. That acquisition has been "very
successful," Mr. Sullivan said. Merry-Go-Round and Cignal are
unisex outlets, while Dejaiz, Attivo and Silverman's cater to
young men. Merry-Go-Round's specialty retail competitors
include Gap Inc. and Limited Inc.
   In addition, Merry-Go-Round is in the process of acquiring
as many as 55 women's apparel stores under the T. Edwards
name from Brooks Fashions Inc. of New York. Merry-Go-Round,
which is still getting approval from various landlords, has a
target of early February for the sale to close.
Merry-Go-Round will operate the T. Edwards stores under that
name, initially.
   Mr. Sullivan wouldn't disclose the purchase price. But he
said the company won't have to borrow to finance the
purchase. "We'll probably have in excess of $65 million to
$70 million in cash" at year end, he said.

   Westpac Banking Corp. of Wellington, Australia, said it
offered to acquire Southland Building &amp; Investment Society,
New Zealand's biggest mutually owned savings institution with
assets of about 400 million New Zealand dollars (US$235
million).
   A Westpac spokesman wouldn't disclose financial details of
the offer. The 50,000 members of Southland are to hold an
extraordinary meeting in February to consider the offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed acquisition is the first expansion by Westpac
in New Zealand in about seven years. If successful, Westpac
intends to maintain Southland as a wholly owned but separate
entity. An application to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for
a full banking license for Southland would be made if the bid
is successful, Westpac said.

   Tokyo stock prices finished little changed Thursday, as
gains posted earlier in the day were chipped away by
profittaking toward the end of the session, traders said.
   In London, share prices closed higher, and at the top of
the day's trading range, in a market starved for activity.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 53.14
points at 23940.70.
   At the end of Friday's morning session, the Nikkei closed
at 23,848.71, down 91.99.
   Volume on the first section Thursday was estimated at 330
million shares, up from 223.5 million shares Wednesday.
Gaining issues outnumbered declining issues 599 to 345, while
153 issues remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was up 10.74 points, or 0.62%, at 1740.55.
   The Second Section Index gained for the first time in nine
trading days, climbing 3.99 points, or 0.15%, to close at
2722.06. Volume in the second section was estimated at four
million shares, virtually unchanged from 3.99 million shares
Wednesday.
   Stock prices in general found support at their
intrasession lows through a moderate amount of buying by
newly launched investment trust funds, and by arbitrage
buying, traders said.
   Large-capital shares such as steel manufacturers and
shipbuilding companies were bought, as well as big-name
companies such as Hitachi and Mitsubishi Estate. Talk that
Secretary of State James Baker may visit Iraq for discussions
on Jan. 9 also provided some stability to the market, traders
said.
   But the market failed to sustain investors' buying
interest. After advancing to the intraday high of 24263.63
points at midafternoon, the Nikkei index quickly turned
downward, falling 322.93 points by the end of the day.
   Most investors were sitting on the fence earlier in the
day, but started taking profits on the perception that stock
prices were unlikely to rise further, said Shigeru Akiba,
head of equity at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International.
   With only the Friday morning session left for this year,
investors were wary of keeping positions high amid the
ongoing Persian Gulf crisis and political uncertainty in the
Soviet Union, participants said. The market will be closed
from Dec. 29 to Jan. 3.
   "There are no strong incentives to buy. But at the same
time investors have no reason to hurry to sell as stock
prices are unlikely to fall widely below the current level,"
said a senior trader at Yamaichi Securities.
   Mr. Akiba of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International predicts
stock prices will be supported Friday as arbitragers are
likely to buy stocks to take advantage of a wide premium on
futures compared with stocks at the end of Thursday's
trading.
   Nippon Steel was the most heavily traded issue for the
day, ending at 448 yen ($3.29), up 10 yen. Among other steel
makers, Sumitomo Metal gained six yen to 456 yen, while NKK
ended one yen higher at 401 yen, pushed down from its
intraday high on profit-taking.
   Other gainers included Hitachi, which was up 10 yen to
1,120 yen, and Mitsubishi Estate, which advanced 50 yen to
1,390 yen.
   Shipbuilding companies also attracted buying, with Mitsui
Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding up 12 yen to 542 yen, while
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained three yen to 673 yen.
   Also popular were shares of some pharmaceuticals. Mochida
gained 190 yen to 2,540 yen, while Ono Pharmaceutical was up
350 yen to 4,500 yen.
   Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange reported data on
stock-futures arbitrage trading for the week ended Dec. 21.
The number of short cash positions held at the end of the
week totaled 5.7 million units, amounting to 6.13 billion
yen. The number of long positions, meanwhile, totaled 182.9
million units, amounting to 209.37 billion yen.
   As of Dec. 21, the number of short cash positions held
against March futures contracts declined 37.4 million units
to zero, marking a 42.59 billion yen loss. On the other hand,
the number of long positions held against March contracts
increased 142 million units to 485.6 million units. The value
rose to 541.1 billion yen.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share
Index closed 11.5 points higher at 2167.8, up from the day's
worst level of 2155.7 recorded in the first hour of trading.
   The narrower FT 30-Share Index closed 8.9 points higher at
1687.8. Volume was a meager 177.4 million shares.
   The London exchange was closed Tuesday and Wednesday for
holiday.
   Brokers said trade is effectively on hold until the new
year, with most operators absent from the market for the
holiday season. This gave activity an overbearingly technical
tone, apart from a few new year trading tips that generated
volume in selected issues.
   A late start to trading on the American and New York stock
exchanges, caused by a fire in the Wall Street area, further
deprived London of incentive during the afternoon session. By
the close of trading in London, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was off to a poor start.
   Among shares benefiting from the new year trading
recommendations published by various newspapers, the property
development group Trafalgar House rose seven pence (13 cents)
to 203 pence a share while the telecommunications group Cable
&amp; Wireless ended two pence higher at 446 pence.
   Food distribution and service company Albert Fisher was
unchanged at 117 pence. Earlier, the company said it paid #15
million ($28.2 million) for the European frozen vegetable and
seafood assets of Campbell Soup Co.
   Shares in building products company RMC ended two pence
lower at 650 pence. RMC has reported to the U.K. Office of
Fair Trading that some of its units operated unlawful
market-sharing practices.
   In the pharmaceutical sector, shares in Wellcome ended
five pence higher at 435 pence, despite the potential
competition of a new treatment for AIDS developed through a
U.S.-Swiss joint venture.
   Glaxo closed 12 pence higher at 861 pence, and SmithKline
Beecham finished five pence higher at 625 pence.
   Meanwhile, share prices closed higher in Milan, lower in
Stockholm, Paris, Frankfurt and Madrid and mixed in Brussels,
Zurich and Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed
firmer.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Singapore and

   It's Still Hot in Hawaii

   HONOLULU -- No state is an economic island, but one clue
of how removed Hawaii may be from the mainland's doldrums can
be found in a nondescript hangar off the city's international
airport. Five shiny British Aerospace 94-passenger jets sit
in preparation for the planned April start-up of Discovery
Airways.
   If given a regulatory nod, Discovery is to serve
inter-island tourist routes already flown by two troubled
Hawaiian carriers. Its start-up actually is a rebirth -- it
was grounded last summer after 10 weeks when the initial
ownership ran afoul of federal prohibitions on foreign
control. Since then, the U.S. airline industry hasn't exactly
invited such a venture. But the strategy of the three
Americans who took over Discovery has a lot to do with why
the U.S. economic sun will set last in Hawaii. The key word
is Asia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Discovery's president, Clyde McAvoy, was a longtime
Continental Airlines executive in Tokyo (and sometime
contributor to these pages). He believes Hawaii's Asian
visitors, particularly, want more reliable and pleasant
service on connecting flights to the state's increasingly
popular "neighbor islands." These passengers generally must
hook up with one of the Hawaiian airlines because the big
carriers fly only to Oahu -- Honolulu -- and sometimes Maui.
Mr. McAvoy knows that tourism in the 50th U.S. state, indeed
much of its economy, is becoming a blend of East and West.
   That helps to explain why housing prices are highest in
the nation, why the state government is so flush it has been
cutting taxes and why analysts tend to believe the islands
can escape the crashing wave of bad news from the American
mainland -- as long as they don't get caught in a
recessionary riptide from Japan. At the same time, however,
Hawaii's upward spiral in the late '80s, with linkages to the
equity and property markets of Japan and a supervalued yen,
makes any prospect of a bilateral bust all the scarier.
   The Japanese presence has been notable here for decades,
but not until the 1980s did the rush come. Japan now accounts
for more than a fifth of the tourists, having nearly tripled
its annual count in seven years, and roughly half the money
spent by those who do visit. Travel in turn led to investment
in hotels, resort condominiums and lately the
commercial/office market.
   Those sound like losers in most parts of America. But
Hawaii has been different. Honolulu is distinct among U.S.
cities, for example, in its dearth of shopping malls and its
low downtown high-rise vacancy rate -- about 2%, though
expected to reach the mid-teens in a couple of years as a
slew of projects are finished.
   The extent of Japanese holdings, particularly in the
Waikiki hotel district, gives Hawaiians hope that business
and government leaders in Tokyo will shepherd this tourism
trail through any economic slump. Japan's employment levels
are expected to remain high, even if its asset markets
continue to decline. And that bodes well for travel, because
the middle-class, shut out of housing purchases and without
anywhere to park additional cars, has little else to spend
on.
   However, should the Gulf crisis or other drags on the
trade-dependent Japanese economy lead to a significant
devaluation of the yen, tourism abroad would be dearer.
Hawaiian real estate would suffer an even ruder jolt from a
lower yen. Nicholas Ordway of the University of Hawaii's Real
Estate Research and Education Center, reviewing the 10,000%
growth in the dollar volume of property transactions in the
state since 1965, finds a direct link between boom periods
and yen appreciation against the dollar. In upturns in the
Hawaii market, volume rises 3% for every 1% gain in the
yen/dollar ratio, he says.
   Mr. Ordway finds an uncomfortable parallel between the
Hawaii transaction volume and Chicago office real-estate
before the 1929 Crash. Japanese have been doing most of the
deals of more than $1 million, using home-country financing.
Even with a high yen, the top end of Hawaiian real estate
already has begun to sag, and Mr. Ordway sees trouble
deepening. How fast Japanese finance, geared to highly
leveraged assets, can or will contract is a question: Mr.
Ordway says, "We can expect intervention in the banking
system, but I keep returning back to what we saw in the early
'30s."
   David Ramsour, chief economist for Bank of Hawaii, is more
sanguine. "Historical patterns that Japanese banks have
followed with regard to maintenance of credit lines lead me
to think there will not be a contraction," he says. More
likely, he thinks, is a drying up of new credit. That will
stifle the luxury condominium market.
   Mr. Ramsour emphasizes, however, that Hawaii's financial
institutions aren't endangered: They weren't players in the
big deals, and even demanded 50% or more down from Americans
trading up into high-priced homes. (If anything, the
tightfistedness of the local banks was a complaint of
Hawaiian businesses long before recent cries of a national
"credit crunch.") Moreover, the islands' population has
maintained the best payback record of any state in the
nation.
   Mr. Ramsour argues that although unemployment may drift up
a bit from its remarkable 2.5%, the real oomph from an
estimated $11 billion in foreign -- mostly Japanese --
investment from 1985 to 1989 is yet to come. The transactions
merely shifted wealth between non-Hawaiian accounts. The
renovation or replacement of the properties lies just ahead
and will employ locals. About $3 billion will keep the 1.1
million-person economy humming, he says, maybe at 3% growth
in 1991.
   Residential real estate is widely thought to be stable,
although those amazing median prices of recent years
($375,000 in third-quarter 1989) may drop. The reason is a
changing mix of sales. Demand is off for the most expensive
homes, but is moving down the price ladder to the "entry"
condo market, at $200,000 or below. (About 40% of Hawaii's
dwelling units are condominiums.) Little construction of
"affordable" houses has been seen for 15 years in Hawaii
because of land-use constraints, and low-end shelter is due
to be bid up in step with earlier rises in classier homes. If
transactions thus are concentrated in cheaper units, the
average sales figure is going to come down.
   Housing at all market levels is a financial strain not
only because land is dear, but because construction, when it
can take place, is amazingly expensive. Mr. Ordway figures it
is 10 times or more the price per square foot on the
mainland, not only because building materials other than
cement have to be imported but because demand for workers has
zoomed and the arrival of new hands is checked by the high
cost of living.
   How does Hawaii maintain the balance between
tourist-service wages and high home prices? The secret, say
local analysts, is the locals' inclination to work multiple
jobs. And, particularly among those of Asian ancestry,
there's a willingness to crowd into one domicile.
   That doesn't appeal to many executives, so the housing
sticker shock is a major deterrent to drawing the kind of
managers or technical talent Hawaii could use to diversify
its economy. Aside from tourism and construction, only the
medical industry is a significant gainer; the state has a
mandatory health-insurance law. Production work is dwindling
with the gradual demise of sugar and pineapple plantations,
and though the state has a vibrant small-business culture,
neither high-technology nor any other significant sector has
emerged as a local wealth base. Alarm is expressed over the
numbers of college-trained young people leaving the state for
jobs that will afford them a better life style, but the large
U.S. military operations here yield some skilled personnel,
such as advanced mechanics.
   Hawaii long has suffered from high-tax paternalism, but
its economic ambitions have been bolstered by effective tax
cuts in the past two years. Income-tax brackets have been
compressed and the top marginal rate cut to 9 1/2% from 10%.
Credits have been expanded. According to mainland economists
Victor Canto and John Silvia, Hawaii's tax burden, which has
been fifth highest in the nation, is dropping far faster than
any other state's.
   Whether this represents anything more than a good-times
jubilee is another question mark over the Hawaiian horizon.
Government remains heavy and difficult for entrepreneurs to
deal with. But as long as the Asians come, even if only to
buy Louis Vuitton "souvenirs" instead of real estate, the
islands' economy should remain blessed. In November, that
visitor traffic was up 21% from that month a year earlier,
leading to an overall 3.9% jump in tourist numbers. No wonder
Clyde McAvoy wants to get Discovery Airways back off the
ground.

   Economy:
   New Construction
   Hit a 5-Year Low
   During November

   NEW YORK -- Contracting for new construction in November
reached its lowest level in five years, further evidence that
the economy is slumping.
   F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said
its seasonally adjusted Dodge index fell to 144 in November
from 145, a four-year low, in October. The index uses 1982 as
a base year of 100.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The value of newly started construction of all kinds fell
to an annualized $225.9 billion in November from $228.3
billion in October. Nonresidential building contracts and
new-home start-ups fell 8% and 4%, respectively, to $77.6
billion and $91.8 billion. In contrast, values for
nonbuilding construction, which includes public works and
utilities, surged 16% to $56.5 billion, reflecting an $800
million program of pipeline repair and replacement in Alaska.
This project helped to keep the index from falling more
steeply.
   Despite economic uncertainties, construction start-ups
aren't unusual in the category of large nonbuilding projects
requiring three to five years lead time. But conventional
commercial and residential projects are hurting for
financing. George A. Christie, vice president and chief
economist for F.W. Dodge, said, "Lenders are properly wary of
real estate investment after the S&amp;L mess, but if lenders
won't lend, developers can't build."
   Construction activity declined in all five major regions
in the nation, particularly in the Northeast and the South
Atlantic, which recorded 21% and 16% declines, respectively.
Smaller than average slumps, ranging from 3% to 6%, were
reported in the South Central, the West and the North Central
regions.
   Through the first 11 months of 1990, total construction
contract values declined 10% to $225.6 billion from $251.3
billion in the previous year. Nonbuilding construction
remained flat.

   More evidence that the economy has slipped into recession
put a damper on stock prices but nudged bond prices higher.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 11.63 points to
close at 2625.50 after a session shortened by an electrical
fire that delayed the opening of the New York Stock Exchange
for 90 minutes.

   Bond prices rose in light trading. The dollar was mixed,
posting gains against the Japanese yen, but falling against
the German mark.
   A surprisingly big drop in November durable goods orders
set the tone for the day, pushing bond prices higher. The
orders plunged 10.5% last month, virtually confirming that
the economy is mired in recession. Economists had estimated
the order rate would be down a little more than 2.2%. Even
excluding the volatile transportation sector, which swings
widely from month to month because of huge aircraft orders,
the November pace was down 3.5% to the lowest level in two
years.
   Economists said the dismal news almost certainly means
more layoffs in the industrial sector of the economy early
next year, adding to economic woes already afflicting large
parts of the country. The news makes it more likely that the
Federal Reserve will lower short-term interest rates further
in hopes of stimulating the rapidly weakening economy.
   Some analysts predict the Fed will again cut the federal
funds rate -- which banks and other financial institutions
charge one another for short-term loans -- as early as next
week.
   An explosion and fire outside a New York building housing
the computer nerve center for the major stock exchanges
prevented the New York Stock Exchange from opening until 11
a.m EST. But with trading activity stuck in low gear for the
holidays, traders said the delay had little perceptible
effect on either volume or prices.
   Foreign currency trading was "extremely light" because
traders were reluctant to take positions in a thin market
without any compelling developments. While traders look to
the Middle East crisis and the Soviet Union's deepening
political problems to provide some support for the dollar,
profit-taking after last week's big runup has eaten away at
the dollar's recent gains against the mark. They said
Japanese purchases of short-term dollar-denominated
investments has strengthened the dollar against the yen
modestly in the past few days.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices slumped in thin trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 103 million shares. Declining
issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 892 to 598.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices climbed. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
gained nearly one-half of a point, or almost $5 for each
$1,000 face amount. The yield on the issue slipped to 8.24%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading the
currency was quoted at 1.5255 marks and 136.40 yen compared
with 1.5368 marks and 136.25 yen Wednesday.

   Base Ten Systems Inc. said net income for the fiscal year
ended Oct. 31 fell 39% to $1.8 million, or 50 cents a share,
on revenue of $47.6 million.
   In the year-earlier period, the Trenton, N.J., maker of
electronics systems for defense and commercial applications
reported net income of $2.9 million, or 82 cents a share.
Results included income from discontinued operations of $1.3
million, or 37 cents a share. Revenues were $48.9 million.
Fiscal fourth-quarter figures weren't immediately available.

   Looking forward, Myles M. Kranzler, chairman and
president, said the company expects that "after a slow start,
1991 will be profitable but with revenue in the $30 million
to $35 million range."
   For 1992, Mr. Kranzler said the company sees sales of
"over $40 million with better than 80 cents a share net
income, and a continuation of growth in both sales and
profits in 1993."

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said it expects to
complete its $66-a-share tender offer for MCA Inc. on
schedule, by 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.
   The Japanese electronics giant said it doesn't expect to
extend the offer for the Universal City, Calif.,
entertainment concern beyond that date. Barring any
last-minute surprises, the $6.59 billion acquisition
therefore should be completed this year.

   MCA also filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission related to the planned
spinoff of New York-area television station WWOR-TV to its
shareholders as part of the Matsushita acquisition.
   The newly spun-off company, which will be called Pinelands
Inc., rather than Red Oak as originally contemplated, is
expected to have about 16.9 million common shares
outstanding, or one share for every five MCA shares. MCA said
the station had operating cash flow of about $28 million for
the first nine months of 1990, up about 55% from $18 million
for the same period in 1989. Revenue of $141 million was up
18% from $119 million a year ago.

   THE ECONOMY CRUMBLES even faster than expected, private
analysts say.
   As recently as early this month, the Blue Chip consensus
forecast a 1.3% GNP drop for the current quarter. Now, Morgan
Stanley says the economy shrank at an annual rate of 3.6%;
Goldman Sachs says 4.4%. Even the more optimistic 2.1%
prediction by McGraw Hill/DRI would make the fourth-quarter
performance the worst since 1982.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Fed defuses criticism by picking up the pace of its
interest-rate cuts; Congress now is likely to start bashing
banks for failing to cut the prime rate in response. "The
banks are reluctant to pass on the savings because of their
own problems," says Senate Banking Committee Chairman Riegle,
adding that they shouldn't "penalize current borrowers for
mistakes . . . that were the banks' fault."
   The sour economy eats into tax revenues. Personal
income-tax receipts for October and November ran 3% behind
last year's; corporate receipts were down nearly 7%.
                                                                                                       

   THE PENTAGON MULLS reducing supervision of contractors,
raising hackles.
   One proposal envisions a 20% cut in overall federal audits
and on-site contract management personnel at aircraft
factories, missile plants and other facilities; companies
that improve their own internal vigilance would be rewarded
with a better shot at winning new government deals.
   But following recent scandals, some lawmakers -- including
powerful Rep. Dingell -- push for more rather than less
supervision. The issue could dash the chances of Donald
Yockey, the Pentagon's acting acquisition chief, to get the
post in fact. He has been leading the campaign for reduced
policing, but critics say he has long disliked government
auditors.
                                                                                                       

   BAKER'S CONCERNS extend from the Persian Gulf to the
Soviet Union.
   The secretary of state plans to head abroad next month,
whether or not the meeting with Saddam Hussein comes off. He
will seek more money from Arabs and Germany. He will also
probably convene a session of the foreign ministers of the
five permanent U.N. Security Council countries to consider
how to enforce the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   In addition, Baker wants to see the Soviets, in Moscow or
elsewhere, for a firsthand account of the turmoil there. He
would prefer to hear it from departing foreign minister
Shevardnadze, whom he trusts. The two sides also need to
smooth out details of the planned Feb. 11 Bush-Gorbachev
summit and discuss Moscow's posture on the Jan. 15 U.N.
deadline.
   Aide Dennis Ross will soon visit Israel, signaling Arabs
the U.S. still cares about the Palestinian problem despite
refusing to link it with the Gulf.
                                                                                                       

   BUSH HOPES to name a new GOP chairman by early next week,
but problems abound with the short list of contenders:
Political consultant Rich Bond once worked for a liberal
congressman; former Texas Rep. Tom Loeffler's Contra stand
upset conservatives; New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers pushed
for a tax increase. Transportation chief Skinner remains an
outside possibility.
                                                                                                       

   BANKERS SCRAMBLE for an alternative to Seidman's proposal
to replenish the FDIC fund. The American Bankers Association
has a team of accountants devising a less-painful method than
his proposed onetime, 1%-of-deposits assessment. "It's all
going to be painful medicine, but we want to make sure we
don't overdose," says William Brandon, president of an
Arkansas bank.
                                                                                                       

   HARVARD REFUSES -- as is its custom -- to extend leaves
beyond two years for several professors now serving as Bush
administration officials. White House policy chief Porter
resigns his endowed chair at the Kennedy School; Treasury
Undersecretary Glauber quits the business school.
                                                                                                       

   GRUDGING GIFTS: Japan's Gulf crisis aid to "front-line"
states Egypt, Jordan and Turkey has strings attached. Some
low-interest loans are earmarked for specific construction
projects; others are tied to tough World Bank financial
conditions. That irks the Bush administration, but Treasury
boss Brady is loath to criticize Tokyo publicly.
                                                                                                       

   IRAQ CLOUDS planning for Bush's State of the Union
address.
   Cabinet members Thornburgh, Derwinski and Sullivan meet
with White House officials to discuss possible themes; aides
are also trolling for ideas, especially among Bush's
conservative critics. But with the Gulf situation,
speechwriters don't know how much space to devote to domestic
issues.
   Despite all the complaints about a lack of direction in
domestic policy, some aides want to hold ideas back from the
address; Sununu thinks some legislation stands a better
chance with Congress -- and can make a bigger splash -- if
presented separately. A health initiative for the working
poor and uninsured may fall into this category.
   So might the controversial national energy strategy,
though a White House official says scornfully that "there is
absolutely no event requiring an immediate decision" on it.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Bob Hope, irked at bureaucratic obstacles to
his Christmas shows for troops in the Gulf, called Bush
directly last week to speed up arrangements. . . . Rapping
Rep. Major Owens urges Bush to "just declare victory and dig
in/outlasting the enemy is not a sin." . . . Sen. Armstrong's
office sends out an up-to-date official biography of him,
dated Dec. 16; he leaves office next Thursday.

   Southern Co. said its subsidiaries have completed
negotiating an agreement with Gulf States Utilities Co. over
disputed contracts for the sale of power.
   The agreement, if approved by the companies' boards, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and others, will
terminate litigation that began in July 1986 when Gulf States
asked Southern Co. to renegotiate contracts to buy
approximately $1 billion in electricity from Southern Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement calls for Gulf States, of Beaumont, Texas,
to give Southern Co., of Atlanta, as much as $300 million in
cash, common stock and deferred payments. In a refinement of
the initial agreement, Gulf States agreed to pay a penalty to
Southern Co. unless the price of Gulf States stock reaches
$18.25 a share for five consecutive days before Jan. 1, 1993.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Gulf
States stock closed at $10.125 a share, down 12.5 cents.
   Southern Co. said it agreed to exercise voting rights on
Gulf States stock only "in very limited circumstances."

   Treasury Asked
   To Launch Study
   Of Insurance Firms

   WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
has asked the Treasury to launch a wide-ranging study of U.S.
insurance companies, as congressional concern about the
industry increases.
   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) requested that as part of
an eight-month study, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
consider the merits of abandoning state regulation of
insurance companies in favor of federal oversight.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I believe that the recent history of the savings and loan
and commercial banking industries makes clear that the
federal government cannot afford to ignore serious problems
in any industry that lies close to the heart of the American
economy," Sen. Riegle said in a letter dated Dec. 20 to Mr.
Brady.
   The request occurs as other lawmakers intensify their
scrutiny of the industry. Both Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.,
Ohio) and Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) intend to push for
legislation to tighten insurance regulation, possibly moving
it to the purview of a federal agency. Sen. Metzenbaum also
favors repeal of the insurance industry's 45-year-old
antitrust exemptions. Such a bill was approved by the House
Judiciary Committee last year, and nearly made it to the
House floor for a vote.
   A Treasury spokesman said the department was considering
the request, but had no reaction yet. Sen. Riegle requested
that the study be completed by Sept. 1. Already, Messrs.
Dingell and Metzenbaum have indicated that they plan to press
ahead on insurance legislation.
   Sen. Riegle asked the Treasury to assess the general
financial health of the insurance industry, which suffered a
record number of failures in 1989. He also requested an
evaluation of the industry's exposure to risky assets, such
as real estate and junk bonds, as well as the health of the
state guaranty funds and the effect of a large insurance
company failure on the economy. He also requested comment on
whether insurance companies, increasingly marketed as
investments, should be subject to more extensive disclosure
requirements.
   Insurance industry lobbyists say that Capitol Hill concern
is overblown, but understandable, following the S&amp;L industry
bailout, which will cost taxpayers $200 billion plus hundreds
of billions more in interest. "What is of grave concern is
that the wrong image about the industry's financial strength
is being promoted by unwarranted inquiries," said Henri
Bersoux, a lobbyist for the American Council of Life
Insurance.
   He said that Congress believed the life insurance industry
is healthy enough to incur an $8 billion increase in its tax
burden, as part of the recent federal budget pact. The total
industry has roughly $2 trillion in assets.

   American Express's Shearson Troubles Linger,
   Say Analysts Who See Write-Downs in Future

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- It looks as if American Express has found some
more worms in the apple at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
   Nine months ago, James Robinson, chairman of American
Express, signaled "the start of a new era" for the company's
investment bank. American Express shoveled money into
Shearson and, in a major purge of people, bad loans and 1980s
excesses, Shearson wrote off $787 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That was supposed to be the last time that Shearson -- a
longtime drag on American Express stock -- would drain money
from its parent.
   But now, analysts say Shearson didn't root out all the
worms. It has almost $10 billion of real estate and other
investments that are causing concern. With real estate in
such a slump, some analysts speculate that Shearson
ultimately will have to write down the value of these assets
by hundreds of millions of dollars, and perhaps take more big
charges to revamp its businesses.
   Over time, suggests Neuberger &amp; Berman analyst Mark
Goldstein in a recent internal study for his firm's money
managers and salespeople, "it is conceivable" that Shearson's
doubtful loans could be written down by $300 million to $500
million; an additional $100 million to $200 million "might be
needed to exit or downsize various businesses." Mr.
Goldstein, who couldn't be reached, didn't forecast over how
many quarters the charge-offs might extend. But his study
suggests that to raise money to rebuild Shearson, American
Express might at some point sell 25 million of its own new
shares, which at today's prices would fetch more than $500
million and dilute current holders' stake 5%.
   For the fourth quarter just ending, several analysts agree
that Shearson might write off about $50 million. "I'm saying
to clients, the odds favor another big charge-off by Shearson
at year end," says E. Wilson Davis of Gerard Klauer Mattison
in New York. He thinks American Express might get away with
ordering only a $50 million year-end charge at Shearson; if
it delays, he speculates, the damage might be much bigger
next year.
   Recently, Mr. Davis downgraded his rating on American
Express stock from "buy" to "hold." The shares had been
rebounding from a 1990 low of 17 1/2 but now seem to have
stalled; they were at 20 5/8, down 3/4, yesterday.
   Shearson's "real" equity, excluding intangible items, is
about $600 million. American Express says its securities firm
"has done a fine job, given the tough environment, and will,
from its own operating income, continue to strengthen
reserves when and if called for." Asked whether American
Express might funnel more money into Shearson, a spokesman
said, "we don't speculate on our future financing plans." He
added, "we have a lot of respect for Neuberger but their
{write-off} numbers are a gross exaggeration and well beyond
anything that we consider to be reasonable."
   Though Mr. Robinson has done a good job of ordering cost
cuts at Shearson, "there has been a loss of respect for
management" at American Express because of Shearson's
troubles, analyst Davis says. "If we only had a Tom Murphy
running American Express, we'd have an $80 stock," New York
money manager Chris Browne of Tweedy Browne said last fall,
referring to Capital Cities/ABC's highly regarded chief.
   Now, Mr. Browne says, "we're not enthusiastic about the
prospect of more write-offs" at Shearson. Still, he has been
buying American Express stock in recent months at prices from
27 to 17, and says, "I wouldn't be buying if I didn't think
it could go up," whatever happens to Shearson.
   The new signs of trouble at Shearson come at a time when
American Express's highly prized charge-card business is
losing a little luster: Growth has slowed, competition is
mounting and losses are rising. However, American Express has
raised reserves for charge-card losses and says it is seeing
"a leveling of charge accounts that are moving into the
delinquent category."
   Meanwhile, Gerard Klauer's Mr. Davis expects Shearson's
1990 losses to cost American Express about $2 a share in
profit, leaving the parent with 1990 per-share earnings of
$2.24. Even without special charges, Shearson's operations
will probably lose $200 million for the year, he says, with
almost half of the loss falling in the fourth quarter, a
rough time for Wall Street firms.
   Shearson isn't the only investment firm with headaches.
Merrill Lynch could write off a $75 million loan in the
fourth quarter, says Salomon Brothers analyst Samuel Liss.
   Neuberger &amp; Berman lists some big assets of Shearson and
affiliates that are cause for "concern:" a $1 billion
portfolio of commercial real estate; more than $6 billion of
home equity loans; more than $800 million of merchant banking
investments, including a $500 million loan to shaky Prime
Computer; $600 million of junk bonds and a $158 million First
Capital Holdings stockholding, now valued in the market at
around $20 million.
   How come American Express didn't bite more of the bullet
earlier? A spokesman says, "The industry now is confronting a
significantly deteriorated environment."

   AUSTIN, Texas -- A pair of radio stations owned by the
family of former President Lyndon Baines Johnson have been
put on the block. But like many Texas properties, they aren't
worth as much as they used to be.
   Austin stations KLBJ-AM and KLBJ-FM have been valued at
$13.5 million by the Ted Hepburn Co., which has been retained
by the LBJ Co. to entertain offers for the properties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As recently as 1987, though, the family had received an
offer of $27.5 million from the Chase Group, a New York
investment company. Chase didn't meet the deadline for
closing the transaction, and the deal fell through.
   John Barr, executive vice president of LBJ Co. said the
stations were profitable. He attributed the apparent steep
decline in the station's value to "the lack of capital and
borrowing ability of investors across the country." He added,
"This isn't a distress sale," although the family would sell
if it got the right price. The Johnson family has owned the
stations for over 40 years.
   The LBJ Co. also has interests in communications, cable
television and real estate.

   TOKYO -- Toshiyuki Inamura, a member of Japan's House of
Representatives and a cabinet minister for the governing
Liberal Democratic Party until he resigned Wednesday, was
charged with evading taxes on stock profits.
   While the incident is yet another blow to the party's
credibility, it could help Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in a
way: The indictment will remind Japanese voters of an earlier
political stock scandal -- the notorious Recruit Co. affair
of two years ago. Mr. Kaifu is struggling against powerful
party faction leaders who want to give ministerial posts back
to Recruit-tainted politicians in a coming Cabinet shuffle.
Renewed public anger about scandals could provide the
ammunition Mr. Kaifu needs to appoint another slate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office alleges that the
55-year-old Mr. Inamura failed to pay taxes of 1.72 billion
yen, or $12.6 million, on profit of 2.88 billion yen, or
$21.1 million, earned in share transactions between 1986 and
1988.
   Mr. Inamura's physician, Akiyuki Yamaguchi, also was
charged with evading 827.9 million yen in taxes in 1986-87,
Chief Prosecutor Yusuke Yoshinaga said. The physician is
charged with channeling inside information to Mr. Inamura
from a third man who is being tried for allegedly
manipulating stock prices.
   Mr. Inamura was minister of state and director general of
the Environment Agency in 1986-87. If found guilty, he could
be fined as much as 3.2 billion yen in back tax and
penalties, officials said.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's finance minister has resigned,
saying the largest and richest Soviet republic has made no
progress in the transition to a market economy, the Russian
legislature's newspaper reported.
   Boris Fyodorov, 33 years old, was quoted as telling
Rossiiskaya Gazeta that lawmakers in the Russian republic
have been unwilling to take responsibility for necessary but
unpopular measures, such as lifting artificial price
controls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Fyodorov told the newspaper that important decisions,
such as forming private companies, setting up a stock market
and bringing Russian accounting practices in line with
international norms, "get bogged down in the depths of the
apparatus . . . for months on end."
   "This is a shortcut to financial bankruptcy for the
republic and for the {Soviet} Union as a whole," he said.
   On Nov. 1, the Russian Federation began a program to
switch from a centrally planned, command economy to a free
market within 500 days. Russian lawmakers said they wanted to
move faster than the national government, but critics contend
their policies often conflict and create confusion rather
than reform.

   BRUSSELS -- The Belgian health secretary announced
yesterday he has decided to ban the popular French painkiller
Glifanan, made by Laboratoires Roussel, the Belgian
subsidiary of French group Roussel-UCLAF, from the Belgian
market starting Dec. 31.
   The company announced earlier yesterday that it was
withdrawing the drug, which has been on the market for at
least 13 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A statement from Health Secretary Roger Delizee said other
analgesics Exidol, Glafenic and Nalfogan, which contain
Glafenine like Glifanban, were also banned.
   The statement said Glifanan had been investigated by
Belgian and European drug experts since 1977. It said all
drugs containing Glafenine had been on free sale until 1987,
when experts advised to use them under medical control.
   Although the European Community's drug committee did not
recommend immediate precautions, the statement said, Mr.
Delizee asked Belgian experts to pursue their investigation
in cooperation with the drug makers.
   The investigation was completed in July and led Delizee to
decide the ban on Glafenine.
   A spokesman for Mr. Delizee confirmed press reports that
two people had died from taking Glifanan without medical
advise. The Belgian radio said a hundred other people had
suffered severe secondary effects.
   In France, however, the health ministry did not plan to
ban Glifanan immediately, according to official sources.

   PRAGUE -- The first round of auctions to privatize small
shops and state-owned businesses is scheduled to begin next
month, the state CTK news agency said.
   The privatization is part of the government's program of
economic reforms and is designed to turn over to private
hands some 130,000 small shops and enterprises as the
nation's centralized economy is transformed into a
Western-style economy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first auctions are scheduled for the last weekend in
January in Prague.
   Thousands of vendors across the country staged symbolic
strikes in September demanding they be given first crack at
buying the shops and a chance to pay as much as half the
price in installments over a seven-year period.
   However, the law approved by parliament in October
excluded any provisions that would give preferential
treatment to any potential buyer.
   Auctions will be held in two rounds with the first one
only for Czechoslovak citizens and those who left the country
after 1948, when the Communists came to power.
   Shops and enterprises that aren't sold in the first round
will proceed to the second, in which some foreigners will
also be allowed to bid. CTK said it would take at least a
year to sell the shops and businesses.
   Privatization of large industrial plants and the
agricultural sector is expected to begin later in 1991.

   Wall Street Fire Exposes Weakness in SEC's Authority

   An electrical explosion shut down the New York Stock
Exchange for an hour and a half yesterday morning, prompting
the Securities and Exchange Commission to order a temporary
trading halt at all U.S. stock exchanges.
   But some brokerage firms and large institutions
sidestepped the SEC's efforts to halt all trading, bypassing
the exchanges and continuing to buy and sell stocks directly
with large clients.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The incident was a graphic demonstration of how stock
trading is increasingly moving beyond the control of federal
regulators and stock exchanges into less regulated markets.
"If I wanted to trade, I could trade; there was nothing
stopping me," said one institutional trader.
   Many brokers assailed what they deemed were mixed signals
from the SEC, which, while moving quickly to shut down
trading to protect small investors, was less forceful -- and
less successful -- in preventing trading by large
institutions that can trade off the exchanges through
brokerage firms or electronic networks.
   Following yesterday's confusion, the SEC launched a review
of its policy on off-exchange trading of listed stocks during
failures in the trade-reporting system. The review could lead
to a change in the agency's traditional view that all
domestic trading in listed stocks should halt when an
operational failure blocks the broad dissemination of price
and volume data.
   The trouble started shortly after midnight yesterday when
a transformer exploded in lower Manhattan in front of 55
Water Street, the building where the New York and American
stock exchanges' computer nerve center, the Securities
Industry Automation Corp., or SIAC, is located.
   SIAC processes stock prices quotations from all of the
nation's major exchanges and puts out a consolidated tape of
prices for all exchange-listed stocks. In November 1989, an
electrical fire closed down SIAC and the Big Board for nearly
2 1/2 hours. SIAC is building a backup computer facility in
New York that won't be completed for about a year.
   Yesterday's explosion blew out windows on some floors of
the building, and aroused fears of chemical contamination
from polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which are used in
electrical transformers.
   A Big Board spokesperson said none of the SIAC computers
was damaged, and SIAC had full power and was ready to operate
for the opening at 9:30 a.m. EST. But a PCB inspection by
city officials kept SIAC, and thus the exchanges, closed
until 11 a.m.
   That didn't stop Wall Street traders. Around 9:30 a.m.,
several securities firms -- among them Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette; Shearson Lehman Brothers and Montgomery Securities
-- began to notify clients they were ready to make markets.
Jefferies &amp; Co., a firm that specializes in off-exchange
stock trading, also said it was ready to handle client
orders.
   All of these firms bypassed stock exchanges to trade
directly with clients in what traders call the "third
market." Meanwhile, Reuters Holdings PLC's Instinet unit, an
electronic system that matches stock trades, also was active.
   The Midwest Stock Exchange in Chicago said it, too, was
prepared to open its market to trade Big Board stocks. Six
months ago, the Midwest quietly negotiated an agreement with
Quotron Systems Inc. to post its quotes so it could sidestep
the SIAC system during times of trouble.
   But the SEC called a trading halt at all U.S. stock
exchanges, including the Midwest. Traders at several
brokerage firms said they received calls from the SEC
indicating that the commission didn't want them to conduct
trading for clients while the exchanges remained closed. An
SEC spokeswoman said the commission "suggested" that
Jefferies refrain from trading. The SEC acted to restrain
third-market trading under its interpretation of its
responsibility to maintain orderly markets.
   Some traders were relieved. "Thank God the SEC did not
give the regional {exchanges} the opportunity to open," said
Charles B. Milligan, co-director of PaineWebber's stock
department. He worried that if the regional exchanges opened
with the Big Board closed, customers would question if they
had received the best price when buying or selling stocks.
Nevertheless, PaineWebber was prepared to trade on the
regional exchanges if the pricing appeared rational, he said.
   But the SEC's action angered the Midwest exchange. "We
were very disappointed," said Charles Doherty, the Midwest's
president. "We had a large numbers of customers that were
ready to trade at {9:30 a.m. EST}, and I assume they went to
the third market or London."
   He added: "I think the Commission may not have appreciated
the situation this morning."
   Meanwhile, Shearson and Donaldson Lufkin, after
discussions with the SEC, decided that existing securities
regulations prevented them from "crossing" trades -- or
matching customers' buy and sell orders -- in the U.S. while
exchanges were temporarily shut.
   But the firms concluded that they could trade with clients
directly by risking the firms' own money.
   Consequently, several thousand shares of stock traded
before the Big Board opened. For example, according to
trading records, about 40,000 shares of Toys "R" Us Inc.
traded in the third market at $22.50 each. More than 25,000
shares of General Electric Co., and more than 75,000 shares
of Chemical Waste Management Inc., traded in the third market
before the opening.
   While trading was halted on exchange-listed stocks, the
Nasdaq trading system, where traders buy and sell
over-the-counter stocks on electronic screens, was up and
running.
   Acknowledging the confusion, the SEC said it will review
yesterday's events in light of existing securities rules.
"Historically, we thought it was clear that trades didn't
occur in the U.S. when the markets were down," said Richard
Ketchum, director of the SEC's division of market regulation.
"We're going to review that to see whether it should be
changed."
   The goal of the review is to "make sure there's a clear
understanding whether or not one can do institutional trades
in the U.S." when the market-information system is down, Mr.
Ketchum said.
   "Our main desire is that next time to make sure that the
rules of the road are absolutely clear."
   The keystone of U.S. securities law is the requirement
that information be equally available to all market
participants. Normally, third-market firms funnel information
on their trades into SIAC, where it joins a stream of price
and volume information from trades on the exchanges to give a
full picture of market activity for each exchange-listed
stock. With SIAC down, the SEC feared it would be impossible
to collect accurate market data.
   But third-market firms deal only with large institutional
clients -- those deemed to be sophisticated enough to take
the risk of trading on incomplete market information. "None
of the firms wanted to do retail trading" with small
investors, Mr. Ketchum said.
   Big Board President Richard Grasso said it appears that
brokerage firms were operating within securities laws when
they traded off the exchange yesterday. But "without the
primary market," he said, there wasn't competitive pricing of
stocks. "So the customer is really in a {buyer beware}
situation."
   The SEC's Mr. Ketchum said, "Everybody operated in good
faith in a time when there was confusion. Some of the firms
operated initially on the thought that they would try to
provide a marketplace for their institutional customers. We
had no problem with that."
   The outcome of the SEC's review is far from clear, because
yesterday's difficulties raised several fundamental questions
about how modern markets should function. The issues include:
   -- Is it fair to allow institutions to trade when smaller
customers can't? "That's clearly the real concern," Mr.
Ketchum said. "The U.S. market is built on the principle that
a marketplace should be available to everyone."
   -- Should pension funds, insurance companies, banks and
other institutional customers be barred from trading if they
determine they have adequate information?
   -- In an era of global financial markets, does it make
sense to bar firms from making markets in the U.S. when
trading in U.S. listed stocks can continue in London? "There
was no rule impacting their ability to trade in London
without being able to report trades," Mr. Ketchum conceded.
   -- Since third-market trading continues every day after
the exchanges close and SIAC shuts down, why bar such trading
when SIAC doesn't open in the first place?
   Given these questions, "I think there will be debate on
whether or not that was an appropriate interpretation" by the
SEC, said John Wall, executive vice president of the National
Association of Securities Dealers. "It's a question that's
going to be discussed, and I think it's very right that it be
discussed."

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Texaco Canada Petroleum Inc. said it

million Canadian dollars (US$86.2 million).
   Texaco Canada, 78%-owned by Texaco Inc., White Plains,

Esso Resources Canada Ltd. unit is subject to various
conditions and approvals.

   Texaco Canada and Mission Energy Co., a unit of SCEcorp of
Rosemead, Calif., plan to form a joint venture to acquire and
operate the properties, which contain an estimated 300
billion cubic feet of proven or probable natural gas
reserves, and six million barrels of oil or gas liquids,
Texaco Canada said.
   Texaco Canada said the proposed purchase would increase
its share of daily natural gas production by about 20 million
cubic feet and its oil and gas liquids production by 450
barrels. The company currently produces about 7.5 million
cubic feet of gas a day and 1,000 barrels of oil or gas
liquids a day.
   Separately, Texaco Canada said it agreed to acquire for
C$6 million Esso Resources' oil and natural gas rights at 21
exploration properties, covering about 73,000 acres of
undeveloped land, along with an option to drill four
additional prospects and earn rights to a further 18,800 net
acres. All of the exploration properties are in British
Columbia, Texaco Canada said.
   Texaco Canada Petroleum was formed in September 1988 to
hold selected exploration assets that weren't included in the
$4.15 billion sale of Texaco's interest in Texaco Canada Inc.
to Imperial Oil. That transaction received final regulatory
approval in February.
   Imperial Oil is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., New York.

   STOCKHOLM -- The restructuring of Sweden's defense
industry continues, with an announcement that Nobel
Industrier Sverige AB and Foerenade Fabriksverken, the
state-owned arms maker known as FFV, agreed to pool most of
their defense-related operations under a new jointly owned
company.
   The new company, to be called Swedish Ordnance-FFV/Bofors
AB, will begin operations Tuesday with 6,000 employees and
estimated annual sales of five billion Swedish kronor ($873
million). Nobel's AB Bofors unit has long been Sweden's
biggest defense contractor. Swedish Ordnance will control
virtually all arms output except the manufacture of military
aircraft and engines by Saab-Scania AB and AB Volvo.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Nobel-FFV accord reflects swift consolidation among
Swedish defense contractors in recent years. Sweden's
military has cut back spending, and international competition
has intensified on the limited number of export markets open
to defense contractors under Sweden's tight arms export
controls.
   During the past 18 months, Nobel has acquired the defense
electronics operations of the Swedish unit of N.V. Philips
and formed a military electronics venture with Telefon AB
L.M. Ericsson. Last month, FFV and Volvo's aircraft engine
unit combined their military aircraft maintenance operations
under a company 51% controlled by Volvo.
   FFV and Bofors have been talking for months about merging
their operations.
   Anders Carlberg, Nobel's chief executive, cited missile
production -- where Bofors competes head on with
Saab-Scaniaas virtually the only remaining defense sector
where costly duplication could be eliminated.
   The Nobel chief said that no talks are under way with
Saab-Scania or are likely to begin soon.

   Often, when I return from a sporting event, I'm asked if
it was a "good" one. Sometimes, I'm stumped for an answer.
   I have no problem answering when all the contestants in
the match in question played truly and well. Ditto when they
stunk up the joint. But I and, I'm sure, others, have
difficulty evaluating the more-common situations in which one
player or team performs much better than its opponent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The point seems apt when reviewing sports-year 1990. All
three of our major professional team sports ended their
seasons with one-sided championship playoffs, and even the
NCAA basketball tournament, which usually produces a
cliff-hanging finish, followed suit. Did that make 1990 a
bust, competitionwise?
   Not if you are of the half-full persuasion, and chose to
concentrate on the winning side. It's hard to recall a better
football game than that played by the San Francisco 49ers in
trouncing the Denver Broncos, 55-10, in Super Bowl last. The
same goes for the court-singeing, 30-point win over Duke that
the Nevada-Las Vegas Rebels posted in the college hoops
final.
   The Cincinnati Reds surprised everyone, including
themselves, in besting the Oakland Athletics in every facet
of their baseball World Series sweep, and the Detroit Pistons
played their bump-and-grind style of basketball to near
perfection in taking four of five games from the Portland
Trail Blazers for the NBA crown. Certainly, no one in Cincy
or Motown was heard to complain about the brusqueness of
those triumphs.
   To me, though, the best of the year's one-sided victories
-- and one of the two best events I witnessed in 1990 -- was
posted by Pete Sampras in the U.S. Open tennis tournament.
That the 19-year-old won the tourney at all was remarkable,
because he'd never accomplished anything nearly so grand.
What made his performance stand out were the men he defeated
and the way he defeated them.
   His last four matches in the big bowl in Flushing Meadow
were against Thomas Muster, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and
Andre Agassi, who must rank in anyone's Top 10. Young Sampras
didn't just beat them, he blew 'em away with a serve that had
observers straining for historical comparisons. And all the
while, after bad points as well as good, he displayed in his
quizzical half-smile a sweetness of temper that seemed to
have disappeared from the men's game with long pants.
   The Sampras service bears special mention; as everyone who
plays tennis knows, serving well looks much easier than it
is. One might think that height and strength are the key
ingredients, but they aren't -- timing and rhythm are.
   The best server of the 1980s was McEnroe, who stands but
5-foot-11 and is unprepossessing of physique. Sampras is
gangly, so he looks a good bit taller than Mad Mac, but he
outmeasures him by just an inch. And while Mac's service
succeeded mostly because of spin and guile, Sampras whacks
the ball country-style, at 120 or so mph on your radar gun.
But that's just as difficult in its way.
   Ask Sampras how he is able to serve so superlatively, and
he'll tell you he practices long and hard. This, no doubt, is
true, but so do other players with greater apparent physical
gifts. A touch of genius also was involved, as was a
mysterious chemistry of time and place that isn't easily
replicable. He cannot depend on working such magic every time
he steps on court.
   At the Open, though, all parts of Sampras's game were "go"
(he's not a one-dimensional blaster like Roscoe Tanner or
Kevin Curren), and his serve was his coup de grace. He
notched 24 aces in a five-set quarter-final win over Lendl,
and 17 in a four-set semi against McEnroe.
   In the final against Agassi, whose specialty is return of
serve, Sampras struck 13 aces plus numerous others that his
foe barely reached. He surrendered just 17 points in his 13
service games, all of which he won. The set scores were 6-4,
6-3 and 6-2, and the match lasted only about 1 1/2 hours. No
one, however, was heard to ask for a refund.
   My other highlight of the dying year was an
altogether-different sort of contest: Julio Cesar Chavez's
last-round technical knockout of Meldrick Taylor in their
March 17 championship prizefight in Las Vegas. It was a
"good" fight in the classic mold -- fast-paced and
competitive -- and a half-minute before its conclusion it
appeared as though Taylor would be declared the winner on
points. But late in round 12, Chavez floored Taylor with a
straight right, and while Taylor arose before the count of 10
he was waved out by referee Richard Steele. Behind Taylor's
head blinked a ring-post light signaling that the bout was in
its final seconds. Two more seconds and it would have ended.
   I find I have to apologize for liking boxing, sometimes to
myself. It's the sport that needs the most regulation but
gets the least, and the machinations of some of the people
who run it border on the criminal. It is saved by its
participants, who are among the most skillful, best
conditioned and most courageous of men.
   Those adjectives applied equally to champion Chavez and
challenger Taylor that March night. Chavez is an athlete
whose totality exceeds the sum of his parts. Smooth-faced and
boyish, he doesn't look the part of a fighter, and his
celebrity has been hindered by his Mexican nationality and
membership in the off-brand junior welterweight (140-pound)
division. In the ring, though, he's a nightmare foe:
Relentless, indefatigable and hard to hurt. He was unbeaten
in 68 bouts.
   Taylor, from Philadelphia, also was unbeaten, but in 25
goes. He was thicker in the chest and arms than Chavez, and
quicker afoot, too. He used his speed to stay away from
Chavez until he chose to close and flurry, which he did
effectively through round 11.
   If Taylor had chosen to run in the last round, he would
have won on two of the three judges' scorecards. Instead, he
stood and fought, and was staggered by one flush right and
decked by another. But in losing the way he did, he lifted
the fight above the ordinary. One athlete or team, playing
extraordinarily well, can produce a "good" event, even a
memorable one. But it takes two to make one great.

   Two addenda to your excellent Dec. 12 editorial, "GATT
Riddance," recommending unilateral free trade:
   1. While 19th-century Britain is an excellent test of
unilateral free trade, it is not "the best," since critics
maintain that Britain's superpower status at the time enabled
it to impose its policy on other countries. Modern-day Hong
Kong is a better test -- a small island and peninsula with
few resources and no independent political power, yet
unilateral free trade enabled it to achieve an even higher
rate of growth in per-capita real income than its fellow
little Tigers, Singapore and Taiwan, despite more rapid
growth in population.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   2. The most effective succinct argument for free trade I
know was penned by Henry George, famous for his single tax,
more than a century ago: "Free trade consists simply in
letting people buy and sell as they want to buy and sell. It
is protection that requires force, for it consists in
preventing people from doing what they want to do. Protective
tariffs are as much applications of force as are blockading
squadrons, and their objective is the same -- to prevent
trade. The difference between the two is that blockading
squadrons are a means whereby nations seek to prevent their
enemies from trading; protective tariffs are a means whereby
nations attempt to prevent their own people from trading.
What protection teaches us is to do to ourselves in time of
peace what enemies seek to do to us in time of war." From
Henry George, "Protection or Free Trade" (1886; reprint ed.,
New York: Robert Schalkenbach Foundation, 1980), p. 47.

   Wave of Soviet Immigrants
   Swamping Israel's Economy

   TEL AVIV -- Cardiologist Eduard Zaslavsky and his wife,
Polina, an economist, were forced to stop buying food just
five weeks after moving from Kiev. Yet the two professionals,
whose public assistance had run out after paying the bills,
were too ashamed to join the growing number of new Soviet
immigrants who can be seen these days foraging for something
to eat amid garbage heaps at open markets in Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv.
   When the Zaslavsky's plight was broadcast on national
television, Israelis recoiled. Calls poured in to help the
Soviet couple. Relief came speedily in the form of jobs as
janitors to supplement their immigrant stipend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Zaslavsky story brought home to Israelis some painful
economic truths about Soviet immigration. It stripped away
any illusions that Israel, with its population of 4.7
million, can smoothly absorb -- or even pay for -- the one
million Soviet Jews who are expected to arrive over the next
few years.
   The sheer volume of people fleeing the Soviet Union far
exceeds expectations and planning. Just yesterday Israeli
officials said the pace of Soviet immigration had picked up
to 2,000 people a day. It had been considered heavy at the
previous level of about 1,000 a day. Next year, 400,000 more
Soviets are expected, according to the Jewish Agency, a
quasi-governmental organization that assists immigration.
Israeli officials have attributed the surge to increasing
uncertainty about the political climate in the Soviet Union
and better Israeli-sponsored transportation arrangements.
   The cost of transforming the have-not immigrant population
into productive Israelis is staggering. Finance Minister
Yitzhak Moda'i has estimated it will take $40 billion --
roughly equivalent to one year's budget -- to provide the
housing, language training, jobs and other services needed to
absorb the new arrivals.
   "It is like the U.S. trying to absorb the whole population
of France in two or three years," says Michael Kleiner,
chairman of the Immigration and Absorption Committee of the
Knesset, Israel's parliament. "The Soviet immigration is the
greatest thing that could happen to Israel, but in terms of
sacrifice, it also has the potential to destroy us and tear
society apart."
   Economists agree that immigration has long-term potential
to spur Israel's stagnant economy, partly with the influx of
Soviet professionals and scientists. But the short-term
forecasts are grim.
   An unpublished Finance Ministry report on immigration
predicts there will be no available housing by March. By
spring, the number of homeless could total 140,000. This
means that even the temporary housing supply, including
mobile homes, hostels and hotels, will soon dry up. The
report also warns that if jobs aren't created quickly, the
current 10.2% unemployment rate could double by 1992.
   Natan Sharansky, president of the Soviet Jewry Zionist
Forum, is a vocal critic of the right-wing government for its
failure to make provisions to avert a potential economic and
social disaster. Israel's budget for 1990 to 1991 was built
on the assumption that 40,000 Soviet Jews would arrive this
year, a fourth of the actual number. Next year's budget is
based on the expected arrival of 300,000 Soviets. But twice
that number could arrive.
   Critics say the most glaring sign of government
foot-dragging is its reaction to housing needs. This year,
less than half of the planned 40,000 construction starts were
initiated. There is growing resignation that next year tent
cities will spring up to accommodate immigrants.
   When the government announced a cost-cutting plan to slash
by $1,500 the $9,000 one-year package of subsidies new
immigrant families receive, Mr. Sharansky warned of an
"impending catastrophe." Some argue that Mr. Sharansky
overstated the case with his prediction that social tensions
could explode in a "civil war" in Israel. Last summer, 2,000
Israeli families were left homeless by high housing costs,
boosted by the surge in immigration. Memories are still fresh
of the violent demonstrations that took place then.
   Meanwhile, Israelis are being called on to dig more deeply
into their pockets to foot the immigration bill. Bank
Hapaolim Chairman Eitan Berglas estimates that "the standard
of living will be frozen at current levels in Israel for five
years." Others forecast a sharp decline.
   Next year's proposed $33.23 billion budget includes a 5%
surcharge on already steep income taxes, and a
two-percentage-point rise in value-added tax. Israel's
massive defense budget also faces cuts; for the first time,
it will be less than expenditures for immigration. This will
only provide a fraction of necessary financing.
   "There is no reasonable way for us to collect the money we
need," says Mr. Kleiner. He notes that the combined revenues
from proposed tax increases, contributions by world Jewish
organizations and a U.S. commitment for a $400 million
guaranteed loan for housing adds up to only 4% of the total
needed.
   Mr. Berglas says the government's initial hope to raise
half the $40 billion abroad through Israeli banks is
unrealistic. In light of the Gulf situation, the Palestinian
uprising and a world-wide credit crunch, "We thought it was
necessary to say don't rely on us, it's impossible," he says.
   One possible source of financing, he suggests, could be an
accelerated privatization of state-owned utilities, airlines,
commercial banks and other activities. It's estimated that as
much as $8 billion could be raised this way.
   But for Mr. Berglas, the bigger economic picture isn't
entirely bleak. In 1991 he forecasts a doubling of the
economic growth rate to between 8% and 10%. Mr. Berglas is
enthusiastic about the immigrants. More than half the Soviet
newcomers have academic, technical, medical or scientific
training. So far, only a small portion of professionals have
found work in their field.
   "These kinds of people provide extraordinary potential for
economic development," Mr. Berglas says.

   Executive Directors
   Of IMF, World Bank
   Disburse Billions

   WASHINGTON -- Everybody has a boss, but who is Jacques de
Groote's?
   Technically, he has none. As an executive director of both
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which pay
his salary, he is meant to be an independent official who can
vote as he chooses on approving aid and helping countries
adopt sound monetary policies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But since he is elected by six nations to look after their
interests, he must pay attention to their needs if he wants
to be re-elected every two years. Those countries are
Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg, Turkey, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia -- but not Zaire. It has its own executive
directors.
   Mr. de Groote says he also reports to officials at the
National Bank of Belgium, which sent him to Washington in
1973, and at the Belgian finance ministry. Alfons Verplaetse,
the Belgian National Bank governor, is satisfied that Mr. de
Groote has kept him posted on matters essential to Belgium's
interests in Zaire. But some others say they have been either
unaware of or uneasy with his Zairean actions. A former
national bank official who dealt directly with Mr. de Groote
recalls warning him that "Zaire is not your business" and
urging him to be prudent. And in the early 1980s, according
to a former finance ministry official, Mr. de Groote told
Belgian Finance Minister Willy de Clercq he had stopped
advising Zaire.
   Mr. de Groote, who plans to leave his posts in 1992, is
the senior member of the World Bank board and second-ranking
in seniority on the IMF board. He helps direct the affairs of
the multibillion-dollar, taxpayer-financed institutions. This
includes approving large loans, most of them to poorer
nations; the World Bank alone has lent more than $160 billion
since its founding in the 1940s.
   Both the World Bank and the IMF have 22 directors, most
elected by groups of countries. For seven nations -- the
U.S., Germany, Japan, England, France, China and Saudi Arabia
-- directors are appointed by their governments and report
only to them. U.S. executive directors are appointed by the
president, are subject to Senate confirmation and report to
the Treasury Department.
   Executive directors, whose board meetings are private,
work in a pampered environment. They benefit from first-class
air flights, luxury hotels, six-figure tax-free salaries,
salary supplements for non-working wives and other perks.
Unlike staffers, who are explicitly barred from leaking
information or using their positions for personal gain,
directors aren't subject to written restrictions. This
"doesn't mean it is a totally lawless situation," says a
senior World Bank lawyer. "If something egregious happens, I
think the board has the general power to control what
executive directors do," though there haven't been any test
cases.

   Elena's Bonner's Warning to the West

   NEWTON, Mass. -- Elena Bonner, visitor from a dissolving
empire, sits in a pink-walled living room citing lines from a
pamphlet entitled "KONSTITUTIA." But this constitution is not
one of many drafts circulating in Moscow's winter democracy
debate. It is not one of the programs advanced by, say, the
independence movement of a Baltic state. It is the 1978
constitution, a relic from the reign of Leonid Brezhnev.
   That the Soviet Union's most venerable dissident should
choose to quote lines from her great oppressor is
significant. Ms. Bonner is not glorifying the regime that
stashed her away with her late husband, Andrei Sakharov, for
years of KGB-isolation in the town of Gorky. She is recalling
Brezhnev to make a point: that the Soviet Union's current
leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, is actually moving away from
democracy and removing what vestiges of law do exist from the
Soviet Union.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To many Western observers, last week's resignation of
Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze seemed a shock --
and one that foreshadowed political and military crackdown.
To Ms. Bonner, the resignation was no surprise. "In the
Soviet Union," she says, "the coup has already happened."
   A visit with with the 68-year-old Ms. Bonner in her
daughter's suburban house is a lesson in how backward
Washington's Soviet policy seems from Moscow. This past month
President Bush has released at least $1 billion in
agriculture credits in the name of aiding a hungry and
reforming Soviet Union. Such bounty, Ms. Bonner says, "may
improve the situation of a very few people for a very short
period. But it will not improve the program for long-term
change -- at all." That the Soviet leader assigned the KGB to
distribute the emergency food is proof of that.
   What's worse, says Ms. Bonner, is that the West seems
willing to overlook Mr. Gorbachev's power-mongering in the
hope that he will use that new power to end food lines and
domestic chaos. What America is really doing though, she
thinks, is reinforcing "Gorbachev's transition to
dictatorship." Ms. Bonner trained as a medical doctor, and
she doesn't want to promote suffering. Perhaps though, she
says, the world would do better to send food this winter to
starving Africa -- "in my country, there isn't enough food
because the leadership doesn't want political reform."
   With her daughter Tatiana interpreting and a photo of her
late husband framed at her right elbow, the bespectacled Ms.
Bonner undertakes a careful review of Mr. Gorbachev's
half-decade-long abuse of the law. Years ago, he widened his
own powers as president without a popular vote -- an abuse
which the West has honored, ironically, by referring to him
as "President Gorbachev." She points with hand and cigarette
to Article 72 of the Brezhnev constitution, which reads:
"Every union republic retains the right of free secession
from the Soviet Union." That bit of law was ignored last
spring, when Mr. Gorbachev refused Lithuania independence.
(It may be, Ms. Bonner adds mischievously, that President
Bush didn't protest because he didn't know about this part of
the constitution). Now, Mr. Gorbachev has broadened his
powers again so that he controls all slots in his cabinet.
   Ms. Bonner is taking this time off from a holiday trip
because she thinks America's citizens just don't understand
how wrong their president is. The comparison may be rough,
she says, but Mr. Gorbachev is like another leader who first
sided with democrats, then crowned himself emperor Napoleon.
He has changed the Soviet constitution so often, she says,
that "his name should be in the Guinness Book of World
Records."
   Ms. Bonner isn't really being fair to Mr. Gorbachev on
this last point -- Soviet leaders from Lenin to Chernenko had
already fiddled their constitution some 100 times before Mr.
Gorbachev got to it. Indeed, that she, the widow of Andrei
Sakharov, should be so vehement in an attack on Mikhail
Gorbachev may at first glance seem odd. When he came to
power, Mr. Gorbachev did much to improve the lot of political
dissidents -- people who, like the Sakharovs, suffered KGB
hounding, force feeding and persecution that lasted years on
end. In the Sakharovs' case, Mr. Gorbachev actually
telephoned the couple personally to announce the end of their
Gorky exile. (The publicity-minded leader had a phone
installed especially for the event). Mr. Gorbachev has also
moved forward on another major Sakharov goal-free emigration.
   But there is consistency to Ms. Bonner's work. In the
1960s, 1970s and 1980s, she and
nuclear-physicist-turned-rebel tried to hold their regime
accountable to its own laws -- however pointless this seemed.
Sakharov died a year ago, and now she is doing the same thing
-- alone. Mr. Gorbachev, she points out, may have made
concessions on human rights, but he has not given such rights
any basis in law.
   What should the West do next? Not, says Ms. Bonner, fear
that Mr. Shevardnadze's departure means the Soviet Union will
stop supporting the U.S. on Iraq. "Until he gets all the aid
he wants, Gorbachev will keep the same line and save face."
Worry instead, she advises, about the civil strife --
including violent military strife -- as Soviet republics
fight for freedom. Ms. Bonner herself thinks general strikes
may be the best way to spur change.
   To fight for that change, this longtime emigration-rights
campaigner will herself return home to her Chkalova Street
apartment in Moscow. On her husband's birthday in May, she
plans a congress on the future of the Soviet Union. She is
concerned about the Soviet Union's future -- but does she
think Mr. Gorbachev and his regime will take back East
Europe?
   "Ha]" says Elena Bonner in a lively moment and laughs.
"No." He and the military are too corrupt and too weak for
that. As for the republics at home, she thinks reversal isn't
really possible there either. "No," she says again, shaking
her gray ponytail. "Things have gone too far."
