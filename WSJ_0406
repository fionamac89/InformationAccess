   Banking Firms in Southwest Continued
   Their Modest Recovery in First Quarter

   Southwestern banks continued their modest recovery in the
first quarter, bolstered as much as anything by the fact that
they aren't Northeastern banks.
   "You've got shifting fortunes between those two areas,"
said James McDermott Jr., an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods Inc. "In the Southwestern areas there is a sense of
stability and gradual improvement in operating conditions,
whereas in the Northeast there continues to be
deterioration."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, compared with some New England banks, which have
taken massive charges against shaky real-estate loans in
recent months, Southwestern banks are beginning to look
almost solid.
   First City Bancorp of Texas, a Houston bank holding
company recapitalized with nearly $1 billion in federal
assistance two years ago, said it expects to report its
seventh consecutive quarterly increase in net income. A
spokesman said the company plans to report that first-quarter
net was $3.70 a share, fully diluted -- including an
as-yet-unspecified gain from the sale of its credit-card
subsidiary -- up from net of $1 a share in the year-earlier
period. The spokesman said the results reflect the company's
decision to "take some additional reserves to build back our
balance sheet," and are in line with its plan for the year.
   While such results mostly reflect the clean balance sheet
First City received in the recapitalization, they also
suggest improvements in the Texas economy. Frank Cihak, First
City vice chairman, took a call recently from an East Coast
stock analyst who inquired whether the bank had any
real-estate loans in the Northeast. Mr. Cihak replied that
the bank's real-estate loans are concentrated in Texas.
"That's great," the analyst replied, according to a First
City spokesman.
   Don Powell, chief executive of First Amarillo Bancorp,
Amarillo, Texas, agrees that "the economic engine we need in
Texas is beginning to move, but it's slow." Citing a decrease
in nonperforming loans and slightly better interest margins,
Mr. Powell said he expects first-quarter operating profit to
be about "a half million bucks," or 17.5 cents a share, up
sharply from the year-earlier operating profit of $84,782, or
three cents a share. "I believe we've most definitely
stabilized," he said.
   Terry Kelley, president of Fort Worth, Texas-based Team
Bank, said improvements in the residential real-estate market
and energy-related industries have fueled loan demand. "We're
beginning to see some loan growth across the state," said Mr.
Kelley, whose bank was created, with nearly $1 billion of
federal help, primarily from the failed banks of Texas
American Bancshares Inc., Fort Worth. "There's more cautious
optimism in the energy industry than there's been in the last
several years," he added.
   In New Mexico, meanwhile, "real estate is relatively soft,
but it isn't in the tank," said Carl Guist, chief financial
officer of United New Mexico Financial Corp. Although "we
don't see a lot of booming expansion here this year," Mr.
Guist said, he expects first-quarter earnings to be "slightly
better" than the $1.3 million, or 30 cents a share, reported
in the year-ago period.
   Even in Arizona, which has been ravaged in recent months
by a real-estate collapse, some analysts see light at the end
of the tunnel. Thomas Brown, an analyst with PaineWebber
Inc., expects Valley National Corp. to report a first-quarter
profit, after three consecutive quarters of heavy losses
linked primarily to the Phoenix bank holding company's
real-estate loans. Mr. Brown said he expects nonperforming
loan growth to flatten out at the company. "I think we'll
look back on {the fourth and first quarters} as an important
turning point."
   However, not all analysts are as sanguine about Valley's
prospects for the quarter. Robert Rieke, an analyst with
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., Dallas, is predicting a loss of
22 cents a share in the period, against net of 96 cents a
year earlier. Valley National declined to comment.
   Colorado banks also are expected to report a few bumps
along the road to recovery. "The first quarter isn't
necessarily going to be a barn-burner from our viewpoint,"
said James L. Basey, executive vice president of Colorado
National Bankshares Inc., Denver.
   Boettcher &amp; Co., Denver, said it lowered its first-quarter
and 1990 estimates for Colorado National by 20 cents a share
"to reflect the negative effects of a large credit which will
likely show up as a new non-performing asset." Mr. Basey
wouldn't comment specifically on the first quarter, but
acknowledged: "We're still somewhat choked on a high level of
real-estate problems," particularly in the Colorado Springs
area.
   Perhaps the biggest bump for the quarter came from
Hibernia Corp., whose 64-quarter streak of profit increases
ended after regulators examined the bank's real-estate loans.
The New Orleans bank holding company, which had seemingly
weathered the region's economic downturn in better shape than
any of its competitors, said it doubled its loan-loss reserve
to $110 million, resulting in an expected first-quarter net
loss of $25 million, or about 90 cents a share.
   Hibernia also said it is adding $64 million in loans to
nonperforming status -- half at regulators' request and half
to reflect "uncertainty in the economy and uncertainty about
what examiners may require banks to do in the future."

   PARIS -- Cerus SA, a holding company headed by Italian
financier Carlo De Benedetti, declined to comment on a news
report that it is near a sale of its 15.4% stake in Societe
Generale de Belgique S.A.
   In the past, Cerus has sometimes scoffed at such reports.
Meanwhile, a financial executive familiar with the situation
suggested Mr. De Benedetti might be willing to take a loss on
the sale of the shares under certain circumstances.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The report, in the Belgian daily Echo de la Bourse,
suggested Cerus might sell the shares in three blocks,
perhaps to Japanese and German buyers.
   Cerus bought the shares during a failed 1988 battle to win
control of SGB, a sprawling holding company for Belgian
industrial and financial interests. The battle ended with
Cie. Financiere de Suez of France gaining 51% of SGB. Since
then, Cerus has said it was interested in selling its stake
eventually. It has assumed, however, that Cerus would be very
hesitant to sell for less than the average of about 3,500
Belgian francs ($99) a share that it paid in 1988.
   On the Brussels Bourse yesterday, SGB closed at 3,320
Belgian francs a share, down 20. At the latest closing price,
Cerus's stake is valued at the equivalent of about $935
million.

   High-Tech Firms Are Trying to Curb
   Reliance on Ozone-Eating Chemicals

   Under pressure from the pending clean-air bill and the
public, the U.S. high-technology industry is trying to kick
its reliance on ozone-eating chemicals.
   Fearing a federal ban on the use of these chemicals in
manufacturing, many of the nation's largest high-technology
concerns are scrambling for substitutes. International
Business Machines Corp., the world's largest electronics
manufacturer, pledges to eliminate the chemicals, known as
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the end of 1993. Most other
large electronics manufacturers have less ambitious plans,
but only a few have refused to join the war on CFCs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For high-technology companies, kicking the CFC habit isn't
easy. The most popular type of CFC, 113, turns up in more
than 100 different high-tech manufacturing processes, from
cleaning freshly soldered circuit boards to etching a chip
design into a silicon wafer.
   "With all these different uses, finding one magic snake
oil to replace them is very difficult," said David Chittick,
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s vice president for
engineering and safety. Mr. Chittick, who also heads a new
industry cooperative attempting to spur cuts in CFC use, said
technical difficulties "have made a number of companies
reluctant to pledge to completely eliminate CFCs from the
manufacturing operations."
   Progress is being made. Since the start of 1988, IBM has
cut CFC emissions by 31%. AT&amp;T is cutting its use by making
some of its circuit boards with a process that doesn't
require the removal of excess solder; for some other
processes it is switching to a cleanser derived from citrus
rinds.
   And Digital Equipment Corp., one of the biggest computer
makers, has devised a way to clean the most advanced type of
circuit boards, using so-called surface-mount technology,
with a water solution that eliminates the need for CFCs.
Digital had said it will offer for free to other high-tech
manufacturers directions on how to use and make the new
solvent.
   CFCs, which also are used in Styrofoam containers,
automobile air conditioners and refrigerators, are blamed for
depleting the earth's atmospheric ozone layer. Scientists
believe "holes" in the ozone, created by CFCs, increase the
possibility of skin cancer by letting in more ultraviolet
radiation.
   The industry's decision to rely more heavily in the 1980s
on the ozone-eating chemical is harshly criticized by some
observers.
   Defenders of the electronics industry concede that it
should have moved more swiftly to curb CFC use. "Should we
have done something {to cut back} sooner? In hindsight, we
should have," said Cheryl Russell, a lobbyist for the
American Electronics Association, an influential trade group
that advocates a 50% cut in CFC emissions by 1993.
   But Ms. Russell said the industry had good reasons for
embracing one type of CFC, 113, even after the alarm bells
began to sound. An effective cleanser, CFC-113 was popular
with electronics manufacturers because it posed fewer, if
any, hazards to workers than traditional solvents and was
easily handled and stored, she said.
   As a result, CFC-113 won out in a push to rid the industry
of other, patently hazardous chemicals, including
cancer-causing agents.
   Even now, many companies are slow to move forward with CFC
substitutes because of uncertainties about their
effectiveness. "We recognize CFCs must go, but we want a
long-term fix. We don't want to try {a substitute} out and
find it doesn't work," said Cliff Bast, who heads a CFC task
force at Hewlett-Packard Co., which manufactures medical
instruments, computers and related products. Through various
conservation measures, H-P did cut its use of CFCs by 8% in
the fourth quarter of last year.
   Other electronics manufacturers say they haven't yet
identified substitutes for some processes. "We haven't found
any acceptable substitute for critical cleaning needs," said
a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a semiconductor
maker.
   But given the prevailing political winds, the high-tech
industry won't have CFCs around for long. In January, the
federal government placed a hefty tax on new purchases and
existing inventories of CFCs. And on Tuesday, the Senate
passed a comprehensive clean-air bill that, among things,
calls for a phase-out of CFCs. The House may pass an even
tougher provision restricting CFCs.

   Another Economic Development Bank
   Is Forming in Europe, but Is It Needed?

   LONDON -- Europe's Berd is going to fly.
   The so-called Banque Europeene pour la Reconstruction et
Developpement, or Berd, is back on the launch pad, planners
say -- although this comes amid nagging questions over the
need for yet another international financial institution.
According to a negotiator for the European Community, there's
a solid consensus on 54 of 58 articles of confederation. The
remaining differences, he said, can be settled or at least
smoothed over at a Paris meeting Sunday and Monday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As the West's principal vehicle for transfusing the
ravaged East bloc economies, the new bank will begin with
about $12 billion to lend to companies and selected public
works. Planners stress that the Berd's loans will come
wrapped in lots of advice about how to set up a
private-enterprise economy and help it flourish.
   So far, though, the East Europeans mainly have been given
a lesson in how Western aid gets filtered through a mesh of
egos and jostling political interests.
   The French uncorked the idea of a new reconstruction bank
in November at a summit in Strasbourg. Britain was initially
cool to it, but came around in time to churn out a glossy,
trilingual brochure explaining that "from opera to
athletics," London is the logical home for the bank.
Meanwhile, other would-be hosts were elbowing in: Serious
contenders include Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen, and Vienna,
as well as Prague and Budapest from the East bloc.
   Within this competitive caldron, compromises bubble up
almost daily. One talked-of bargain has London hosting the
bank, but accepting as its President Jacques Attali, aide to
French president Francois Mitterrand. Another scenario floats
the Berd back to the continent, but places Onno Ruding, the
former Dutch finance minister and a strong British ally, in
the top job. (This scenario collapses if Algemene Bank
Nederland NV and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV merge and ask
Mr. Ruding to run the combined bank.)
   Even the working labels seem to flow from Pan-European
compromises: the acronym, Berd, comes from the bank's French
name, while the official title is the Anglicized European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
   Lost in the debates over name and place is the fundamental
question of why the Berd should exist. "It's another of
Mitterrand's monuments," says one London economist who
insists on staying anonymous. "It's the
multiplication-of-entities principle."
   The World Bank and its affiliated International Finance
Corp. are already doing the sort of financing jobs that the
Berd would take on. Then there's the European Investment Bank
and the International Monetary Fund. Not to be outdone, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has set
up a new office to advise East bloc economic reformers.
   Sir William Ryrie, head of International Finance, said in
a recent interview that he worries about his organization and
the Berd both pursuing the same projects. If the Berd's terms
are more generous, he warns, International Finance could see
clients drift away.
   Even the Berd's most vigorous supporters concede that it
will take more time and money to set up a new institution
than to expand those already up and running. "You could
probably do more lending faster by using the existing
institutions," says one European central banker. However,
critics risk looking like spoilers who won't support the East
bloc's courageous march to freedom and economic health.
   Discussing the Berd at a congressional hearing in
Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said,
"Let's conjure up the headlines if we didn't join this." The
U.S., after an internal fracas over its level of
participation, has assured its allies that it will weigh in
with a contribution of about 10%.
   Berd's planners also have agreed that the new bank will
devote at least 60% of its resources to private-sector
enterprises. The remainder would go to government
"infrastructure" projects that would help private companies
function: more working telephones and rail cars, fewer
poisonous dumps. There are continuing worries that even with
the emphaisis on private-sector projects, the new bank will
add to the debt burdens of nations already heavily indebted.
   The biggest worries involve the Soviet Union. "The size of
the country is such that they could bankrupt the bank," says
the EC negotiator. He adds that in the coming Paris meeting,
"we will come up with a way to let them in -- but fence
them."
   The U.S. Treasury's negotiator, David Mulford, has
suggested limiting Soviet borrowings for five years to
amounts equal to the capital it paid in. Moreover, Berd loans
to the Soviet Union would be restricted to private companies
and special technical assistance under the Mulford proposal.

   WASHINGTON -- Growth in consumer debt continued to slow in
February, the Federal Reserve Board reported.
   Consumer installment credit expanded $3.42 billion during
the month, a 5.7% annual rate, according to the Fed. That was
the smallest rise since last October and followed rates of
6.4% and 7.3% in January and December, respectively.
Originally, the January rate was estimated at 5.9%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A drop-off in growth of automobile loans held back the
expansion of consumer credit, a statistic that includes all
consumer borrowing except mortgages. Car loans expanded $889
million, a 3.7% annual rate, after spurting $2.02 billion in
January, an 8.4% annual rate. Nevertheless, February's growth
in car financing is an improvement from late last year when
debt from auto loans was declining.
   Revolving credit, largely bank card and retail borrowing,
showed weak expansion for the second consecutive month.
Borrowing in this category grew $485 million, for a 2.9%
annual rate of increase, after inching forward at a 1.8%
annual rate in January.
   At the end of February, consumer installment debt totaled
$718.67 billion, up 5.3% from a year earlier.

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Tesoro Petroleum Corp. said it won a
$6.4 million verdict against a foreign subsidiary of Coastal
Corp.
   The company said a New York Supreme Court jury found that
Holborn Oil Co., a Bermuda-based unit of Coastal, had agreed
to purchase 25,000 metric tons of gasoline from Tesoro in May
1979, before a steep decline in the world petroleum market.
Holborn later denied entering into the contract and refused
to accept delivery of the gasoline, Tesoro said, forcing
Tesoro to sell the gasoline at a loss. The jury verdict
represented Tesoro's loss and accrued interest.

   FRANKFURT -- Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it will join four
West German companies to invest 750 million marks ($441.3
million) in a 50-50 joint venture it has formed with
Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline, to update and expand
the Moscow airport, Sheremetjevo I.
   West Germany's national air carrier, which is 51%
government owned, announced a year earlier that it had signed
a letter of intent for the project. Feasibility studies were
made during the past 11 months.

<TEXT>
   The Sheremetjevo I airport in Moscow, as well as other
Soviet airports in the future, will be modernized, expanded
and operated by the joint venture. The 750 million marks will
be used to expand and update a passenger terminal in Moscow,
to build an international freight terminal, to build a
waiting hall and to build an airport hotel.
   In addition to Lufthansa, partners in the venture will
include electronics concern AEG AG, Flughafen Frankfurt am
Main, Salzgitter subsidiary Noell G.m.b.H and Dresdner Bank
AG.
   Lufthansa also said it received a comprehensive
maintenance contract to service the fleet of Airbus planes
owned by Aeroflot. Lufthansa didn't disclose financial
details of its new Aeroflot service contract.

   Debate About Tropical Forests Rages

   Southeast Asian Officials
   Assail Conservationists

   KUCHING, Malaysia -- Mention the fate of Southeast Asia's
tropical forests these days and watch official hackles rise.
   "I'm not an environmental villain," protests Abdul Taib
Mahmud, chief minister of Sarawak, a steamy Malaysian state
on the north coast of Borneo. He challenges conservationist
critics to fly over his timber-carpeted domain: "You'll be
lucky if you see any bald patches anywhere in Sarawak."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Like other government leaders across the region, Tan Sri
Taib has reason to be defensive. Like it or not, Southeast
Asia is being sucked into the center of a global controversy
over the world's fast-diminishing tropical forests.
   International environmental groups assert that unless the
region's governments and timber industry mend their ways,
their actions will contribute to ecological problems that
ultimately will affect the entire Earth. Rapid deforestation
of the tropics, environmentalists say, threatens to wipe out
species of plant and animal life, contributes to harmful
changes in the global climate, and destroys forest-dwelling
societies.
   But Southeast Asian governments, committed to using timber
earnings to help power their developing economies, are
lashing back. They say their forest policies aren't as bad as
the critics charge, and they see protectionist motives behind
the critics' complaints. Malaysia's combative Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, for example, regularly blasts foreign
environmentalists' criticism as a subterfuge intended to keep
developing lands economically subservient long after the
industrialized West and Japan have laid waste to their own
forests.
   The confrontation threatens one of Southeast Asia's
biggest industries. The region holds a quarter of the
estimated one billion hectares of remaining tropical forest
and controls about 80% of the world's $7 billion in annual
tropical-timber trade.
   In Tan Sri Taib's Sarawak state, for example, the forest
provides thousands of jobs, pays half the government's bills,
finances local political dynasties and supports some of
Asia's richest, if most obscure, tycoons. One of the world's
main exporters of hardwood logs, Sarawak reaped an estimated
$1 billion last year from timber sales.
   "If you stop logging tomorrow, you stop the whole state,"
says Sarawak's environment and tourism minister, James Wong
Kim Min.
   Southeast Asia's forests aren't facing extinction yet. But
all is not well. Recent studies -- as well as interviews with
government officials, timber-industry officials, academics
and conservationists throughout the region, and visits to
logging sites and forest settlements -- make it clear that
current methods of exploitation are shrinking the size and
degrading the quality of Southeast Asia's remaining forest.
   "The forests have been treated like mines," says a
European tropical-forestry expert based in Indonesia. "They
are exploited, not appreciated as a permanent resource."
   The region hasn't suffered the wholesale destruction that
has marred some Latin American and African forests. Despite
heavy logging and an influx of settlers, huge areas of
Southeast Asia -- especially in Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua
New Guinea -- are blanketed in the ecologically richest rain
forests in the world, lush in timber, plant and wildlife.
   Independent experts say long-term preservation of the
Southeast Asian forests depends on whether they can be
managed on an economically productive and ecologically sound
basis. That is technically feasible, they say, but the effort
will require fundamental changes in government and popular
attitudes toward the forests, a firm commitment to new
policies that place a higher value on the resource, and
sophisticated forest management never before seen in the
region.
   In the meantime, the outlook is for an increasingly bitter
confrontation between Southeast Asian governments scrambling
to defend their policies and environmental groups seeking to
curtail commercial logging. The clash could cause headaches,
too, for international lending institutions and Western
officials who formulate trade and aid policies.
   Last year, the World Wide Fund for Nature (formerly the
World Wildlife Fund), the world's largest private
conservation organization, called for a halt, within five
years, to all international tropical timber trade that isn't
produced by ecologically sound logging practices.
   Only about 1% of tropical-timber output currently meets
the fund's criteria. The fund chastised Japan, in particular,
for abetting deforestation by being the largest importer of
tropical timber, more than 90% of it from Southeast Asia.
   Other environmental groups and "Green" political parties
in Europe want boycotts of tropical-timber products and are
spreading their campaign to the U.S., where the issue has
attracted the interest of legislators. The activists want
such institutions as the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank to stay out of development projects that they charge
contribute to forest degradation. They also want to make
Western aid to timber-producing countries contingent on the
recipient's environmental record.
   The pressure appears to be producing some results. The
European Parliament has called on the European Community to
adopt regulations imposing quotas on tropical-timber imports,
although the EC has yet to do so. In Indonesia,
environmentalists are claiming partial credit for Scott Paper
Co.'s recent decision to drop out of a $654 million
pulp-and-paper project, although the U.S. company says it
acted for other reasons. In Malaysia, conservationists claim
credit for a central-government decision, announced in
November, to stop the export of logs from its Borneo states
of Sarawak and Sabah. Both states are resisting the move,
however, and no timetable has been set for its
implementation.
   Alarmed at the growing influence of the environmental
movement, Southeast Asian governments and the timber industry
have mounted a public-relations counterattack. Last month,
officials of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
which comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Brunei, decided to send missions to
the EC, Japan and the U.S. to lobby against restrictive
timber-trade measures being advocated by environmental
groups.
   Officials contend that Western critics are, wittingly or
not, promoting trade restrictions in the guise of
environmental protection. "If the world is really concerned
with tropical forests, then it should open its markets so we
won't be so dependent on forest industries," says Indonesia's
environment and population minister, Emil Sa lim. "Everybody
talks about tropical forests, but they don't talk about
development."
   At the same time, however, Southeast Asian policy makers
concede that their forests have suffered from poor management
and ill-controlled exploitation. In the Philippines and
Thailand, for example, most primary forests have been ravaged
beyond hope of rehabilitation by reckless logging and illicit
settlement.
   Southeast Asian officials also privately acknowledge that
despite adoption of logging and land-use policies that look
reasonable on paper, enforcement is haphazard and damaging
practices continue.
   But officials in Malaysia and Indonesia say conditions in
their countries aren't as bad as portrayed by the critics.
They assert that foreign activists, and small but
increasingly vocal domestic environmental groups, are
ill-informed and present a distorted picture of what is going
on. Between them, Indonesia and Malaysia account for about
75% of the remaining primary-forest area in Southeast Asia
and are the region's main timber exporters.
   Across Southeast Asia, officials say they are taking steps
to improve matters. For example, Indonesia's forestry
minister, Hasjrul Harahap, has pledged to crack down on
abuses by politically well-connected logging concessionaires
and is backing policies designed to make the timber industry
more efficient and more ecologically responsible. "The
question you're asking is, Can we control it?" he says. "The
answer is yes. But give us time and give us help."

   Port Authority Drops Plans to Increase
   Hudson River Tolls, PATH Charges

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, trimming its budget, has dropped plans for higher
tolls and PATH fares, but will push for them again in 1991.
   "The 1990 budget does not include a toll increase" nor
does it recommend increases for the PATH fare this year, Port
Authority spokeswoman Mildred Schneider said yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the Port Authority unveiled its proposed 1990 budget
in December 1989, the draft called for a $2.9 billion budget
that included $93 million in additional revenue from the
agency's tunnels and bridges: the George Washington, Bayonne
and Goethals bridges, the Outerbridge Crossing and the
Holland and Lincoln tunnels.
   That meant round-trip tolls would rise to $4 from $3 for
automobiles and to $4 from $3 per axle for trucks. The
increases were to take effect April 1.
   There also was to be a fare increase to $1.25 from $1 on
Port Authority Trans-Hudson trains linking New Jersey to
Manhattan.
   In January, it was revealed that a mid-November 1989 plan
outlined a five-year capital program that saw the tunnel and
bridge tolls going as high as $6 by 1993 and PATH fares
increasing to $1.50.
   The bulk of the money was to be invested in the area's
three major airports, which are operated by the Port
Authority.
   However, the governors of New York and New Jersey must
approve the budgets and increases.
   Initial votes on the budget were put off and a new,
revised budget goes before the Port Authority's commissioners
on April 12.
   Port Authority representatives declined to speak about any
possible pressures from the governors that caused the change.
The governors' offices did not immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment, but Nancy Kearney, spokeswoman for New
Jersey Gov. Jim Florio, told the Star-Ledger of Newark, "The
governor's office did not direct them to do this."
   Hazel F. Gluck, a former New Jersey transportation
commissioner and current Port Authority commissioner, said
the agency's revised budget calls for a $33 million cut in
operating costs and the deferral of $300 million in
construction projects for both states.
   She said she assumed that it was "hard to get staff {of
the two governors} to focus on an increase vis a vis the Port
Authority when they are trying to put a budget together."
Both states face sizable deficits.
   Ms. Gluck said the lack of increases and the trimming of
the capital budget to about $900 million was reasonable --
for the time being.
   The governors of both states will hear again about toll
hikes and PATH fare increases, this time for 1991.
   "I'm sure that's going to come up for discussion again,"
Ms. Gluck said. "I think the Port can make a case for it."
   She said she did not know how much nor in what form the
increases would be, "but it's not going to be every 18
months" nor will it hit the initially projected $6.

   KATHMANDU, Nepal -- From Berlin to Managua, the past year
has seen people all over the world turn out despotic
governments in favor of democracy and human rights. Now
isolated Nepal is trying to join the club. For the past six
weeks, Nepali citizens have been rallying, mostly peacefully,
to demand a greater say in the running of their country.
   In response, the government has ordered all schools and
campuses closed, arrested hundreds of people and shut down
seven newspapers. Armed policemen patrol the streets in this
once polite and peaceful city; four people were reported
killed in the suburb of Patan last weekend when police opened
fire on a demonstration. The situation has reached a point
that cosmetic measures like the cabinet reshuffle announced
last weekend will no longer do. The government must come to
terms with the opposition or lose its legitimacy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The demonstrations cap a difficult year for Nepal. In
March 1989, India refused to renew trade and transit treaties
with Nepal, closing down all but two of the 15 trade routes
along the 1,100-mile border. The combination of economic
tension and the refusal to relax the ban on political parties
sparked a resurgence of political activism. The seven
bitterly divided communist groups formed the United Left
Front in January; then the democratic Nepali Congress Party
decided to launch a protest movement Feb. 18, the anniversary
of the restoration of the Hindu monarchy in 1950. The two
groups joined together in the Movement for Restoration of
Democracy and pledged to fight for Western-style liberal
political institutions.
   On the announced day, thousands of people converged on
Kathmandu's main street and in a dozen other towns and
villages. Their demands: dismissal of the government; a
lifting of the ban on political parties; and parliamentary
elections.
   At the heart of the dispute is the Panchayat method of
government, which rules through a series of indirectly
elected councils, culiminating in a National Assembly, but
with the king as the source of all authority. Panyachat
leaders enjoy a life even Europeans would envy while the
average Nepali earns only $150 a year -- and inflation is
high. Nepalis can be jailed for up to 18 months without
charge. Religious freedom is limited.
   Since the protests began, police have killed, by their own
count, 15 people, and released prisoners say they have been
tortured and beaten. The use of force has rallied most of
Nepal's intelligentsia behind the anti-government movement.
Doctors and health workers staged a general strike Sunday to
protest the imprisonment of medical workers while 250 lawyers
marched on the prime minister's office to demand the release
of 64 jailed colleagues. Government workers went on strike
for two hours yesterday.
   There are signs that the movement may be gaining support
among urban workers. Industrial laborers in Hetauda staged a
one-day strike in support of the movement on March 22. The
following day, hawkers refused to sell state publications and
set fire to government newspapers. Housewives in Kathmandu
rattled steel pans at the university last Friday to make
their displeasure heard. But Harvard- and Eton-educated King
Birendra has refused to budge on the issue of Panchayat rule.
   In Kathmandu, life is normal enough between
demonstrations, but Patan is as tense as a war zone. On
Tuesday, condolence meetings were held in memory of the
people killed Sunday, and on Monday, the Constitution of
Nepal is to be burnt publicly.
   The government is getting nervous at what it calls the
"anti-national, anti-social, subversive and terroristic
elements out to disrupt peace and stability with foreign
backing." Official sources privately admit that they have
given Panchayat workers foreign aid money to stage counter
rallies. Meanwhile, the Swiss and West German governments
have officially notified Nepal that they will stop aid unless
the human-rights situation improves.
   Even some of King Birendra's supporters oppose the
extended crackdown and have urged negotiation. A statement
signed Feb. 22 by 40 members of the 145-member national
assembly, including a former prime minister, six former
ministers and two nominees of King Birendra, criticized the
use of force and called for a political dialogue. They blamed
the "desperation of reactionaries" in the government for the
unrest.
   Former Attorney General Sambhu Prasad Gyawali, who served
under the Panchayat for 11 years, has called on King Birendra
to recognize the major political parties to save Nepal "from
the whirlwind of a devastating civil strife." Last weekend,
Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, who urged the
government to negotiate, resigned in protest against the
crackdown. Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha submitted
his resignation last night, the Associated Press reports. The
Panchayat policy committee is scheduled to meet on April 18
to discuss possible reforms, but it is unlikely to make the
dramatic concessions needed to curb the country's
restiveness.
   For its part, the Congress Party could ease fears about
its aims by repudiating its alliance with the United Left
Front, which is led by Sahana Pradhan, the widow of a Maoist
leader, Puspa Lal. The ULF is violent and unpredictable.
Congress can hardly believe in the ULF's sudden conversion to
democracy, and the front's violent tactics give the
government a pretext to crack down on even peaceful protests.
   The relationship between Nepalis and their king is
important. He is the symbol of national unity, the source of
all government policies, the defender of tradition and a
Hindu saint. That does not mean, however, that the
relationship cannot change. All around the world, from Japan
to Sweden, monarchy coexists with multi-party democracy.
Since 1950, the Nepal monarchy has based its legitimacy on
the consent of the people. Now is the time for King Birendra
to accept that his people want reform. The alternative is
more bloodshed, which can only weaken the ties that bind
together king and people.

   GOP Constituency From Soviet `Captive Nations'
   Reacts to Bush's Stance With Anger and Sadness

   EUCLID, Ohio -- Here on East 185th Street, just beyond
Tony's Polka Village and Donna's Slovenian Restaurant,
Skufca's sports store is holding a sale on bowling shoes.
Across the way, Setina's Meat Market has a special on zeludic
and skilandis, the Slovenian and Lithuanian lean sausages
made with the stomach casing of a steer.
   This is the heart of a sprawling ethnic community that
dropped its roots in the New World on a swath of land east of
Cleveland.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was also, until last month, the heart of George Bush
country -- a conservative urban enclave that for nearly four
decades made the Republican Party the repository of its
dreams of liberation for Eastern Europe.
   Now, however, the support for Mr. Bush has dried up as
fast as the early-April snow showers that blow in from Lake
Erie a few blocks away. The Republicans' Captive Nations
constituency -- a small but vocal and influential GOP bulwark
since the early 1950s -- is angered the president hasn't
recognized Lithuania or taken a stronger position to free the
Baltic nations from their ties to the Soviet Union.
   "It's good that Bush wasn't president during the Civil
War, because the slaves would never be free," says Raymond
Kudukis, an emigre engineer who serves as vice president of
the international Lithuanian World Community. Vida Grigonis
Glinka, a Cleveland-born homemaker, adds: "I was a very
strong Republican. Now Bush is treating Lithuania and the
Baltics like they're garbage."
   Two years ago this month, Mr. Bush brought his
presidential campaign to the Lithuanian-American Citizens
Club here on East 185th Street. Speaking amid the traditional
woodcarvings and the brightly colored crests of the cities of
Vilnius, Klaipeda and Kaunas, Mr. Bush talked of "the
commitment to freedom" and promised to "help countries around
the world that want to be free."
   Today Mr. Bush's visit to the Lithuanian center -- where
the smell of balandeliai, the stuffed cabbage rolls that are
served with whipped potatoes, hangs in the air -- is
remembered with irony and bitterness. "We'd like him to
repeat the same speech he made here, word for word," says Mr.
Kudukis, a registered Republican. "We'll send him a copy. He
can read it."
   Mr. Kudukis and the others are part of one of the post-war
GOP's most loyal constituencies. Wooed to the Republicans by
Dwight Eisenhower, who was looking for ways to appeal to
Midwest voters, the group gave the GOP an entree into
communities they wouldn't have penetrated otherwise because
of economic or ethnic factors. For their part, the
Republicans in their 1952 platform promised "liberation" of
Eastern Europe and, beginning in 1953, repeatedly got
Congress to pass resolutions establishing Captive Nations
Week, commemorations set aside for Americans to pray for the
liberation of people behind the Iron Curtain.
   In local politics, the Captive Nations constituency showed
its influence when Ralph Perk, a Czech Republican, was
elected to three terms as Cleveland's mayor beginning in
1971. Even Mr. Perk has trouble defining his coalition in one
breath: "I couldn't have won the election," he says now,
"without the Lithuanians, the Estonians, the Latvians, the
Slovaks, the Hungarians, the Poles, the Byelorussians, the
Ukrainians, the Romanians, the Slovenians, the Croatians, the
Serbians and the Czechs."
   The ties to the GOP were strengthened as the Republican
National Committee poured resources into the outreach
operations of its nationalities department. And later, Ronald
Reagan preached a brand of anti-communism that appealed as
much to prewar immigrants, who had tended to be Democrats, as
to the post-war immigrants, who largely were devout
Republicans.
   "He talked about family and neighborhood and work," says
Michael Novak, director of social and political studies at
the American Enterprise Institute, "and he sounded right for
this constituency."
   But today many of these voters -- and not only those of
Lithuanian descent -- feel betrayed by what they regard as
Mr. Bush's inaction and by their suspicion that he cares more
for the survival of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev than
for the freedom of Baltic peoples.
   "We've been led down the primrose lane," says Maris
Manteneiks, a Latvian-born physicist. "President Bush
promised to work for freedom for the Baltic states. Now, all
of a sudden, silence, absolute silence." Lia Staaf, an
Estonian-born school librarian, adds: "I became a Republican
because of Yalta. I trusted Republicans, they gave us so much
hope. I'm angry."
   Many of these Cleveland-area Republicans have already
translated their anger into action. They have traveled to
Washington to speak with their members of Congress -- all
Democrats, and all exceedingly pleased to voice their support
at a time when Mr. Bush is measuring his wordsand have
participated at vigils in front of the Capitol and the White
House.
   Victor Stankus, a Lithuanian-born dentist, is helping to
lead a petition drive of Lithuanian-American veterans. And
Linas Muliolis, a Cleveland State University student who
wants to study at Vilnius University, is planning to
participate in a coast-to-coast relay that youths of Baltic
descent are arranging, to dramatize their demands for U.S.
recognition of an independent Lithuania.
   "We're not going to take this lying down," says Mr.
Kudukis. The complaints have begun to penetrate the White
House, with some Bush administration officials growing
worried that the discontent could be a political problem for
the president.
   Some Democrats have tried to capitalize on the president's
predicament. Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, for example, who is
in a tough re-election battle in a state with many voters
with ties to the Captive Nations, has been a leader in
pressing Mr. Bush to recognize a free Lithuania at the
"earliest appropriate time." In all, there are an estimated
one million voters with ties to Lithuania and another 90,000
with ties to Latvia, and while they are scattered all around
the country, there are important pockets in such places as
Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Buffalo, N.Y.; and Pittsburgh.
   Though many of the members of the Captive Nations
constituency found little appeal in Michael Dukakis in 1988,
they share a harsh view of President Bush and -- today at
least -- vow either to vote for a Democrat in 1992 or not to
vote at all.
   "He has let us down -- and when he comes around again we
will not forget," says Terese Kalvaitis, an investigator for
the Cleveland public schools. "He has given up the Baltics,
just as Roosevelt did."
   And though a number of these voters may stray back into
the GOP fold by the 1992 elections, many of them now regard
Mr. Bush as an appeaser; one of them compared him with
Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who wagered
that concessions to Hitler in the late 1930s would forestall
war. They worry, more-over, that Mr. Bush's reluctance to
alienate Chinese leaders during and after the democracy
movement there in 1989 signals a pattern.
   "If there's a Tiananmen Square massacre in Vilnius, the
blood will be on the hands of President Bush," says Michael
Krivinskas, a Lithuanian-American engineer who counts himself
a Republican. "This is genocide, a sellout of human rights."
   These ethnic voters, who for so long thought their dreams
were unachievable, are overcome with frustration now that the
dreams seem so close to becoming reality. "People are
standing in line to sign our petition," says Dona Cipkus, a
real-estate agent who was born in Lithuania and who worked on
the Bush campaign in 1988. "I cannot understand why the
president is not responding."
   But mixed with the anger to Mr. Bush is, simply, sadness.
"He says nothing but `Read my lips,' " says Vytautaf Brizgys,
a retired manufacturing engineer who came to the U.S. from
Lithuania in 1949. "Who can read those lips if they don't
ever open?"

   South Korean Businessmen Seek to Speed
   Progress on Seoul-Moscow Relations

   SEOUL -- Many South Korean government and business
officials, impatient with the slow progress that Seoul and
Moscow have made toward normalized relations in the past two
years, are trying to speed the process. The shift in pace is
alarming some Korean officials.
   "Koreans are by temperament a very impatient people," says
a national security adviser to President Roh Tae-Woo. "Many
are simply tired of waiting and want to rush ahead. But now
more than ever, we must be cautious."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The adviser says that the Soviet Union remains a highly
risky place politically and economically. He notes that
ongoing tensions between Moscow and Lithuania underscore the
continuing instability of the Soviet Union.
   Given the political uncertainty, some Korean officials are
particularly anxious to establish an investment-guarantee
treaty with the Soviets to diminish the potential for what
the adviser calls "economic disaster and the loss of Korean
investments." Friction on the economic front, he warns, could
undermine the budding Korean-Soviet relationship and even
renew tensions between Moscow and Seoul.
   "We are in a dangerous phase," adds a Korean Foreign
Ministry official. "There's a certain recklessness about the
way that some prominent Koreans have begun rushing at
breakneck speed to grab profit -- or glory -- from the
development of relations between these two long-estranged
countries."
   The officials urging caution are responding to a flurry of
recent developments between the two countries, culminating in
Friday's announcement that Seoul plans to send a government
delegation to Moscow in May to discuss the establishment of
formal diplomatic relations.
   While Seoul insists that some type of formal relations is
a prerequisite for greater trade and investment between the
two countries, Korean businesses are busily gearing up for
eventual normalization. Many companies already have signed
big trade contracts, joint-venture agreements and other
business deals.
   Though unofficial government contacts between Seoul and
Moscow have been carried out openly for at least two years,
the May meeting would be the first official
government-to-government discussions on normalizing
relations. On the Soviets' side, the chief obstacle to
normalization is Moscow's worry about the reaction of its
communist ally, North Korea, which remains a bitter enemy of
South Korea.
   A spokesman for Mr. Roh said the Korean government would
"take a prudent attitude in promoting the goal of improving
relations with the Soviet Union."
   That attitude is shared by Park Chul-Un, Korea's minister
of state for political affairs, who returned from Moscow last
week. Mr. Park warned on Saturday that Korean haste in
wanting to normalize relations with the Soviet Union would
give Moscow the upper hand in negotiations. He indicated that
Moscow already has asked for financial assistance from Korea,
but he gave no details.
   "We couldn't sound out {the Soviets on} detailed
conditions on the establishment of links so far," he said.
"What do you think they require of us? It may be something
that will inflict a great burden on us. We don't have to make
haste. They may then ask for more."
   Mr. Park's caution wasn't shared by Kim Young-Sam, a
co-leader of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party who joined
him on the eight-day mission to Moscow. Mr. Kim, an
opposition leader until January, said he had discussed the
timing of normalization with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and is convinced that diplomatic ties are likely
this year, perhaps as early as June.
   But Mr. Park, who carried an exchange of personal messages
between Messrs. Roh and Gorbachev, warned against such
"excessive optimism." He said there are no positive signs
that normalization will come swiftly because Moscow, besides
trying to avoid offending Pyongyang, is preoccupied with
domestic problems.
   Korean Foreign Ministry officials attribute the
differences of opinion to a strong rivalry between Messrs.
Park and Kim. Both men, the officials say, want to claim
credit for a breakthrough in Seoul-Moscow relations.
   The ministry officials said the official Korean position
is that the two countries should enter into full-blown
ambassador-level relations without conditions or interim
steps. But they said Seoul will consider a Soviet
counterproposal that the two countries open
consulates-general before establishing full relations.
   Until a breakthrough is made on formal diplomatic
relations, Korean officials say, economic relations will be
restricted to small investments and modest trade accords.

   Software Companies Expected to Post
   Improved Earnings for Latest Quarter

   Most computer software companies' earnings improved in the
first quarter, analysts say, although profit forecasts are
sometimes risky, as Oracle Systems Corp. reminded holders
last week.
   Fast-growing Oracle shocked the market March 27 by
reporting flat earnings for its third quarter ended Feb. 28.
The next day, its stock fell $7.875 to $17.50 on record
over-the-counter volume of 21 million shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say that barring such surprises, the outlook for
most of the closely watched software companies is upbeat,
with personal-computer software providing the headiest
growth.
   For its third quarter ended March 31, bellwether Microsoft
Corp. should report a 60% profit increase to $69 million, or
$1.15 to $1.20 a share, from $41.1 million, or 73 cents a
share, says Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co. Revenue was up more than 50% to about $300 million from
$197 million, he adds. "It will be a real strong quarter," he
says. He predicted sharper growth in the fourth quarter
because of the introduction of four products.
   Robert Therrien of PaineWebber sees even stronger
Microsoft earnings, of $1.25 to $1.30 a share. However, he
worries that at some point Microsoft will be hurt by a
lawsuit by Apple Computer Inc. that charges copyright
infringement of the Macintosh computer by Microsoft's Windows
program. "I'm not recommending the stock for that reason," he
says.
   Lotus Development Corp., the No. 2 PC software company,
will "look very strong, coming off a depressed earnings
comparison," says David Readerman of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
He estimates net income more than tripled to about 48 cents a
share from $5.3 million, or 13 cents a share. Revenue rose
about 29% to $155 million from $120 million.
   This year Lotus continues to benefit from its big base of
existing customers who are upgrading to improved versions of
its 1-2-3 software that were introduced last summer. In
addition, it has been bringing out versions of 1-2-3 for
larger computers such as International Business Machines
Corp. mainframes and Sun Microsystems Inc. workstations.
   Analysts say that Lotus should report good growth in the
current quarter compared to depressed 1989 levels but that
the comparisons will be more difficult in the second half.
   Among smaller PC software companies, analysts expect
Ashton-Tate Corp. to report a small loss compared with the
year-ago first quarter, when net income was $11.1 million, or
43 cents a share. Ashton-Tate has reported losses since then
because of slumping sales as users wait for it to produce an
error-free update of its dBase software program. Mr. Sherlund
estimates first-quarter sales fell 33% to about $60 million
from $89.8 million.
   Software Publishing Corp. and Borland International Inc.
are both growing about 25% in sales and earnings, Mr.
Sherlund adds.
   In the mainframe software arena, Computer Associates Inc.,
the biggest company in the industry, faces slow growth but
rising profit. Computer Associates acquired unprofitable
Cullinet Software in the third quarter last year, and while
losses have been stanched, sales of Cullinet's products have
continued to decline.
   Mr. Readerman predicts that for its fourth quarter ended
March 31, Computer Associates will report net of about 36
cents a share, compared with 23 cents a share, or $42.5
million restated, the year before. He estimates revenue was
about the same as last year's restated $357.9 million.
   The big computer-services companies are growing steadily
because "the most interesting thing in the industry is
outsourcing," says Mr. Therrien of PaineWebber. Corporate
computer users increasingly are willing to entrust some of
their data processing and management of their computers to
outside firms. As a result, he says, General Motors Corp.'s
Electronic Data Systems, Computer Sciences Corp. and
Automatic Data Processing Inc. will all be up 10% to 15% in
earnings. "They're good, solid, predictable companies," he
says.

   Japan Can Expect Little Help With Yen
   From Its Partners in G-7, Analysts Say

   TOKYO -- The need for Bank of Japan to raise interest
rates could increase if the meeting by the Group of Seven
industrialized nations this weekend offers little help in
supporting the yen, analysts say.
   They say Japan can expect little succor from the U.S. and
other major partners. So Bank of Japan may have to gradually
start tightening in the money market as a prelude to boosting
the official discount rate for the fifth time in a row since
last May.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That may be harder this time around as interest rates are
now at the level where further increases could seriously hurt
the economy, some analysts caution. Bank of Japan's
tightening this past year has only reversed the easing over
the previous few years.
   What Japan needs from the G-7 meeting in Paris among
Japan, the U.S., West Germany, U.K., France, Italy and Canada
is some coordinated interest rate action with the U.S.,where
the Federal Reserve eased rates as Bank of Japan raised them.
This would repay the easing that Japan pursued for several
years after the Plaza Accord 1985 to support the dollar. The
accord was the first agreement by the G-7 for coordinated
attempts to keep the dollar within certain ranges.
   But "what they'll get is probably little but warm words
about coordinated policy," says David Pike, chief economist
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International Ltd. As a result, there
will be "a shift of focus back onto the Bank of Japan and a
fifth hike in the ODR {official discount rate}."
   The Japanese believe that now "it is time for the U.S. to
play its international role and help us out of our trouble,"
Mr. Pike says. "They helped the Americans . . . with a
relatively lax monetary policy. Now they are counting the
costs."
   But the U.S. hasn't shown much willingness to help.
   "Domestic considerations will continue to dictate U.S.
{monetary} policy," which is concerned more about inflation
than the yen, Mr. Pike says.
   "Unless the U.S. eases monetary policy, we can't expect
much appreciation in the Japanese yen," says Susumu Kato,
senior economist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp. But he said
he doesn't expect any immediate policy change by the Fed.
   "To stabilize foreign exchange, Japan doesn't want to have
to raise interest rates but instead wants other countries to
lower their interest rates," says Takashi Tsuchiya, economist
at Tokai Bank. "But the U.S. probably won't lower interest
rates, and West Germany probably won't either. If this
happens, then the yen will weaken further."
   Mr. Kato of Goldman Sachs says it is likely that the yen
will be traded around 155 to the dollar even after the G-7
meeting. The dollar was trading in New York at around 157.45
yen Thursday, down from 158.95 yen in New York late
Wednesday.
   However, the Tokyo stock market's prolonged decline and
the slowing of the economy may make Bank of Japan even more
wary of acting suddenly and severely than in the past, some
analysts say.
   Any tightening is likely to be gradual and well advertised
to avoid spooking the Japanese financial markets further, the
analysts contend. "It is very difficult to expect any
monetary policy change given the very fragile financial
markets," says Mr. Kato.
   "The BOJ is going to be fairly reluctant and the Ministry
of Finance will be out-and-out against" boosting the discount
rate again, says Mr. Pike of UBS. So "it is likely to be
fairly well sign-posted."
   Yet market participants contend that, by delaying a boost
in March, the ministry's reluctance prevented any impact on
the dollar's upward momentum and further eroded Bank of
Japan's credibility. With Japanese interest rates starting to
attract the interest of investors in the yen, their
confidence that Bank of Japan has the freedom to do what is
needed to defend the currency and fight inflation is more
crucial than ever.
   Bank of Japan has to make definite moves that reassure
investors, says Mr. Pike of UBS. But if the central bank does
want to take the public step of raising the discount rate
again, he says, "we will get the usual bickering" with the
Finance Ministry.
   Expecting a boost of 0.75 to one percentage point in June
or July, Takahide Furuhashi, head of research at DB Capital
Markets Asia Ltd., says the way it is carried out will
determine its impact. "If they are forced to raise the ODR
hike like the one we had before, it will have no effect at
all," Mr. Furuhashi says.

   WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in
another move aimed at curbing trading abuses, proposed a rule
that would order members of brokers' groups to register with
commodities exchanges.
   The groups, known as broker associations, have come under
heightened scrutiny in the wake of last year's federal
undercover investigation of fraud in the Chicago futures
pits. An earlier CFTC study found that relationships among
members of broker associations may increase the potential for
trading abuses.

   The proposed rules would require broker associations to
register with futures exchanges and would direct exchanges to
set up monitoring programs for the groups. The rules would
apply to any group in which brokers work together to execute
customer orders and share profits and losses from customer
trades.
   The commission will take public comments on the proposal
for 60 days before making a decision on final rules.

   China's Premier Li
   Evades Questions
   Of Foreign Press

   BEIJING -- When Chinese Premier Li Peng gives a news
conference, the questions journalists pose often generate
more interest than Mr. Li's answers.
   Mr. Li repeatedly retreated to blandness or non-answers
when treading on controversial ground as he fielded questions
from foreign and Chinese reporters after the annual National
People's Congress. Chinese viewing the broadcast got an
earful nevertheless as the international media put the
premier on the spot, asking the questions most citizens here
wouldn't dare utter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "One assumes that China's leaders won't give satisfactory
answers," says Andrew Higgins, Beijing correspondent for the
Independent, a British daily. "So what matters is simply
asking tough questions."
   It's a role that foreign journalists took on here after
most Chinese were cowed into silence by the violent
suppression of last year's pro-democracy movement. By raising
tough questions as they do in the West, foreign journalists
often disclose to the Chinese masses controversial facts that
China's state-controlled media studiously avoid.
   For example, a Hong Kong reporter asked Mr. Li's reaction
to news that a leader of last year's student demonstrations
had escaped to the West. Mr. Li shrugged off the question,
but it was the first time Chinese around the country watching
the broadcast had heard that one of the country's most-wanted
"criminals" had evaded China's security apparatus and escaped
overseas.
   The Chinese also learn of taboo topics from the
Chinese-language broadcasts of Voice of America and the BBC.
But since June, the authorities frequently have jammed the
broadcasts. But almost everyone has access to a television,
and they tune in faithfully when the leaders meet the press.
   Given the embarrassing leaks, why doesn't the government
ban foreign journalists from the televised conferences? A
Chinese intellectual explains that, despite the unwelcome
questioning, the presence of foreign journalists lends an air
of credibility and legitimacy to the proceedings, and helps
reinforce the idea that China is an open society.
   "It's an uncomfortable trade-off," says the scholar. "But
it gives the Chinese leaders enormous `face' to have the
Western media eagerly participating in their political
theatrics."
   On Wednesday, foreign journalists threw a number of tough
questions to the premier. Among them: Does Mr. Li have any
regrets for last year's killings? (No.) Will China's leaders
keep Tiananmen Square open to the public, despite fears of
renewed protests? (Unclear.) Will ousted Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang ever make a political comeback? (Unlikely.)
   Mr. Li dodged specifics. When asked which leader gave the
order to open fire on demonstrators in Beijing last June 3-4,
he ducked the question, saying only, "There was no other
choice but to use force to stop the turmoil." When another
Western journalist repeated the question, Mr. Li dismissed it
with obvious pique, saying, "I've already answered that."
   Despite the evasions, many Chinese eagerly watched the
broadcast. "The Chinese people's spirits have been very low
recently," said a government worker after the telecast. "But
hearing journalists ask so many sensitive questions certainly
stirs up a lot of people."
   Indeed, foreign reporters frequently meet Chinese who
recognize them from televised news conferences. Many praise
the journalists for raising controversial questions. But such
attention puts journalists in an ethically awkward position:
their goal is to report the news objectively, not be drawn
into the Chinese political debate.
   By contrast, journalists for China's tightly controlled
press pose only the softest of questions. Some appeared
prearranged to let Mr. Li make points. Others were
super-cautious.
   In one, a People's Liberation Daily reporter waxed
emotional about the military's constitutional duty to
suppress unrest such as the Tiananmen protests. When he
finished his impassioned question, Mr. Li was speechless for
a time.
   "You have made a correct and comprehensive analysis of the
constitution," said Mr. Li, a hard-liner who is thought to
have played a leading role in the suppression of the
protests. "I have nothing to add."
   To his credit, Mr. Li did solicit questions from many
Western reporters. And, while offering little new
information, he handled the questions with confidence.
   When foreign journalists asked questions about the June
killings -- still the central issue to many Chinese -- Mr. Li
dismissed them as irrelevant:
   "It's nearly a year after the June 4 events," he said. "I
wonder if this question isn't a little outdated."

   I find it incredible that your television critic Martha

15). I would like to remind her that Hemingway won the Nobel
Prize for literature for this work in 1954. Ms. Bayles's
judgment undoubtedly has been altered by watching too much
TV. I suggest that in the future she forgo literary criticism
and stick to reviewing such masterpieces as "The Gong Show."

   "The Old Man and the Sea" re-established Hemingway as one
of the significant writers of the 20th century. Even
Hemingway's most virulent literary critics would hesitate to
describe "The Old Man" in such negative terms.
   Ms. Bayles, who must spend much of her working life
watching television, has obviously had her tastes jaded by
that most pretentious, mediocre media.
   As a bookseller, I am pleased that she is not a book
reviewer and hope she continues to work in a field to which
she is so nicely suited.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Eastman Kodak Co. pleaded guilty to two
misdemeanor violations of New York environmental law and paid
the state a $2 million fine.
   Kodak, which had been accused of contaminating ground
water at Kodak Park, its core manufacturing facility, also
signed a consent order to do extensive cleanup work at the
site. Company officials didn't have an immediate estimate on
how much that would cost.
</LP>

   Kodak has already agreed to spend $100 million to replace
or remove 1,013 chemical storage tanks in the wake of
hometown furor over toxic spills. It also agreed to reduce
emissions of methylene chloride, a suspected cancer-causing
chemical, by 70% by 1995. But New York State Attorney General
Robert Abrams yesterday charged the company must still
"remedy decades of environmental abuse."
   Kodak pleaded guilty to unlawful removal of hazardous
waste in connection with a July 1, 1986, shipment of 48,900
pounds of contaminated soil to a silver-recovery plant. State
officials said Kodak failed to file proper hazardous waste
documents and ensure that the waste hauler and reclamation
plant were licensed to handle the hazardous soil.

   Your March 7 Law-column item seems to imply that the State
Bar of Michigan had somehow sought to influence the
disposition of a now-dismissed complaint against its
president-elect. Complaints against lawyers in Michigan are
handled by an agency appointed for that purpose by the
Michigan Supreme Court, which is funded from state-bar dues.
No one outside the discipline agency even knew of the
existence of the complaint file. Even our president-elect,
who was the target, did not learn of its existence until the
incident was disclosed in a newspaper article long after the
file had been closed. Consequently, it was not possible for
the State Bar of Michigan to seek to influence the
disposition of the complaint, the existence of which was not
known. Further, the state bar has no control over the
operations of the Attorney Grievance Commission.

owned subsidiary, which is expected to have combined annual
revenue of about $200 million. AO Safety makes safety
eyeware, respirators and other safety products.
   Previously, Cabot had said it would form a limited
partnership with a unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. that
was going to acquire AO Safety from American Optical. In
addition, Cabot was going to contribute its E-A-R business to
the partnership. From that transaction, Cabot would have
received $100 million in cash and $30 million in securities,
plus a "significant" minority interest in the partnership.
   Cabot Chairman Samuel Bodman said, "As a result of certain
strategic and financial developments, we decided it was in
the best interest of Cabot to structure the transaction as an
outright purchase. This will have a positive impact on
earnings and provide more flexibility for financing in the
future."
   American Optical is based in Southbridge, Mass.

   NEW YORK -- Bobby Orbach, who turned discounter 47th
Street Photo into one of the nation's biggest independent
computer retailers, said he is leaving to start a new
software-related business.
   Mr. Orbach, 37 years old, who joined closely held 47th
Street in 1981 as a calculator salesman, spearheaded the
discounter's move into computers. Retail industry sources
estimate that last year 47th Street sold about $130 million
of computers and had total revenue of over $300 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Orbach managed the unlikely feat of making 47th Street
a major supplier of computers and software to big corporate
and government offices in the New York area. Although
computer and software companies once shunned 47th Street as
an unauthorized, gray-market discounter, many began to deal
with the retailer when it became a major outlet.
   Before getting into computers, 47th Street was primarily a
camera retailer, famous for low prices, high decibel
order-takers and Saturday closings (in keeping with the
Orthodox Jewish traditions of its owner and employees).
Irving Goldstein, owner of 47th Street, said the company
"regretfully accepted the resignation." Mr. Orbach said he
expects to announce his new venture by the end of May.

   Toyota Weighs

   TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said it is considering making
light-aircraft engines, yet another sign of Japan's growing
interest in the aviation business.
   A Toyota spokesman said engineers at Japan's largest auto
maker "are examining whether our engines are applicable to
the aviation industry as well." But he stressed that "we
don't have any plans to market it or build anything in large
numbers at this point."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He denied a report in the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun
yesterday that Toyota had already developed the engine and
was planning to seek U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
approval later this year to sell it in the U.S.
   "That's jumping the gun," he said. "We haven't made any
decisions one way or the other."
   Separately, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said it will
send three officials next week to West Germany to meet with
Daimler-Benz AG's Deutsche Aerospace unit and to tour some
aerospace plants.
   A Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman said it will be the first
meetings between the two companies since they announced last
month that they were exploring linkups in a wide range of
sectors, including aviation.
   Japan currently lags far behind the U.S. and European
countries in aircraft, but it is making major efforts to
build a domestic industry. Worries about an emerging Japanese
aviation industry helped spark a controversy in the U.S.
Congress last year over the FSX fighter plane to be
co-produced by U.S. and Japanese companies.
   Currently, the only Japanese makers of aircraft engines
are Mitsubishi Heavy, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries
Co., and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.
   Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest auto maker, has
been making rocket engines for more than 30 years.
   Since 1988, Toyota has been importing and exporting
airplanes, but it currently doesn't have aviation-related
manufacturing. If the company does start such production, it
might come by modifying the engine currently used in its
top-of-the-line luxury automobile, which is known as the
"Celsior" in Japan, and the "Lexus" in the U.S.
   Earlier this year, the auto maker announced it was
exploring expanding into marine-related equipment.

   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of newsprint dropped 2.9%
in February from a year earlier, with the industry operating
at 94% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 747,000 metric tons of
newsprint in February, down from 769,000 metric tons a year
earlier. The February 94% operating rate was unchanged from a
revised 94% in January but down from 100% a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   For the first two months of the year, production fell 3.9%
to 1,544,000 metric tons from 1,607,000 metric tons a year
earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   February shipments dropped 0.4% to 718,000 metric tons
from 721,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments within
Canada rose while shipments to the U.S. and other markets
fell. Shipments dropped 2.8% in the first two months to
1,434,000 metric tons from 1,475 metric tons in January and
February of 1989.
   The association said U.S. consumer stocks at the end of
February were 1,297,000 metric tons, a 38-day supply,
virtually unchanged from the end of January but down from a
42-day supply of 1,448,000 metric tons at the end of February
1989. Canadian mills' stocks at the end of February rose to
432,000 metric tons from 403,000 metric tons at the end of
January and 420,000 metric tons at the end of February 1989.
   Total U.S. consumption of newsprint fell 0.9% in February
to 920,000 metric tons from 929,000 metric tons a year
earlier.

   Neither Bolar nor any other generic-drug company has ever

original brandname Dyazide, has been flooded with calls
asking whether our drug is still available. Others have

   ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- A philandering pizza maker and his
homicidal wife may profit from a new movie. And some people
here don't think that's right.
   The movie is a new Hollywood comedy opening today. It's
based on the true-life attempted murder of Tony Toto, a
former Allentown pizzeria owner and admitted womanizer, by
his jealous wife, Frances. Directed by Lawrence ("The Big
Chill") Kasdan, the movie stars Kevin Kline and Tracey Ullman
as the husband and wife.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the movie, "I Love You To Death," is a box-office hit,
the Totos could reap a tidy sum. But some people here grumble
that the Totos should be ashamed of trying to cash in on
their wicked ways.
   "It's a sin that people can resort to violence and are
rewarded by being made rich beyond their wildest dreams,"
says Lori Donnelly, an Allentown resident. Ms. Donnelly has
started a campaign urging a boycott of local theaters that
show the movie. She has even sent to President Bush a copy of
a protest letter she wrote to Sony Corp.'s Tri-Star Pictures
Inc. unit, which made the movie.
   Seven years ago, police found Mr. Toto at home, shot in
the head and in his cheating heart, but miraculously alive.
For a year or so before that, according to a detective who
worked on the case, his wife and inept hired killers had
tried bombing his car, clubbing him, drugging him and
shooting him. But to no avail.
   The unsinkable Mr. Toto, who is 44 years old, not only
survived, he bailed his wife out of jail before she was
sentenced, then waited faithfully while she served four
years. Their improbable love-conquers-all story made
headlines.
   The movie idea was hatched by two Allentown detectives,
who found a producer who sold the idea to Tri-Star.
   Pennsylvania law restricts convicted felons such as Mrs.
Toto from enjoying the fruits of their crimes. But the law
won't stop Mr. Toto, who still has a .25-caliber slug in his
skull, from sharing any gains with her. He stands to receive
an undisclosed share of the proceeds.
   Mr. Toto says he just hopes for enough money to send his
three younger children to college. But watching clips from
the movie and chuckling over Mr. Kline's portrayal of him,
Mr. Toto was thinking of another successful black comedy
about a warring couple. "`The War of the Roses' has made"
more than $80 million, he says, adding that he's been keeping
track.

   MANILA, the Philippines -- In a recent debt buy-back deal
with foreign commercial banks, the Philippines reduced its
debt stock 3.6% to $26.6 billion as of the end of January.
   This compares with $27.62 billion at the end of 1989,
according to latest figures on the country's foreign debt,
released by the Central Bank of the Philippines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Central Bank official said January's lower level of
foreign debt coincides with a debt purchase plan the
Philippines signed with foreign creditors that month.
   The plan gave the debt-ridden country a chance to buy
$1.34 billion of debt, owed by government agencies to foreign
commercial banks, at a 50% discount.
   The Philippines used an estimated $668 million in new
loans obtained from the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank, and Export-Import Bank of Japan to buy its debt.

   Approves Its Own
   Clean-Air Measure

   WASHINGTON -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee
approved its version of clean-air legislation after adopting
an acid-rain package that would help Midwestern utilities
facing steep cleanup costs.
   Approval of the acid-rain amendment, which came on a 39-4
vote, cleared the last major obstacle before passage of the
overall bill. The bill would impose about $20 billion in
costs annually on industry to clean up acid rain, smog and
toxic emissions from chemical plants and other facilities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) called the
bill "necessary" and said it would yield environmental
benefits, but would also "have a significantly adverse impact
on jobs and the economy." He predicted that the bill,
approved 42-1 by the committee, would reach the House floor
around the middle of May. William Dannemeyer (R., Calif.)
cast the only negative vote.
   Significantly, the acid-rain amendment doesn't include an
explicit subsidy for Midwest utilities, something that the
advocates of such cost-sharing have fought for over the past
year.
   Providing financial aid for the Midwest was "never
accepted at any point, at any time, anywhere," said Rep. Phil
Sharp (D., Ind.), who led the cost-sharing drive.
   Instead, the measure would aid utilities in the Midwest as
well as utilities in Western states and other regions that
have been seeking assurances they can expand. It would do
this by tinkering with the pollution-trading system to be
created by the legislation.
   Under the system, utilities that make especially deep cuts
in sulfur-dioxide emissions would get pollution credits that
they could sell or swap with other utilities, which could use
them to expand.
   The acid-rain provision would impose costs of $4 billion
annually on industry to clean up acid rain, which harms lakes
and trees in New England and Canada. Under the bill, 111
dirty coal-burning power plants in 21 states would have to
make deep cuts in sulfur-dioxide emissions by 1996. More than
200 additional power plants nationwide would have to make
cuts by 2001. A total 10 million tons a year in emissions
would be cut.
   The bill would include a nationwide cap on total power
plant emissions, designed to preserve the pollution gains
well into the next century.
   The agreement on acid rain was reached after several long
nights of intense bargaining between lawmakers from the
Midwest and those from the so-called clean states.
   The amendment would generate additional pollution credits
for utilities in the Midwest and clean states by requiring
deeper emissions cuts from all utilities affected by the
first phase. In addition, it would require cuts from several
power plants owned by the Energy Department and certain small
utilities that weren't previously covered.
   Midwest plants would also benefit from certain provisions
designed to encourage utilities to install emission-scrubbing
devices rather than switching to cleaner, low-sulfur coal.
These changes are designed in part to preserve mining jobs.
Bill Samuel, a lobbyist for the United Mine Workers, said he
believed the House provisions would result in fewer job
losses among miners than the bill passed this week by the
Senate.
   The Senate bill would generate additional allowances to
help the same groups of utilities, but does so by moving up
the two deadlines for cutting emissions.
   The committee's overall bill is stronger than the Senate's
legislation in some respects, and weaker in others. On smog,
the House bill calls for a stronger federal role in forcing
cleanups by states and cities. It would also tailor
requirements to the severity of an area's smog problem.
   Environmentalists also prefer the committee's provision on
cancer-causing industrial emissions.
   The Senate, however, calls for a significantly stronger
program requiring the use of reformulated gasoline or other
cleaner alternatives to conventional fuel in the smoggiest
cities. The Senate's provisions on auto-tailpipe exhaust are
also more stringent.

   ARNHEM, the Netherlands -- As far as Marlou Terhorts is
concerned, this is no time for the European Community to be
dismantling what's left of its national frontiers.
   Standing at a bus stop here, nine miles from the border
with West Germany, the 19-year-old says she isn't eager to be
a member of a club that will have 16 million new German
members. With German reunification looming, she argues, a
time of reflection is needed before border controls are
removed or the Dutch currency is exchanged for a European
one.
   "When Dutch people go to Germany, we speak German," says
Miss Terhorts. "But when the Germans come to Holland, they
treat it like it's theirs. Now is not the time for uniting
Europe."
   The European dream of economic unity is bumping up against
the reality of German reunification. While the EC's drive to
tear down remaining trade barriers inside the 12-nation bloc
continues to enjoy widespread public support, a substantial
minority is voicing fears that a powerful, reunited Germany
will hold economic sway over its smaller neighbors.
   Europe's leaders say a united EC in which most big
decisions are to be shared by all members should allay the
anxieties surrounding a united Germany. They want to push
forward with both economic and monetary union, eventually
including a single currency, and political union, buttressed
by joint institutions to handle foreign policy, trade
relations, and other matters. They say such common
institutions, which will require at least several years to
realize, will guarantee that no EC country will ever again be
able to use its economic or political power against another.
   But moving ahead quickly with this agenda won't be easy.
In Arnhem, a city of 130,000 inhabitants painfully scarred by
the war, people aren't always sure unity is the answer. While
they are mostly delighted by the lessening of tensions in the
East and hopeful about the business opportunities change will
bring, they also have vivid memories of their nation's past
powerlessness compared with a united Germany.
   Willem de Kat says such issues are a source of lively
debate these days in the living rooms of Arnhem, sometimes
dividing families and cutting across generations and economic
classes. The 28-year-old proprietor of a fix-it shop called
Handyman is convinced that the events under way in Europe
today will be manageable. But, he says, "My father fought in
the war. He is still a bit suspicious of the Germans."
   Public-opinion surveys show that people in the small
countries of northern Europe are the most wary of German
unity and its effects on their countries. The most recent
Pan-EC survey -- taken in November during the euphoric
international reaction to the opening of the Berlin Wall --
showed that more than one in five Dutch, Belgians, Danes and
Luxembourgers were against both German unification and
further steps toward EC integration. On average, that is
about twice the negative response found in the Mediterranean
countries.
   These emotions blossom on the streets of Arnhem. "A united
Europe would undoubtedly be better," says Annie Geresee,
drinking coffee with her elderly mother in a cafe. "But I
don't think it's possible under the present circumstances."
   Ms. Geresee says she is afraid of having the Netherlands
overrun with foreigners, including East bloc residents
seeking better living conditions. "We shouldn't open the
borders any more than they already are," she says.
   In the 45 years since the Battle of Arnhem, memories of
the war have refused to fade. Over eight days in September
1944, 80% of the city was reduced to rubble by bombing. In
recent weeks, some people here have felt as if they were
watching a replay of the uncertain years between the two
world wars. The continuing controversy over the security of
Poland's western border, in particular, has been a sharp
reminder of the 1930s, when no borders were sacred.
   Alex, a 26-year-old administrator of a construction firm,
also fears that neither the Netherlands nor the EC is strong
enough to hold Germany down. When the four victorious allies
agreed last month in Ottawa to allow the two Germanys to
unite, Dutch, Belgian and Danish leaders didn't get to say a
word.
   "A united Europe might help protect the interests of small
nations," Alex says. "But all of this has started too late.
If the EC had united 10 years ago, they would have been able
to have some say. But the changes are happening too fast, and
the EC cannot react properly in so little time."
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, trying to reassure his
EC partners, told journalists in Brussels last Friday that he
would support a quickened pace toward EC monetary and
political union, and that he wants to build the new Germany
firmly into a united EC. "We want to be European Germans and
German Europeans," he said.
   In Arnhem, it is businessmen who are most eager to have
the controversy about Germany cleared up. The closer ties
they have built up with the Germans through the EC are
directly responsible for much of the economic success that
the Netherlands has enjoyed in recent years. And recently,
Arnhem chose the East German city of Gera as its sister city,
partly with the hope that the Netherlands will share in the
economic revival of East Germany.

   Concerning your Feb. 27 article "As HMO Premiums Soar . .
.":
   Yes, the number of HMOs is less than a year or so ago --
but HMO membership continues to increase. The smaller number
of HMOs is mostly the result of consolidation and mergers.
HMOs continue to attract more and more new members.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yes, HMO premiums have increased -- but "soar" is an
overstatement, especially when you compare HMO increases of
16.5% for 1989 with indemnity increases of more than 20%.
   Yes, HMOs have to find new ways to control costs and still
provide a quality product and provide better data to
employers. But great progress has been made and will continue
to be and, contrary to your pessimistic view, the HMO, or
"Managed Care Industry," is proving to be more and more
popular as a way for employers and employees to meet
health-care needs.

   You focused on a finding by A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co. that
not many employers perceive they are saving money with HMOs.
Were you unaware the survey included a reality? The reality
is, employers pay roughly $300 less per employee for HMO
coverage than for indemnity insurance, a figure that
translates into about $4 billion in savings a year.
   More encouraging news in the Foster Higgins survey went
unreported: Employers who get the data they seek are more
likely to believe HMOs save them money; the greater the
number of employees enrolled, the more likely the employer is
to be satisfied. Furthermore, where employers have the
greatest experience with HMOs -- the Far West -- they are the
most satisfied.
   HMOs and employers are experimenting with "open-ended"
products so that employees will give HMOs a try. Once they
do, employees are likely to experience the levels of
satisfaction, often as high as 90%, reported by current
members, and to select their providers from within the HMO
network.

   It has been our experience that HMOs rely completely on
arbitrary methods for controlling costs. Typically, an HMO
negotiates with physicians and, in our own case,
neurosurgical specialists, to reduce our fees. At first look
this might seem to be a prudent, cost-effective way to do
business. However, the real cost-savings in health care will
not be in the reduction of surgical fees, but rather by the
overall reduction of costs that are built into the
health-care system. Fee negotiation proves to be
counterproductive; the real savings in health care is by
tighter controls of unnecessary costs.
   The goal of health-maintenance organizations to control
costs is certainly admirable. Our concern is the approach
that is often taken. For example, recently, one of our
patients was having a cervical-disk operation that requires
an intraoperative cervical X-ray. Because of the inexperience
of an X-ray technician, at least 25 additional minutes were
required in the operating time (which essentially doubled the
surgical time). This added between $500 to $750 onto the
patient's bill for the unnecessary delay in time.
   We believe it is more prudent and cost-effective to reward
health-care providers that identify these "wastes" and that
work to eliminate such inefficiencies, rather than penalizing
them. We should all contribute to and expect more effective
and efficient patient care through education and
collaboration among physicians, nurses, insurance carriers,
institutions and health agencies, such as HMOs.

   You say HMOs are "under attack" by consumers long
"dissatisfied" with HMOs, while employers are suddenly
dissatisfied. In fact, quite the opposite is true: Every
consumer-satisfaction survey available shows that consumers
prefer HMOs to traditional insurance. By contrast, employers
have been less satisfied for years because the savings from
HMOs is focused on lower employee cost-sharing.
   The value of the benefits provided by HMOs is greater than
traditional insurance, even at a lower price, but the
employee receives most of the advantages. Employers simply
want to share in the savings, which is much different from
wanting lower prices or being dissatisfied with HMO premium
increases.
   It is true that employers recently have shown tremendous
concern about the proliferation of HMOs with poor track
records, but this is not caused by higher prices. The real
problem for employers is that they cannot get enough
employees to go into HMOs. If they could get rid of
traditional insurance, their premiums would really be low
because there would not be any wasteful insurance products.
This is what most major benefits advisers are telling Fortune
500 firms every day.

   If "only 28% of employers" feel "their rates fairly
reflect services delivered," does that mean 69% were
satisfied while only 31% disagreed fully?
   The same applies when you indicated that only one-third
believe HMOs are effective in controlling health-care costs:
Does that mean 67% disagreed with your statement and were
satisfied that HMOs controlled costs?

   Businessland
   To Report Loss
   For 3rd Period

   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Businessland Inc. said it expects to
report a third-quarter net loss of about $2 million,
reflecting soft retail sales and lower profit margins
overseas.
   The news surprised analysts who had been expecting profit
of $4 million to $5 million. Analysts said Businessland as
late as this past month indicated the quarter would be
profitable. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, the computer retailer fell $1.50 to $8.875.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year-earlier quarter, net income was $8.5 million,
or 27 cents a share. The company said it expects to report
revenue for the latest quarter ended March 31 grew 9% to
about $320 million from $293.3 million.
   Businessland said new product announcements from Apple
Computer Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. in
mid-March caused "unanticipated slowing" in the market, as
customers delayed purchases in order to evalute the new
offerings.
   Apple Computer has said it expects to post
better-than-expected results for the quarter ended March 30,
spurred by sales of its newer personal computers.
   Businessland's chairman, David Norman, said that a
strategy "to put a cap on discounts" affected sales, and in
some cases "we were not competitive with Apple." In addition,
he said some "sales people lost their focus" in the quarter,
as Businessland geared up to start selling Compaq Computer
Corp.'s products once again. However, Compaq products didn't
begin shipping until this month.
   Early last month, Businessland said it would begin selling
Compaq products, after a feud between the companies caused
Compaq to halt sales to Businessland for nearly a year. That
announcement boosted Businessland's stock 23% in one day, to
$10.75.
   Mr. Norman said the company's U.K. operations and its
Computer Craft unit weren't profitable in the third quarter.
He said cost-cutting moves, including firing 15 to 20 of the
270 employees in the U.K. may bring U.K. operations back to
profitability this quarter.
   Businessland said it would also take an unspecified
write-down for inventory of certain service parts. In the
second quarter, the company took a $7.5 million charge for
the closure of 19 retail centers, and the dismissal of as
much as 7% of its work force.
   Sales of Next Inc. computers, the company headed by Steve
Jobs, co-founder of Apple, were "building momentum" in the
third quarter but were "below plan," Mr. Norman said. Last
year, Mr. Norman signed on as exclusive dealer for Next,
which has been off to a slow start.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Tradition Galore at Augusta National
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein

<LP>
   Augusta, Ga. -- America is a relatively young country that
prizes innovation, so it's no wonder that we are short on
tradition in many areas, including sports. For instance, our
newly crowned collegiate basketball champion, the University
of Nevada-Las Vegas, has been in existence for so brief a
period that its hoops coach, Jerry Tarkanian, can quip that
"our alumni didn't go there."
   One institution, though, does its best to make up for this
lack. That would be the Masters Golf Tournament, which
convened in earnest again here yesterday. The Masters marks
its 56th anniversary this annum -- not a long history in the
Royal-Pain &amp; Ancient Game. But, like a good golf swing, it
thrives on repetition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Masters has its traditional green jacket, which
distinguishes members of the host Augusta National Golf Club
from hoi polloi. It goes against the current grain by
requesting, with surprising effect, that spectators limit
their vocalizing to the encouragement of participants. It
insists that TV cables be wrapped in green to harmonize with
the outdoor decor, and bans advertising symbols, down to the
product names on concession-stand soft-drink and beer
spigots.
   Even when things change here, they remain the same.
Augusta National this year unveiled a bright, roomy press
center to replace the gloomy, barracks-like structure that
had served the purpose for many years. But the press snack
bar still dispenses the worst sandwiches in Christendom.
   The nicest Masters tradition has to do with respect for
excellence past: It's the one major tournament in golf -- or
any other big-time sport, for that matter -- that extends a
lifetime invitation to its former champions. They can come
and play a lot, or play a little, or just watch. The latter
is no small privilege at an event whose $90, four-day tickets
are available only to longtime subscribers or those willing
to pay scalpers upward of $1,500.
   The upshot is that spectators can witness rare meetings of
golf's generations. At Wednesday afternoon's par-three
tournament, they applauded 77-year-old Sam Snead, the 1949,
'52 and '54 winner, and 67-year-old Doug Ford ('57) along
with current heroes, and later on the practice range watched
77-year-old Byron Nelson ('37 and '42) appraise the tee shots
of Tom Watson ('77 and '81). "Tom's working on his fade, and
wanted to know what I thought," explained Nelson to people
who asked.
   The Masters honors its past winners with an annual
pre-tourney dinner, at which the defending titlist gets to
dictate a menu item. Britisher Nick Faldo picked
steak-and-kidney pie for this week's feed. Then, those who
wish to can tee it up with the big boys, unencumbered by any
euphemism for over-the-hill.
   To be sure, some "seniors" don't regard their appearances
as merely sentimental. One such is six-time champ Jack
Nicklaus, who just celebrated his passing of age 50 (gasp])
by winning his first start on golf's burgeoning seniors tour.
He declared on Wednesday that, newly liberated from back
ills, he's not playing this one for exercise.
   "I'm hitting the ball better than I have at any time since
the '70s," said the man who usually scored in the 60s during
that decade. "Realistically, I suppose I'm a long shot here,
but I think I can win."
   Darlin' Jack thrilled the multitudes with his
come-from-behind victory here in 1986 at the athletically
advanced age of 46, but that hasn't been the only geriatic
highlight on these beflowered acres. Snead, the game's wonder
as both boy and old boy, was a top-10 finisher in 1967 at age
54, and won the par-three tourney seven years later. Claude
Harmon ('48) fired back-to-back holes-in-one in the 1968
par-three event at age 52. Jimmy Demaret ('40, '47, '50) tied
for fifth in the tourney proper in 1962, at 51. Gene Sarazen,
winner of the second Masters, in 1935, shot a pair of 74s in
1962, when he was 60.
   Even when no such feats are envisioned, some ex-champs
look forward with relish to tackling Augusta National. "I'll
play here as long as I can walk," said Ford, who at age 67
was the oldest man slated to compete yesterday. "This place
is so beautiful, I hate to just come and watch."
   Nelson, golf's "Lord Byron" of the 1940s, thinks so too;
he played in the tourney proper until 1966, and in the
par-three until last year. For the past several years, he,
Snead and Sarazen played nine holes as the Masters'
ceremonial starting threesome, but a hip ailment worsened
last summer and relegated him to spectator status. Sarazen,
still swinging at 87, and Snead were scheduled to go it alone
yesterday.
   "I didn't bring my clubs this time," Nelson said on
Wednesday. "Didn't want to get tempted."
   Still, the Roanoke, Texas, rancher said he wouldn't miss
taking a journey he has made annually since 1935 save for the
years in which his first wife, Louise, was ill. "This course
is different -- it was special the year it opened," he said.
"Credit Bobby Jones, who built it, for that. He knew as much
golf history as he knew the game, which was a lot."
   Nelson went on to say that the Masters was important to
his personal history as well. "I still rank my 1937 win here
as my favorite," he said. "We didn't talk about `majors'
then, but it was one of my first important victories. I'd
just been named pro of a club in Reading, Pa., and my prize
money -- $1,200 -- outfitted my pro shop. I think I played my
best golf ever when I won again in '42. I was three shots
down to Ben Hogan after five holes, but came back to beat
him, 69-70. Had an eagle at eight (a par-five)."
   The reunion aspect of the tourney is "nice," he said, even
though the definition of what constitutes an old-timer
constantly changes. "Sam, Gene, Henry Picard ('38) and Herman
Keiser ('46) are about the only ones left from my era, except
for Hogan ('51 and '53), who doesn't come. But lately Jack
Burke Jr. ('56) and Arnie Palmer ('58, '60, '62 and '64) have
joined us," he smiled.
   "But it's the whole thing -- the event, the people, the
place. This would be the most beautiful park in the world if
they didn't use it for golf. Wouldn't be spring without it."

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- National Bancshares Corp. of Texas
said it has come under pressure from certain creditors to
sweeten the terms of its debt-swap offer, but added that
federal regulators said they would block any changes in the
proposal.
   National Bancshares said the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. threatened to use its newly endowed powers to close the
troubled bank holding company's solvent member banks --
scuttling a pending open-bank recapitalization plan -- if at
least 85% of the company's $25 million in debentures aren't
tendered by the April 26 deadline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Terms call for holders to receive $1,000 face amount of
increasing-rate senior subordinated debentures, due 2006, and
10 common stock warrants, for each $1,000 face amount of its
10% convertible subordinated debentures, due 2006. Creditors
estimate that the proposed swap would give them about 30
cents on the dollar of original debentures.
   Regulators say the swap is crucial to the recapitalization
plan, under which Equimark Corp. of Pittsburgh agreed to
invest or raise about $116 million of new capital for
National Bancshares. The FDIC is expected to contribute about
$255 million to the recapitalization. If the debt swap isn't
completed, the FDIC has said it would attempt to use the
so-called "cross-guarantee" provisions of the 1989 thrift
bailout bill to seize assets belonging to solvent National
Bancshare banks to help defray the costs of rescuing
insolvent subsidiaries. Such a move would likely render the
healthy banks insolvent, too, National Bancshares said.
   Some creditors decried the FDIC's tactics, predicting that
the move would backfire. "They're doing this as a
Gestapo-like threat to bondholders," said Jay Lustig, an
analyst at Drake Capital Securities Inc., Santa Monica,
Calif. He predicted that few bondholders would agree to the
swap unless they receive a better offer.
   But an FDIC official said the agency won't back down.
"It's a free world," he said. "If {creditors} would rather
have bankruptcy, they have that option."

   Cineplex Says
   Profit Is Unlikely
   Until '91 or '92

<LP>
   TORONTO -- Allen Karp, president and chief operating
officer of Cineplex Odeon Corp., said the company expects to
end the year with positive cash flow, "significantly" lower
debt levels and higher revenue.
   But he said shareholders "ought not to look for" profits
until 1991 or 1992, after the company's restructuring is
completed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Karp succeeded Cineplex's founder and former chairman,
Garth Drabinsky, in December after Mr. Drabinsky quit the
company after his failure to launch a takeover bid for the
Toronto-based theater-distribution chain.
   Mr. Karp's current task is to reduce, through asset sales
and other measures, the debt built up by Mr. Drabinsky during
an aggressive expansion in the late 1980s, and return the
company to profitability.
   He said that in the first quarter the company saw a nearly
20% increase in revenue from box office admissions and
concessions from a year earlier.
   "Our {operating} revenues are outstripping both 1989
figures and our budgets," Mr. Karp said. "This will trickle
down to the bottom line."
   Improved relations with major film studios also means
Cineplex won't be shut out of distributing high-grossing
films this year, as happened in 1988 and 1989, he added.
   Although Mr. Karp said he expects to see positive cash
flow by the end of the year, he declined to quantify it,
saying it would be affected by what assets are sold, and when
the sales are concluded.
   Cineplex already has "very attractive offers" for some of
its theater chains, Mr. Karp said, and is negotiating the
possible sale of, among others, theaters in Virgina, Oregon
and Washington state.
   He said he expects Cineplex to receive around seven or
eight times cash flow for the properties. Most analysts say
eight times cash flow is the maximum any buyer is willing to
pay in the current buyer's market.
   Cineplex may report losses on the sale of some of the
chains, but Mr. Karp said he expects "some very large gains
on other sales" to result in a net benefit to the company.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Cineplex closed at $5.50, up 50 cents.
   Asset sales will help to cut Cineplex's debt, which
reached a high of $620 million in the first quarter, to
between $400 and $500 million by year end, he said.
   Mr. Karp said the company is eyeing a number of ways to
refinance its debt load, including the possible sale and
leaseback of some of its theaters. Other options under study
include a joint venture partnership with another company, or
stand-alone financing arrangements for some of the individual
theater chains. He didn't identify any potential partners.
   The key to returning the company to profitability, Mr.
Karp said, is keeping a tight rein on capital spending and
other expenses. Cineplex's capital spending budget will be
limited to $12 million in 1990, he said, although under
agreements with its bankers the company is able to spend up
to $17.5 million refurbishing and building new theaters this
year.
   He said general and administrative expenses are expected
to drop from $35 million in 1989 to less than $22 million
this year.
   Mr. Karp said that in 1991 "we will be reaping the
benefits" of the restructuring efforts and begin showing
profits again.

   Tandem Says Earnings in Latest Period
   Didn't Meet the Company's Expectations

   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Tandem Computers Inc. said that
earnings and revenue for its second quarter ended March 31
were below its expectations.
   The announcement, which surprised analysts, sent the
company's stock plunging in composite trading yesterday on
the New York Stock Exchange. Tandem shares closed at $22.625,
down $4.625.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tandem was the most active stock on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 4.8 million shares changing hands. A Tandem
spokeswoman declined to comment on the drop in stock price.
   The computer maker said that net income in the quarter was
between $16.9 million, or 17 cents a share, and $30.7
million, or 29 cents a share. The company had expected
earnings to be more than the $30.7 million it posted in the
fiscal first quarter.
   In the year-ago period, Tandem posted net income of $16.9
million on revenue of $363.4 million.
   Revenue in the second quarter was between $437 million and
$457 million, the company said, falling below its
expectations. A spokeswoman said Tandem expected revenue to
be above $457 million, but wouldn't say by how much. Analysts
had estimated that revenue would be about $465 million.
   Tandem said some orders it expected to close in the
quarter were deferred. In addition, the company said higher
interest rates in the United Kingdom may have caused
financial institutions there to tighten budgets, and also
blamed the downsizing of the securities market in the U.S.
Tandem makes computers that are widely used by banks, stock
exchanges and others who seek to record transactions at once,
refreshing their central data bases at the same time.
   J. Neil Weintraut, analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist, blamed
the stock plunge on Tandem's overly optimistic outlook,
rather than on changes in its markets, or fundamental
problems at the company. "Tandem has unfortunately
established a record of disappointments for Wall Street," he
said, which may have caused investors to react strongly to
the announcement. He now expects Tandem to earn about 22
cents a share for the second quarter.
   He said Tandem's high-end computer, Cyclone, introduced
last year, and other recent products "are very competitive"
with offerings from International Business Machines Corp. and
Digital Equipment Corp.

   Clean-Air Game:

   John Sununu at least deserves credit for candor. The White
House chief of staff was talking to business lobbyists
assembled for a clean-air pep talk last month, and it wasn't
going well.
   The visitors were bewildered and angry. They'd endorsed
George Bush's original clean-air bill. But now they felt
betrayed by the White House embrace of a Senate "compromise"
far more expensive and regulatory. After a shouting match
with lobbyist William Fay, Mr. Sununu replied that sometimes
you just have "to punt."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The football metaphor perfectly captures the White House
performance on the politics of clean air. Drug czar William
Bennett likes to say that politics, like football, comes down
to "time of possession." If you're not moving the ball on
your opponents, they're moving it on you. Despite all the
self-congratulation, the Bush White House on clean air has
resembled Northwestern containing Notre Dame.
   The official White House line is that this week's Senate
bill is a big victory, of course. Privately, White House
sources will concede that its January veto threat against a
bill costing more than $19 million has been breached, though
they add they had no political choice.
   Even more privately, many White House officials agree that
the business lobbies have a right to be angry. The most
influential environmental skeptics, budget director Richard
Darman and chief economist Michael Boskin, didn't wield much
clout on this one. The administration's greens and White
House process-is-policy aide Roger Porter did the
negotiating.
   Anecdotes suggest the breadth of the clean-air rout:
Though the devil is always in the regulatory details, the
White House left the drafting of its own bill to what Mr.
Sununu would later call "unnamed bureaucrats" at the
Environmental Protection Agency. They obliged with an onerous
regulation on clean-air permits.
   This early blunder led to the ludicrous scene this week of
the White House lobbying the Senate to pass an amendment
repudiating the White House's own proposal. Not surprisingly,
the Senate hanged Mr. Bush with his own rope, 51-49.
   The administration also blinked on a last-minute amendment
that dictates an entirely new gasoline (and, not
coincidentally, a new subsidy for the ethanol industry).
White House officials had once called such an amendment
veto-bait. But after Senate minority leader Bob Dole joined
the cause, the same officials dropped out of sight.
   Oil companies say this gasoline redesign will raise prices
from 15 to 25 cents a gallon, even if the new formula works.
Supporters say the cost is only a penny a gallon. Compromise
and assume it's a mere eight cents a gallon. That's still a
hefty gasoline tax, a direct transfer of wealth from
working-class drivers to Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the
principal maker of ethanol. Clean air has nothing to do with
it.
   These and other stories have eliminated any credibility
from a White House veto threat. Sen. Steve Symms (R., Idaho)
hoped to kill the bill by supporting an expensive amendment
(sponsored by Robert Byrd of West Virginia) to compensate
coal miners thrown out of work. Mr. Sununu called to twist
his arm. He told the senator that even the Byrd amendment
wouldn't prompt a veto -- the opposite of what the
administration was saying in public.
   White House officials say they'll do better in the House,
relying on their alliance with Democratic Rep. John Dingell
of Detroit. But their embrace of the Senate bill has given
Mr. Dingell less latitude. No politician now wants to be less
"green" than the White House, so the greens need to make
fewer concessions. "It's as if they played a game of chess
without thinking they had a second move," says Mr. Fay, the
business lobbyist.
   It may be true, as many in the White House argue, that by
anteing up on clean air, Mr. Bush proves his green
credentials and so can resist green extremists in the future.
Robert Teeter, the White House pollster, has numbers showing
Mr. Bush with low credibility on the environment.
   But Karlyn Keene, who follows public opinion for the
American Enterprise Institute, thinks that misreads the
public mind. A consensus clearly exists on preserving the
environment as an end, but the public is far less clear about
means. Ms. Keene says George Bush has more leverage to
negotiate a better bill than his advisers understand.
   More disappointing for the long run, no one in this
administration has made a case for an alternative
environmentalism -- one that speaks of the ecological
benefits of growth and new technologies, or of the disaster
that befell Eastern Europe from the same sort of
command-and-control economics many environmentalists now
want.
   Instead, Mr. Bush has implicitly embraced the apocalyptic
assumptions of the greens. This week, he was planting a tree
for clean air and decrying "extremists" on all sides -- as if
the owner of a polluting dry-cleaning business is somehow a
radical. His EPA director, William Reilly, raised the specter
of 50,000 "premature deaths" from air pollution, just the
sort of unproved scare statistic used by the greens. The
environmentalists are winning a political grand slam: a bill
that has enormous economic costs but that the public sees
described as too "weak."
   Messrs. Reilly and Bush like to say they favor
environmental "stewardship." It's a good word, a Bush kind of
word, suggesting moderation and a check on democracy's
tendency toward extremism in the name of desirable goals like
clean air. Yet both men have embraced the green movement's
rhetoric. They've flunked the steward's test.

   Worsening

   Newspaper advertising in 1990, never expected to be
robust, is shaping up to be even weaker than 1989's dismal
showing.
   Publishers have been caught by surprise by an ad
environment far weaker than even some pessimists had
predicted. Ad revenue is flat or down at papers across the
country, especially in the Northeast. Retailers have slashed
their ad budgets, classified ads generally are down and many
publishers don't foresee the faintest flicker of a comeback
until the fourth quarter at best. Publishers are puzzled and
depressed as they watch the modest gains that they had hoped
for evaporate into thin air.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It has been just awful," says Valerie Salembier,
president of the New York Post. "What happened to us and our
competitors is the retail market fell out, period. It's that
simple. It's just endless, endless bad news. We're all
suffering, and no one really expected it, not to this
degree," she says.
   John Morton, an analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan, says
newspaper revenue at the 17 companies he follows rose only a
modest 4% in 1989, the first time in recent memory that
revenue didn't keep pace with inflation. The first two months
of this year were even weaker, with flat revenue and
declining ad linage, he says. The first quarter is normally
weak, but rarely this weak. He expects ad revenue for the
year to edge up 4% to 4.5% overall.
   Certainly, ad conditions vary from market to market.
Gannett, for example, says some of its newspapers in the
South and West -- including papers in Fort Myers, Fla.,
Tuscon, Ariz., and Marin County, Calif. -- are in line with
modest expectations of about 5% linage increases. Those in
the Northeast and elsewhere, though, are below projections.
Overall, advertising at Gannett's 82 newspapers is "weaker
than expected," with ad linage flat for the first two months,
says Sheldon Lyons, president of Gannett National Newspaper
Sales.
   Perhaps the major culprit is the retail industry, which
typically accounts for half of all newspaper ads. Just two
days ago, a U.S. bankruptcy-court judge ordered the
liquidation of most Bonwit Teller retail stores. Bonwit's
sister chain, B. Altman &amp; Co., is already out of business
following the bankruptcy-law filing last year of the two
chains' parent, L.J. Hooker Corp. Campeau Corp.'s U.S.
operations, including Bloomingdale's and Rich's, filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.
   New York newspapers have taken a double hit because of the
demise of some smaller but important retailers, like the
Crazy Eddie electronics chain. All in all, retailers are
spending far less than they, or the newspapers, had expected,
industry executives say. Says Ms. Salembier, "Every major
retailer has cut their budgets. No one is healthy right now."
   The problem is compounded in some places, including Boston
and New York, by softness in classified ads -- especially in
help-wanted advertising. At the Boston Globe,
lower-than-expected ad revenue is due almost entirely to
falling classified advertising. For the first nine weeks of
the year, classified volume was off 12%, while retail
advertising was off just 2%, says Art Kingsbury, executive
vice president of Affiliated Publications, which publishes
the Boston Globe.
   "The Massachusetts Miracle is over, and has been over,"
Mr. Kingsbury says. Classified advertising had been off in
1989, but "we hoped it would level off {this year}," he says.
"It hasn't."
   Since help-wanted advertising is often used to gauge the
economy's health, industry analysts say the softness
forebodes uneasy times ahead. "The question is, despite what
all the indicators {coming out of Washington} say, have we
already slipped into a recession? Certainly, the media
business is having one," says Mr. Morton, the Lynch Jones
analyst.
   The paltry showing of retail and classified ads is partly
countered at some papers, including the New York Post, by an
increase in national advertising, like auto and packaged
goods ads. But national advertising is also down in many
areas. Landon Associates Inc., a newspaper sales firm that
represents 630 local papers nationwide, says national
advertising is running 4% to 5% below what it had budgeted
for last fall. Help-wanted advertising is also weak in a
number of areas.
   The poor advertising environment overall is taking its
toll on the major newspaper chains. Just last week, Times
Mirror reported that for the first nine weeks, ad revenue
fell 2.8%. While its flagship Los Angeles Times reported
gains, the chain was badly hurt by double-digit declines in
ad volume at its Newsday, Baltimore Sun, and Southern
Connecticut Newspapers -- all of which performed "well below
our earlier expectations," says Robert F. Erburu, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   Newspaper publishers see little sign of relief until the
country's skittish economy makes a comeback. "When business
contracts, advertising is the easiest thing to hold back on,"
says Robert Keim, Landon's executive vice president and
director of sales. "Most advertisers look upon advertising as
an expense and not an investment, which is a terrible
mistake. Advertising generally produces results -- but their
focus is, `Well, I'll cut back right now and wait and see
what happens.'"

   Billings weren't disclosed. The Seagram Co. unit said it

   Seagram put the account up for review in January, and
asked Ogilvy; DDB Needham, an Omnicom Group unit; and Wells
Rich to pitch the account. All handle other Seagram business.
   An executive familiar with the situation said Seagram

   Emerge Names Time Warner Executive
   To Lead New Black-Oriented Magazine

   Emerge Magazine, a recent startup aimed at upscale black
readers, named Time Warner Inc. executive Donald Anderson as
publisher and chief executive officer.
   Robert L. Johnson, chairman of Emerge Inc., said he sought
Mr. Anderson to strengthen the marketing and advertising
sales effort of the magazine, a newsmonthly with analysis of
issues from a black perspective.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Johnson said he was pleased with initial advertising
support for the six-month-old magazine and its unaudited paid
circulation figure of 150,000. But he said Emerge doesn't
stand out sufficiently from the handful of national black
magazines including Ebony, Essence and Black Enterprise. "The
thing it has not done to distinguish itself is to give the
reader a sense of being on top of issues that impact black
America and providing some learned analysis -- that's what's
missing in our {black} publications," Mr. Johnson said.
   Washington communications lawyer Tyrone Brown had been
serving as publisher on a caretaker basis, Mr. Johnson said.
He added that he hopes the magazine will break even in three
years.
   Mr. Anderson, a 16-year veteran of Time Warner's Home Box
Office unit, has been quietly instrumental in linking the
media giant with black-communications ventures. In 1985, he
helped convince HBO to take a stake in Mr. Johnson's then
ailing Black Entertainment Television (BET) cable service and
spent four years overseeing BET's sales and marketing. BET's
subscriber base rose from seven million to 23 million in the
period. Mr. Anderson was also a mentor to Wilmer Ames, a
former Time magazine researcher who sought backing to start
Emerge in 1988.
   While Mr. Anderson's positions with Emerge were called
permanent, and he was elected to the board, Time Warner will
pay his salary and he will remain officially part of Time
Warner's staff.
   "He's a long-termer here and he's done a lot of good
things here," said Christopher Meigher III, executive vice
president of the Time magazine group, of the unusual
arrangement. BET is Emerge's largest holder with 35%; Time
Warner holds about 17%.
   "The upscale black community is excited about us. But we
have to speak more clearly to the advertising community," Mr.
Anderson said. "We have to clearly demonstrate that our
editorial delivers the demographic that's not currently being
served by other black publications. To do that we must live
up to our mission to be a news monthly."
   Audrey Edwards, executive editor of Black Enterprise
Magazine, said she welcomed Emerge in the ranks of competing
black magazines because fewer than 10 of the 1,275 national
consumer magazines are black-oriented. Nevertheless, Ms.
Edwards, formerly an editor with Ms. and Essence magazines,
said it can be difficult for a monthly magazine to handle
news on a timely basis.

   Insurance Offered
   By London Firm
   In Takeover Fights

   LONDON -- For corporations, being the object of a takeover
war is economically similar to being hit by a hurricane or a
flood. So it isn't surprising that the insurance industry has
hatched a new policy that companies can buy for protection
against this modern catastrophe.
   TOI Corporate Services, a newly formed firm, is pushing
the new takeover insurance in collaboration with Robert
Fraser Group, a brokerage concern here. According to Sandra
Ringsell, one of TOI's founders, "we're the first to market"
takeover insurance, though others have sold it here and there
on a makeshift basis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A sales brochure TOI is circulating highlights the
dizzying costs of being raided: for a company valued at more
than #30 million ($49.2 million), it can cost about #500,000
to fend off an unwanted suitor, according to TOI.
   Merchant bankers lay claim on the biggest chunk of these
costs, with about #320,000. Lawyers and stockbrokers grab
another #110,000. Public-relations people speak for another
#5,000, while accountants claim #35,000.
   Then there's all the extra time that executives at raided
companies have to put in. That can be insured too. For
coverage of #500,000 of takeover expenses, an insurance
policy costs as much as #25,000 a year. The premium doesn't
count as a takeover expense, however.
   Ms. Ringsell says she has pieced together
takeover-insurance policies through various underwriters for
about 35 companies. Now that TOI has been formed to
specialize in raider policies, she figures she will bring in
about 400 more.
   Although takeovers have slowed in the U.S. with the
collapse of the junk-bond market, TOI warns companies in
Europe that they aren't out of the woods yet. "Takeovers are
likely to increase," the company said in sales literature,
partly because "companies will be seeking to be better
positioned in their respective markets ahead of 1992."
   So far, Ms. Ringsell said, only one policyholder has filed
a claim. Everything went smoothly: The company got reimbursed
for the costs of repulsing the raider, and it came back to
renew its policy for another year.

   WORCESTER, Mass. -- BankWorcester Corp., citing a
"dramatically weakened" real-estate market, said it will add
$11.9 million to its allowance for possible loan losses,
resulting in a loss for the first quarter -- and possibly
jeopardizing its agreement to be acquired by a Rhode
Island-based subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.
   In the year-earlier first quarter, BankWorcester had net
income of $2.8 million, or 38 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said it has charged off about $9.1 million of
loans, and said that after the provisions and charge-offs,
the loan-loss allowance will be about $14.4 million, or 1.5%
of loans outstanding. It said nonperforming assets total
about $44.5 million.
   As reported, BankWorcester has agreed to be acquired by
Royal Bank's Citizens Financial Group Inc. unit for $22.50 a
share, or about $149 million.
   One condition of the acquisition agreement, however,
provides that Citizens can terminate the agreement if
nonperforming assets and other items exceed $50 million after
all regulatory approvals for the acquisition have been
received. As of March 31, BankWorcester said, the level of
nonperforming assets and other items covered by the condition
totaled $58.6 million.
   BankWorcester said that the total is expected to fluctuate
over time and noted that the $50 million benchmark comes into
effect after receipt of all regulatory approvals.
   The company said, "The management of BankWorcester
believes that it will be able to meet this condition at that
point in time; however, there can be no assurance that this
condition will in fact be satisfied at that future time."

   PHILADELPHIA -- A federal appeals court ruled that
Canada's Belzberg family, which owns about 10.68% of
Armstrong World Industries Inc., can directly contact
shareholders regarding proposed amendments to the company's
charter.
   The ruling modified a lower court order last month. A
judge had ruled that the Belzberg family couldn't directly
contact Armstrong shareholders regarding the amendments,
which would revoke certain anti-takeover provisions in
Armstrong's bylaws.

   The Belzbergs are planning a proxy fight to elect four

   The Belzbergs have said they may seek to acquire the

   Bush, Gorbachev Agree on Summit Date;
   U.S. Makes Concession on Gatt Talks

   WASHINGTON -- Despite rising tensions over Lithuania,
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev agreed
to hold their second summit meeting May 30-June 3 in the U.S.
   In addition, the Bush administration has quietly made an
economic concession to Mr. Gorbachev. U.S. diplomats in
Geneva agreed to admit the Soviet Union immediately to
observer status in world trade negotiations, rather than
delaying its entry until next year, as Mr. Bush had
originally pledged to do.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The unannounced trade decision and the agreement on a
summit date, announced in the midst of a visit here by Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, formed part of a
pattern of mixed signals the Bush administration sent this
week about the status of U.S.-Soviet relations. While the
administration appeared to ratchet up its private rhetoric on
Lithuania, the warming trend in relations continued
unaffected.
   Administration officials, speaking anonymously, have put
out the word that Secretary of State James Baker turned up
the heat about Lithuania at a private State Department
meeting Wednesday. They say he warned that further armed
intimidation against Lithuania's independence drive could
severely disrupt U.S.-Soviet relations, even if Moscow
stopped short of mass violence. The officials add that
President Bush will make the same point when he meets the
foreign minister this morning.
   But Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker, who strongly favor holding the
summit and signing pending arms pacts with Moscow, have sent
a far more positive signal to Moscow with their actions. They
have kept the U.S.-Soviet dialogue rolling smoothly. In
addition to setting a summit date, the U.S. has pressed ahead
full steam during the Shevardnadze visit with efforts to
resolve key arms-control disputes by the summit date.
   "Gorbachev's watching what they're doing, not what they're
saying. And everything they're doing, in my view, is
encouraging Gorbachev to feel that he can do in Lithuania and
elsewhere what he feels he needs to do, at no cost. It is
reminiscent of the Bush approach to China," said Frank
Gaffney, a former Pentagon official who heads the
conservative Center for Security Policy.
   At last December's Malta summit, Mr. Bush said the U.S.
would withdraw its historic objection to Soviet participation
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade once the
current round of trade negotiations, called the Uruguay
Round, is over at year end. But a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills said the U.S., after consulting
with its trading partners, decided there was no point in
making Moscow wait.
   White House officials said Mr. Baker warned Mr.
Shevardnadze that the administration couldn't maintain its
public restraint on the issue of Lithuania if Moscow kept
using troops and tanks to try to force the Baltic state to
drop its drive for independence.
   But the secretary of state also exhorted U.S. and Soviet
negotiators to redouble their efforts to settle key nuclear,
conventional and chemical arms-control issues in the seven
weeks remaining before the summit. The date is about a month
earlier than expected, apparently because Mr. Gorbachev has a
critical Communist Party Congress in July for which he must
prepare.

   MILFORD, Mass. -- Home National Corp. said regulators may
appoint a receiver for its principal unit, Home National Bank
of Milford. The move is possible because it is "very
doubtful" the unit can raise $8 million to pad its $22.1
million loan loss reserves, as advised by regulators after an
examination of the bank.
   The company warned that failure to raise capital could
cause the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulatory
authorities to "take such action as they consider
appropriate, including the possible appointment of a receiver
for the institution."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Home National also said it expects to report operating
losses for the first quarter. In the year-ago period, the
bank holding company had a loss of $3 million, or 47 cents a
share.
   The operating losses and the increase in the loan loss
reserves will result in a deficit of shareholder equity of
not less than $6 million, the company said.
   In addition, Home National said it may restate its 1989
year-end results, which were already revised last month to
show a loss of $26.6 million, or $4.18 a share, compared with
profit of $4.1 million, or 62 cents a share, in 1988.
   Home National Corp. had assets of $484.5 million at Dec.

   Sex and Self-Deception: A Murderer's Life
   ----
   By Bruce Bawer
</HL>
<DATE>
04/06/90
</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A17
</SO>
<LP>
   Though he has been hailed by critics as one of Ireland's
major living novelists, and though this year marks the 20th
anniversary of his first book, John Banville has remained
unfamiliar to American readers. Why? Perhaps it's his
penchant for ambiguity and equivocation; or perhaps it's his
devotion to such unsexy subjects as the astronomers
Copernicus and Kepler.
   All this may change, however, with the stateside
publication of "The Book of Evidence" (Scribners, 220 pages,
$17.95). The winner of last year's Booker Prize, Mr.
Banville's beautifully composed and impeccably shaped seventh
novel takes the form of a recit by a 38-year-old scientist
named Frederick Charles St. John Vanderveld (Freddie)
Montgomery, who is being held in an Irish prison for murder.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Freddie doesn't deny his guilt. But he is eager to tell
the story behind the crime. This he does, shuttling between a
chronicle of recent events and a discontinuous account of his
earlier life: his privileged Irish childhood, his stint on a
California faculty, and -- following his marriage to one
Daphne, whose "moral laziness" strikes in him a responsive
chord -- his abandonment of science and academia for the
indolent life of a Mediterranean gadabout.
   And what a life] For more than a decade, the Montgomerys
drift from one island to another, tarrying at harborside bars
and regarding the world with "grand detachment" and a false
sense of their own inviolability. It is this false sense of
inviolability, in fact, that precipitates Freddie's downfall.
For, simply in order to amuse himself, he blackmails a
small-time drug dealer for a large sum of money. Freddie
spends the money, only to learn afterward that it came from a
local big wheel who expects repayment and is threatening the
lives of his wife and son. Unable to repay, Freddie hies
himself to Ireland to liquidate his late father's art
collection.
   When he arrives at the family manse, however, Freddie
discovers that his mother has sold the collection to Binkie
Behrens, the rich father of his old flame Anna, and has
squandered the money on horses. In desperation, Freddie
steals a 17th-century Dutch portrait (possibly a Rembrandt)
from the Behrens mansion and kills a family maid.
   What makes him commit such a senseless crime? What, for
that matter, makes him live such a senseless life? Freddie
argues that it's not really his fault, for there's no free
will (he acted, he says, "almost without thinking from the
start"), and therefore perhaps there's no such thing as moral
culpability. "There is just the ceaseless, slow, demented
drift of things," he says.
   An equally important factor, though, is Freddie's
self-image. He always has had a sense of himself as "exposed
and invisible . . . (as) something without weight, without
moorings, a floating phantom"; after the murder, he looks
forward to being "unmasked" because only this, he thinks,
will give him "weight, gravity, the sense at last of being
firmly grounded. Then finally I would be me, no longer that
poor impersonation of myself I had been doing all my life. I
would be real. I would be, of all things, human."
   Freddie claims that incarceration provides "time and
leisure really to get to the heart of things." But Mr.
Banville wants us to realize that Freddie never does get to
the heart of things -- that there are matters about which
Freddie (who continually teases us with his power, as
narrator, to revise reality) is deceiving not only us but
himself.
   He is coy, to be specific, about carnal matters. Freddie
inhabits a world of erotic secrets and is surrounded by
ambiguous sexuality. Daphne, we learn, was once involved with
Anna Behrens; Freddie's mother is involved with a stable
girl. And Freddie? In Ireland he haunts a gay bar called
Wally's, and after the murder holes up with a reputed
homosexual; in prison, he expresses a desire for a
"catamite," a wish that seems to be granted by novel's end.
He is always describing men's hands. Yet he claims to find
homosexuality repugnant and insists, "I am not queer."
   Like Ford Madox Ford's "The Good Soldier," then, "The Book
of Evidence" is a cannily constructed novel about sex,
betrayal and self-deception, a novel whose narrator's
testimony is egregiously unreliable and laced with internal
contradictions. Mr. Banville's book also recalls other,
mostly French, novels, among them Andre Gide's "The
Immoralist" (which, like Mr. Banville's book, depicts the
consequences of sexual repression) and Albert Camus's "The
Stranger" (which concerns a senseless murder).
   Yet "The Book of Evidence" does not feel at all
derivative. On the contrary, one comes away from it awed by
the freshness of its descriptions and imagery and by the
vigor and exactness of its diction. Of particular interest is
Mr. Banville's attention to subtleties of light and shadow, a
trait that reminds one less of any other writer than of the
Dutch painters. One could do worse, indeed, than to describe
"The Book of Evidence" as a literary version of a Rembrandt
portrait; for it is, above all, a character study -- dark,
enigmatic and intensely captivating.

   Conditions That Cut

   WESTLAKE, Ohio -- Nordson Corp. said conditions that
reduced profit in the first quarter ended Jan. 28 are
continuing in the second quarter.
   William P. Madar, president and chief executive officer,
said weaker demand for Nordson's core products, greater sales
of new products that carry lower profit margins and the
effects of the stronger U.S. dollar continue to affect
earnings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nordson, which produces equipment to apply adhesives and
coatings, declined to make a specific earnings forecast for
the quarter ending this month.
   In the 1990 first quarter, net income fell 17% to $6.7
million, or 70 cents a share, from $8.1 million, or 84 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 19% to $77.5 million
from $65 million.
   For the second quarter of fiscal 1989, Nordson earned $9.7
million, or 99 cents a share, on sales of $73.5 million. More
than half of the company's sales are overseas, but production
is mainly in the U.S.; that makes the company vulnerable when
the value of the dollar rises against foreign currencies. The
dollar has risen sharply against the yen this year, and
Nordson does a sizable business in Japan.

   NEW YORK -- The Conference Board, reporting that
help-wanted ad volume continued to fall in February, said
that it may begin to stabilize over the next few months.
   The Help-Wanted Advertising Index, a seasonally adjusted
indicator of hiring plans, fell six points from January's 147
and eight points from 149 in December. The index was 14
points lower than in February 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Labor demand was measurably lower in February 1990 from a
year ago because of the slower pace of economic activity over
the past 12 months, said Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board
economist. "However, economic growth is not expected to erode
from its present level," he said, "suggesting that recent
declines in help-wanted advertising are unlikely to
accelerate."
   Ad volume, measured in 51 major U.S. newspapers, rose in
three of nine regions. Leading was the West North Central
region with a 6.8% increase. The East South Central and West
South Central regions showed increases of 1.7% and 1.5%,
respectively. Declines ranged from 6.9% in the East North
Central region to 3.9% in the Pacific region.

   WEST CHESTER, Pa. -- QVC Network Inc. said it expects to
report a loss of about $10 million, or about 59 cents a
share, for the first quarter ending April 30. The company
said the loss reflects the costs of absorbing CVN Cos.,
acquired last fall.
   A year earlier, the video-shopping concern posted net
income of $1.2 million, or eight cents a share. Last month,
QVC suspended its quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   QVC also said its agreement to sell its C.O.M.B.
mail-order business to Damark International Inc. was
terminated because conditions of closing weren't satisfied,
specifically with regard to financing the transaction.
   QVC said it also expects a loss in the second quarter but
is "confident" it will return to profitability in the third
quarter. The company added that it hopes to earn $7 million
for the year ending Jan. 31, 1991, compared with $6.3 million
the previous year.
   QVC said it is reopening the bidding for the customer
lists, goodwill, and other intangible assets of C.O.M.B. The
mail-order business has only $4 million in inventory, and QVC
said the final disposition of C.O.M.B. will have no material
effect on QVC's financial reports. QVC acquired C.O.M.B. last
fall as part of its purchase of CVN. In February, QVC agreed
to sell C.O.M.B. to Damark contingent on financing and
government approval.

   Avon Suggests Chartwell
   Not Buy Additional Shares

   NEW YORK -- In an unusual move, Avon Products Inc.'s board
suggested that its largest shareholder not acquire additional
shares in the company.
   In a letter to Richard Fisher, a leading participant in
Chartwell Associates L.P., Avon Chairman James Preston wrote,
"Our board views Chartwell's additional purchases of Avon
stock as inappropriate." Chartwell owns about 16% of Avon's
common, or 12% of voting stock including preferred. On
Wednesday, Chartwell bought three million shares of Avon
common.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Preston said Avon's board believes additional
Chartwell purchases will unfairly influence Avon's desire to
"maximize shareholder value." He also expressed concern that
more purchases will be unfair to other holders and harm
Avon's door-to-door business.
   To underline its point, the board amended Avon's share
rights plan. Share rights are attached to each share of
common, and in Avon's case allow shareholders to acquire Avon
stock at half price if any buyer passes a 20% common stock
threshold.
   Now, the board has decided that if anybody acquires more
than 12.5% of Avon's voting shares, the board will have only
10 days to redeem the share rights for that particular buyer.
After that, the poison pill will automatically kick in at the
20% benchmark.
   "What we're telling Chartwell is don't try to buy the
company on the cheap," said an executive familiar with Avon's
strategy.
   A Chartwell spokesman said, "We are disappointed by Avon's
unilateral change in its rights plan. We haven't read the
full amendment, but we are considering all of our options."

   Kerry Packer, an international investor and media magnate,
remains Australia's richest person, with assets valued at
$1.8 billion Australian dollars (US$1.38 billion), according
to an annual list published by Australia's Business Review
Weekly. Robert Holmes a Court placed second, with A$800
million.
   The magazine's ranking of the country's 200 richest
persons dropped 27 from last year's list, following a spate
of corporate disasters over the past year. Among those
omitted this year were Alan Bond of Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.
and Christopher Skase of Qintex Australia Ltd.
   For the first time in the eight-year history of the
ranking, the threshold for entry was lowered, reflecting the
declining fortunes of Australia's rich. Individuals and
families needed an estimated minimum net worth of A$30
million to reach the list, down from A$35 million in 1989.
   The Smorgons, with assets valued at A$1 billion, replaced
the family of Rupert Murdoch, with A$870 million, as
Australia's richest family.
                                                                                                       

   REVIEWING THE BHOPAL SETTLEMENT
                                                                                                       

   India's Supreme Court began a review of last year's $470
million settlement between the government and Union Carbide
Corp. for the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster. A five-judge panel
will hear arguments until at least April 10, after which it
will decide whether to overturn the deal or accept it.
Yesterday, a lawyer for the Bhopal Women Gas Victims
Organization argued that counsel for the government of
previous Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi "had no authority to
enter into a settlement." Union Carbide says the settlement
is fair and binding.

   PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S OFFER
                                                                                                       

   Papua New Guinea has offered to place a two-year
moratorium on new logging to save its rain forests in return
for millions of dollars in aid projects. Minister of Forests
Karl Stack said: "We're challenging the international
community to stop pontificating. We've told them, `You do the
right thing and we'll do the right thing.'" A spokesman for
Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said
Australia "stands ready to support the moratorium. It's just
a question of how much." The moratorium, which will start in
July, would mean a loss equivalent to about $73 million in
potential earnings, Mr. Stack said.
                                                                                                       

   A VISIT TO NAMIBIA
                                                                                                       

   The United Nations Council for Namibia, set up in 1967 to
administer the territory but never allowed to set foot there,
will finally visit Namibia, three weeks after it attained
independence. The 31-member council will convene in Windhoek,
the capital, from April 9 to 11. South Africa, which ruled
Namibia for 75 years, refused to cooperate with the council
and prevented it from establishing its authority in the

recommending that the council be disbanded.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA'S SLUMPING AUTO INDUSTRY
                                                                                                       

   The Chinese government pledged to bail out its auto
industry, now struggling with plunging sales and rising
stockpiles, the official China Daily said. The paper said
auto makers produced 54,500 vehicles in the first two months
of the year but sold only 44,390, down 35% from the same
period in 1989. The daily said the government has allotted
$80.9 million in credit to help stimulate the auto market.
The market has collapsed under a 20-month-long austerity
drive that has limited purchases by government institutions,
the industry's main customers.
                                                                                                       

   `YEAR OF THE CATASTROPHES'
                                                                                                       

   Zurich's Swiss Reinsurance Co., calling 1989 the "year of
the catastrophes," estimates in a new study that various
disasters around the world caused insured damage of at least
$13.3 billion last year.
   Saying this amount was "unprecedented," the study said
that 292 disasters last year killed 15,000 people. The 1989
insured-damage total was more than double the amount recorded
for 1988.
   Four of the costliest calamities occurred in the U.S.
Hurricane Hugo led the U.S. disaster list, causing $4.31
billion in insured damage, followed by an explosion at a
petrochemical plant in Pasadena, Texas, costing $1.3 billion.
The San Francisco earthquake cost at least $1 billion in
insured damage, and the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill at
least $425 million in insured losses, the study said.
   This year, nature has struck hard in Europe. Several
storms that occurred in the first quarter caused "immense
property damage, provisionally estimated to be at least $8.80
billion," the study said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The Belgian parliament voted to restore King Baudouin to
his throne, less than two days after he stepped down to avoid
signing a bill that legalized abortion. . . . South Korea and
China agreed to begin jointly operating car-ferry services
between the two countries before the Asian Games in Beijing
in September.

   Tokyo stocks managed to avoid another plunge, helped by a
strong rebound in the last hour.
   The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 193.88 points to
finish at 28249.06. The index lost 316.78 points Wednesday.
In trading Friday, the index rebounded to rise 899.11 points,
or 3.2%, in the morning session to 29148.17.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In London, meanwhile, stocks Thursday finished a
lackluster session firmer and at intraday peaks, with little
motivation to pilot the market.
   The Nikkei index plunged 1200 points midday because of a
fast-paced sell-off spawned by growing concern about reported
financial troubles of speculative groups.
   Individual investors dumped their holdings beginning in
the morning, regardless of whether or not the shares were
related to speculative groups, traders said.
   Lack of confidence in the market and fear that further
price drops would increase the burden of additional deposit
for margin buying hastened selling by individuals, analysts
said.
   Fully stifled buying activity in the morning left a number
of shares unpriced.
   However, after rounds of sell-offs were complete, stock
prices gradually turned upward, helped by a return of buying
activity led by the Big Four Japanese brokerage houses,
participants said.
   Some stocks, which are believed to be held by speculator
groups and which have been falling sharply in the past week,
were pushed up by such dealer buying, which appeared to be an
effort to support the market, said a trader at Jardine
Fleming (Securities).
   The Nikkei increased its upward pace as institutional
investors and investment trust funds started to hunt for
bargains among high-tech and pharmaceutical shares, as well
as among some large-capital shares, traders said.
   Also, index-linked buying helped push up the Nikkei later
in the afternoon session, traders said.
   They said that since the Nikkei fell sharply in the
morning due to a lack of buy orders, a small amount of buying
was able to push up the index.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 580 million
shares, down slightly from 596 million shares Wednesday.
Losers outnumbered gainers 648 to 185, while 44 issues were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 35.15 points Wednesday, was down
17.14 points, or 0.83%, to finish at 2058.82.
   The impact of the sell-off by individual investors hit the
second section severely, reflecting that the stocks in the
section are largely held by individual investors. The second
section index, which fell 95.45 points Wednesday, plunged
176.70 points, or 5.06%, to 3313.92. Volume was estimated at
eight million shares, down from 11 million shares.
   Rumors that speculative groups are having financial
difficulties because of the continuous decline of stock
prices this year have been whispered now and then among
participants in the past month, traders said.
   Wednesday, rumors that the groups' financial conditions
might be worsening to levels that would force them to
drastically reduce their holdings spawned a sell-off of
speculative shares.
   And then yesterday, investor uncertainty was fueled by a
local newspaper's report that about 30 small-sized and
midsized securities companies suffered defaults on payments
for stock purchases by one of the speculative groups,
totaling 30 billion yen ($188.8 million).
   All sorts of rumors swept through the market in the
morning, including that these securities firms are being
rocked and that a branch manager of a securities company
committed suicide.
   During the lunch break, the Tokyo Stock Exchange denied
such rumors, calling them "totally unfounded" and urged
investors not to be carried away by them.
   In trading yesterday, Honshu Paper ended at a bid of 1420
yen, up 160 yen. Nippon Beet Sugar gained 100 yen to 790 yen.
   Sankyo closed at 2430 yen, up 160 yen.
   Ono Pharmaceutical was up 210 yen to 4850 yen.
   Large-capital shares fared well. Nippon Steel was up 30
yen to 540 yen. Sumitomo Metal was up 22 yen at 520 yen.
Toshiba gained 60 yen to 1090 yen, while Hitachi finished at
1650 yen, up 70 yen.
   In London, dealers said today marks the end of a difficult
two-week trading account. Investors were content to close out
positions and wait until the next account opens, the dealers
said.
   Some traders said investors were still digesting the
ramifications of Tokyo's gyrations, with whispers that should
some large Japanese investors find themselves short of cash,
they might have to liquidate British equity positions to meet
margin calls.
   Investors "haven't got a clear picture of what's happening
in Tokyo so they're saying they'd rather not risk the money,"
said one chief dealer. "Also, we seem to be in quite a tight
range where we're running into buyers at 2222 {on the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index} but above
that, there's nothing there."
   At the close, the FT-SE 100 share index was up 7.9 points
at 2239.5, its intraday best level and well above its
midmorning minimum of 2222. Some market watchers contended
that the index's early 10-point drop and subsequent
eight-point gain underscore the market's dearth of direction.
   The Financial Times 30 share index gained 6.6 points at
1756.3. Volume was a moderate 499.5 million shares, compared
with 505.4 million shares Wednesday.
   There was little corporate news to enliven the market. In
fact, the next major company results aren't expected until
well into next week. Of these, food retailer Tesco added 3.5
pence to 198 pence (6 cents to $3.25) ahead of Wednesday's
full-year earnings results. British Aerospace surged 18 pence
to 528 pence on news that its Rover Group unit saw its sales
rise 33% to 31,963 from 23,989 in February and 7.2% from
29,809 a year earlier. Rover's market share edged to 15% from
14% in February and 14% a year ago.
   Sun Alliance, a British composite insurer, firmed 8.5
pence to 312 pence following Wednesday's earnings
announcement. The shares are still being supported by the 22%
increase in its full-year dividend, giving investors a good
value-for-money argument.
   Elsewhere in Europe, prices closed higher in Paris,
Zurich, Madrid and Milan, lower in Frankfurt, Oslo and
Helsinki, mixed in Stockholm and Amsterdam. South African
gold stocks closed lower.
   Meanwhile, prices closed lower in Sydney, Wellington,
Manila and Singapore. Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul were
closed.

   BURBANK, Calif. -- Dawn Steele, who resigned as president
of Columbia Pictures earlier this year, has landed at Walt
Disney Co., which said she will produce movies and television
shows and develop other projects.
   Ms. Steele, in her early 40s, had been rumored for several
months to be leaning toward a relationship with Disney that
might include the establishment of combination day-care and
family-entertainment centers.

   "She wants to do a lot of things in her life; this is a
place where she can fulfill any dreams she has," said David
Hoberman, president of Touchstone Pictures, part of Disney's
Walt Disney Studios unit. There haven't been any discussions
about specific films or other projects, he said.
   Ms. Steel's "exclusive" arrangement with Disney includes
TV production, which she hasn't done before, Mr. Hoberman
said. She left Columbia last fall after the company was
purchased by Sony Corp. Ms. Steele was the second woman after
Sherry Lansing, who oversaw what was then Twentieth
Century-Fox Film Corp.'s movie division, to head a Hollywood
studio.

   Crude-Oil Prices Register Sharp Drop
   On Worries of Possible Glut in Supply

   Petroleum prices fell sharply on worries of a possible
supply glut.
   Prices of European and Middle East crude oils dropped as
much as 25 cents a barrel -- some falling for the second
straight day. In the U.S., futures prices of crude oil
plunged as much as 45 cents a barrel while refiners rushed to
reduce field postings by 50 cents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The problem is a buildup in excess supply," said Philip
Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute for
International Economics and an authority on oil-price
behavior. "OPEC is not cutting production enough," he added.
   Oil prices had been expected to soften some in the second
quarter, which is traditionally a sluggish demand period. But
this week's declines are earlier -- and far larger -- than
had been expected.
   The declines began Wednesday in the wake of a Wall Street
Journal article on a rise in production by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and after industry reports
that crude oil inventories in the U.S. are expanding faster
than anticipated. OPEC production now is at the highest level
in eight years, and U.S. crude oil inventories are the
largest in at least two years.
   Most oil prices now are below those of a year ago when
they were rising because of fallout from the Alaskan oil
spill and from North Sea production mishaps. Prices of a few
crudes still are near $20 a barrel, but most are below that
psychologically important level.
   In European spot markets yesterday, North Sea Brent for
May delivery was down 20 cents a barrel to $18.10, according
to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report. In U.S.
futures trading, the May contract for West Texas
Intermediate, or WTI, fell 35 cents to settle at $19.43 a
barrel. And new field postings for this U.S. benchmark crude
generally are $18.75 a barrel.
   "As it cracks $20, WTI is the last indicator {among the
world's benchmark crudes} to reflect global fundamentals,"
said William H. Brown III, international oil analyst at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Until now, Mr. Brown and other analysts added, WTI has
continued to hold relatively firm -- even as prices of other
crudes eroded -- because it is a light "sweet" crude that is
low in sulfur content. These crudes are best for yielding
preferred fuels such as gasoline.
   Most of the pricing pressure has been on the "sour" crudes
-- those that are high in sulfur and often are very dense
such as the heavy crudes of the Middle East. With Kuwait and
some other Middle East members of OPEC producing beyond their
quotas, the heavy and high-sulfur crudes have been pouring
into the market. Some countries such as Iraq, Iran and Saudi
Arabia are understood to be offering steep discounts to some
customers to maintain their market shares.
   "The big overhang {in inventories} is in the sour crudes,"
said Marshall Thomas, editor in chief of the Oil Daily.
   Despite the surplus of sour crudes, West Texas
Intermediate and other light crudes still would have held
firm in price if the gasoline market had remained as strong
as expected, analysts said. But there suddenly are signs of
new weakness in the gasoline market.
   As a result, prices of gasoline are coming down, at least
at the wholesale level. The futures price of unleaded
gasoline for May delivery fell 1.57 cents a gallon on the New
York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, settling at 63.29 cents.
The June contract fell 1.71 cents to 62.16 cents.
   "We are looking for a decline in gasoline demand this
year," said Mr. Brown of Kidder Peabody.

   Cheney Urges Cut
   In Congress Control
   On Defense Budget

   WASHINGTON -- In the face of spreading opposition to his
budget, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney counterattacked by
calling for sharply reduced congressional control over the
details of Pentagon spending.
   The sweeping proposals by Mr. Cheney take aim at some of
the most cherished prerogatives of lawmakers, including
annual authorization of big-ticket weapons purchases and
line-item review of the entire Pentagon budget. The package
also contains specific legislative proposals to make it
easier for the Pentagon to encourage or force thousands of
officers out of active service as military spending shrinks
in the next few years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many of the radical ideas, especially at a time of
escalating bipartisan criticism of Mr. Cheney, are almost
certain to languish in Congress.
   But by focusing attention on lawmakers' own shortcomings
and parochial concerns in shaping the defense budget, Mr.
Cheney apparently hopes to build public support for the Bush
administration's beleaguered spending blueprint.
   Urging Congress to concentrate on "broad missions rather
than on individual items of hardware," Mr. Cheney told
reporters that the current system often leads to continual
battles over which congressional districts benefit from
weapons contracts. "If next year's budget debate is only a
few days away from the end of this year's debate," he said,
lawmakers have "no reason to accept a negative decision as
final."
   Barely two hours earlier, however, two of Mr. Cheney's
former allies in the GOP deserted his budget proposal. Sens.
John McCain of Arizona and William Cohen of Maine, both
important swing votes on the Armed Services Committee, called
for defense cuts about twice as large as those proposed by
the White House through 1995.
   Mr. Cheney's most controversial proposals, if enacted,
would fundamentally change the relationship between the
military and the defense industry. One section of his
proposed legislation, for instance, envisions a major
curtailing of on-site government monitoring at selected major
weapons plants.
   Instead of "assuming there is a dishonest atmosphere out
there," Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood said, the
Pentagon wants to test the concept of "reducing the degree of
inspections and audits that we put on these contractors."
Pentagon critics, including members of the House leadership,
are almost certain to keep such proposals from reaching the
floor.
   Mr. Cheney, who repeatedly said his proposals weren't
intended to set up confrontations with lawmakers, tried in
other ways to placate Congress. He confirmed that the Navy's
Seawolf nuclear attack submarines and Arleigh Burke-class
destroyers, which carry a total price tag of about $40
billion, have been included in a previously reported review
of the Pentagon's most expensive high-technology weapons.

   Down With Shuttlecocks

   New York Have you ever wondered why they called it
badminton instead of goodminton?
   Well so have we, ever since that fateful Saturday a few
weeks back when our local YMCA gym -- a dim, dank and dingy
58-year-old temple to basketball in the heart of Manhattan --
was abruptly seized by apparatchiks from the front office who
declared that henceforth, noon to 2 p.m. on Saturdays was
reserved for the newest full-metal Olympic sport --
badminton.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Instantly, dozens of basketball-loving men and boys from
New York's mean streets, young men who had taken precious
time off from their hectic careers in substance retailing,
men who looked like substance wholesalers but who are
lawyers, ad guys, delivery bikers, wordsmiths, guitar
players, gofers and the professionally unemployed -- in other
words, God-fearing males gathered into the warm Christian
bonds of basketball fellowship -- were summarily evicted from
the gym.
   Their space confiscated, they wandered the Y in shock.
There were whole floors the B-ballers had never been on, and
they found themselves in mirrored rooms infested with strange
hopper people, who, in their pink-and-lime-green body
stockings, looked like Day-Glo cellulite sausages. Hippity
hop. And rooms full of machines with lots of red lights where
people were doing finger exercises "programming" the
machines.
   Meanwhile, into the now-empty gymnasium strode exactly
three adults and four children armed with those cute little
four-ounce rackets and carrying some strange feathery things
that looked very familiar. At first, we couldn't remember
why.
   Then it hit us: Manuel Noriega's lovenest villa in Panama.
It was all over TV. The brave U.S. Military Invasionary
Forces said they found weird stuff in there: frozen tamales
disguised as cocaine, red panties and feather-and-bone things
used in vile rituals that cannot be discussed in
northern-temperate-zone newspapers.
   But wait a minute. Let's go to the videotape. Those
strange feather-and-bone things weren't what they seemed.
They were . . . yes, badminton shuttlecocks]
   We, of course, don't want to smear badminton by
associating it with despicable dictator-drugsters. We want to
smear badminton fair and square, and that, of course, takes
solid factual information.
   So we looked badminton up. It turns out that some young
British army officers, on home leave from the Indian
subcontinent, decided to play an Indian game called poona at
the Duke of Beaufort's country estate, called Badminton, in
Gloucestershire, Merry Olde England, in 1873. You remember
Poona, the Indian town, of course. It also is the home base
of the late Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the
give-free-love-and-get-free-Rolls-Royces guy who almost got
Oregon to loosen up in the early '80s.
   We found out something far more interesting, especially to
all you kindhearted animal-rights activists: that real
shuttlecocks are made from real feathers extracted from real
geese. Draw yourself a clear mental picture of how they get
them: Four feathers are plucked from the left wings of four
different geese -- unsedated geese you can bet -- to make a
single shuttlecock. They claim they use only left-wing
feathers so that all shuttlecocks will spin in the same
direction. We do not believe this.
   Our research also revealed that some Americans don't
follow our fairness-to-badminton example. They malign
badminton. We know this because we called up the United
States Badminton Association, headquartered in Papillion,
Neb., and got Ray Scott, who is the retired executive
director but nevertheless was hanging around the office that
day. And he told us: "Its kind of considered to be a wimp
sport," he said. "Our problem is that people in the U.S.
don't understand what it is. But the rest of the world does."
Americans think it's the backyard kiddie game when it's
really a super-fast, high-speed, lightning-moves-type contest
in which shuttlecocks wing off rackets at 200 miles per hour,
he said. Tennis, in contrast, is for super slo-mos.
   We can't argue with him because in the olden days when we
lived in Indonesia, we had the pleasure of watching the Babe
Ruth of Badminton, Rudy Hartono, in action. He was awesome.
In fact, Indonesia is our favorite badminton country. We are
rooting for Indonesia in the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona.
Badminton's muscle, these days, however, is in China.
(Incidentally, Moussy, the no-buzz beer, found that 44% of
this country's sportswriters and broadcasters they surveyed
last year wanted the Olympics to drop badminton even before
the first medals were awarded. Even more wanted to deep-six
synchronized swimming, rhythmic gymnastics and windsurfing
from the games.)
   We think it's wonderful that badminton is big in
California, and sad that the USBA has only about 2,000
card-carrying members compared with two million in England's
association. We feel sorry for Bob Ericson, badminton's
lonely P.R. man, who invited all three TV stations in
Oklahoma City to capture on videotape a major tournament
there recently, and only one showed. Mr. Ericson was hoping
for better exposure this week at the U.S. National
Championships, now shaking the eastern slope of the Rockies
in Colorado Springs (through Saturday). He hasn't gotten it.
Competitors have outnumbered fans. The current national
champion, Tariq Wadood, from California via Pakistan, didn't
show up, although Chris Jogis, former champ, who has
"committed his life to badminton," did says Mr. Ericson, who
envisions big-time, big-bucks badminton for America any
decade now.
   We wish him luck, but we just don't think New York City is
a badminton kind of town, even though, unfortunately, our
research also turned up the fact that America's first
badminton club was started in New York City in 1878. It was
at the 71st Regiment Armory, at 35th and Broadway, and it was
the hot social recreation spot, with all sorts of Astors and
Rockefellers and Vanderbilts popping in.
   Still we wonder how the world would have turned out if
some badminton booster had sidled up to Kareem in the old
days and put a shuttlecock in his hand. A shuttlecock,
incidentally, weighs one-fifth of an ounce, has a cork tip,
and can be substituted one-for-one with chicken heads in
certain vile rituals (See Robert's Rules of Voodoo).

   Bankruptcy-Law Filings by Firms Spurt

   Soft Economy and Heavy
   Debt Burdens Are Cited

   The soft economy and heavy debt burdens are triggering a
spurt in bankruptcy-law filings by U.S. businesses.
   Many of the companies now seeking court protection from
creditors aren't household names. Rather, they are typically
small-to-medium-sized concerns, mainly in the real estate,
apparel, retailing and construction industries. And though
the filings haven't grabbed headlines like the celebrated
busts earlier this year of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
Campeau Corp.'s U.S. retailing units, they are proving a boon
to bankruptcy attorneys and a bane to creditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Business filings nationwide jumped 34% from the third to
the fourth quarter last year, the latest period available,
according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts in
Washington.
   And in just the past week, at least four publicly held
companies have sought bankruptcy-court protection after
failing in last-ditch efforts to obtain new financing. They
range from Amdura Corp., a Denver construction equipment
concern, to Casual Male Corp., a Shrewsbury, Mass., men's
clothing retailer.
   "Bankruptcy filings are up significantly," says Harvey R.
Miller, co-managing partner of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, a New
York law firm with a large bankruptcy practice. In his area,
real estate, retailing and manufacturing concerns are having
trouble, as are highly leveraged companies in general. "It's
a result of the generally weak state of the economy," he
says, combined with a drying up of some sources of financing.
   Moreover, the situation appears likely to worsen before it
improves. More companies are past due in bill payments, which
is a good barometer of financial health. The next step for
these slow-paying companies may be bankruptcy court.
   Nationwide, companies in March paid their bills an average
nine days past due, up from seven days in December, according
to data compiled by TRW Inc.'s business credit division.
"That's a significant change," says Robert Wheeler, marketing
vice president for the division. "It's a strong signal that
companies are in a cash bind."
   In certain sectors, the cash bind has become acute. For
instance, the past-due indicator jumped in the same period to
17 days from nine for apparel stores and to 14 from eight for
general retailers, Mr. Wheeler says. In building and
construction, it increased to 14 days from 12.
   Most bankruptcy specialists link the increase in filings
to greater uneasiness among bankers. Though the soft economy
clearly has weakened cash flow for many businesses, the
credit environment has also become more cautious. Savings and
loan associations, many of them in trouble, aren't able to
come to the rescue of debt-burdened real estate concerns. And
the junk-bond market, where a lot of less-credit-worthy
companies previously found financing, has all but
disappeared.
   As a result, banks have become the lenders of last resort
-- and increasingly they are skittish. "We ran out of cash,"
says Melvin Jaffee, president and chief executive officer of
National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc. The Fountain Valley, Calif.,
operator of building-supply stores filed under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code after the company's lenders
refused to provide it with more cash. Under Chapter 11,
National Lumber continues to operate while seeking an
arrangement with creditors.
   Even though outstanding loans were secured with liens
against inventories and other assets, "our lender wouldn't
give us any more," Mr. Jaffee says. "I think they were scared
by what they saw happening to other retailers."
   For their part, commercial loan officers say they are more
cautious partly because bank examiners are scrutinizing their
loans very closely. Adding to bank uneasiness is a new
Federal Reserve guideline, adopted Feb. 6, that sets a
uniform definition for highly leveraged transactions and
requires banks to report them.
   "The world has changed so dramatically in just a few
months time. There's been an incredible tightening up of bank
credit," says Richard M. Cieri, a partner at Jones, Day,
Reavis &amp; Pogue in Cleveland, the nation's second-largest law
firm. Mr. Cieri, who co-manages the firm's bankruptcy
practice, cites tight lending as the major reason for a
significant increase in Jones Day's bankruptcy caseload in
recent months.
   The tight credit situation "becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy," adds A. Gary Shilling, a New York economic
consultant. "As lenders get more worried, they stop lending
to the people who most need to borrow, forcing what they most
fear, which is bankruptcy."
   Mr. Shilling expects the problem to get worse before it
gets better. "The economy is pretty much dead in the water,"
he says, making it unlikely that troubled companies will be
relieved by an improvement in earnings. "And once lenders get
scared, they tend to stay scared for awhile. We're advising
clients to be very, very cautious, because we think the
economy is very close to a recession, which will be global in
scope." Such a scenario, he adds, would drive a large number
of highly leveraged businesses, from New York to Tokyo, into
a financial crisis.
   To be sure, bankruptcies in 1989 and so far this year
don't appear to be as high as they were in the mid-1980s,
when the rust, farm and energy belts suffered a near
depression. Nevertheless, after falling back, filings are
rising again -- and higher debt levels are a big contributor.
   The soft economy has eaten into income. As a result,
interest expense is rising far faster than the cash flow from
which it must be paid, says Mr. Shilling. In the 1989 fourth
quarter, he notes, net interest cost equaled 27.5% of
corporate cash flow plus interest costs, up from 18.8% in the
first quarter of 1986, when the buy-out trend was just
getting under way.
   Many of the companies bought during that period were
financed with high-risk, high-yield securities, commonly
known as junk bonds. And that heavy burden of debt has set
the stage for some big filings in recent months. In fact,
Beard Group Inc., a Washington, D.C., research firm that
keeps tabs on bankruptcies, says 10 of the 27 largest U.S.
bankruptcies in history occurred in the past 15 months.
   The debt bomb permeates the economy. "I can explain {the
increase in bankruptcies} with three letters: LBO," or
leveraged buy-out, says Herman Glatt, a partner with the Los
Angeles law firm of Stutman, Treister &amp; Glatt. "A lot of
companies moved too heavily into the debt market, and they
can't refinance the debt."
   Nor is that debt burden likely to lessen anytime soon. A
record $15 billion of high-interest junk bonds are likely to
go into default this year, says Richard Lehmann, editor of
Defaulted Bond Newsletter, a Miami Lakes, Fla. trade
publication. That would be a 28% increase from $11.7 billion
last year and more than three times the $4.97 billion of
1988, he says. Bloated by the $3.5 billion default last
January by the Federated and Allied department-store units of
Campeau, first-quarter defaults totaled $5.7 billion.

   BONN -- New orders to the West German manufacturing
industry rose a price-adjusted and seasonally adjusted 0.4%
in February from January but dropped 2.4% from a year
earlier, the Bonn Economics Ministry said in a preliminary
report.
   The month-to-month rise reflects a 3% increase in foreign
orders, while domestic order bookings fell 1%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The February increase, which follows a 5.5% drop in
January, was smaller than what most economists had expected.
   In a two-month comparison, which is less subject to
short-term fluctuations, January-February order bookings
dropped 2.5% from the November-December period. Foreign
orders fell 5.5%, while domestic orders were off 1%.

   TAXES

   Horace Greeley told the enthusiastic young to head west
for opportunity. Today this has largely become the
conventional wisdom, and not without reason. The line is that
the New Yorks and Massachusetts are gagging on bloated
budgets and deficits, while out west one finds the future in
entrepreneurially driven success stories. The West deserves a
closer look. California, Arizona, Washington, Oregon and
Colorado all have become scenes for the growing tension in
the U.S. between tax-siphoning public-spending commitments
and the taxpayers who keep getting asked to give more.
   For more than a decade in California, the publicrats have
chafed under both a state spending limitation pushed through
by Paul Gann and Howard Jarvis's property-tax rollback, which
voters approved in 1978. California has since settled into
the middle rank in tax burden among the 50 states, and it has
enjoyed boom years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By and large, Republican Governor George Deukmejian has
protected this voter mandate. Only in law-enforcement and
prisons has the Governor been a big spender. But now, the
public-sector lobby has found a wedge: highways.
   The story is an involved one but basically the state's
legislature has convinced the Governor to back a relaxation
of the Gann limit on this June's ballot so that the gasoline
tax can be doubled to 18 cents a gallon (on top of the sales
tax) to pay for pavement. Part of the deal is a separate bond
issue for more mass transit, which of course requires
taxpayer subsidies that never end.
   However, the Gann limit's cap on total outlays isn't the
reason that California is having infrastructure problems in
prosperous times. Other programs now claim the money that
roads used to get. School spending has exploded. Social
services grow steadily more expensive even as they get uglier
at the recipients' end. Thanks to a legislature-imposed
cost-of-living allowance, the state has some of the highest
welfare payments in the land.
   The Democrats are cheering on Mr. Deukmejian, as is the
Los Angeles Times. Their support group includes the
public-employee unions, local governments and transit
districts, major businesses, builders and hospital interests.
It sees this vote as a turning point, the symbolic twilight
of California's tight-fistedness with public spending. The
only force bucking these bigwigs is the rag-tag taxpayer
groups. Still, they may again have the taxpayers' pulse:
Polls show a close vote.
   Arizona, the onetime Sunbelt superstar, also is
discovering what happens when state government grows too big
for its britches. In addition to adding prison space, Arizona
for the past decade has been running up its relief and
health-care tabs. The result is a perpetually looming budget
deficit that always must be fed new taxes.
   You may remember the Phoenix establishment's part in the
tribunals to oust Governor Evan Mecham. This corporatist
element is behind a report called Fiscal 2000, which among
other things recommends heavier reliance on the progressive
income tax. An analysis for the Goldwater Institute suggested
that this would have the effect of generating a greater
revenue stream and thus closing the "structural deficit" that
Fiscal 2000 found was plaguing the state. In other words, the
higher public-spending trend line of the 1980s would be
affirmed. A governor's election this year will give voters a
chance to decide whether Arizona is to adopt the tax, spend
and tax model so familiar in the Northeast.
   Up north in Washington, times are so good that an
embarrassing $725 million surplus has accumulated from the
higher business and consumer taxes that were imposed during
the last downturn. By one measurement, the state's tax burden
in the 1980s went from 39th heaviest in the country to 17th.
Washington is only state that still relies heavily on a
gross-receipts tax, a killer for start-up enterprises that
aren't yet showing profits. The state thrived in the face of
such levies because the dominant Boeing Co. has had done well
and because other exporters and importers benefit from being
Japan's closest American continental neighbor.
   Now, as during the recession, state policy is to raise
taxes. Because Southern Californians are bringing road
congestion with them as they migrate in droves into the
Northwest, Washington legislators have enacted the highest
gas tax in the country -- to 23 cents, not counting local
surcharges and sales taxes (plus nine cents a gallon for the
feds).
   Meanwhile, the state's legislators this week voted to
disburse $475 million of the surplus, mostly to schools and
schoolteachers but also to welfare recipients and state
employees. It's a spend-the-surplus scenario similar to that
played out to unhappy results in the Northeast. To date
Washington's voters have fought off a state income tax. No
wonder so many Californians are coming.
   In Oregon, which is getting its share of in-migration,
both major-party candidates for governor have signed on to
the imposition of a sales tax. For years, it's been as
fiercely resisted by the public there as the income levy has
in neighboring Washington. The politicians are promising that
it could bring relief from other taxation. In Colorado, where
a taxpayer initiative to curb government growth failed last
time around, another is due for this year's ballot.
   The lure of the Pacific and maybe again of Mexico will
likely continue to beckon Americans toward the commercial and
recreational promise of the sunset shoreline. But nowadays
Horace Greeley would have to hedge: Go West, but take along
an accountant and a tax lawyer.

   Sex and Suicide
   In Sweden Aren't

   BORLANGE, Sweden -- Drinking alone at the Saga Nightclub,
Charlotte Eriksson drifts back to her days as a living
legend.
   "As soon as American guys heard I was Swedish, you could
read their minds," says the 19-year-old drama student, who
spent three of her teen-age years in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
"They expected me to leap right into their bed. That, or leap
out the window and kill myself."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tapping her foot to the music, Ms. Eriksson scans the bar
for possible dance partners. "Sometimes," she sighs, going
back to her beer, "I wish Sweden was as thrilling as its
reputation."
   In the beginning, Odin and Frigg begat Thor -- and
Scandinavia begat myths that have multiplied ever since. With
the Norse gods came Vikings: fierce men in bear furs, prone
to rape and pillage. Gradually, the Nordic image thawed,
spawning new emblems. Norway has fiords. The Danish have
pastries. Sweden has suicide and sin.
   "I imagined beautiful blondes climbing all over me as soon
as I got off the airplane," says Michael Rosenblum, a New
York television producer now working in Stockholm. "What a
joke] A lot of them aren't even blond."
   Staring glumly at the cold crayfish on his dinner plate,
he adds: "You can see why they kill themselves. This is the
most boring, depressing place I've ever been."
   Swedes themselves are uneasy with their image, which they
blame on the movies. People see Max von Sydow playing chess
with Death in "The Seventh Seal." They recall the soft-core
porn film "I Am Curious Yellow." They remember Greta Garbo
and Ingrid Bergman. They think Swedes are like their movie
stars. Well, yes and no.
   Separating fact and fiction takes some doing. It is true,
for instance, that most native Swedes are blond. Swedes in
large numbers also are good-looking, though obviously that is
subjective. (Many Swedish men find Norwegian women more
appealing.) And Swedes, generally speaking, have very
permissive attitudes toward birth control, premarital sex and
unmarried couples living together.
   "Blondes don't have more fun," says Nina Yderberg a
Stockholm medical student, who is tall, blond and stunning.
She recently got so bored with her love life that she wrote a
magazine piece maintaining that "Swedish men are such bad
lovers, I'd rather sleep with women." The article, which
includes unflattering samples of male pillow talk, has
brought the 25-year-old a lot of attention, none of it
amorous. "I haven't even kissed a man in months," she says.
   Sex isn't the only thing that Swedes complain is
overrated. Young people in particular gripe that their
bureaucratic social-welfare society is over-engineered -- a
sort of Volvo writ large: safe, staid, the ultimate family
vehicle. And many speak enviously of the excitements to be
had abroad, where people are less formal and the night life
more exciting.
   "This country is cold and gray, and I'm not just talking
about the weather," says sex therapist Malena Ivrsson, who is
married to a Yugoslav. Adds writer and social critic Jan
Myrdal: "We're almost irrationally rational. It's hard to get
an emotional response from a Swede."
   Television host Robert Aschberg agrees. He recently
invited nudists and anti-nudists to appear together on his
show. The nudists disrobed and, to spice the debate, he asked
the anti-nudists to do as much themselves. They did. Mr.
Aschberg thought the program would cause a stir. It didn't.
   "Nine people stark-naked on TV, and no one cared," he
says. "Not one angry letter or phone call. Nothing."
   In summer, Swedish women routinely go topless at beach and
pool, as do women elsewhere in Europe. But contrary to some
visitors' expectations, strip clubs and sex shops in
Stockholm are rare and discreet -- no competition for
Amsterdam or Copenhagen, tame compared to New York.
Prostitutes are almost demure. Eva, a 24-year-old making the
rounds of a park near Stockholm's Opera, tries to lure a
foreign visitor by representing herself as "a Swedish sex
machine." But dressed in denims, a windbreaker and Reeboks,
she looks more like a gym teacher than a Toulouse-Lautrec
lady of the evening.
   "Swedish men don't want you looking like a prostitute,"
she explains. "Anyway, I'd freeze in hot pants and halter
top." Asked to describe her clients, she responds, "Your
basic Swedish meatballs. Polite, efficient, no passion --
same as out of bed."
   Swedish levelheadedness extends to, and flows from, social
policy. Sweden was the first country to introduce sex
education in schools. Contraception is freely available to
teen-agers, without parental consent. And teen-agers often
bring friends home to bed, even when parents are on the
premises.
   "Most parents feel this is better than having their
children freeze in cars or parks," says Katarina Lindahl, who
heads Sweden's National Association for Sexual Information.
   The permissiveness doesn't seem to encourage promiscuity.
A 1988 survey asked Swedes 16 to 23 years of age to name the
most important thing in relationships. Only 1% cited "good
sexual relations." In part because of contraception, rates of
teen-age pregnancy are comparatively low, and falling. A
survey of Swedish women 20 to 30 found that they had, on
average, five sex partners in their entire lives.
   But the news hasn't made it abroad. During a recent trip
to London, 19-year-old Lotta Strand was asked by a British
man to record a message for his answering machine. He thought
her Swedish accent would "sound sexy," she says.
   Ms. Strand, who lives in Stockholm, refused. And she has a
new way of warding off unwanted advances from foreign men. "I
tell them I'm from Iceland," she says. "Saying you're Swedish
is suicide."
   An apt image, some would suggest. Sweden, particularly in
winter, seems a stage set for suicide. The country has long,
dark, snowy winters that keep people indoors, often with a
bottle of aquavit to keep them company.
   Swedes, reserved around strangers, can indeed seem gloomy.
"Our national character is best described as Lutheran
melancholia," says Lars Hellsten, a teacher of literature and
philosophy. "The real question," he adds, with a smile, "is
why don't all Swedes kill themselves?"
   Actually, not a remarkable number do. In 1987, Sweden's
suicide rate was 18.4 per 100,000 people, which is about par
for industrialized countries. The U.S. rate was a relatively
low 12.7. Hungarians do themselves in at twice the rate of
Swedes.
   Historians say that Sweden's undeserved reputation began
with a speech by President Eisenhower at the 1960 Republican
National Convention in which he referred to a socialist
country in the north where "suicide has gone up almost
unbelievably." He was trying to discredit Sweden's welfare
state, and the suicide myth has survived ever since, with
evident help from Ingmar Bergman, the writer and director of
depressing movies.
   So what is the true Swedish vice?
   "We don't have one, that's the problem," says Anders
Sjogren, a business consultant and part-time therapist.
"We're so busy being reliable and boring that we don't have
time for sin."
   Speaking for himself, Mr. Sjogren thinks he knows of an

   VMS Funds
   Delay Dividend
   Declarations

   CHICAGO -- The eight publicly traded funds originally
sponsored by ailing VMS Realty Partners said that they were
delaying dividend declarations and that distributions by the
three master limited partnerships would be suspended.
   The funds also said they had retained the accounting firm
of Coopers &amp; Lybrand to prepare an independent evaluation of
the value of hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to the
troubled syndicator. VMS itself has retained Kenneth
Leventhal &amp; Co. to conduct its analysis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   VMS raised $1.1 billion from more than 100,000 investors
through the funds, including sales commissions.
   All together, the funds are the largest creditor of VMS,
which has announced a series of liquidity problems and
management shake-ups since last November. Last month, First
Chicago Corp. set aside $150 to $160 million as a provision
for loan losses to offset loans to VMS entities. This week,
Xerox Corp., an owner of VMS, said it would take a
first-quarter write-off of nearly $400 million on VMS-related
equity and unsecured investments and loans.
   Leonard G. Levine, president and chief executive officer
of the funds, said the announcements were a part of steps
toward full control by the funds' boards. The funds were
administered and advised by VMS, which reaped huge fees from
them until February of this year. The funds include five real
estate investment trusts, or REITs, and three master limited
partnerships, or MLPs, all of which made loans exclusively to
VMS entities and projects.
   Mr. Levine, who had been responsible for structuring and
administering the funds as a VMS senior vice president, said
he expected an oral report from the accountants in the next
30 days. While he wouldn't estimate the value of the funds'
loans to VMS, Mr. Levine said their net per-share value was
"substantially in excess of the market price."
   The funds, issued at $10 a share and sold by a nationwide
network of broker-dealers led by Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., have been trading at prices sharply below their book
value. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, VMS Mortgage Investment Fund closed at $1.25, up
31.25 cents. The three MLPs all were trading below $1 a share
in the over-the-counter market.
   In his first interview since leaving VMS last December,
Mr. Levine said it was logical to question his position with
the funds, given his previous position with VMS. But he
defended that position as a "vote of confidence" by the
funds' directors in his knowledge and experience with the
funds.
   While Peter R. Morris, the founder of VMS, and Joel A.
Stone, the firm's current chairman and chief executive
officer, have both left the boards of the funds, the
remaining directors were all nominated by VMS and served as
directors during VMS's management of the funds. The directors
weren't available for comment.
   Mr. Levine acknowledged that a number of the funds made
loans to other funds or in participation with them. But he
said that such participation was on an equal footing between
the funds and that the interests of the eight funds in
negotiations with VMS were "in concert, not in conflict."
   Mr. Levine wouldn't comment on the results, or even the
tenor, of a major VMS creditors' meeting that took place on
Tuesday. But he said the funds would exercise "all of their
rights as creditors" to recover the principal amounts loaned
to VMS and to enforce the dividend guarantees made by a VMS
affiliate.
   The guaranteed dividends were a major selling point of the
funds, which many broker-dealers aimed at selling to people
on fixed incomes or with personal pension funds to invest.
VMS executives say the firm, which once claimed control of as
much as $9 billion in assets, won't enter bankruptcy-law
proceedings, and Mr. Levine said the funds wouldn't force
such proceedings. "Our principal recovery plan will be more
successful without a third-party intervention," Mr. Levine
said.
   Mr. Levine said the announcements were unrelated to the
Xerox moves. "Our loans are secured principally by mortgages
or other interests in real property," he said. Those
interests include junior debt and assigned interests in
partnerships according to quarterly reports by the funds.
   Mr. Levine said the funds, formerly housed at VMS's
headquarters here, had opened their own offices in Chicago
and were seeking new advisers and new names for the funds
which didn't mention VMS. He said they would open an investor
relations department at the end of the month.

   Economy:
   Ten-Year Spending Required to Close
   Failed S&amp;Ls Seen Topping $300 Billion

<LP>
   The 10-year spending required to close down insolvent
thrifts, an outlay that was estimated last year by the Bush
administration at $157.6 billion, is now considered certain
by federal budget analysts, economists and thrift executives
to wind up costing at least twice that amount, even without
any new losses among moribund savings and loan associations.
   The new estimates leave a funding gap of $100 billion to
$200 billion that will need to be addressed by the
administration and Congress in about two years. It could, at
that time, lead to attempts to tap the deposit insurance fund
of the commercial banking industry and the earnings of the
federal home loan banks owned by thrifts, and to additional
onerous insurance premiums to be paid by thrifts. But
taxpayers are still expected to bear the main brunt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The federal Resolution Trust Corp., charged with disposing
of insolvent S&amp;Ls, may defer the impact by selling its least
costly wards first, delaying the sale of the most expensive
failed thrifts. But informed economists and federal analysts
say the new cost estimates are realistic, and the money will
eventually have to paid be out.
   Over the long term, thrift experts say, the soaring
financing requirements of the thrift debacle will keep
interest rates relatively high, and wipe out much of any
"peace dividend" from cuts in defense spending.
   Thrift regulators have been hinting heavily for the past
two months that the $50 billion provided by passage of the
thrift-rescue legislation last August to cover net losses
from S&amp;L closings would be insufficient. William Seidman,
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., provided
figures in congressional testimony indicating that, even if
future resolution costs were fairly low, an unexpected jump
in the number of insolvent thrifts is apt to increase
anticipated net losses by roughly 50%.
   But certain boomerang effects of the bill itself,
increased borrowing expenses and other events since last
August, completely apart from the increase in insolvencies,
have been driving up the projected cleanup costs. Moreover,
the original administration estimate was based on unrealistic
assumptions, and was confusing in that it excluded off-budget
expenses.
   "Those numbers were contrived," one government analyst
said.
   It is believed that agencies such as the Congressional
Budget Office and the General Accounting Office may soon
submit official projections that the actual 10-year spending
will end up in the $300 billion-to-$350 billion range, before
factoring in increased net losses from an unexpectedly
greater number of insolvencies. If net losses increase to $80
billion to $120 billion, considered a minimum range by thrift
economists such as James Barth, former chief economist for
the Office of Thrift Supervision, financing requirements will
drive total spending over 10 years far past the $400 billion
mark. At the end of 10 years, taxpayers would still have to
pay interest on $80 billion to $120 billion of debt over the
subsequent 20 to 30 years.
   The Bush administration originally estimated that it would
need to raise about $197 billion from thrifts, the Federal
Home Loan Bank system and the Treasury from 1989 to 1999 to
pay for anticipated costs of the thrift cleanup, although
only $157.6 billion was considered "on budget." About $59
billion would be used to pay for S&amp;Ls closed before 1989, $50
billion for current and imminent failures, and nearly $33
billion to pay for cases after 1991 and to establish a new
deposit insurance fund for thrifts. The remainder would go to
pay administrative expenses, and principal and interest on
various forms of debt.
   About half the spending was supposed to be funded by the
Treasury, with the rest of the money coming from off-budget
borrowings, insurance premiums from the thrift industry and
the sale of seized assets.
   The biggest need for additional spending comes from the
failure of the RTC to attract buyers for whole thrifts,
partly because the 1989 thrift legislation made such
investments unattractive. So the RTC has essentially been
liquidating S&amp;Ls, by keeping the bad assets and selling what
is left at enormous losses. In its first 50 resolutions, the
RTC's estimated cash outlays amounted to 75% of total assets,
and expected net losses to 47%, according to figures it has
supplied Congress.
   To finance this retention of bad assets, the RTC is going
to need $50 billion or more of additional borrowings, or
working capital. The original estimate of the cleanup costs
didn't include the interest on this working capital-interest
that is likely to reach $40 billion or more over the next
decade.
   Moreover, a Federal Deposit Insurance Fund official
testified before Congress this week that "we are not
optimistic" that the costs projected to cover S&amp;Ls seized
before 1989 "accurately reflect the size of the obligations."
Several other outlays, such as actual administrative
expenses, are expected to be far higher than estimated by the
government.
   Compounding the problem of higher cash outlays is a
shortage in cash income. The administration assumed S&amp;L
deposits would grow 7% a year over the period, pushing up
insurance premium receipts by $12 billion. The thrift
industry's deposit base is instead narrowing sharply, partly
because solvent S&amp;Ls are shrinking to meet higher capital
ratios imposed by the thrift bill, and partly because the RTC
is selling deposits of seized S&amp;Ls to commercial banks.
Government and thrift analysts now expect little or no net
deposit growth through 1999. The analysts also consider the
expected recovery rate on the sale of seized assets to be
markedly lower than the rate projected by the administration,
threatening an additional $22 billion of expected income.
   "The shortfall is monumental and signals the need for
Congress to revisit the funding issue," Mr. Barth and another
former government thrift economist, R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr.,
write in an unpublished paper prepared for the Stanford Law
and Policy Review.

   Orbital Sciences
   Launches Rocket
   Off the West Coast

   WASHINGTON -- Orbital Sciences Corp. successfully launched
its first Pegasus rocket off the California coast. Now it
must launch a profitable business.
   Pegasus, the first U.S.-developed launch vehicle since the
space shuttle, is designed to carry small satellites into
space. The crewless rocket, outfitted with a distinctive
triangular wing, is launched from a B-52 bomber to eliminate
the need for a costly ground booster.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday, at 12:10 PDT, the rocket worked just as its
youthful inventors hoped it would. The B-52 dropped the
Pegasus booster over the Pacific Ocean; it fell for five
heart-stopping seconds; then it ignited. A camera in a jet
trailing the B-52 televised the rocket's fiery ascent into
space. "I got my view of Pegasus really climbing fast," said
the B-52 pilot, Gordon Fullerton. "It looked like a shuttle
heading for the sky."
   The launch's success was a big boost for privately held
Orbital Sciences Corp., which developed the rocket, and for
space entrepreneurship generally. Most immediately, it clears
the way for Orbital Sciences to complete its initial public
stock offering and raise a much-needed $16.3 million, before
underwriting fees. The offering was postponed last week after
a Wall Street Journal article appeared describing the risk of
the launch.
   Even more important, the launch enhances the credibility
of the Fairfax, Va., company, which had been promoting
Pegasus for several years but had run into a host of
technical problems in building the rocket. "The first launch
represents the ultimate proof of concept -- of design,
analysis and testing," said Orbital Sciences Chairman David
Thompson. "It's a very important milestone."
   The launch also was a milestone for aerospace technology.
No winged vehicle ever accelerated to eight times the speed
of sound, as Pegasus did. The computer models that Orbital
Sciences used to make the rocket will now be utilized by the
National Aerospace and Space Administration to design its
proposed X-30 jet, which would take off from an airport and
vault into space.
   The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Agency bought the
first three Pegasus rockets and ran yesterday's launch,
indicating the military's keen interest in Pegasus.
Air-launched rockets can be used to put up small
reconnaissance and communications satellites quickly over
out-of-the way trouble spots. Indeed, one of the two small
objects Pegasus put into orbit yesterday was a Navy
communications satellite that could be useful for spies.
   "Pegasus offers a capability we haven't had before," said
Jerry Grey, vice president of technology for the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. "You can launch
from anywhere into any orbit."
   But Orbital Sciences may have a tough time exploiting that
advantage because of competition and price pressures. NASA
plans to choose a company later this year to build that
agency a small launcher of its own and may be hesitant to use
a Pegasus-based vehicle for fear of relying too much on a
single launcher. Meanwhile, commercial customers demand low
prices, but the cost of Pegasus may be going up.
   Orbital Sciences charges the Pentagon research agency
about $6.5 million for each Pegasus -- about half the going
rate for small launchers. But Orbital Sciences has said it
will raise that price to about $8 million to launch
commercial satellites, and may have to raise it even more
once it starts renting its own plane instead of using the
NASA B-52.
   The rocket company also will be under pressure to raise
prices to boost profit. So far, the company has had losses of
about $46.5 million since its founding in 1982. In the nine
months ended last Sept. 30, the latest period for which it
has filed financial data, Orbital Sciences had a loss of $5.4
million on revenue of $56.8 million.

   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- A Superior Court jury rejected a
Westport delicatessen owner's claim that he was promised a
stake in actor Paul Newman's gourmet food companies.
   The jury found that Mr. Newman never promised Julius Gold
an 8% stake in the companies, Newman's Own Inc. and Salad
King Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gold contended that he was involved in marketing
efforts as well as manufacturing and bottling operations
since the business began, said his attorney, Richard
Albrecht. Mr. Newman first started the business by making
salad dressing in the basement of his Westport, Conn., home.
The line later expanded to include spaghetti sauce, popcorn
and lemonade.
   "Mr. Gold naturally is disappointed but is not totally
surprised," said Mr. Albrecht. "He recognized that he was
going after an extremely popular institution predicated on an
oral agreement."
   Attorneys for Mr. Newman said they were "delighted" with
the results. "Paul Newman has always said Newman's Own is
Newman's own and the jury agreed," said W. Patrick Ryan, one
of Mr. Newman's attorneys.
   All profits from the companies, $28 million to date, have
gone to charity, according to the Associated Press. The
Westport-based companies had a record $42 million in sales
last year, up from $36 million in 1988, the AP reported.
   "It's just tragic, all of this energy and time could not
have been spent in more charitable pursuits, but that's the
nature of the beast," Mr. Newman told the AP after the
verdict.

of slow sales.
   The Dearborn, Mich., production facility, which has been
closed this week, is now scheduled to resume output April 16.
Good Friday, April 13, is a holiday for virtually all U.S.

   Mustang sales so far this year are down 35% from year-ago
levels. Some 2,100 hourly employees work at the Dearborn
plant.
   Chrysler Corp. closed all but one of its four U.S.
car-assembly plants this week, idling a total of about 12,700
workers. The auto maker said all the plants are scheduled to
reopen April 9. The only car plant that worked this week is a
St. Louis facility that builds LeBaron and Daytona cars.
   General Motors Corp. said it has scheduled daily and
weekend overtime at its Janesville, Wis., and Lansing, Mich.,
assembly plants. Janesville builds the Chevrolet Cavalier and
Lansing manufactures the Buick Skylark and Cutlass Calais.
Overall, the 10 major U.S. auto makers plan to build 110,245
cars this week, down 30.7% from 159,001 a year ago.
   In March, the manufacturers built 992,012 cars and trucks,
down 3.6% from 1,028,993 vehicles in the same month a year
ago. Car production fell 4.9% and truck output was off 1.2%.
   Total U.S. car and truck output for the first quarter fell
21.4% compared with a year ago.

   WASHINGTON -- After a one-month court hold on the
thrift-industry restructuring, government regulators seized
Colony Savings Bank, Monaca, Pa., an insolvent thrift with
assets of $451 million.
   It was the first government seizure of an insolvent S&amp;L
since Olympic Federal Savings &amp; Loan, Berwyn, Ill., won a
round of court cases March 7. The Office of Thrift
Supervision said Colony was operating in an unsafe and
unsound condition, and suffered losses related to securities
trading and commercial real-estate lending. Colony will
continue operating under government management.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The court case rested on the fact that the director of the
thrift office hadn't been confirmed by the Senate, as
required by the Constitution. On Wednesday, the Senate
confirmed Timothy Ryan for the post, and he will be sworn in
Monday, apparently making the court decision moot.
   Separately today, the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, is expected to disclose its
latest estimate of how much the thrift bailout may cost over
10 years. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust
Corp., the S&amp;L bailout agency, has already estimated that
another $25 billion will have to be piled onto the $166
billion estimated by the Bush administration. Congressional
sources expect the GAO estimate to be much higher.

   BRUSSELS -- The average rate of unemployment in the 12
European Community countries was a seasonally adjusted 8.6%
in February, unchanged from January, the EC's statistics
agency, Eurostat, said.
   The rate was down from 9.7% in February 1989. On an
unadjusted basis, average EC unemployment was 8.9% in
February, also unchanged from January. The rate was down from
10.1% in February 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eurostat said that during the past three years, the EC
unemployment rate as a whole has fallen by a constant 0.7
percentage point a year, from 10.6% in February 1987.
Unemployment has thus fallen by about 20% during the past 36
months, Eurostat said.
   Unemployment fell during that period in all member states,
with the exception of Italy and Denmark, Eurostat said.
   Adjusted unemployment in February was highest in Ireland,
at 16.7%. It was lowest in Luxembourg, at 1.6%.

   USX Chairman
   Says Icahn Plan
   To Cost Firm More

   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp. Chairman Charles A. Corry said
investor Carl Icahn's proposal to split the company's steel
and energy operations would cost the company an additional
$100 million to $120 million a year.
   Moreover, Mr. Corry asserted that Mr. Icahn's $48-a-share
value on a divided USX is the result of "a lightweight
analytical job." He noted, for example, that the more
cyclical steel segment was given the same high asset and
market ratio as the more attractive oil operations. Mr.
Icahn's analysis was also based on asset values, rather than
earnings and cash flow, he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If accepted, Mr. Icahn's proposal would result in steeper
interest expenses incurred by a separate steel company
borrowing at about an 11 1/2% rate, compared with the
company's average 8 1/2% rate. That alone would cost $45
million more annually to cover the steel company's $1.5
billion in debt, Mr. Corry said.
   In addition, separating the steel business from the parent
would add $20 million to $30 million a year to the combined
entities' insurance expenses. Two separate companies would
also result in higher state taxes and new administrative and
management costs. "The companies aren't going to be as
profitable as they are in a common shell," because they'd
each have costs currently spread between them, Mr. Corry
argued.
   The executive said one issue -- the $900 million in
tax-loss carry-forwards -- would resolve itself by year end
because if the businesses are kept together USX would earn
enough to use up the steel-related tax losses that have
sheltered energy-related earnings.
   But he questioned whether the proposed spinoff would be
tax-free, as Mr. Icahn indicated. That condition would have
to be determined by the Internal Revenue Service, which would
require a number of complex conditions, Mr. Corry said.
   Mr. Icahn defended his analysis by saying it did take cash
flow into account, and did assign different valuation
multiples to the steel and energy units. He also said his
lawyers advised him the split-up could be executed on a
tax-free basis.
   He said any extra interest cost for steel could be offset
by lower interest costs for energy operations, but added that
he didn't agree there would be extra steel interest costs. As
for extra state taxes and administrative costs, he said, "If
you take that to its final conclusion, then everything should
be conglomeratized, and we saw the devastating results of
conglomerates in the 1970s."
   In proxy materials mailed this week to USX shareholders,
Mr. Icahn advocated the split-up of the Marathon Oil unit and
U.S. Steel, arguing that the separate businesses would be
valued at about 30% above the current market price, or $48 a
share. USX closed yesterday at $36.375, down 12.5 cents, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Icahn
is USX's largest investor with a 13.3% stake. Shareholders
will vote on his proposal at a May 7 annual meeting.

   Wariness about the Tokyo stock market, the U.S. economy
and the fate of the dollar kept a tight lid on financial
markets.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 1.80
points to 2721.17 in light trading. But the advance was
concentrated in blue-chip issues. Broader market averages
were off slightly. Long-term bond prices eased, and the
dollar was mixed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said worries about Japanese stocks restrained
U.S. stock prices. The Dow industrials lost more than 17
points Wednesday after rumors spread that a big player in the
Japanese stock market was in financial trouble. The Nikkei
index of 225 stocks lost about 1,200 points in early trading
Thursday, but recouped most of that by the end of trading.
   Treasury bonds, which benefited Wednesday from a flight to
safety on the unconfirmed Tokyo rumors, were nearly moribund
yesterday as investors awaited this morning's March
employment report. Economists expect the report to show the
economy generated about 178,000 non-farm jobs last month,
substantially below the growth rate in January and February.
   Currency traders, meantime, awaited the results this
weekend of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations
meeting in Paris, where officials will discuss steps to rein
in the dollar's surge against the Japanese yen. Although
traders don't expect any such efforts to be successful in the
long run, they nevertheless bid the dollar lower against the
yen yesterday.
   Charles Clough, chief portfolio strategist at Merrill
Lynch, said investors are correct to be concerned about the
Tokyo stock market. If nothing else, the disruptions there
could undermine investor confidence in the U.S. market. But
he added that even if Tokyo's troubles spread to the U.S.,
any turmoil is likely to be short-lived. He said U.S.
interest rates are among the lowest in the world, the dollar
is strong and Americans are saving an ever-growing portion of
their incomes -- all signs of fundamental economic strength.
   "Right now, Japan is a loose cannon," he said. "But I
think that if we did see the U.S. markets destabilized, it
wouldn't last long."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices crept higher in light trading. Volume on the
New York Stock Exchange totaled 144.2 million shares. But
declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 744
to 703.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices eased. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
lost an eighth of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face
amount. The yield on the issue rose to 8.51%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6995 marks, unchanged from
Wednesday, and at 157.4 yen, down from 158.95.

   The politics of Eastern Europe have held the world's
attention. But if these brave people are to succeed, the
world had better keep paying attention when the talk turns to
the harder subject of money. This weekend at the G-7 meeting
in Paris, finance ministers will hear that a $12 billion
development bank will do wonders for Eastern Europe. In fact,
history suggests that it will prolong the shift from
socialism to capitalism.
   The Eastern European Development Bank (EEDB), with 27
Western and seven East European member nations, was largely
the brainchild of French President Francois Mitterrand. He
insisted that the European Community provide most of the
capital and make most of the decisions. The U.S., Japan and
the Soviet Union each are invited to chip in 8.5% to 10% of
the capital.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. was leery of French insistence that 40% of the
lending in Eastern Europe go to governments rather than
private firms, but it went along. It is drawing a line,
however, on loans to the Soviet Union. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady told Congress that the U.S. won't join if the
Soviets are allowed to borrow more than their share of the
capital. He noted that the Soviet Union is clearly not yet an
emerging democracy. Since it still spends 15% to 20% of its
GNP on defense it has ample resources to finance perestroika.
   But U.S. concerns go deeper. If the record of the World
Bank and its offshoots is any guide, an EEDB would help
preserve statism. The French insist that the EEDB will be
different, with 60% of its loans going to the private sector.
But this is a distinction without a difference.
   Such bodies fund private-sector borrowers by giving the
money to state-run development banks whose bureaucrats then
"on-loan" to private borrowers of their choosing. Last year a
World Bank internal report noted that in a sample of 18 of
these "directed credit" programs, an average of nearly 50% of
loans were in arrears. Yet, the first World Bank loan to
post-communist Poland this February was $265 million to the
National Bank for "directed credit" to export industries. Is
it likely that the EEDB's private-sector lending will be more
rational?
   Such infusions often act as a narcotic, delaying needed
economic reforms and thus making matters worse. Politicians
can't help but look at aid as a way to delay privatizations
and painful price reforms. The Czechs seem to agree.
President Vaclav Havel told Margaret Thatcher during his
British visit that "we value your advice and moral support
far more than your money."
   U.S. policymakers are going along with the EEDB partly out
of concern that the U.S. will be ridiculed if it doesn't. But
rather than fret about its image, the U.S. should stand up
for the incentive-based policies that the rest of the world
is now emulating.
   Any money the U.S. does send to Eastern Europe would be
better spent in the forms recommended by the commission on
Hungary, whose conclusions are summarized in an article
nearby (See: "A Recipe for a Free-Market Hungary" -- WSJ
April 6, 1990). Additionally, Eastern Europeans could be
brought to the U.S. to work as trainees and interns, much the
way American corporations routinely bring foreign nationals
to the U.S. for intensive training.
   The West should be helping Eastern Europe. But the
proposed EEDB looks no better than the other development
banks. If they are so good, how come so many of their Third
World clients are still doing so badly?

   DALLAS -- International Telecharge Inc. said that talks
about a possible sale of the company have ended and that
Allan L. Rayfield, a former telecommunications executive, was
named chairman and chief executive officer.
   The company, which provides operator-assisted
long-distance service to hotels, hospitals and pay phones,
said that discussions to sell the company to a suitor ended
before a formal offer was made. The potential acquirer wasn't
disclosed. International Telecharge said last month that it
had received an inquiry about a possible acquisition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company also said that it named Mr. Rayfield, a
company director, to the two top posts, succeeding Edmund F.
Tagg, who was chairman, chief executive officer and
president. Mr. Tagg, who remains a director, now will serve
as president and chief operating officer, succeeding Dennis
Geraghty, formerly chief operating officer, who resigned, the
company said.
   Mr. Rayfield was a senior vice president and director of
GTE Corp. until a year ago. Since then, he has been a
consultant.
   International Telecharge also said that it has agreed to
provide operator services to hotel and hospital customers of
MCI Communications Corp. as part of an agreement calling for
International Telecharge to become a large customer of MCI's
long-distance network. International Telecharge said the pact
reduces its long-distance line costs, and that it calls for
MCI to market its operator, billing and collection services
for hotels under the MCI name.
   As part of the agreement, MCI returned warrants to
purchase 2,986,895 International Telecharge shares to
International Telecharge and agreed to provide a
working-capital loan of undisclosed size to defray
development costs for the hospitality services.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
International Telecharge rose 12.5 cents to close at $3.125 a
share.

   On Sunday Peruvians go to the polls to elect their new
president. The leading contender is novelist Mario Vargas
Llosa. A few months ago, Mr. Llosa was interviewed by his
friend, Chilean economist and essayist David Gallagher. The
interview took place at the Center of Public Studies in
Santiago and was published in the Center's publication
Estudios Publicos. Excerpts appear below:

   Mr. Gallagher: Why do you think that, generally speaking,
writers and intellectuals have the tendency to oppose
free-market experiments and libertarian revolutions?
   Mr. Vargas Llosa: Because unlike socialism, capitalism has
never generated a mystique; capitalism was never preceded by
a utopian vision.
   Intellectuals and artists have a strength -- that comes
perhaps from the artist's condition itself -- which is the
condition of the dreamer; the man who wants to transcend the
limits of reality, to go further. Capitalism has nothing to
do with that. It has to do with reality. Capitalism is within
the limits of the human.
   The poet and novelist want no part of this reality. They
want to transcend it. They want to substitute it. They want
to change it for a reality that comes out of their fantasies
-- out of their desires. Then, how can they accept
capitalism? It is very difficult; there is a resistance to
human mediocrity.
   What the intellectual should do is at least tolerate
mediocrity, because mediocrity is what has brought us
progress. The utopian vision, on the other hand, which is so
beautiful in the abstract, has brought nothing but barbarity.
Utopias have never brought progress. After the establishment
of religious or revolutionary utopias there are multitudes of
cadavers, great amounts of tortured people, millions who are
purged and sent to concentration camps. We are living it now
in Iran: that materialization of the utopia in which a whole
country gets hooked, bringing thousands of deaths, and the
destruction of an economy that could be, perhaps, one of the
most prosperous in the world.
   The intellectual in Latin America confronts a tragic
panorama of hunger, exploitation and terrible discrimination.
Therefore, there exists the totally false but deeply rooted
beliefs about what capitalism is. Of course, this vision is a
complete caricature. Thus, to defend a capitalist model means
to defend the existent model -- to defend the
"establishment."
   The curious part is that in Latin America, reality has
became more socialist than capitalist. This is a socialism
that does not carry the name, but in practice that is what it
is. We have states that have been overbuilt; we have
interventionist practices; we have a multitude of economic
policy control systems. The confusion in the intellectual
world is that they have come to accept the idea that
capitalism is the "establishment," when it is exactly the
contrary. What our countries do not have is a genuine liberal
economy; a genuine capitalist economy with a free market,
free competition and nonintervention by the state.
   It is not bad that intellectuals and artists will be
constant critics of the "establishment." I believe it is
legitimate that they defend the utopian vision. What is
dangerous is if this utopian vision turns into political
power.
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Gallagher: If you become president, your term will
coincide with the fifth centenary of the discovery of
America. How are you going to celebrate this milestone?
   Mr. Vargas Llosa: The anniversary is going to provoke a
lot of speeches around the Hispanic world -- endless ones.
But I am afraid that a good part of the celebration will
remain in the realm of rhetoric effusions. We may lose the
opportunity of celebrating in a creative fashion.
   For instance, we should explore the battle against the
spirit of "nationalism" in Latin America, which still is
pending. All ideologies in Latin America -- whether on the
political right or left -- are, in some way or another,
involved in applauding this curse of nationalism. This is an
issue that is approached very prudently and very rarely in
Latin America.
   But I believe this attachment to nationalism as an ideal
is a curse we will have to fight if we ever are to get out of
the stage of underdevelopment. Even if we become a bit more
developed, we will still be out of step with the rest of the
world if we do not become a part of the profound process of
integration taking place around the world. And I believe that
process is incompatible with the nationalist culture that is
rooted at all levels of our society.
   Thus, the anniversary should remind us that our borders
are, in large part, fictitious, artificial things created by
bureaucrats who do not respond to the profound realities of
Latin America -- neither the past ones nor the present ones.
This fifth centenary should be used to help liberate us from
nationalism, to provoke a great continental mobilization to
the idea of integration, to dissolve the borders. But I am
afraid that because the celebrations will be directed by
governments -- I mean, through political power -- politicians
will take advantage of ceremonies to engage in exercises of
auto eulogy. So, I am afraid that nothing important is really
going to happen.
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Gallagher: How is the writer in you -- one who is a
merciless critic of power -- going to coexist with the
political actor?
   Mr. Vargas Llosa: Well, as cat and dog. It is a very
difficult coexistence between the writer and the politician.
Both are activities that intimately repel one another, there
is no doubt about that. The writer is a man who works in
solitude. He is entirely owner of his own acts, of everything
he does. This is very different from the politician who works
immersed in a mixture of people, who has to permanently
accept the politics of the minor evil, knowing that he can be
wrong about identifying the minor evil.
   My distrust of power has not decreased. Now that I am
doing politics, I daily verify how all those low levels of
personality show up in endless ways in the political life,
because they have to do with power. And power brings out the
worst there is in human beings. So, that reconfirms my
distrust toward power, my conviction that power brings out
the worse.
   I think that is why I have come to liberalism. If there is
a system of generalized distrust toward power, that is
liberalism. True liberalism believes that power is a danger
and that it has to be dispersed -- pulverized -- in society.
That is why I believe that the best defense the human race
has against that threat to the individual is to disperse
power within society in a way that no group, no party can
really subordinate others to their convenience or to their
will.
   That is why, if I get to power, I want to fight so that
executive power is kept limited, restricted and decentralized
so that all Peruvians can start to participate in power. I do
not know if I will accomplish this, but the idea I have is at
least clear: The only way to fight exploitation,
discrimination, brutality -- something that is a part of the
Peruvian experience -- is by distributing power throughout
the society. The ones who have gone farthest in this are the
liberal thinkers, who have come to the defense of individuals
who confront the modern monster that is power.

   Big Retailers'
   March Sales
   Were Weak
   ---
   Sluggish Demand Is Cited
   In Durable Goods, Along
   With Late 1990 Easter

   Several of the nation's big retailers reported weak sales
for March, reflecting this year's later Easter holiday season
and continued sluggish demand for some durable goods.
   Analysts estimate sales at stores open at least a year
rose an average of less than 3% from a year earlier, or less
than the inflation rate. The figures are sketchier than usual
because a number of large chains with different fiscal
calendars won't report March sales until next week. They
include K mart Corp., Dayton Hudson Corp., May Department
Stores Inc. and Limited Inc.

   "The weak hard-goods sales reflect a somewhat flat
consumer economy across the country," maintained Thomas
Tashjian of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   He predicted a stronger showing next week when department
stores and specialty stores that rely more heavily on
clothing sales report their results. "The early warm weather
really helped," he said. "Business for apparel retailers is
coming in better than management planned."
   With Easter's shift into April this year from late March,
some analysts favor combining the two months for comparison
purposes. "When all is said and done, you're going to see a
same-store increase averaging 6%," predicted Robert Buchanan
of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore.
   After adjusting for inflation, which he believes is
increasing at a rate of around 4% or 5%, Mr. Buchanan
predicted little growth in sales. "Consumer spending is still
slow," he said. "Disposable income growth has slowed. People
seem determined to save at least part of their income."
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's largest retailer,
posted a 1.6% gain in U.S. same-store sales, after excluding
discontinued items from its year-earlier results. A Sears
spokesman, however, said executives were "very pleased" with
the showing because last year's figures were inflated by an
advertising blitz that accompanied the launch of Sears's
everyday low-price policy.
   Woolworth Corp. said its U.S. same-store sales dropped
3.7%. Same-store sales at Ames Department Stores Inc. fell
13.5%. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. said same-store sales rose 1%
and Melville Corp. said its sales rose 2.8%.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. reported the
strongest showings. Same-store sales at Wal-Mart, the
fast-growing discounter that has been gaining market share,
rose 12%. Penney rang up an 8.7% increase in same-store
sales, partly because it compensated for the later Easter by
moving up its 25% discount promotion for credit card
customers to March from April last year.

   For Just $1,200,
   You Too Can Be
   Goldman Client

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)
MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Small investors suddenly are welcome at one of
Wall Street's white-shoe investment banks.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., after long catering to the rich,
plans to launch its first stock mutual fund that woos the
little guy. Through the years, Goldman typically has required
that individuals looking to invest with the firm put up at
least $5 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The minimum for its new GS Capital Growth Fund? A mere
$1,200.
   The planned offering hammers home just how bad times are
on Wall Street, analysts say. With nearly every segment of
the securities industry in the doldrums, firms are scraping
for any way to drum up steady income. And managing
mutual-fund assets generates fees based on the amount of
assets under management; those fees pour in even in slow
markets.
   "They go out and do a good deed and make a pile of money
for Goldman," says James Hanbury, a financial-services
analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. Right now, on Wall Street,
asset management "is the world's best business," he says.
   Goldman is mum on its change of heart, saying it can't
discuss the fund while the offering documents are being
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
haven't yet been approved.
   In papers filed with the SEC, Goldman said the fund will
stress long-term growth through so-called value investing --
trying to find underpriced securities.
   But the fund clearly won't be for shrinking violets. It
will be able to invest in a wide range of securities,
including foreign stocks and debt, junk bonds, restricted
stock, and shares of small, fledgling companies. However, no
more than 25% of the fund's assets can be invested in foreign
stocks and bonds. The overseas markets most likely to be
tapped include Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Japan,
Switzerland, Britain and West Germany, the document says.
   And it won't come cheap. Investors will be levied a
maximum sales charge of 5.5% of the amount invested when
buying fund shares -- relatively high for a mutual fund.
Moreover, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the fund's adviser,
will get a steep annual management fee equal to 1% of the
fund's average daily net asset value.
   "Such {a} fee is higher than that paid by most investment
companies," notes Goldman's registration document; many
mutual funds levy annual management fees of 0.5% of assets.
   Goldman fund investors also will be charged an annual
"distribution" fee of as much as 0.25% of assets, according
to registration papers.
   Leon Cooperman, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management
and chief portfolio manager of the planned fund, declined to
comment.
   Notwithstanding the heavy charges, Goldman boasts one of
the best long-term stock-picking records in the securities
business.
   In the 12 months ended Dec. 31, Goldman ranked third out
of 10 securities firms regularly tracked by this newspaper,
with an estimated return of 37.1%. That eclipsed the 31.7%
return for the Standard &amp; Poor's-500 stock index last year,
according to the joint study by this newspaper and Zacks
Investment Research Inc. And for the 42 months ended Dec. 31,
Goldman topped all the other securities firms, just beating
out Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. with an estimated return
of 81.9%.
   In 1989's fourth quarter, the latest period available,
investors following Goldman's stock picking advice lost 2.4%,
Zacks said.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Princeton/Newport Defendants,
   U.S. Back $3 Million Settlement

   The federal government agreed to accept $3 million in
forfeitures from defendants in the Princeton/Newport Limited
Partnership racketeering case -- much less than the
government originally sought but more than a federal judge
ordered.
   The agreement was revealed in a proposed order submitted
to U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter in New York City last
week. The forfeitures will have to be paid only if the
convictions of the six defendants in the case are upheld on
appeal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The potent Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
law, or RICO, requires convicted defendants to forfeit their
profits from alleged wrongdoing, plus interest, as well as
their salaries during the period of wrongdoing and their
stake in what the law calls a "racketeering enterprise."
   Last July, a federal jury returned guilty verdicts against
five officials of Princeton/Newport and a former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. trader on multiple felony counts
relating to securities fraud, conspiracy and racketeering.
The jury determined that the defendants should forfeit assets
totaling $3.8 million, far less than the $21.7 million the
government sought. At the time, the government vowed it would
appeal the forfeiture verdict because it was too low.
   But when he sentenced the defendants in November, Judge
Carter ordered a total of $1.6 million in forfeitures from
two of the six defendants. He dismissed the forfeitures
sought by the government against most of the defendants
because, he said, "the benefits the defendants received were
greatly disproportionate to the penalty," in violation of the
Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
   Since the Princeton/Newport defendants were convicted, the
Justice Department has issued new guidelines urging
prosecutors not to seek disproportionate penalties or to
bring RICO charges in a case involving mostly tax offenses.
In the Princeton/Newport case, most of the offenses were
tax-related.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Neil Cartucsciello said the
settlement didn't indicate any weakening of the government's
position. "The settlement is a settlement, not an admission,"
he said, adding, "The defendants originally said they should
pay nothing." The government also agreed to remove prior
restraining orders on the defendants' assets soon.
   But Jack Arseneault, a defense lawyer in the case,
disagreed. "This is not only less than the government asked
for, but less than the jury awarded," he said. While Mr.
Arseneault acknowledged that lawyers argued that defendants
shouldn't have to pay anything, he said, "We compromised more
out of practicality than out of an admission that any
forfeiture is appropriate." Mr. Arseneault said the
defendants agreed to the compromise because many had
difficulty living with restraints on their assets.
   Under the agreement, James Sutton Regan, the former
managing partner of Princeton/Newport, will forfeit
$2,367,645 if his conviction is upheld on appeal. Former
Princeton/Newport general partners Jack Z. Rabinowitz,
Charles M. Zarzecki and Paul A. Berkman will forfeit $157,843
each. Steven B. Smotrich, the defunct securities firm's
former comptroller, will forfeit $983, and Bruce L. Newberg,
a former Drexel trader who did business with
Princeton/Newport will forfeit $157,843.

   LIBEL SUIT against Glamour Magazine may be allowed to
proceed.
   Eric A. Foretich, former husband of Elizabeth Morgan, sued
Glamour and others, alleging that a Glamour article left the
impression that he had sexually abused their daughter Hilary,
as Dr. Morgan claims.
   Conde Nast Publications Inc., which publishes Glamour,
author Bob Trebilcock and others at the company also are
defendants in the suit, in which Dr. Foretich and his parents
seek $40 million in compensatory damages and $200 million in
punitive damages. Conde Nast is part of the Newhouse
publishing empire.
   In a decision this week, U.S. District Judge Gerhard
Gesell of Washington, D.C., said Dr. Foretich's libel suit
was barred because it was filed more than one year after
publication of the November 1988 article. But Judge Gesell
said Dr. Foretich can proceed with the suit if he can show
that the magazine gave permission to supporters of Dr. Morgan
to copy and distribute the article, as Dr. Foretich contends.
Under libel law, subsequent re-publications of the same
material are considered new publications.
   Dr. Morgan became the center of widespread media attention
when she spent 25 months in jail for civil contempt after
refusing to produce Hilary for a two-week unsupervised visit
with her ex-husband.
   Dr. Morgan has claimed that Dr. Foretich sexually abused
Hilary, a charge he denies. A judge said the evidence was
inconclusive about whether abuse had occurred.

   WESTERN UNION LOSES challenge to gay-discrimination law.
   California Superior Court Judge Ira Brown rejected the
company's efforts to declare the 13-year-old San Francisco
ordinance, the first of its kind in the nation, invalid under
California's constitution. Judge Brown also rejected Western
Union's claim that cities don't have the power to give
victims the right to sue for damages over wrongful conduct,
such as job discrimination.
   Western Union asked the judge to declare the law invalid
after the company was sued by Armand Ertag, a former employee
who claimed he was harassed on the job by a supervisor.
Melvin Honowitz, Mr. Ertag's lawyer, said the decision clears
the way for the case to be addressed on its merits. Mr. Ertag
is suing for damages for lost compensation, emotional
distress and invasion of privacy.
   A Western Union spokesman said the Upper Saddle River,
N.J., company had planned to withdraw its challenge to the
ordinance this week before it learned of the judge's
decision.
   "What we had here was really a narrow legal issue, which
we offered as a defense," the spokesman said. The legal
tactic, however, created "a widespread reaction that the
company discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation.
That is absolutely not the case," he said.
   Western Union's actions in the case spurred a boycott by
some gay-rights organizations. The Human Rights Campaign Fund
in Washington, D.C., for instance, canceled a contract that
it estimated would have given the company $350,000 in revenue
this year. A group of gay and lesbian San Francisco city
employees plans to file a complaint with the city's Human
Rights Commission asking that the city government be
prohibited from doing business with the ailing communications
company.

   DIGGES SENTENCED: Edward S. Digges Jr., the
product-liability defense specialist who pleaded guilty in
January to stealing more than $2 million from a former
client, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison. The scion of
one of Maryland's most wealthy and prominent legal families,
Mr. Digges, 44 years old, faced as much as three years in
jail for padding legal bills and submitting phony invoices.
Mr. Digges apologized for the theft, saying he is only now
beginning to understand his behavior. A psychiatrist
testified that Mr. Digges suffers from a "narcissistic
personality disorder" that made him unable to comprehend the
magnitude of his crime. U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove
in Baltimore sentenced Mr. Digges to probation for three
years upon his release and ordered him to pay $1 million in
restitution and $30,000 in fines. Mr. Digges is to report to
prison May 7.

   JUDICATE, the nation's oldest private court system, hired
Stephen D. Edenbaum, a former IBM sales executive, to head
its national sales division. The move is another step in
Judicate's efforts to shift from advertising and promoting
its private-mediation service to direct sales through phone
calls and presentations. Lackluster performance since
Judicate introduced its private alternative
dispute-resolution service in 1983 forced the company to lay
off marketing staff and impose across the board salary cuts
in August. The company has yet to turn a profit, but new
emphasis on sales, said Theodore A. Schwartz, Judicate's head
of investor relations, is already paying off.

   American Airlines, Eastern Airlines and Mesa Airlines all
reported March traffic increases.
   American, a unit of Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp.,
said its traffic rose 4.1% to 6.45 billion revenue passenger
miles from 6.19 billion last year. A revenue passenger mile
is one paying passenger flown one mile. American's load
factor, or percentage of seats filled, fell to 63.2% from
65.6%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the first quarter, American said it flew 17.5 billion
revenue passenger miles, up 7.9% from 16.2 billion. Its
year-to-date load factor was 59.9%, down from 60%.
   Miami-based Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., said it
flew 1.72 billion revenue passenger miles last month, against
299 million a year ago, when Eastern was nearly grounded by a
strike. Eastern's load factor was 66.8% last month, compared
with 50% a year ago. For the quarter, revenue passenger miles
rose 9.2% to 4.75 billion from 4.35 billion. Load factor also
was up, to 63.2% from 59.2%.
   Mesa said its March traffic soared 74%, to 10.2 million
revenue passenger miles from 5.9 million a year ago. Load
factor fell to 47.4% from 51.5% last March.
   The commuter carrier attributed its increased traffic to
its new operations carrying passengers as a United Express
carrier out of Denver. The airline continues to operate as an
independent carrier out of its Albuquerque, N.M., and
Phoenix, Ariz., hubs.
   For the first three months of 1990, Mesa said its traffic
jumped 62%, to 25.1 million revenue passengers from 15.5
million in 1989. Load factor for the same period declined, to
44.7% from 48.5%.

   Who's News:
   Wharton School Picks Thomas Gerrity
   Of Computer Sciences Corp. to Be Dean

   PHILADELPHIA -- Thomas P. Gerrity, president of Computer
Sciences Corp.'s rapidly growing commercial consulting
division, was named dean of the University of Pennsylvania's
Wharton School.
   Mr. Gerrity, 48 years old, is expected to guide the
redesigning of the business school's curriculum, while
continuing the international emphasis on research and
teaching that began under his predecessor, Russell E. Palmer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Palmer, 55, who has been the dean for seven years,
said this past summer that he plans to step down June 30. He
will pursue some entrepreneurial ventures.
   Mr. Gerrity brings extensive academic and corporate
experience to the assignment. As head of CSC Consulting
Corp., he has been leading the computer-services firm's
efforts to expand into commercial computer-systems
integration in the U.S. and Europe, decreasing the firm's
dependence on federal government contracts.
   For four years, Mr. Gerrity taught at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, where
he founded Index Group, a consulting firm that specializes in
counseling executives on strategic management of changing
information technology. In the early 1970s, he left Sloan to
become a full-time consultant. Index Group is now part of CSC
Consulting.
   At Wharton, Mr. Gerrity is expected to infuse both the
curriculum and the research programs with more emphasis on
practical business techniques and problems. Although the
school is already considered to be among the best in the
U.S., faculty members say students still need better
preparation for confronting international markets and
competitors.
   Wharton "needs to work continually to see that
globalization is reflected throughout the curriculum," Mr.
Gerrity said in an interview. "There are no more purely
domestic arenas."
   Another challenge facing the new dean is the
reorganization of Wharton's core courses, said Anita Summers,
a professor of public policy and a member of the search
committee that selected Mr. Gerrity. She said the school
needs to evaluate whether it is "slicing the subjects
correctly."
   In addition to creating more cooperation among Wharton's
segmented departments, Wharton's current dean, Mr. Palmer, is
credited with almost quadrupling Wharton's endowment, to more
than $100 million at current market prices from $27 million
in 1983. "He was able to convince a lot of people that this
was a good place to invest their money -- in human capital,"
Ms. Summers said.
   Mr. Gerrity is expected to continue the fund raising, said
Edward Bowman, the deputy dean who led the search. "But he
brings more than that," Mr. Bowman said.
   Computer Sciences, El Segundo, Calif., said Chairman
William R. Hoover will assume Mr. Gerrity's responsibilities
until a successor is named. "We regret losing an executive of
Tom's caliber," Mr. Hoover said. "At the same time, we are
proud that Tom has been chosen to lead one of the world's
truly outstanding business schools."

   Big Beverage Firms Are Expected to Post
   Mixed Earnings for the First Quarter
   ----

   The big beverage companies will report mixed first-quarter
earnings, as the nation's thirst for low-calorie drinks
offsets some worries over the impact of price fluctuations.
   Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. are expected to report
earnings gains of at least 13%, analysts estimate.
Anheuser-Busch Cos. is seen posting an increase of at least
3.5%. Adolph Coors Co. may report break-even results or post
a profit, compared with a year-earlier loss. Meanwhile,
bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., keeping its dismal
earnings record intact, will probably post another quarterly
decline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts are looking for Coca-Cola, which derives the bulk
of its earnings from overseas, to show a 6% rise in
concentrate shipments abroad, while retail sales climb a
strong 10%. In the key Western European market, Coke is
benefiting from its increased involvement in bottling
operations. Volumes will probably be strong in England, for
example, where Coke has a joint-venture bottling business,
and in France, where Coke last year acquired virtually all
the distribution business, says George Thompson, an analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Japan, one of Coke's
biggest markets, should show a solid volume gain at the
retail level.
   Closer to home, Coke's domestic volume is expected to
increase a slim 3% or so, reflecting continued soft sales
among fast-food restaurants, one of the biggest clients for
fountain soft drinks. Amid a lack of any really jazzy
consumer promotions anywhere in the business, Pepsi's volume
should be up only about 3% as well.
   Both companies snapped a several-year discounting spree
late last year and have taken some lumps in recent quarters
as consumers felt some sticker shock. In the first quarter,
though, "moderate price increases didn't cause any unusual
resistance," said Martin Romm, a First Boston Corp. analyst.
The increasing popularity of diet soft drinks, which are
priced the same as regular ones, is tempering consumer
resistance to higher prices, he said. "Diet soft drinks are a
value-added product that provide the consumer a reason to buy
the product," he said.
   In the first quarter, Atlanta-based Coke is expected to
earn between 81 cents and 84 cents a share, according to
analysts' estimates, compared with 72 cents a share a year
earlier.
   Purchase, N.Y.-based Pepsi, aided by stronger fast-food
and snack operations, will earn between 70 cents and 72 cents
a share, up from the year-earlier 62 cents a share. The
results would have been higher except for the earnings
dilution resulting from Pepsi's multibillion-dollar
acquisition binge last year. PaineWebber Inc. estimates that
the dilution sliced about 11 cents a share off Pepsi's
earnings in the latest quarter.
   Earnings at Coca-Cola Enterprises are expected to fall to
between two cents and five cents a share from the year-ago
seven cents. One optimistic analyst sees flat earnings.
Higher marketing costs again appear to be the main culprit,
analysts said. The giant Coca-Cola bottler, whose recent
profit performance has disappointed investors, has been
increasing marketing and promotional spending to lessen
consumer resistance to higher soft-drink prices.
   But low pricing, which has been squeezing soft-drink
bottlers' margins until recently, has been creeping up. That
trend has led some analysts to predict higher earnings for
Coca-Cola Enterprises in 1990, although the comparative 1989
earnings were poor.
   Amid a moderate 2.5% to 3% increase in beer shipments in
the first quarter, Anheuser-Busch, St. Louis, is expected to
earn between 60 and 64 cents a share, compared with 58 cents
a year earlier. Although the major brewers raised prices 3%
early this year, some uncertainty remains about the effect on
profits of sporadic and regional price discounting in the
beer business. But, said Mr. Romm of First Boston, "the beer
industry seems to be very healthy in the first quarter. All
points of reference suggest that the consumer is drinking
more light and premium light beers."
   Coors, of Golden, Colo., is expected to have at least a
break-even quarter, compared with a loss of 13 cents a share.
Analysts credit the company's Keystone beer brand, introduced
last September. The so-called popular-price beer, Keystone
has been selling well above expectations because of a strong
marketing campaign and the flagging fortunes of some smaller
competitors.

   Big Board Specialists' Return on Capital
   Plunged to Record Low of 5.9% Last Year

   NEW YORK -- The Wall Street recession has found its way
inside the New York Stock Exchange, where last year's return
on market makers' capital plunged to 5.9%, the lowest level
on record.
   The specialists, the 46 firms that make markets in
individual stocks on the Big Board floor, found their
after-tax annualized return on capital fell to about half the
1988 level of 11.7%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest return is "the lowest since the exchange began
reporting these figures in 1981," said a spokeswoman for the
exchange.
   The small return underscores the price wars sweeping the
Wall Street stock-trading business and the pressures faced by
many brokerage firms, who pay the specialists commissions. It
also reflects the growing competition faced by the Big Board
from regional and off-exchange trading.
   "It is indicative of the same squeezes in the rest of the
industry," said Robert B. Fagenson, president of the
specialist firm Fagenson &amp; Co. "Volume is down and trading
opportunities are down. Our revenue is someone else's
expense, and when our customers, the brokerage firms, are
under tremendous strains, we are one of the sitting ducks."
   In the past, Big Board specialists have had years of
stupendous returns. In 1987, they finished with a 15.5%
return on capital despite the October crash. The best year on
record is 1983, when they earned 17.4%.
   But recently, specialists and Wall Street brokers have
been feuding over trading costs. The big brokers argue that
their clients incessantly demand lower commissions. In turn,
the brokers want the trading-floor firms to cut fees.
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in January even started shipping orders
of 5,000 shares or fewer to the Midwest Stock Exchange to
pressure the floor firms to cut rates, though specialists say
that after about a month Goldman sent the orders back to the
Big Board.
   "The {specialists'} portion of the commission pie is in
most cases higher than it should be," says Dudley Eppel, head
of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "Rates on
the floor have not come down the way they have upstairs."
   The pressure is still on, though negotiations are quieter
these days. Trading volume has stunted commissions so far in
1990 for both the "upstairs" traders and the floor firms.
Average daily New York Stock Exchange volume fell 3.7% in the
first quarter to 159.2 million shares from 165.3 million in
the year-earlier period. Also, some brokerage firms are
parting with their traditional alliance to the Big Board and
sending orders to regional exchanges and off-exchange market
makers where trades are cheaper.
   In another sign that times are tough on the Big Board
floor, New York Stock Exchange seat prices are falling
sharply this year. In February, a seat was sold for $351,000,
the lowest price since January 1985.
   Despite the gloom, a few brokerage and specialist
executives think the bottom of the Wall Street recession may
be in sight.
   "Wall Street is going through a cycle that we've been
through many times before," says Donald Stone, New York Stock
Exchange vice chairman and senior partner at the specialist
firm Lasker, Stone &amp; Stern. "In the 1990s, there will be the
realization that equities are the place to be and we will go
into a very big stock market."
   Charles B. Milligan, co-director of PaineWebber Group
Inc.'s equity department, which recently bought a Big Board
specialist firm, adds: "The New York Stock Exchange has had a
lot more difficult times than it's weathering now. If a
specialist firm is a franchise, and if you staff it
correctly, you should be able to make a great deal of money."

   East Germany Girds for Business Boom

   EAST BERLIN -- Siegfried Schliemann watched communism
slowly mangle his family's business.
   The small sweater factory, founded by his grandfather in
1926, was taken over by the state in 1972. Then, in 1981, it
was folded into one of East Germany's unwieldy conglomerates,
lumped together with companies producing everything from
safety helmets to boat propellers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They called it `rationalization,'" says Mr. Schliemann,
who was allowed to stay on as the firm's state-appointed
manager. I call it crazy."
   His main task in recent years, he says, was to preserve
some semblance of enterprise in a company where he couldn't
fire anyone or decide how many sweaters to produce. Now, he
is determined to make up for the blunders of the past.
   As East Germany lurches toward a free market, born-again
entrepreneurs like Mr. Schliemann are wasting no time seizing
the opportunity. Once a devout Communist, Mr. Schliemann has
applied to reprivatize the company, and he has combed West
Germany in search of partners to help him retool the
260-employee enterprise, VEB Berliner Strickmoden.
   "I'm a Berliner down to my bones," proclaims 60-year-old
Mr. Schliemann, "and I'm going to fight for a piece of this
market."
   He isn't alone. With rigid economic controls crumbling,
East Germany is poised for a burst of business activity.
Thousands of East Germans are expected to reclaim family
firms; many others are launching ventures -- everything from
grocery stores and restaurants to auto-repair shops and
medical clinics -- often with the help of West German
partners. Meanwhile, some of the state's huge conglomerates
have started to break up, with economically viable divisions
trying to shake off money-losing partners. By one West German
estimate, there may be 500,000 businesses about to be born in
East Germany.
   "We're expecting an avalanche of new companies to be
founded in the next six months alone," says Heinz Borchardt,
an economist at East Germany's fledgling small-business
association. The association, launched in January, already
claims 22,000 members and its own glossy magazine, called
"Market Economy."
   The financing for East Germany's business boom will be
provided by wealthy West Germans. The entire East German
car-and-truck industry, for example, is already a virtual
subsidiary of West German car makers. "But it's the East
Germans themselves who have the advantage in forging small
businesses," says Mr. Borchardt. "They're closer to the
market."
   New businesses are crucial to the country's economic
revival. As the Germanys hurtle toward monetary merger, the
East's creaking factories are expected to spew out as many as
two million unemployed, out of a population of only 16
million. A vibrant small-business sector could soak up some
of this excess labor.
   Bonn has poured six billion West German marks ($3.53
billion) into a special loan program for small and midsize
businesses, open to Germans from either side of the border.
West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said
yesterday that 3,000 loan applications worth nearly two
billion marks have already rolled in, most from East Germans
eager to set up family businesses.
   Meanwhile, many East Germans have figured out how to
bypass obstacles like the currency problem. Peter Wollanik,
owner of a small East Berlin interior-design company, is
restocking his shop with Western equipment and fabrics. Like
many entrepreneurs, he found a West German supplier willing
to ship materials, which he pays for at a rate of three East
German marks for one West German mark. The West German
suppliers, who have no guarantee they will get such a
favorable rate for their East German earnings, do so to lock
themselves into the new market.
   East Germans admit they are sometimes stymied by the ins
and outs of a market economy. Managers at East Germany's
state-run factories lived in a sheltered world of dictated
production targets and controlled prices. "Our people have
simply never learned how to deal with the consequences of a
market economy," says Manfred Pushmann, director of
management studies at East Berlin's Institute for Business
Management.
   There aren't many places an East German can go for help.
East Germany's small-business association is holding
market-economy seminars in various East German cities. "Our
people need answers to questions that nobody could even
imagine asking a few months ago -- like what's marketing?"
says Mr. Borchardt, the association's economist.
   Yet many of those who claim to offer answers to such
questions are viewed with suspicion. "I keep wondering where
these people were six months ago," says Mr. Wollanik, the
interior designer. East Berlin's Institute for Business
Management is offering expertise. But until a few months ago,
it was better known as the Communist Party Central
Committee's Institute for Socialist Economic Management.
   "We get half a dozen East Germans coming in here every day
asking for advice on how to get started in business," says
Ulrich Schmid, an East Berlin-based representative of West
Germany's Dresdner Bank AG. Western banks aren't yet allowed
to do business in the East, but many have set up
representative offices that dole out free advice.
   Mr. Schmid says some visitors have good ideas, such as the
two teen-agers who want to set up a courier service
specializing in sound equipment for Western rock bands. The
boys had studied the market, calculating that many bands
would use the recent political changes to stage East European
tours this summer.
   "I would have given them the loan, if I were in a position
to do so," says Mr. Schmid. "They were the
dishwasher-to-millionaire types."
   But even with the surge in private enterprise, East
Germany still faces a tough task creating fertile ground for
business. East Germany's Communist bosses built up an
elaborate system of disincentives for private firms, and the
country's newly elected democratic government hasn't begun
tackling legislation to create a true market economy.

   90% Rise in Profit
   For First Quarter

</IN>
<LP>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Hilton Hotels Corp., regrouping
after its assets-sale plan derailed, expects to report that
earnings rose approximately 90% to about $25 million, or from
50 to 52 cents a share, in the first quarter.
   In the year-earlier period, the company had net income of
$13.1 million, or 27 cents a share. Revenue is expected to be
about $264 million, compared with $225.1 million reported a
year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In his first interview since the hotel-casino concern
scrapped its auction last month, Barron Hilton, chairman and
chief executive officer, said he's "very enthusiastic" about
developing the company's core businesses. "We weren't going
to accept a transaction in an unfavorable climate," Mr.
Hilton says of the disappointing proposals.
   JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago and an investor group led by
NWA Inc. executives Alfred Checchi, Frederic Malek and Gary
Wilson both submitted proposals to acquire Hilton's assets
for far less than the $5 billion or even $6 billion that many
analysts had anticipated last year.
   For the quarter, Mr. Hilton said, both major Las Vegas
hotel-casinos should report record results despite increased
competition. Operating profit from the gambling segment
should more than double, he said.
   Hotel operating profit rose about 7%, despite the adverse
effects of a three-week strike at the Hilton Hawaiian Village
and continuing softness in the San Francisco hotel market
after the earthquake in October. The gains stemmed in part
from strong occupancy rates in New York, Chicago, New Orleans
and other key cities.
   Although Mr. Hilton said he is "very optimistic about this
year," he stressed that the marked improvements in
first-quarter results won't necessarily set the pace for the
rest of 1990, for several reasons.
   In the 1989 first quarter, Hilton's Nevada casinos
experienced a streak of bad luck at the gaming tables, as
well as an expensive boxing promotion, that contributed to a
50% decline in profit from gambling operations. The
prior-year results were also affected by construction
disruptions in Reno, start-up costs from two new hotels, and
an early Easter holiday that is normally a soft time for the
hotel business.
   In the 1990 first quarter, hotel occupancy is expected to
be relatively flat at about 66%, influenced in part by a
handful of properties that are still in their first year of
operation.
   Mr. Hilton noted that the construction at the Flamingo
Hilton, which disrupted walk-in traffic for several months in
1989, is finished. O'Shea's, a casino with an Irish theme
that opened next door to the Flamingo Hilton, had its first
profitable month in March following a weaker-than-expected
opening last year.
   The Reno property should report record results in March,
despite a snowstorm over the normally busy President's Day
weekend. Mr. Hilton said the 2,000 room hotel-casino in
Laughlin, Nev., is on schedule to open in August.

   Browning-Ferris Plans to Leave Business
   Of Hazardous Waste and Take Charge

   Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., stumbling over
environmental regulations, plans to sell its hazardous
waste-disposal business and to take a charge of $295 million
for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31.
   For the huge waste hauler, No. 2 in its industry, the
abrupt exit from hazardous waste signals a defeat for its
strategy begun in 1988 to boost its environmental image. That
year, the company, based in Houston, named former
Environmental Protection Agency head William D. Ruckelshaus
chairman and chief executive officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the presence of Mr. Ruckelshaus, previously
praised by both environmentalists and industry competitors,
Browning-Ferris has been plagued with compliance problems in
New York, Louisiana and Ohio.
   In an interview, Mr. Ruckelshaus insisted the
environmental problems weren't decisive in the company's
departure from hazardous waste, but he conceded the problems
have caused "tension" within the company. He said
Browning-Ferris will focus on solid waste, recycling and
medical waste as its growth areas.
   Mr. Ruckelshaus blamed the move away from hazardous waste
on low profit margins, compared with its other businesses.
"They {margins} just aren't attractive enough, even assuming
we can overcome the regulatory problems, which I think we
could."
   Last month, a Dallas regional office of the EPA said two
of the company's units in Louisiana agreed to pay about $1.5
million to settle allegations that they violated hazardous
waste-disposal rules.
   Moreover, the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation last month denied a Browning-Ferris subsidiary
the state permits necessary to construct a new hazardous
waste cell at a landfill in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   In its statement yesterday, Browning-Ferris said a unit
has agreed with the Ohio attorney general's office to pay a
$25,000 fine and plead guilty to violating an environmental
law at its Williamsburg, Ohio, facility. The company also
will pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, establish an
environmental trust fund of $1 million for the state and pay
an additional $1 million to Clermont County. The cost of the
Ohio penalties are included in the one-time $295-million
charge.
   Hazardous waste produces just 2% of Browning-Ferris's
revenue, and the segment has had operating losses for the
past year and a half, the company said.
   In the year-ago quarter, the company had net income of
$58.8 million, or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $594.9
million.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, the company's shares fell 25 cents to $35.375.
   Analysts said Browning-Ferris's decision to quit hazardous
waste comes at a time of increasing litigation in the
industry, concerns about liability for the health of
residents near landfills and rapidly rising costs for
technology that satisfies stricter environmental regulations.
"Managing a hazardous waste-disposal site in 1990 is much
more complicated and costly than it was 10 years ago," said
Kan Hahn, an analyst at Chicago Corp. She said
Browning-Ferris entered the hazardous waste field in 1982.
   "Today, your disposal site has to have synthetic
double-liners, costly air emissions systems and much more
detailed record-keeping," said Ms. Hahn. "{Mr.} Ruckelshaus
tried to make major improvements in Browning-Ferris's
operation but the company was already too far behind when he
arrived, without committing a lot more capital."
   The company's newest hazardous waste-disposal site is
scheduled to open soon in Last Chance, Colo. A spokesman said
the new state-of-the art facility is part of the assets being
put up for sale.
   It is uncertain where the company will find a buyer for
hazardous waste-disposal sites. One possibility is Chemical
Waste Management Inc., based in Oak Brook, Ill., the nation's
largest hazardous waste concern. But a Chemical Waste
spokesman, reached late yesterday, said it was too soon to
comment on the likelihood of such an acquisition, and other
company officials couldn't be reached.
   Mr. Ruckelshaus said he plans to continue running
Browning-Ferris. Yesterday's announcement "has no effect on
me," he said, adding, "It just didn't make sense to stay in
that business."

   Japan's Securities Firms Await Aftershocks

   TOKYO -- Takuya Iwasaki is president of one of Japan's
biggest brokerage houses, Nikko Securities Co. So his
subordinates were astonished two weeks ago when he barely
mentioned the Tokyo stock market's recent nose dive in a
speech to Nikko managers.
   Mr. Iwasaki may have dodged it then, but the crash of what
had been the world's richest stock market is sure to consume
a lot more of his time in the future. The 27% decline in the
market's value since the start of the year will shake up
Japan's powerful securities industry, analysts and industry
insiders agree.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rumors that the collapse in share prices might bring down
a Japanese securities house shook Wall Street on Wednesday
and carried stocks sharply lower early Thursday in Tokyo,
before they recovered. A number of big stock-market
speculators are said to be in financial trouble because of
their exposure to the market, but analysts say any associated
losses will be spread among enough securities firms to
prevent any bankruptcies.
   Nonetheless, profits could be cut in half in the coming
year at Japan's biggest securities houses, including Nikko.
Smaller firms may be forced into mergers. Banks, until now
all but banned from the securities industry, may be allowed
to slip into the business under the guise of helping troubled
brokers.
   And U.S. and European securities firms, which have been
making big strides in the Tokyo market over the past half
decade, will face stiff competitive challenges. In the wake
of the Tokyo market's plunge, profit-hungry Japanese
securities firms will try to expand into selling foreign
stocks, doing computer-assisted program trading and offering
more securities research -- areas until now dominated by
foreign houses.
   "There's a bear market in Japan," says Richard Greer,
managing director in Tokyo of Baring Securities Co., a
London-based firm that has made its reputation and about 60%
of its profits by specializing in Japanese investments.
"Liquidity is gone," he says. "Interest is waning. Investors
are going to need persuading to stay in the market."
   "It's going to be very difficult to make a buck out there
in 1990," says J. Brian Waterhouse, a financial analyst at
James Capel &amp; Co., a British brokerage house.
   Few professionals expect layoffs of the sort that have
ravaged the securities industry on Wall Street and in the
City of London. In harmony-conscious Japan, firings aren't
likely to become common. Still, the financial consequences of
an atrophying stock market will be severe for an industry
that has seen its clout expand globally in recent years.
   Just how severe isn't clear yet. Securities companies in
Japan are notoriously shy about discussing their fortunes,
and few executives would talk on the record about their
industry. But based on a review of the industry's results in
the six months ended last Sept. 30, some analysts are
concluding that the market crash could halve the profits of
Japan's Big Four securities firms.
   That would be an abrupt reversal for the companies --
Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Yamaichi
Securities Co. and Nikko -- all of which have predicted
record earnings for the year that ended last Saturday, March
31. Those results aren't out yet. But, thanks to a strong
year in the first three quarters of its financial year, most
analysts expect Nomura, the biggest securities firm in the
world, to report consolidated net profits for a second year
running of more than 240 billion yen ($1.5 billion).
   Nomura officials declined to discuss their operations,
however those figures would make it the most profitable
financial company in the world.
   The turmoil in Japan's financial markets this year could
end that success. "In a severe market downturn, where
everything goes to hell, Nomura could still make huge
profits," says Robert G. Zielinski, a financial analyst at
Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. "But there's no question all
the securities firms will be hurt by a prolonged bear
market."
   Among the Japanese stocks that have fallen most in recent
days have been those of the major securities companies. Since
the end of last year, Daiwa's share price has fallen 45.3%,
Yamaichi's has dropped 43.8%, Nikko's is off 44.1% and
Nomura's has lost 45.7%.
   A breakdown of the revenues of Japan's Big Four houses
shows that they are highly dependent on three basic sources
of income: stock and bond trading commissions; stock and bond
underwriting commissions; and in-house trading of securities.
The market's decline, concedes a senior executive at Daiwa,
"will have a big impact."
   As Tokyo stock-market volatility has increased this year,
trading volume has fallen by nearly half from a year ago.
That means that commission income is sharply lower.
Underwriting fees have dried up, largely because of a
self-imposed ban by the securities industry on new issues of
stocks and equity-linked bonds. The ban was intended to prop
up the market by forcing money into existing shares, not
newly issued securities. "About 2.3 trillion yen in new
issues disappeared overnight, and that's a lot of gravy,"
says James Capel's Mr. Waterhouse.
   Even in-house trading revenues will fall sharply because
of the evaporation of one of the hottest profit centers for
Japanese securities companies: warrants. Warrants are sold
together with corporate bonds, usually issued in the
deregulated Euromarkets. They give the holder the right to
buy the issuer's stock at a set price by a specified date.
Because the Japanese firms arranged most warrant-bond issues
for companies here, they were able to hold on to warrants
until the instruments were "in the money," or profitable, and
then sell them to retail clients for an easy profit.
   Analysts estimate the Big Four made as much as one-third
of their profit from the warrant market in the fiscal year
ended March 31. Now that stocks are falling, though, trading
activity in the $50 billion warrant market has nearly
disappeared.
   Japan's individual investors haven't been big sellers of
stock yet, instead they are holding on to their shares in
hopes of a rebound. But there are few buyers, and many people
who keep their savings in stock mutual funds are shifting the
money into fixed-income accounts.
   That hurts the Japanese securities industry. Of the 272
firms that belong to the Japan Securities Dealers'
Association, more than 200 depend almost entirely on retail,
or individual-investor, brokerage and investment-trust
business.
   As a result, some firms may retrench. Norio Watanabe, a
strategist at the Credit Suisse Bank, predicts that if hard
times continue, Japanese authorities may take the opportunity
of the market's decline to force some small houses into
mergers with one another.
   Even the government's own Financial System Research
Council often has hinted at the need for consolidation of
Japan's sprawling retail securities industry; the crash might
give the country's powerful Finance Ministry the impetus to
bring it about.
   But authorities are wary of splicing small firms together
with the Big Four houses, which already dominate as much as
two-thirds of many securities businesses. As a result, some
analysts speculate that the ministry might try to match
troubled small securities houses with Japanese banks.

   PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it agreed
to sell its soft-drink beverage business to a group led by
management of the unit. In addition, Westinghouse said it
will purchase a 15% stake in the new company. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   A Westinghouse spokesman said the company expects to
record a gain from the sale, which is expected to close in
the current quarter. However, the spokesman declined to be
more specific.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Financing will be provided by Citicorp Venture Capital
Ltd., a unit of Citibank; Hong Capital Investors Limited
Partnership, managed by Hong &amp; Co., of Richmond, Va.; and
other institutional investors, Westinghouse said.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Westinghouse closed at $74.875, down 25 cents.
   The divestiture of the beverage group, a leading bottler
of brands such as 7-Up and Royal Crown, had been expected.
Sale of the unit, which has estimated annual sales of about
$400 million, marks the last major divestiture expected to be
made during the tenure of John C. Marous, chairman and chief
executive officer. Mr. Marous will retire later this year,
and will be succeeded by Paul E. Lego, president and chief
operating officer.
   The beverage group, based in Vernon, Calif., also bottles
and distributes A&amp;W Root Beer, Sunkist Orange, Hawaiian Punch
and Seagram's Wine Coolers. It also distributes Perrier and
Evian bottled water, the company said.
   Last year, Mr. Marous signaled that the beverage group was
on the block because it had been hurt by pricing competition
within the soft-drink industry.
   In the past three years, Westinghouse has shed businesses
representing $2.64 billion in annual revenue while acquiring
more than 70 smaller businesses with revenue of about $1.5
billion.
   Westinghouse has interests in broadcasting, defense
electronics, community development, financial services and
over-the-road refrigeration.

   DETROIT -- It was a poignant scene: Robert W. Kearns, an
unknown and nearly broken man, had stepped before the judge
to explain, in a figurative way, why he was suing the world's
biggest car companies.
   "I'm wearing a little badge here, and that badge says I am
an inventor," he said at the court hearing in 1980. "Maybe
you can't see the badge. I don't think anybody is going to be
able to see the badge until my trial is finished."

   What's more, Mr. Kearns insisted, he is an inventor of
substance, not some eccentric tinkerer with a wild story
about a big company stealing his creation and, with it,
millions of dollars in royalties. It was he who designed the
first practical, electronic intermittent windshield wiper --
the popular stop-and-go system now found on millions of cars.
And it was Ford Motor Co. and others, he claimed, who pirated
the invention.
   Mr. Kearns's lawsuits would drag on for years, and show
how consuming this sort of pursuit of vindication can be. In
the course of battle, he suffered an emotional breakdown. He
was dropped by three law firms. He sparred with judges. And
he relied heavily on his son Dennis, who, on one occasion,
proposed intimidating Ford lawyers with a .45-caliber pistol,
and, on another, had an affair with a paralegal in an
opposition camp -- and came away with a fistful of
incriminating documents. "I don't think there's been a patent
case like this one before," grumbles the judge presiding over
the suits.
   Intent in his cause, Mr. Kearns, now 62 years old, waged
an extraordinary and solitary crusade. Then, on Jan. 29, a
jury returned an equally extraordinary decision.
   Given to rumpled clothing, his hair white and wispy, Mr.
Kearns looks the part of the eccentric inventor. He once
dreamed of getting rich in Detroit supplying his wiper to the
world's auto makers, but he ended up with a much more obscure
career: studying the skid resistance of highway surfaces for
the U.S. government. Even after abandoning Detroit for
Maryland, he still considered himself the righteous David in
a world of Goliaths. So he sued them all: Ford, General
Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp., Daimler-Benz AG, Porsche AG,
Toyota Motor Corp. and 18 other auto makers.
   The federal district judge overseeing the Ford case, Avern
Cohn, has imposed a gag order on participants in the trial,
so Mr. Kearns, his family, his lawyers and Ford have refused
comment for this article. Nonetheless, the story of Robert
Kearns and his invention is amply told in stacks of
depositions and motions that fill more than a half-dozen
boxes in Detroit's federal courthouse.
   It begins in 1962, when Robert Kearns was 35 years old and
simultaneously a professor at Wayne State University in
Detroit and a Ph.D. candidate in engineering at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland. At the time, Mr. Kearns was
trying to devise a project for his doctoral dissertation. "I
had chosen a rather elaborate topic that the professor
thought would cost me $30,000," he said in his court
testimony. "I began to think of something that might be of
lower cost."
   What followed was the kind of inspiration that separates
inventors from ordinary people. Mr. Kearns had been virtually
blind in his left eye since a flying champagne cork hit him
in the face on his wedding night. That injury, he says, made
him think about how his eyes worked, and specifically, how
his eyes were periodically cleaned when he blinked. This
observation sparked an idea: Why not develop windshield
wipers that would "blink" too. That way, during light rain,
the wipers would just occasionally clear the windshield.
   Mr. Kearns began to tinker. He was familiar with
transistors, thanks to a four-year stint in the military
research labs of Bendix Corp. He had a test car: The Kearns
family 1962 Ford Galaxy convertible. And he had access to a
cheap supply of windshield wiper motors, courtesy of his
brother, Martin, who had a low-level job in Ford's research
labs.
   By October 1963, Robert Kearns had produced a working
prototype of his "blinking" wiper. The key elements were a
collection of circuits hidden inside a red metal box mounted
on his 1962 Ford. The device was far from perfect. When it
got hot, for instance, the wipers would suddenly switch on by
themselves -- rain or no rain. Nonetheless, on Oct. 22, 1963,
Mr. Kearns drove out to meet with two Ford engineers to see
if they were interested.
   They were. And that began a six-year waltz between Mr.
Kearns and Ford. Ford engineers had been trying to develop an
intermittent wiper of their own. But their devices relied on
a variety of mechanical systems -- plungers, springs and
diaphragms. Mr. Kearns's system was more advanced and
reliable because it was controlled electronically.
   Mr. Kearns quickly fixed the problem that caused his
wipers to jump into action in hot weather. During the next
year, he tested the system's durability by running the wipers
for six months in a fish tank filled with oil and sawdust.
Then he took out the first of several patents.
   But his dreams of ascending into the affluent ranks of
Detroit's auto-parts suppliers soon came a cropper. Between
1966 and 1969, Mr. Kearns worked with Ford, passing along
details about his wiper in return for encouraging words, but
little else. Ford officials even gave him an award: A
specially mounted, two-speed wiper motor. But they didn't
give him a contract.
   Instead, according to Ford documents and testimony at the
trial, Ford engineers were busy dissecting the Kearns wiper.
Then, in 1969, the auto maker introduced an electronically
controlled, intermittent wiper system that incorporated many
of Mr. Kearns's ideas -- something a Ford official
acknowledged under cross examination during the trial.
   Mr. Kearns was stunned. Ford, however, insisted the system
was Ford's own, and that Mr. Kearns's patents were based on
common knowledge, and therefore not valid. For the next eight
years, Mr. Kearns and his lawyers traded letters with Ford
and its lawyers. Meanwhile, Mr. Kearns began what his lawyers
describe as a spiral into emotional collapse.
   By 1971, Mr. Kearns had moved to Gaithersburg, Md., and
had gone to work for what was then the National Bureau of
Standards. From this obscure post, Mr. Kearns, aided by his
son Dennis, continued his fight with Ford. The younger Mr.
Kearns, then in his 20s, was launching a career as a private
investigator by helping his father get dirt on auto makers.
   Dennis Kearns says that, in July 1976, he bought a control
box for a Mercedes Benz intermittent wiper system from an
auto dealer and obtained the wiring diagram that went with
it. Robert Kearns, worried that his invention was being
pirated by Daimler-Benz, too, began composing his own diagram
of the Mercedes system to see if it matched his patents. In
the midst of this effort, he suffered his emotional collapse.
"He never finished the drawing," Dennis Kearns says today.
   According to court documents filed by his lawyers, Mr.
Kearns had experienced an "emotional breakdown . . . so
severe that it caused {him} to run away from home and wander
aimlessly through three states." He wound up in a hospital.
   Since then, Mr. Kearns has often portrayed himself as a
man clinging to sanity after years of battling his giant
adversaries. "My psychiatrist advises me there is always the
possibility that I could go over the brink," he once told the
court. "And if I go over the second time, it might be
permanent."
   By January 1978, Mr. Kearns had recovered sufficiently to
start filing suits, starting with Ford. By 1985 he had sued
virtually every major auto maker, accusing them of stealing
his ideas. (He also tried manufacturing his wiper in Ireland,
but never found financing for the venture.)
   Not surprisingly, the federal court boggled at the sheer
volume of the litigation and its complexity. Mr. Kearns's
testy relations with the three law firms that ultimately
dropped him didn't help speed things along. Firm No. 1 --
Harness, Dickey &amp; Pierce of Birmingham, Mich. -- quit in
1979, less than a year after filing Mr. Kearns's first suit.
In a motion asking the court to let them leave the case,
Harness lawyers said Mr. Kearns berated them with "constant
verbal reprimands." The lawyers also weren't too happy about
Dennis Kearns's packing a heater.
   Harness said in its motion that Dennis Kearns drew the .45
and declared he wanted to leave it "exposed" during a meeting
with Ford lawyers so they "would be impressed with his
seriousness." Harness said it told Mr. Kearns, before Ford's
lawyers arrived, "to take the weapon out to his car . . . and
never bring it to our office again."
   Harness's successor, Washington patent lawyer Richard L.
Aitken, lasted less than two years. He got out in December
1980 after complaining to the court about Mr. Kearns's
demands. Mr. Kearns, according to his lawyers' testimony,
would sometimes refuse to let his own attorneys see his
records, fight even routine requests by the defense for
information, and turn down settlement offers. When
Daimler-Benz AG and Porsche AG offered to pay $150,000 each
to settle his suits against them, Mr. Kearns said no. "I was
not interested in any money settlement," he said in a 1980
hearing. "What I am looking for is a purchase order" -- an
agreement to supply the wipers.
   Mr. Aitken was unimpressed, particularly since Mr. Kearns
already owed his firm $25,000 in fees. He also was tired of
the hail of motions and counter-motions that delayed the
case. So he quit.
   Chicago litigators Keith V. Rockey and Thomas C. Elliott
of McDougall, Hersh &amp; Scott signed on next, and lasted nearly
six years. They would later label their client
"recalcitrant." But it was Dennis Kearns's amorous exploits
that made them bolt for the exit.
   Dennis Kearns is the oldest of six children, and, unlike
his father, is a natty dresser given to stylish suits, French
cuffs and a large gold ring on his right hand. His private
detective agency, Phoenix Group International Inc., occupies
a suite of small offices in the tony Detroit suburb of
Birmingham. Two samurai swords rest on a black wood stand
behind his desk.
   The younger Mr. Kearns has said he is innocent of any
wrongdoing in his relationship with the paralegal. In 1985,
he told the court that he met the woman, Laurie J.
Fitzpatrick, at a paralegal seminar in Washington, D.C. He
says Ms. Fitzpatrick, who worked for an opposition law firm,
offered him the documents, which included records of Porsche
internal meetings discussing the Kearns wiper.
   Ms. Fitzpatrick, however, offered a different story. In a
1985 deposition, she said Dennis Kearns met her at the
seminar and asked her out for a drink. That began their
eight-month relationship. One day, she said, he called her at
work to say her employers had agreed to provide him with
certain documents. He then gave her a sketchy description of
the papers, and added: "I want to see you tonight, you can
give them to me then."
   "Like a dummy, it didn't occur to me to check this out,"
she said. They met at her apartment, where she handed over
copies of the documents. Then they went to a restaurant, and
Mr. Kearns broke off the affair. (Ms. Fitzpatrick couldn't be
located for comment, and her former law firm has since
disbanded.)
   Lawyers for Porsche discovered the leak when the papers
turned up in court filings. At the time, Judge Philip Pratt
was presiding over the case and, after reviewing the
controversy, he sided with Ms. Fitzpatrick. "Her testimony
was candid, even though at some points painful," he wrote in
his opinion. He ordered the elder Mr. Kearns to pay nearly
$134,000 in penalties as punishment for his son's
"outrageous" conduct. (Dennis Kearns, who provided comment
for this article on this issue alone, says he may appeal the
decision.)
   The flap, and the subsequent death of Judge Pratt, helped
delay a trial of the lawsuits for several more years. The
cases got moving again when Judge Cohn took over in early
1989 and decided to try the suit against Ford first. Finally,
in January, the case went to trial.
   By this point, Mr. Kearns was on his fourth set of
lawyers, William Durkee and Paul M. Janicke of the Houston
firm Arnold, White &amp; Durkee. Their refrain sounds a bit
familiar: "Sometimes, it's hard for me to get things across"
to Mr. Kearns, one Arnold White attorney said in court.
   The trial lasted three weeks and, on Jan. 29, the six
jurors returned with their verdict. It had taken Mr. Kearns
fully 12 years of wrangling in court to get to this stage. By
his own account, the effort had left him financially ravaged.
"My kids are commuting 35 miles {to college}, they're driving
on bald tires," Mr. Kearns lamented at one point. "That is
the sort of price I'm paying to be here."
   But the resilience ultimately won him his vindication. The
jury declared Mr. Kearns in the right, and said Ford stole
his idea for the wiper.
   Ford's potential exposure is huge. Internal Ford studies
ordered into evidence indicate the auto maker has sold more
than 16 million cars with intermittent wiper systems. The
systems currently sell for about $20 each -- of which as much
as half is gross profit to Ford, according to calculations by
Mr. Kearns's attorneys.
   Ford's best hope in avoiding a whopping judgment, assuming
there isn't an out-of-court settlement, now appears to be
Judge Cohn. Already, the judge has ruled that, based on
precedent, Mr. Kearns's award can't be a share of Ford's
profits from intermittent wiper sales. And earlier this
month, he said, "If the jury came back with a judgment of
$500 million, I'd be constrained to set it aside as shocking
to judicial conscience." The jury is expected to begin
deliberating on an award this month, and Ford is expected to
appeal.
   The fact that the case dragged on for 12 years may, in the
end, be to Mr. Kearns's advantage. When he filed his suit
against Ford in 1978, the climate in the federal courts was
hostile to patent holders, experts say. But by the time the
Kearns case came to trial, this attitude had shifted: More
infringement cases were being decided in favor of patent
holders. And, the appeals court was letting more of those
decisions stand.
   What is more, the appellate court has effectively removed
many of the limits that constrained damage awards in the
1960s and 1970s. Now, "the damages are out of sight," says
Harold C. Wegner, a Washington patent lawyer.
   In January, for instance, a Chicago federal-court jury
ordered toy maker Mattel Inc. to pay Jerome H. Lemelson $24.8
million, plus interest estimated at an additional $46
million, for violating his patent on flexible plastic toy
tracks. Mattel, which is appealing the judgment, sold the
tracks for its Hot Wheels toy cars.
   At the very least, the Ford decision will give Mr. Kearns
big leverage in his pending cases against other auto makers,
leverage that could win him rich settlements. After all, he
was found to have valid patents, which Ford violated. The
jury agreed with Mr. Kearns's defiant declaration: His badge
does read, Inventor.

   WASHINGTON -- The National Mediation Board ordered a
30-day cooling-off period in the deadlocked railroad labor
negotiations.
   The order blocks any strike at least until midnight May 5.
It is another step in the strike-stopping procedures of the
Railway Labor Act, under which the White House would
eventually name an emergency panel that would develop
recommendations for solving the health-cost issues and other
matters in dispute. White House officials have said that
President Bush is willing to name the emergency panel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The president may name the panel as soon as the Mediation
Board notifies the White House that the negotiating impasse
threatens to disrupt interstate commerce. That notification
is likely to occur soon.
   An emergency panel usually has 30 days to come up with
settlement recommendations, but the railroads and the unions
say they would allow until Sept. 15, and longer if necessary.
The parties also agreed they wouldn't take any action until
30 days after the emergency board reports, and in any event
won't act if Congress isn't in session. Congress typically
intervenes if the Railway Labor Act fails to prevent a
strike.

   CREDIT-CARD companies are issuing more cards to
small-business clients and offering them more services.
That's good news for small companies, which have watched
banks tighten credit for small-business borrowers.
   MasterCard International and American Express Co., for
example, are stepping up already vigorous marketing programs
for cards aimed at small and mid-sized companies. And banks
in local markets, such as Chemical Bank in New York, are
heavily promoting their own small-business credit-card
packages.
   The battle for new card holders includes slick direct-mail
offers and sponsorship of small-business seminars. American
Express has a small-business magazine in the works for
cardholders.
   The strategy is paying off. MasterCard's small-business
client base, already 60% of its one million BusinessCard
holders, grew by roughly 50% last year. American Express says
it has more than doubled its small-business customer roll
since 1985 to more than one million.
   "This is a high-growth area for the company, without
question," says Barbara Barsa, vice president for
small-business services at American Express. "We are starting
to market a lot more aggressively now."
   For instance, American Express will extend a card member's
payment period for purchases of certain office equipment such
as fax machines and personal computers. It also offers
insurance plans and a slew of discounts on items such as
hotel rooms and auto leasing.
   MasterCard offers insurance plans to holders of its
BusinessCard and a rolling monthly balance, helpful for
high-growth companies with limited cash flow. Credit lines
are around $5,000 a month. MasterCard also offers a toll-free
number for road service, targeted at small companies without
fleet service contracts.
                                                                                                       

   Top Franchise Sellers
   Reaping Big Rewards
                                                                                                       

   IN SHORT SUPPLY, specialists in selling franchises command
top dollar.
   "People who can effectively sell franchises are few and
far between," says Larry C. Jordan, president of Las Vegas
Discount Golf &amp; Tennis Inc., a Nevada-based franchiser of
sporting goods stores. Mr. Jordan has doubled the commission
rate paid to sales agents, to 10% from 5% two years ago, and
says he still has three sales jobs open.
   Demand for experienced franchise salespeople appears to
have outstripped the supply. Also, many franchises are
growing rapidly, and top sales executives are reaping the
rewards in the form of higher compensation.
   "The competition is getting keener, and there aren't
enough experienced people out there," says Jerry Wilkerson,
president of Franchise Recruiters Ltd., a Crete, Ill.,
recruiting firm.
   To keep their top sales performers from bolting,
franchisers are offering guaranteed compensation and, in some
cases, handsome bonuses, instead of traditional straight
commissions. Mr. Wilkerson says pay guarantees for recruited
franchising sales executives are about 10% higher than a year
ago and probably will rise another 15% this year to nearly
$100,000, on average.
                                                                                                       

   In Japan, Conveniences
   Converge at 7-Eleven
                                                                                                       

   COMBINING catalog sales with convenience stores is one
American company's strategy for success in Japan.
   New York-based Shop America Ltd. plans to give Japanese
consumers an alternative to the cumbersome, multi-layered
distribution system with seemingly endless middlemen that
inflates retail prices there. It's a members-only catalog
shopping network, dealing mostly in U.S.-made products, to be
run out of 3,940 7-Eleven outlets in Japan.
   Consumers pay $20 to join Shop America and place catalog
orders at their local 7-Eleven store, paying in yen. Orders
will be filled by air freight from Shop America's
distribution center in New Jersey within five to 12 days.
Sales are scheduled to begin in July.
   Even with long-distance shipping costs, Shop America's
president, Victor Fraenkel, thinks he can undercut the prices
of Japanese products on their own turf with such U.S.-made
items as audio cassettes, compact disks, golf and tennis
balls and cigarette lighters.
   "If I can reach Japanese consumers on a direct basis, I
can provide them with roughly the same pricing that exists in
America," Mr. Fraenkel says.
   Shop America's strategy is also a play on the soaring
popularity of convenience stores with young Japanese
consumers, who use them for a range of services beyond
shopping, such as paying utility bills and life insurance
premiums.
   Seven-Eleven Japan Co. is the largest overseas licensee of
Southland Corp. of Dallas. With sales of $5.4 billion last
year, it also is Japan's largest convenience store chain and
owns 50% of Shop America. Southland just agreed to sell a 75%
stake to 7-Eleven and its parent, Ito-Yokado Group, for $400
million.
   A 7-Eleven rival, Tokyo-based FamilyMart Co., is
test-marketing catalog sales at its convenience outlets in
Japan.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   CONNECTICUT has a legislative commission that is proposing
that employers with fewer than 25 workers be allowed to offer
a "no frills" package of medical benefits instead of the more
costly, broad-based health insurance now required by the
state. . . . SBA Administrator Susan Engeleiter says 98% of
the 520,000 new corporations formed in the first nine months
of 1989 were small businesses.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Japan reached an accord
designed to make it easier for Americans and other foreigners
to do business in Japan, while increasing U.S. savings and
competitiveness.
   If fully implemented, the agreement would be a watershed
in relations between the two nations. But it would require
legislative changes in both countries, which may be difficult
to achieve.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Japan agreed to open its retailing system, boost public
works spending, loosen its clubby business practices, and
strengthen antitrust legislation and patent protection. In
addition, Tokyo pledged to relax restrictive land-use
policies and restraints on foreign investment.
   The U.S., for its part, reiterated President Bush's
promises to encourage savings through tax changes, improve
education, expand research and development efforts, cut the
federal deficit, promote exports and liberalize imports of
steel and machine tools. American officials also pledged to
state clearly that the U.S. welcomes foreign investment. They
pointed to Washington's recent liberalization of energy
exports, particularly of Alaskan crude oil and liquefied
natural gas. The Commerce Department also has recently
recommended a partial relaxation on the ban of exports of
heavy crude oil from California. But the administration needs
congressional approval for many of its pledges, including one
to cut capital-gains taxes.
   The accord culminates negotiations that began last July to
address "structural impediments" to the U.S.-Japan economic
relationship. An interim report describing areas of agreement
will be followed by a final report in July.
   "I think the report demonstrates progress and hard work on
both sides," U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said.
"It's the first time the government of Japan has gone through
such a process and committed to remove barriers to trade."
She said Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu showed
"courage and leadership" in following this "unique approach
and report."
   At a news conference this morning in Tokyo, Mr. Kaifu
said, "I rate this highly as an achievement of joint exercise
by the two governments." He added that talks will "benefit
not only the two countries but also the whole world, serve to
prevent the rise of protectionism, and thus contribute to the
steady development of the world economy."
   But the report already is attracting skepticism,
particularly from Congress. "Put me down as a skeptic who's
seen too many agreements in which the results don't match the
rhetoric," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, (D., Texas), chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee. Previous U.S.-Japan trade
agreements "were like nothing so much as a drugstore cowboy
-- all hat and no cattle," the senator said.
   Just as some people in Washington question whether Japan
gave enough, critics in Tokyo are complaining that Japan gave
too much, particularly on retailing. The Japan Chamber of
Commerce and Industry released a statement saying there could
be "problems" from changing the distribution system and from
toughening antitrust penalties. Mr. Kaifu, in his news
conference, said Japan's measures "have been attained after
undergoing a difficult domestic process, and their
implementation may, in some cases, be painful." But, he said,
they are "essential in furthering Japan's own national
interest."
   He acknowledged that many of the changes will require the
cooperation of the opposition parties, which control the
upper house of the Diet.
   In the interim report, Japan promised to amend and
strengthen its anti-monopoly law to combat exclusionary
business practices, and also will strengthen its Fair Trade
Commission. It also will speed up its patent-approval
process, which frequently has frustrated foreign businessmen
seeking to protect their intellectual property.
   Moreover, the Japanese will increase disclosure of the
close "keiretsu" links between companies, which can promote
preferential group trade and anti-competitive business
practices. "We believe if the people of Japan have a better
understanding of this arrangement, there will be change,"
said Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Dallara.
   In addition, Tokyo will cut down the approval time
required for licensing large retail stores to 18 months
initially, and then to 12 months, from the current indefinite
period that's sometimes as long as 10 years. Stores that
devote roughly 1,000 square feet or more to foreign goods
will be granted licenses immediately. Japan also will seek to
ensure that it can clear imports any time of day; past delays
-- particularly for perishable goods -- have been costly to
foreign companies.
   Moreover, the Japanese have said they'll speed up eight
large public spending projects, including ports and airports,
which could mean business for American companies. They also
will abolish requirements that foreigners give notification
before investing in Japan. And they pledged a full review of
their land taxation system. Critics contend this system has
restricted land use and pushed up prices to prohibitive
levels, making it difficult for foreigners to buy into their
market.
   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Linn Williams said the
talks have "engendered a broad public debate in Japan" that
resulted in widespread approval of many of the measures that
the U.S. was requesting. "This is the first time they've
acknowledged there are barriers and made an attempt to
address them," he added. Michael Farren, an assistant
Commerce Department secretary, said the ruling Japanese party
now realizes that "the ultimate beneficiary (of the reforms
the U.S. requested) is the Japanese consumer."
   Some U.S. observers are dubious. "I think we've been here
before," said Clyde Prestowitz, of the Economic Strategy
Institute, a Washington-based think tank. "I'm reminded of
Yogi Berra's comment that this is deja vu all over again,"
said Mr. Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department official
who negotiated trade issues with Japan.
   But Mrs. Hills said, "I think there are very real
commitments to remove a number of structural impediments."
She indicated, however, that it would be "premature" for her
to decide whether to list Japan again this year as an unfair
trading partner under the Super 301 designation process. A
decision is expected on that issue at the end of this month.
   Japan's stock market and its currency have declined
sharply in recent weeks. There has been speculation that the
U.S. might use Japan's desire for international support for
its currency as a bargaining chip in the bilateral trade
talks. But State Department Undersecretary Richard McCormack,
who led the U.S. negotiating team, and Mr. Dallara denied
there was any trade-off or link between these talks and other
negotiations.
   This weekend, the Group of Seven industrialized countries
-- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada -- are scheduled to meet in Paris to discuss the
coordination of their macroeconomic policies. That meeting is
expected to discuss ways to shore up the weakened yen.
   In the interim report, Japan promised to amend and
strengthen its anti-monopoly law to provide stronger
penalties and ensure private damage remedies are effective,
said James Rill, the Justice Department's antitrust chief.
Japanese officials also agreed to strengthen the country's
Fair Trade Commission and speed up its patent-approval
process, which frequently has frustrated foreign businessmen
seeking to protect their intellectual property.
   Together, the U.S. and Japan account for more than
one-third of world-wide economic output. Japanese exports to
the U.S. totaled $93.6 billion in 1989, while U.S. exports to
Japan totaled $44.6 billion, leaving a $49 billion U.S. trade
deficit.

   SEATTLE -- A pensive Jim Nordstrom, his hands together as
in prayer, is trying to fathom the firestorm of controversy
that suddenly has marred the reputation for stellar service
at the retail chain bearing his name.
   "We were naive to think the product would speak for
itself," says the Nordstrom Inc. co-chairman. "We got our
brains beat out of us."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Nordstrom is smarting from the fallout of the fight
his family picked last year with its weak clerks union, which
has since retaliated with a barrage of accusations. There
have been national press accounts of complaints that the
retailer's vaunted service comes on the backs of its
salespeople. There's been a ruling by Washington state
regulators supporting that view. A union lawsuit. Shareholder
litigation. Even union allegations that Nordstrom deceives
shoppers by selling clothes its salespeople have worn -- a
charge Nordstrom denies.
   It is impossible to predict whether the union spat will
turn off Nordstrom customers or detract from the service they
receive. The company is in the midst of a major national
expansion. But whatever the outcome of the fight, the
Nordstroms are taking the attack on their family-run business
personally. They already pay some of the highest wages in
retailing.
   The company may have underestimated the abilities of a
modern union. It is learning firsthand that organized labor
is capable of tactics far more sophisticated than the
traditional strike or boycott. The United Food &amp; Commercial
Workers Union, which represents about 2,000 of Nordstrom's
30,000 employees, is now attracting national attention to
issues that Nordstrom had assumed last year were only of
local interest.
   "The tactics that were traditional in the past didn't work
out well in the 1980s," says Daniel Mitchell, an
industrial-relations professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles. He says that the Nordstrom case is
an example of a broad attempt by unions to try new
strategies.
   Nordstrom ignited the dispute last June when it angered
labor leaders with an unusual contract proposal: Optional
union membership for employees at its six stores in the
Seattle and Tacoma areas. When the Seattle local put the
proposal to a vote, only about 250 of its 1,500 members
showed up. They overwhelmingly rejected the idea.
   That's when the union, which has represented Nordstrom
employees in hometown Seattle for more than 60 years,
threatened to start a public-relations war. Nordstrom stood
its ground.
   "The company vastly underestimated our resolve to protect
not only this contract but the other retail contracts" in the
area, contends Joe Peterson, a former Nordstrom shoe salesman
who heads Local 1001. "Optional union dues systems are meant
to do one thing: to eliminate the contract."
   Company officials insist they aren't trying to bust the
union. Management proposed the contract change, Mr. Nordstrom
says, because employees had complained over the years about
mandatory union dues. "It's been a source of irritation for
what we felt was the majority," he says.
   President Jack McMillan, noting that union members in
Seattle get the same wages and benefits as non-union
Nordstrom salespeople elsewhere, calls the dues "a bad buy."
   The union considered a strike against popular Nordstrom
"suicidal," Mr. Peterson says. But it seized the opportunity
to take on the company over what has come to be known as the
"off-the-clock" issue.
   Mr. Peterson says Nordstrom salespeople complained to the
union that they were pressured to work without pay to attend
store meetings and to perform other duties such as stock
work, writing thank-you notes to customers and delivering
merchandise to customers' homes and offices. Initially, Mr.
Peterson says even he didn't believe that the practices were
widespread.
   Since then, a union inquiry uncovered 825 current and
former salespeople who claim the company owes them more than
$5.3 million in back wages. The state's Department of Labor
and Industries, backing the union, ordered Nordstrom to
change its practices and pay back wages. And the chain, after
months of denying the charges, created a $15 million reserve
for settling back-pay claims. It says it has already paid
about $1 million to workers outside Washington state. It also
changed its record-keeping procedures and vowed to pay
salespeople for all time worked.
   But Mr. Nordstrom insists "the off-the-clock issue is a
nothing issue." He hints that Nordstrom may challenge the
state ruling. "We don't think it will hold up under federal
scrutiny," he says. "We think the law says if the bulk of
their income is commissions, they're free to go to whatever
lengths they want to sell more things. If it means doing
things from home, we feel in most industries it means the
time doesn't have to be accounted for."
   The company also complains that it has been treated
unfairly by the press, including this newspaper, which a ran
a page one story in February on working conditions at the
company. Last week, Nordstrom announced a sharp cutback in
advertising in Seattle's two daily newspapers. Company
officials deny they were retaliating for unfavorable
coverage. Mr. Nordstrom was quoted in the Seattle Times as
saying "We think your coverage is horrible, the worst in the
nation."
   Nordstrom continues to believe the morale of most of its
employees is good -- but the union continues to fire a
fusillade of complaints about the company to regulators, the
courts and the press.
   At Nordstrom stores, where Mr. Peterson acknowledges that
union support "has always been the weakest" among the chains
he has under contract, employees are choosing sides. Some
have quit the union since its contract with Nordstrom expired
August 1. The pro-company forces have attended rallies in
Seattle and elsewhere along the West Coast.
   Roughly half of the employees in Seattle and Tacoma have
signed petitions seeking to decertify the union. "We're very
angry about the way the union has slandered the company and
the integrity of the people who work for the company," says
John Rockwood, a shoe salesman in Seattle leading one of the
anti-union drives.
   "All the salespeople here operate as entrepreneurs," he
says. As for the state's finding, he contends: "It's petty
little time-keeping stuff. We make twice as much money as
anybody else in the industry. We just haven't kept meticulous
records as to the time we have actually spent working for the
company."
   But the National Labor Relations Board last week dismissed
the Tacoma petition because of unresolved charges of unfair
labor practices. And Mr. Rockwood's decertification drive met
the same fate Monday. NLRB officials say they consider
decertification efforts inappropriate when charges of unfair
labor practices against an employer are pending.
   In one charge, which the labor board has consolidated into
its own complaint against the company, the union asserts that
Nordstrom enhanced employees' vacation benefits without
negotiating with the union. The labor board also is looking
into a union complaint that Nordstrom sponsored the
anti-union rallies.
   The union's Mr. Peterson contends that the company is
drumming up anti-union sentiment and aiding the anti-union
forces in other ways. He claims that Mr. Rockwood's schedule
was changed so he could lead the anti-union petition drive.
Mr. Rockwood says he was able to take a week off to gather
signatures because "business hasn't been great."
   Still, even Mr. Rockwood can't explain how green
pro-company buttons, proclaiming "No One Asked Us," suddenly
showed up in the stores in February. "They just appeared in
our department one morning," says Helen Thompson, who sells
designer women's clothes in Tacoma.
   Employees who support the union say the pressure from
management isn't subtle. "The atmosphere here is, if you're
pro-union, you're anti-Nordstrom," says Sherry Jacobson, who
sold women's clothes at the store in Bellevue, Wash., until
quitting this week. "Jim Nordstrom called me and said, `I
want to know why you have to hurt the company that way.'" She
says he was referring to interviews she had done with a
newspaper and a local TV station.
   The company also produced a 22-minute videotape, shown
recently to Nordstrom employees. In the video, Bruce
Nordstrom, a cousin of Jim Nordstrom and one of three
third-generation family members who share the title of
co-chairman, explains the unfavorable press by saying:
"Evidently, the union in Seattle feels so vehemently about
the issue of union security that they're willing to attack
us, even if it means dirty tricks and untruths that are being
propagated in the press."
   In the video, Bruce Nordstrom admits the company has been
"sloppy" in some of its record keeping and is "taking every
step possible to make sure that is cleared up." But he
narrows his eyes for emphasis and says: "I view it as a
personal attack. I would hope that . . . you folks feel it's
a personal attack on you also."
   Mr. Peterson, meanwhile, vows he won't give up the fight.
"These issues are not going to go away," he says. "As far as
I'm concerned, we're having a strike without having a
strike."

   Marketing:
   Burger King
   Senses Rebound
   Around Corner

   Burger King Corp. is finally talking profits, not
problems.
   The hamburger chain's new owner, Grand Metropolitan PLC of
Britain, is optimistic Burger King will contribute to its
bottom line this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're proving the validity of this acquisition," says
Burger King's chief financial officer, Robert Stetson.
   A year-long overhaul has touched everything from the
number of franchisees to the detergents used to clean the
kitchens. Determined to distinguish Burger King, the nation's
second-largest burger chain, from the competition, Grand Met
has launched aggressive promotional efforts, such as the
current one with popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
videotapes. Even small details are getting great attention.
For instance, Burger King recently said it would replace its
house salad dressing with actor Paul Newman's name brand.
   But even though Burger King just completed its best
quarter in three years, with profit up 25%, management
concedes it's too early to proclaim a total turnaround for
the unit, which was acquired along with Pillsbury Co. last
year. The words "turnaround and transformation signify fast,
almost violent changes in direction, which aren't
appropriate," says Barry Gibbons, the British-born retailing
whiz recruit brought in last year to rebuild the Miami-based
fast-food business, whose profits sagged under Pillsbury.
   "They're just starting," agrees Emanuel Goldman, a
PaineWebber Inc. restaurant-industry analyst.
   Mr. Goldman believes Burger King must turn unique assets
into competitive advantages, and he cites three examples: One
is Burger King's ability to customize its foods, as touted in
the once-successful "Have It Your Way" campaign. It's
something that archrival McDonald's doesn't do. Another is
the fact that Burger King broils its burgers rather than
fries them as McDonald's does, a potential edge amid growing
public consciousness about cholesterol and fats. Finally, the
analyst says, "the fact that the company had been so grossly
mismanaged" under Pillsbury's ownership makes improvement
that much easier. "We're not dealing with a better
semiconductor chip," Mr. Goldman says. "This is basic stuff."
   But the rapid stream of changes and the company's demands
for modernizations at the restaurants have bruised some
franchisees, the backbone of Burger King's 6,200-store
domestic system. Some complain of the burden those changes
have put on franchisees. "They've not done one thing to
reduce our costs," gripes one Midwest franchisee.
   Mr. Gibbons promises that further planned changes should
help reduce operators' overhead. He points to an experiment
with countertop computers where customers will punch in their
orders, then pay with the swipe of a credit card. The
intention is to reduce order errors, speed food delivery and
shrink the store crew size.
   Labor-saving devices also will modernize Burger King
kitchens. "We shouldn't be chopping lettuce in the
restaurant," says Gary Langstaff, executive vice president of
marketing. He and others see technology helping the company
refocus the 270,000-strong store personnel on service.
   Too many operators have concentrated on "what's easiest
for the restaurant, not what's best for the customers," Mr.
Langstaff says. "The focus should be on the entire eating
experience, which includes service as well as food."
   As part of the service slant, the company wants to add
more of a personal touch. As reported, the chain soon will
test high-tech drive-through windows featuring better sound
systems and video screens that allow the customer to see the
order taker.
   Mr. Gibbons wasted little time in changing things. In a
memo his first day on the job -- written before breakfast, he
says -- the executive said earnings were "a mess" and costs
required "urgent work." Soon hundreds of employees were let
go and several management layers stripped away. What had been
a billion-dollar food purchasing and distribution system
underwent radical surgery.
   Work also began on product introductions. With one million
sales a day, the new BK Broiler chicken sandwich already is
challenging Burger King's Whopper hamburger for star billing
on the menu. The company's Kids' Club received a similarly
popular reception; several million youngsters signed up.
Meanwhile, "mystery shoppers" -- essentially spies from
headquarters -- prowled stores looking for problems, and
operators took thousands of calls on an 800 number
established for customer feedback.
   Already nearly 100 franchisees have been dropped, on the
ground that they didn't meet the company's standards. Company
managers stopped renewing leases for what Mr. Gibbons calls
"some of the worst operators in the business."
   Joseph Angel, a franchisee in Portland, Ore., says the
result of the rapid-fire overhaul has been "to get the
consistency of operations and product back on the front
burner." Adds Richard Fors, a Buffalo, N.Y., multi-store
franchisee who heads the chain's National Franchisee
Association: "There's stability in the system for the first
time in years. We used to think no one in the corporation was
listening."
   But franchisees are still grumbling over Burger King's
decision to take marketing money away from local promotions
in favor of national advertising campaigns. Also, Mr.
Langstaff's "Sometimes You Gotta Break the Rules" marketing
tagline remains controversial; one franchisee questions its
appropriateness given today's concern with drug abuse and
juvenile delinquency.
   Although he agrees that previous management "panicked"
over marketing -- failing to introduce new products while it
reeled through an embarrassing series of faux pax, including
the infamous Herb the Nerd advertising campaign -- Mr.
Gibbons prefers not to talk about Burger King's past
problems. "As far as I'm concerned, they're history."
   Ever upbeat, Mr. Gibbons likens the company to a
professional golfer whose game went into a slump. "We're a
great name on the tour. We've had a couple of years off the
leader board, no question. But with a new sponsor and a few
new clubs, we're back."

   HOUSTON -- U.S. District Judge David Hittner barred
Torchmark Corp. from nominating five directors for American
General Corp.'s board, a move that could stifle Torchmark's
current bid to win influence with the insurance concern.
   Torchmark had proposed nominating candidates for five of
the six American General seats that are up for election on
the 15-member board at American General's annual meeting May
2.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, American General argued that Torchmark failed to
notify American General of its plans 60 days in advance of
the meeting, as required by American General's bylaws.
   In granting the preliminary injunction, the judge said
that American General had shown that it had a substantial
likelihood of proving its case, that the company would be
injured if the injunction weren't granted and that the
injunction wouldn't harm the public interest.
   Torchmark immediately said it plans to appeal the
preliminary injunction and said it still plans to solicit
proxies for a resolution calling for American General to
appoint a special committee to evaluate acquisition
proposals. The resolution also calls for American General's
board to hire an investment banking firm to solicit offers
for American General.
   Earlier this week, Torchmark, a Birmingham, Ala., insurer,
dropped a $50-a-share, or $6.3 billion, unsolicited bid for
American General after American General didn't respond to its
offer within 48 hours. American General had said it would
consider the offer at its next regularly scheduled board
meeting.

   Chance to Develop
   Luxury Apartments

   NEW YORK -- Sotheby's Holdings Inc., the British-based
auction house, may finally get to be a real estate developer.
   Sotheby's has long sought to build a tower of luxury
condominium apartments atop its Manhattan auction
headquarters. Late Wednesday, it cleared a local hurdle in
the four-year-old effort.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The subcommittee of a local community board, which has
been meeting on-and-off since 1986 with Sotheby's officials,
voted to give the apartment project a green light. However,
some area residents gathered at the meeting expressed
opposition.
   "The community's concerns have less to do with the
building than with quality-of-life issues" such as increased
limousine traffic and construction noise, said Hedi H. White,
chairman of Community Board Eight, an advisory group which
oversees development on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. But
Sotheby's pledge to construct low-income housing, probably on
a site on East 96th Street, was seen a benefit to the
community, she said.
   The project, which will add 26 residential floors and a
health club above Sotheby's headquarters at East 72nd Street
and York Avenue, was certified by the Department of City
Planning Feb. 27. It still awaits approval by the full
committee of the community board, which meets Wednesday, and
then by the city's Board of Estimate.
   Sotheby's already has a real-estate brokerage division
which handles sales of luxury homes. A. Alfred Taubman, head
of Taubman &amp; Co., one of the largest real-estate development
firms in the U.S., is the auction house's chairman.
   Architect Michael Graves designed the tower, which
includes 256 apartments. In addition, Sotheby's will add one
floor to its existing four-story auction facility, which will
be remodeled while auction operations continue. Mr. Graves is
also the designer of a controversial addition to the Whitney
Museum of American Art in New York. His design for the
Sotheby's building -- full of details such as balconies that
jut out at angles and diagonal designs of glazed ornamental
tile -- is modeled in part after an Italian palazzo.
   The building was originally scheduled to be finished in
1989, but "given the state of the New York real estate
market," it probably was in Sotheby's interest that the
project has been delayed, said Michael Ainslie, Sotheby's
president. Even after approval, "we didn't say we're going to
build," he added.

construction will probably begin late this year or in early
1991.

   Amgen Inc. said it appealed an order issued last month by
a federal judge in Boston under which Amgen and Genetics
Institute Inc. are required to cross-license their respective
versions of the anti-anemia drug erythropoietin, or EPO.
   Separately, Amgen confirmed that Robert D. Weist, senior
vice president, general counsel and secretary, resigned those
posts Monday. Mr. Weist, 50 years old, joined the company in
the early 1980s and in recent years has been Amgen's point
man in the tangled patent litigation.

<TEXT>
   "He will be a consultant on the team, but he will no
longer be heading up the team," said an Amgen spokesman in
Thousand Oaks, Calif. The spokesman said he didn't know why
Mr. Weist resigned. Mr. Weist couldn't be reached.
   A federal magistrate ruled last year that both Amgen and
Genetics Institute are infringing certain provisions of each
other's EPO patents. Last month, Judge William Young in
Boston issued an order aimed at making the companies at least
temporarily cross-license their versions.
   Spokesmen for Cambridge, Mass.-based Genetics Institute,
and its marketing partner, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Japan,
declined to comment on Amgen's appeal.

   Little Firms Hope for Big Things From the SBA's Chief

   Small Business Looks to Engeleiter
   For Broader Leadership and More Vision

   WASHINGTON -- The honeymoon is over for Small Business
Administration head Susan Engeleiter.
   Almost a year ago, Ms. Engeleiter arrived here touted as a
savvy young Wisconsin politician who promised to become a
strong champion of small business. The consensus of many
small-business interests is that she has settled in as a
competent federal official. But now they want the SBA
administrator to deliver broader leadership and more vision.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In the first year, she's established an agency that's
prepared to make some changes,"says John Paul Galles,
executive vice president of National Small Business United, a
lobbying group. "I'm anxious to learn what those changes
might be."
   Such groups credit the 38-year-old Ms. Engeleiter with
generally reflecting small-business views. But they say she
isn't aggressive enough on certain matters important to them,
such as initiating a dialogue with the Department of Health
and Human Services as it prepares a major study on
health-care costs. And Mr. Galles says the agency could learn
from state-level programs that link small firms with specific
opportunities in the U.S. and abroad.
   Small businesses, to a large extent, are asking for a new
level of leadership from the chief of the SBA, whose leaders
in the past have had little clout beyond the small agency.
But it is a new standard that was set by Ms. Engeleiter
herself. Though she never ran a small business herself, she
promised to be an outspoken advocate for people who do.
   "A lot of people wanted her to make a big splash right
away and to go to war for small business. That's unfair,"
says John Motley, chief lobbyist for the National Federation
of Independent Business, the largest association of
small-business owners. "Susan's a good politician, and they
don't make waves until they find out what damage the waves
will cause."
   Ms. Engeleiter has concentrated heavily on matters inside
the SBA, rather than in the business world, Mr. Motley says.
But "in her second year," he adds, "she'll have to become
more visible or the criticisms will be valid."
   Ms. Engeleiter, whose annual SBA salary is $89,000,
resists the idea that she needs to make a "big splash" to
make her mark. She says that in her first year she has
focused on shaping up the agency, which has more than 4,100
employees and an annual budget of about $350 million. "I've
always been known for being prepared and doing my homework,"
she says. "I'm also implementing a lot of changes, and nobody
likes change. Some people may be disgruntled."
   The spirits of many people at the SBA -- which former
President Reagan twice tried to abolish on the claim it's
irrelevant to most businesses -- remain low, despite
morale-boosting efforts by the SBA chief, such as sending a
bagpipe player around Washington offices on St. Patrick's
Day. Some staffers complain that even minor items often get
hung up for months in Ms. Engeleiter's office, which they
deride as "the black hole" and "the Bermuda Triangle." In
late February, Janine Perrignon, vice president for SBA
lending at Commercial Bank of San Francisco, received a
letter from Ms. Engeleiter appointing her to the region's SBA
Advisory Council. The two-year term was to have begun about
eight months earlier.
   Ms. Engeleiter's frequent travel has prompted speculation
that she's keeping her political fires well-stoked in
Wisconsin, where she was the state senate minority leader and
barely lost a bid as the Republican candidate for the U.S.
Senate in 1988. Her travel record lists 31 trips since her
appointment last May, five of them to Wisconsin and four to
Minnesota.
   The SBA chief bridles at any suggestion that she has
traveled too much or for political motives. She notes that
because her agency provides disaster loans, some trips have
been to areas such as those hit by Hurricane Hugo. "There's a
Washington perception that if you're in Phoenix or Seattle,
or touring a disaster center in Puerto Rico, that you're not
working," she says. "The attitude is that this is where
everything happens. That's absurd."
   Ms. Engeleiter says she took over an embattled agency
whose programs hadn't been thoroughly examined in years.
Moreover, the SBA was charged with quickly carrying out new
laws such as one governing a procurement program for
minorities. "It's really been like starting at ground zero,"
the SBA chief says. "I had extensive meetings on Capitol
Hill, and there was the arduous job of going through
everything program by program."
   Recently, she announced a set of 13 initiatives for the
agency's financial programs, including one to encourage
lenders to make more small loans of $50,000 or less by
increasing their fees for such loans. She says the agency
also will begin promoting SBA loans for exporters.
   The SBA's major limitation, Ms. Engeleiter says, is that
since last fall it has been operating without a chief counsel
for its Advocacy Office, the independent research arm charged
with defending small-business interests. President Bush
nominated educator Kyo Jhin for the post last June, but Mr.
Jhin's nomination ran into opposition in the Senate because
of his lack of small-business experience, and he withdrew in
February. The White House hasn't nominated anyone else.
   "We've been dramatically hindered by the lack of a chief
counsel for advocacy," she says. "Candidly, it's been very
difficult. . . . We've been very handicapped."
   Ms. Engeleiter benefits from the Bush administration's
support for the SBA-support that contrasts sharply with the
Reagan stance. As a result, "SBA as a whole is in an upbeat
state," says Tony Wilkenson, president of the National
Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders. "The pressure's
been taken off as to whether it'll be there.
   The SBA chief also gets good reviews from the agency's
oversight committees in Congress, although the SBA still is
seen as too much under the thumb of the White House Office of
Management and Budget. Rep. John LaFalce, (D., N.Y.),
chairman of the House Small Business Committee, says the SBA
chief is "energetic and a good spokesperson for the
small-business community." But he adds that "the jury's still
out" on her performance.

   Imagine Films Says
   Its Annual Meeting
   Is Postponed Again

   LOS ANGELES -- Imagine Films Entertainment Inc. said it
postponed its annual meeting for the second time because it
is still negotiating the termination of Robert Harris,
president of motion pictures and television.
   The meeting was scheduled for 10 a.m. PDT and the
company's explanation wasn't released until after the stock
market closed. Meanwhile, Imagine shares climbed sharply to
$16.25 each, up $1.50, in over-the-counter trading amid
speculation the company was negotiating a merger.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company's meeting originally was scheduled for March
21. Imagine Films, which was formed by producers Ron Howard
and Brian Grazer five years ago and went public in 1986, has
produced such movies as "Parenthood," "The Dream Team" and
"The Burbs."
   Mike Meltzer, Imagine's chief financial officer, said, "We
aren't negotiating with anyone."
   Mr. Meltzer said the stock may have climbed because the
company's latest movie, "Cry-Baby," opens today and "the
reviews have been good." He also noted that shares in New
Line Cinema Corp. climbed before the release of the hit movie
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."
   Mr. Meltzer said the postponement of the annual meeting
was necessary since Mr. Harris is on the company's board. Mr.
Harris wasn't available for comment.
   Christopher Dixon, an analyst at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co,
said, "Many of the smaller film companies tend to trade up on
the potential opening of movies."

   Salomon Says Unit
   To Post $200 Million
   Earnings for Quarter

   NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc. said first-quarter pretax
earnings for its securities firm will exceed $200 million,
but its energy and commodities businesses together are
expected to post a small loss.
   Salomon's estimates were better than many analysts
expected, boosting the stock 12.5 cents to $21.375 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The gains at its Salomon Brothers Inc. unit apparently
stemmed from trading for the securities firm's own account
and don't indicate improving conditions on Wall Street,
analysts say. Earnings will be disclosed April 24.
   "Salomon stands out as unique in the quarter," says Alison
Deans, a securities industry analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co. "One individual firm making lots of money by trading
doesn't signal a turn in the market."
   Both the bond and international stock markets were
volatile in the first quarter, catering to two of Salomon's
strengths. But most other traditional securities businesses
-- notably investment banking and individual-investor
activity -- softened in the quarter. Analysts said the
securities firms that post the best first-quarter results
will be helped greatly by trading gains.
   John H. Gutfreund, chairman, said Salomon Brothers's gains
"are broadly based, spanning both product and geographical
lines." But Salomon's other operating units didn't fare as
well. Results for Philipp Brothers, the commodities unit,
"continue to be disappointing," Mr. Gutfreund said; the unit
is expected to post a pretax loss of less than $25 million,
analysts say. And Phibro Energy is expected to post a modest
profit, Salomon says; the energy unit made up for sharp
losses in January and February with gains in March, analysts
said.
   The results underscore the volatility of trading firms
such as Salomon. Last year, the parent company had a
consolidated pretax loss of $72 million for the first
quarter, then pretax gains of $453 million, $278 million and
$81 million in successive quarters.
   Says James Hanbury, an analyst for Wertheim Schroder &amp;
Co.: "Any company that has consecutive quarterly results like
this one cannot be easy to forecast."

   NEW YORK -- Who owns stock quotes?
   That's the issue at the heart of a dispute raging behind
the scenes between the New York Stock Exchange and a group of
about a dozen brokerage firms and media companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Big Board and seven other securities exchanges, in a
proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission, have
asked for a technical change that would give them the right
to charge fees for "delayed" stock-price quotations. That's
the common way that the investing public gets its stock-price
information through electronic data bases and newspapers.
   These stock quotes, which are delayed 15 minutes, have
traditionally been made available free of charge by the
exchanges. By contrast, the exchanges charge subscription
fees for up-to-the-second "real-time" stock quotes.
   The brokers and media companies all distribute stock-price
quotations to their customers, sometimes charging them for
the service. They claim that the exchanges' proposal could
theoretically allow the exchanges to charge fees for
everything from stock tables in newspapers and news stories
about stocks to a broker's advice about stocks.
   Says Ethel E. Daly, a senior vice president at discount
broker Charles Schwab &amp; Co., one of the protesting vendors:
"We feel 15-minute delayed data is in the public domain."
   Mrs. Daly adds that under the exchanges' proposal: "Every
time a quote is used, whether to talk about someone's
holdings or talk about prices, they'd want to be paid for
that."
   Other stock-quote vendors complaining about the exchanges'
proposed changes include Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The
Wall Street Journal; Associated Press; Knight-Ridder Inc.;
Quick &amp; Reilly Group Inc.; Reuters Holdings PLC's Instinet
unit; Financial News Network Inc.; and Fidelity Investments.
   The vendors say the dispute is no less than a battle over
who owns stock-market data: the public or the exchanges.
   But in a letter to the SEC, the exchange group led by the
Big Board protests that it merely wants to make "technical
and ministerial" changes to how stock data is distributed.
   The Big Board, as the administrator of the exchanges'
stock-quote feed, has yet to respond specifically to the
vendors' complaints. A Big Board spokeswoman says only that
the exchanges "plan to meet in the next few weeks to review
the comments and draft a response to the SEC."
   A spokesman for the American Stock Exchange says, "The
exchange is sensitive to the vendor community concerns, and
has always endeavored to work with them. This issue will be a
priority item at the next meeting" of the exchanges April 20.
   In Washington, an SEC spokeswoman said the agency is
"analyzing the (vendors') comments carefully." The SEC
declined further comment because the issue is pending.
   So far, the exchanges' explanations haven't swayed the
vendors.
   Fidelity, the big mutual-fund company, protests in a
letter to the SEC that one of the exchanges' goals in its
proposal "is to make it more difficult, and ultimately to
eliminate, our ability to provide delayed market information
to our customers."
   Similarly, Schwab, the discount brokerage firm, claims the
exchanges want to "force the personal-computer user and
others either to pay high charges for real-time market
information, or do without."
   Currently, a typical small investor who uses real-time
quotes through a personal computer has to pay $13 a month for
the right and sign a subscription agreement with the
exchanges, vendors say. Professionals have to pay as much as
$120 a month just for the Big Board feed. That's why most
investors buy delayed stock quotes through the vendors or
simply call their broker.
   Technically, the dispute revolves around the exchanges'
request for the power to redefine at any time what
constitutes a "delayed" stock quote. The vendors fear that
stock quotes traditionally considered "delayed" will suddenly
be ruled "real time" by the exchanges.
   Says a spokesman for Reuters, parent of the Instinet
electronic trading network: "Although the (exchanges')
amendments do not put a great deal of emphasis on the issue
of charges for delayed exchange data, they certainly do leave
the door open in that regard. Reuters is in principle against
any such charges for old data."
   The news services are particularly bothered by the
exchanges' proposition that they have an interest in the
services that derive from stock quotes. They say they fear
the exchanges could someday interfere with news stories that
use stock quotes.
   The issue of market-data rights is a hot one. For example,
in a related dispute with the exchanges, Dow Jones in SEC
filings says it doesn't want to pay real-time fees for the
market data it provides on its quote-intensive Professional
Investor Report news service. The exchanges claim the news
service and its subscribers should pay because they're
utilizing real-time quotes; Dow Jones claims its service is a
newswire and shouldn't be subject to the real-time fees.
   While the Big Board declines to get into the public debate
about the stock-quote issue, it has been busy behind the
scenes. Thomas E. Haley, a top market-data official at the
exchange, has visited vendors and tried to convince them that
the exchanges' changes aren't revolutionary, according to
vendors. The Big Board said Mr. Haley wasn't available to
comment.

   Vernon Savings'
   W.F. Lemons Gets
   30 Years in Prison

   DALLAS -- The former chairman and chief executive officer
of the defunct Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association was
sentenced to 30 years in federal prison, one of the stiffest
sentences to date in thrift-related fraud prosecutions.
   Woody F. Lemons, the seventh officer of Vernon to be
convicted, was found guilty in December of 13 charges brought
as a result of a continuing investigation by the U.S. Justice
Department's Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 30-year sentence, which stunned defense lawyers and
elated government attorneys, came less than a week before the
House Banking Committee is scheduled to hold hearings in
Dallas on the effectiveness of prosecution in fraud-related
thrift failures, such as Vernon's.
   The Justice Department has been investigating Vernon's
lending practices since 1986 but has yet to bring criminal
charges against the thrift's former owner, Don R. Dixon. The
banking committee has invited Mr. Dixon to testify next week
but his attorney, William M. Ravkind of Dallas, said his
client won't appear. Mr. Ravkind called Mr. Lemons's 30-year
sentence "absurd."
   In view of the scheduled hearings, Mr. Lemons's defense
lawyer, Michael P. Gibson of Dallas, had urged U.S. District
Judge Robert B. Maloney to be mindful of the prosecutors'
"trophy mentality."
   "Mr. Lemons is the trophy for the federal agencies because
they need to maintain their position that they're out there
doing good for the community," Mr. Gibson said.
   But Judge Maloney, who has presided in at least two other
criminal cases related to Vernon Savings, referred to Mr.
Lemons as "a thief in every sense of the word" and said he
wanted to use the sentence "to assure the public" that thrift
fraud won't be treated lightly.
   Mr. Gibson called the 30-year sentence "way
disproportionate to the crime." Mr. Lemons was convicted of
bank fraud and 12 other charges, including a charge that he
accepted a $212,000 kickback from the proceeds of a $46
million real estate development loan.
   Judge Maloney didn't impose a fine but will rule later
this month on how much restitution Mr. Lemons will be ordered
to make. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is seeking $9
million to $10 million, according to Howard Feinstein, chief
of the conflicts and restitution unit of the FDIC's legal
staff.
   The FDIC is taking a stronger role in criminal cases, as
evidenced by a letter from FDIC Chairman William Seidman to
Judge Maloney.
   "Woody Lemons abused his position of trust and defrauded
the institution, causing damages of over $18 million," Mr.
Seidman wrote earlier this week. "While I have considered the
fact that Mr. Lemons has a family, I have also taken into
consideration . . . that virtually all the costs of Mr.
Lemons's criminal acts will be borne by the {thrift}
resolution fund and, ultimately, the U.S. taxpayers."
   Vernon was closed in November 1987 by the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp., which found a stunning 96% of the
thrift's loans in default. The FSLIC committed $1.3 billion
to fold the thrift's assets into Montfort Savings
Association, which became part of First Gibraltar Bank in
late December 1988.

   Excerpts from the Blue Ribbon Commission's report on
Hungary's transformation to a free market:
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since 1968's New Economic Mechanism, which decentralized
(some) decision-making, Hungary has seen repeated
half-measures to reform the exhausted command economy.
Politics did not permit full transformation. But an economy
only partially free, like a people only partially free in
their political life, ultimately is demoralized when false
hopes are dashed by experience.
   Any large program will take years to put into place even
at maximum speed. The keys are a preannounced path and a firm
timetable. . . . Certain benefits should be apparent within
months -- for example, improved quality and availability of
consumer goods and services, cuts in waste and inefficiency,
and better employment opportunities for skilled, diligent
employees.
   Practically all retail trade, service establishments,
workshops and similar sized firms should be privatized within
one year. . . . Parent companies should be forced to sell
their outlets and shops to private buyers who will obtain
real assets in exchange for cash and real payment
obligations.
   A new Act on Agricultural Land (should) guarantee the
right of private ownership and the right to dispose of land.
. . . Land transferred earlier to the cooperatives, or
similar land, should be offered for repurchase to the
original owners.
   Convert present import restrictions into temporary tariffs
and concurrently announce a firm timetable for the reduction
of such tariffs.
   The current proportion of foreign ownership in many small
West European countries is about one-third of the country's
industry. At the beginning of 1990 foreigners own only about
2% of Hungary's industry, so there is ample room for
expansion, by any reasonable standard.
   Hungary's (past loans) were not used for sound investments
that could generate foreign exchange earnings to service the
debt. Hungary (now) has to obtain additional capital imports
of about $1.5 billion a year for each of the next three years
in order to turn a potentially large net outflow into a net
inflow. . . . In large part, this current-account gap can be
financed though an aggressive policy of foreign investment.
   The central government should retain broad planning
responsibility for the railroad system and for the national
networks; e.g., main roads, oil and gas pipelines,
electricity grids, and the telephone system. But it should
look for innovative ways of cooperating with the private
sector to finance, build, and operate (them).
   The entire sector of state-owned apartments should become
globally self-financing in three years. Rent should be
adjusted to reflect real conditions, based on location, size,
and quality. (Any) subsidies should be given (upfront) to
people because they are poor and not because they occupy
particular dwellings. . . . Free-market rents should be
allowed to emerge for state-owned apartments of the best
quality. . . . The current process of selling off state-owned
flats should continue, though prices should be set closer to
real market values. . . . The government should not enter
into any more mortgage contracts which involve interest
subsidies.
   Initiate steps to seek associate membership in the
European Community.

   Hitachi Seeking Settlement
   In Dispute With Motorola

   TOKYO -- Hitachi Ltd. is apparently declaring victory but
also scrambling to retreat in its semiconductor-patent
dispute with Motorola Inc.
   By all accounts, Motorola was the big loser in a U.S.
federal court ruling handed down last week. But Hitachi is
now the one seeking a settlement. And Motorola is so far
holding out and apparently considering an appeal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Texas judge last week declared that both companies
violated patents owned by each other, and ordered them to
stop U.S. sales of the chips in question. The ruling affected
Motorola's flagship microprocessor, the 68030.
   Hitachi, meanwhile, was ordered to stop selling its H-8
microprocessor, which accounts for only about 1% of its
semiconductor revenue.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton, at Motorola's request,
later stayed the order, allowing both companies to sell their
chips pending an appeal.
   Industry officials say Hitachi may have gotten more than
it bargained for from the court fight. A protracted legal
battle could hurt Hitachi politically: The 68030 is crucial
for many companies, and a snag in its supply could stir up a
backlash against Hitachi.
   But Hajime Yasuda, deputy general manager of Hitachi's
semiconductor design and development center, maintains that
Hitachi is eager to settle because it is concerned about
possible damage to its reputation as a reliable supplier.

   THE U.S. AND SOVIETS SAID Bush and Gorbachev would meet
late next month.
   Amid tensions over Lithuania, the president and the Soviet
leader agreed to meet May 30-June 3 in the U.S. The
announcement came as Secretary of State Baker and Soviet
Foreign Minister Shevardnadze continued talks in Washington
aimed at resolving arms-control disputes. The Soviets
reportedly eased their stance on a neutral, united Germany,
and said they would consider allowing direct flights of
Soviet Jews to Israel with assurances that the refugees
wouldn't be settled in the occupied lands. U.S. officials
said that Baker also warned Moscow over Lithuania, where
Soviet troops reportedly occupied the office of the
republic's prosecutor.

   De Klerk and Mandela agreed on a new date for talks
between South Africa's government and the African National
Congress on giving blacks a share of political power. The

homeland leaders from meeting with Pretoria.
                                                                                                       

   Soldiers in Venda overthrew the government of the small

   Stock Prices End Mixed as Worry
   About Earnings Overhangs Market

   NEW YORK -- Stocks finished mixed as worries about
first-quarter corporate-earnings reports offset relief that
the Tokyo stock market hadn't plunged overnight.
   Consumer stocks that were considered largely insulated
from earnings disappointments attracted buyers yesterday,
just as they did earlier this week. Bank issues met with
across-the-board selling in response to indications that
federal regulatory reviews may put continued pressure on
their results.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, shares of Tandem Computers and several other
companies whose estimates for the just-completed quarter
failed to satisfy market expectations were hit with heavy
selling and fell sharply.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.80 to 2721.17 with
the help of gains among blue-chip consumer issues such as
Philip Morris, which rose 3/4 to 41 1/4, and Merck, which
advanced 7/8 to 72 1/8.
   Broader market measures ended the session with slight
losses. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 0.36 to
340.73 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slid
0.16 to 187.15.
   Losers led gainers by about 744 to 703 on the Big Board,
where trading activity continued at the moderate pace set
earlier this week. Big Board volume totaled 144,170,000
shares.
   Prices moved higher at the opening in response to the
Tokyo market's performance, which went against speculation
Wednesday among U.S. market participants that Japanese share
prices would fall sharply. The Nikkei index of 225 Japanese
stocks finished with a loss of just 193.88, or 0.7%, at
28249.06.
   But the gains proved short-lived, and the market drifted
through the rest of the session amid periodic rounds of
futures-related buying and selling as the focus shifted to
earnings.
   "The market is more vulnerable to earnings disappointments
today than at any time in recent history," because
price-earnings ratios for stocks have been on the rise, said
Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio strategist at First
Boston.
   Mr. Grigoli said he expects first-quarter earnings for the
companies included in the S&amp;P 500 to be down 12% to 15%
overall from the year-ago period -- a drop for which he says
the market isn't prepared. In recent weeks, those issues have
traded at an average of about 15 times their earnings over
the past 12 months.
   With prices near the upper boundary of their trading range
during the past several months, "We're due for some sort of
setback, and I think earnings are going to be the catalyst,"
he said.
   The sell-off in bank stocks came after analysts met
Wednesday with representatives of the Comptroller of the
Currency, who indicated that banks are facing a tough,
sweeping review of their real-estate lending practices and
that the same standards will be used in reviewing their
portfolios of consumer loans and loans to highly-levleraged
comanies.
   Two major commercial banks issues were among the most
active stocks on the Big Board: Citicorp, which dipped 1/4 to
22 1/2 on composite volume of 2.1 million shares, and
BankAmerica, which dropped 1 1/4 to 26 3/8 on 1.2 million
shares.
   Also, Chase Manhattan fell 5/8 to 27 7/8, Bankers Trust
New York declined 1 3/4 to 36 5/8, First Chicago declined 1
to 29 and J.P. Morgan eased 1/2 to 35.
   Prudential-Bache lowered its investment ratings to "sell"
from "hold" on Chase and two regional bank stocks: PNC
Financial, which skidded 2 1/4 to 37 7/8, and Bank of New
York, which retreated 2 1/2 to 31 1/4. Among other regionals,
Security Pacific dropped 1 1/4 to 35 5/8, Wells Fargo lost 1
5/8 to 68 3/4, NCNB fell 1 5/8 to 36 1/8, Citizens &amp; Southern
fell 1 1/4 to 25 1/4, and Bank of Boston declined 1 1/8 to 12
3/4.
   Bank of New England fell 3/8 to 3 7/8 on 1.2 million
shares. Shares of the troubled regional bank holding company
had declined 3/8 Wednesday following its acknowledgment that
it faces further increases in nonperforming assets and
loan-loss provisions.
   Tandem, the Big Board's most active issue, plunged 4 5/8
to 22 5/8 on 4.8 million shares. The company said it expects
to report that net income for the second quarter, ended March
31, was lower than expectations.
   Other stocks hit with earnings-related selling included:
   -- Ogden, which plunged 3 1/8 to 24 3/8. The company told
analysts its first-quarter earnings, excluding a gain
resulting from a sale of stock by its Ogden Projects unit,
would be lower than the year-ago level. In response, Kidder
Peabody and Dillon Read both lowered their 1990 earnings
estimates.
   -- Businessland, which slid 1 1/2 to 8 7/8 after lowering
its earnings estimate for the March quarter. The company said
it now expects to report break-even operating results for the
period on revenue of about $320 million.
   -- WorldCorp, which fell 7/8 to 8 3/4 on news of a
fourth-quarter loss, compared with a profit a year ago. The
company said it also expects to report a first-quarter loss
as well and doesn't anticipate meeting its target of $21
million in net income for the full year.
   Baxter International, which announced a planned
restructuring Wednesday, dropped 1 1/2 to 22 7/8 on 4.5
million shares after a meeting with analysts proved
disappointing. Both Kidder Peabody and Prudential-Bache
lowered investment ratings on the stock following the
meeting.
   Amax advanced 5/8 to 28 on two million shares amid
continuing speculation the company could become a takeover
target.
   Peter Kiewit Sons', a private firm, has been identified as
a possible bidder.
   McDermott International climbed 2 to 28 1/8 after
receiving a $250 million contract for 15 offshore sulfur
mining platforms. Also, traders said there was speculation
that Schlumberger may be interested in acquiring the company;
however, McDermott said it hadn't been approached by any
suitors. Schlumberger declined comment.
   Rollins Environmental Services gained 5/8 to 13 3/8 on 1.3
million shares. Smith Barney, Harris Upham put the company on
its research list with a "buy" recommendation, citing
promising growth in the market for incinerators.
   L.E. Myers Group, which rose 5/8 Wednesday, gained another
1 1/4 to 14 1/2. Analysts attributed the stock's rally to the
Senate's passage of a clean-air bill earlier this week; the
company provides construction services for electric
utilities, among the targets of the measure.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.11
to 361.23. Volume on the exchange totaled 15,830,000 shares.
There were 262 issues advancing and 278 declining.
   Salomon's newly issued call warrants on the Nikkei index
topped the exchange's list of most active issues. The
warrants, which become more valuable as the index moves
higher, rose 5/8 to 3 3/4 in response to the Tokyo market's
showing overnight; more than 3.3 million changed hands in
composite trading.
   International Telecharge, whose board decided against
pursuing a takeover offer from a suitor, who wasn't
identified, rose 1/8 to 3 1/8. The company also signed a
service agreement with MCI Communications and named Allan L.
Rayfield, a former GTE executive, as chairman and chief
executive officer.

   NEW YORK -- Investors remained wary of making commitments
in the over-the-counter market, allowing prices to sink in
yesterday's session.
   Traders say there was evident relief that losses on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange were moderate overnight. Jitters over a
further breakdown in that market depressed OTC share prices
Wednesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But relief failed to turn to conviction, and unlisted
share prices fell to narrow losses yesterday as
computer-driven program trading knocked the New York Stock
Exchange off its highs for the day.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index ended with a 0.46% loss, down 2
to 433.42. On the Big Board, the composite index slipped less
than 0.1%.
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 939 to 982. Total Nasdaq
volume was 134.2 million shares, down slightly from 138.4
million shares on Wednesday. National Market System volume
totaled 102,057,100 shares, up slightly from Wednesday's
100,882,000 shares.
   Following their recent trend, over-the-counter financial
stocks underperformed other sectors of the market. The Nasdaq
Financial 100 Index, which includes the largest OTC bank,
thrift and insurance issues, fell 4.84, or 1.24%, to 384.53.
   The Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes many of the market's
big technology stocks, fell only half as much, losing 2.84,
or 0.66%, to 428.12.
   Nelson Gold, senior vice president of OTC trading at
Interstate-Johnson Lane in Atlanta, says over-the-counter
traders remain gun-shy of the market.
   "Everybody's very relieved that Japan hasn't closed down
for repairs, but everyone is very wary."
   But Christine Callies, senior technical analyst at Cowen &amp;
Co., doubts that Tokyo will continue to be much of a threat
to unlisted share prices here.
   "I think the market can be spooked only so many times by
fear of the same things," she says. "I don't think that Tokyo
alone has the ability to damage our market beyond a
short-term time frame."
   Nor does Ms. Callies worry about further evidence of
declining corporate profits to send the overall market much
lower.
   Many market watchers are concerned that the coming
reporting period for first-quarter earnings will be rife with
disappointments.
   While disappointments are sure to topple some stock
prices, Ms. Callies believes that the environment for
equities has been improving since stock prices hit their
lateJanuary lows.
   "On down days there's a noticeable reluctance for the
market to fall," she says. And while recent rallies have
tended to be timid, she adds that the pattern is typical of a
"consolidation" when the market digests earlier gains.
   Ms. Callies says that, over the next couple of months, she
doesn't expect the OTC market to fall further than the 420
level on the Nasdaq Composite Index. But the market could
carry the index as high as 445, she adds.
   Laidlaw Transportation class B shares led the OTC
most-active list, down 1 to 20 1/8 on volume of more than 5.7
million shares.
   Late Wednesday, the company reported that its second
quarter net income rose to $60.3 million from the $42 million
earned in the year-earlier period.
   The transportation and waste-treatment company also
reported that it would sell its Byers Transport unit for an
undisclosed amount.
   ADAC Laboratories was also high on the most-active list,
down 5/8 to 1 1/8 on volume of more than 3.7 million shares.
The company said it expects to report revenue and earnings in
its second quarter ended April 1 substantially lower than
those reported for a year ago. The company said it about
broke even in the second quarter.
   Pharmacy Management Services closed at 15 nec on volume of
nearly 2 million shares. The company's 2.5-million share
initial public offering was priced late Wednesday at $12 a
share.
   Enclean added 1/2 to 10. A 2.35-million share secondary
offering of the company's stock was sold at $9 a share.
   International Dairy Queen lost the 3-point gain registered
Wednesday, falling 3 1/2 to 57 1/4 yesterday. An advertising
campaign for the company's new frozen yogurt product has
drawn attention to the stock.
   For those investors who were brave enough to buy the
American Depository Receipts of Japanese companies Wednesday,
yesterday was a cheery day. The ADRs dropped in Wednesday's
session in anticipation of a sharp sell-off in Tokyo -- which
failed to occur.
   NEC gained 4 1/4 to 70 5/8, Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance
added 4 to 45 1/2, and Canon rose 3 1/8 to 58.
   Software Toolworks remained unchanged at 15 on volume of
more than 1.1 million shares. The company paid a 100% stock
dividend Wednesday to shareholders of record March 26.

   Greyhound Lines Inc., Dallas, said it had fired 60
employees for incidents of violence and vandalism associated
with the strike by 9,300 members of the Amalgamated Transit
Union. Company spokesman George Gravley said the company was
processing a "very large number" of complaints that would
result in additional terminations.
   The action came a day after a suspicious fire erupted at a
Greyhound terminal in Boston. Since the strike began onMarch
2, 29 Greyhound buses and terminals have been struck by
gunfire, and the company has received 81 bomb threats. In
addition, one striker driver has been killed and one
replacement was seriously injured.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gravley described as "talk and not action" a statement
issued earlier in the day by ATU President James La Sala, who
condemned the violence as "reprehensible." Greyhound, a unit
of GLI Holding Co., has said it will not return to the
bargaining table until a week passes without violence.
   Regarding that stance, Mr. La Sala complained that: "Any
crackpot can stop negotiations from resuming by calling in a
phone threat or by taking a potshot at a bus."

   Copper Futures Decline Further on Expectation
   That Settlement in Peru Mining Strike Is Near

   NEW YORK -- Copper futures further declined on the
likelihood that settlement of a Peruvian mine-workers strike
is near.
   The May-delivery contract eased 1.25 cents a pound, to
$1.1890, for a two-day loss of 5.95 cents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The strike, which began March 12, involves Southern Peru
Copper Corp. workers at two mines and a smelter.
   "The company said Wednesday that reports of a settlement
that caused prices to plunge were untrue, but traders
nevertheless feel that a new pact will be agreed upon Sunday
when workers take a vote," said Richard Hirsch of Sharps
Pixley Inc., a New York metals broker.
   As a result, Mr. Hirsch said, prices in London were weak,
and the selling continued when New York opened.
Computer-guided funds were particularly aggressive sellers as
they sought to take profits from recent advances, he said.
   The liquidation drove the May price as low as $1.1825,
where it leveled off and recovered slightly toward the close.
   Despite the softer tone of the market, Mr. Hirsch said
that the current price may prove attractive to
bargain-hunters and that the market has the potential to
stage a recovery.
   "The fundamentals, such as tight supplies and continued
steady demand, are still present," he said.
   He added that on April 17, the U.S. Mint will be in the
market to buy eight million pounds of copper, to be delivered
in May. "It will be interesting to see what kind of impact
the mint's action will have at a time of shrinking
inventories," Mr. Hirsch said.
   Fred D'Agostino, president of Metals Resources Corp., a
Riverside, Conn., metals-trading firm, said that while the
market has correctly declined on the perception that a
settlement will soon be reached, the longer-term impact of
the strike apparently hasn't been taken into account.
   "Certainly, the end of the strike removes a production
disruption that heightened the concern about supplies and
caused prices to rise," he said. "But even after an agreement
is reached, it will be several days to a week before full
production is resumed. Add that to the 3 1/2 weeks the
workers have been out, and you get a significant production
loss that isn't going to be made up."
   There have been estimates that approximately 20,000 tons
of copper production had been lost. "That's more or less
about right. The loss isn't being felt now, but in time it
will work through the pipeline and have an impact at the
consumption level," Mr. D'Agostino said.
   John Gross, president of J.E. Gross &amp; Associates Inc., a
New City, N.Y., copper-industry consultant, said the market
"appeared to have lost momentum" in reacting so sharply
Wednesday to the incorrect report of the mine workers'
settlement.
   "Not only did the price decline Wednesday, but again
{yesterday}," he said. "I think there may be a test of $1.17
{a pound} for the May contract. If it breaks below that, the
drop could be as low as $1.15."
   However, he said, "one has to consider the fundamentals,
which have been a price-supporting factor. This could lead to
sharp price movements, one way or another."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn contracts for delivery
this year rose slightly on continuing rumors that the Soviet
Union is interested in buying U.S. corn, said Susan Leighty,
grain analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York.
Corn for May delivery rose two cents to close at $2.7025 a
bushel. Traders are speculating that the Soviet Union is
seeking 1.5 million to two million metric tons of U.S. corn.
One sign that a major export deal might be in the works is
that river barges are raising rates for carrying freight to
the Gulf of Mexico. Much of the corn that is exported from
the U.S. moves from the Midwest down the Mississippi River to
New Orleans. The Soviet Union hasn't been a big purchaser of
U.S. corn since its record-setting buying spree last fall.
Those purchases clogged Soviet ports through much of the
winter. Prices of most wheat futures contracts dipped
slightly yesterday amid profit-taking. Wheat prices at the
Chicago Board of Trade had jumped Wednesday on reports that
Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs owns about half of the
wheat stored in CBOT-approved warehouses in Toledo, Ohio, and
Chicago. CBOT traders use wheat stored in those warehouses to
satisfy their delivery obligations. In reaction to
Wednesday's price move, The Board of Trade more than doubled
speculative margin requirements on May wheat futures to $945
a contract from $405. Futures margins are good-faith deposits
and are raised or lowered by exchanges in response to
changing price volatility.
                                                                                                       

   COFFEE: Futures prices closed higher despite late
profit-taking that trimmed early gains. The May-delivery
contract rose 1.76 cents a pound, to 96.75 cents. At its
highest level of the day, the May contract was at 98.50 cents
a pound. Early strength was prompted by the perception that
Brazil wouldn't auction 17 million bags of coffee that the
Brazilian Coffee Institute has in store, and the belief that
Brazil would establish a minimum price for coffee exports,
said Sandra Kaul, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New
York. There had been a report that, since the institute is in
the process of being phased out, its supplies would be sold,
she said. However, it was later reported that Brazil would
impose a "floating price" formula that would keep selling
prices in line with world prices, she said. The development
led to cautiousness among traders because of the vagueness
and complexity of the new rules. But the new rules will allow
coffee to be shipped again, after three weeks of export
paralysis, Ms. Kaul noted. Since Brazil is expected to ship
about seven million bags of coffee during the period from
April through June, there should be less concern over
near-term supplies, she said. A bag of coffee weighs 132
pounds.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell from early firmness
and ended with moderate losses. The May silver contract was
off 2.2 cents an ounce to $5.1680. June gold declined $2.50
an ounce to $379.30. July platinum fell $4.00 an ounce to
$484.20. A metals analyst said silver's strength in London
influenced its early trading gains in New York. But the rally
stalled after May silver traded at its high for the day of
$5.2450, and prices fell. "The $5.25 level has been a strong
resistance level for silver," one analyst said. He pointed
out that silver prices have failed several times since
February to rise above that price. Thus far, there have been
no fundamental factors to account for the rise in the silver
price, which has been wholly chart-related, the analyst said.

   Bethlehem Steel Corp. agreed to pay a fine of $1 million
to New York state for violating state air-pollution laws. The
steelmaker also agreed to eliminate a major source of benzene
emissions from its Lackawanna, N.Y., plant.
   Under the agreement, reached after negotiations between
Bethlehem and New York state environmental officials,
Bethlehem will cease operating one of its three coke oven
batteries by July 1, 1990, construct a closed-loop cooling
system and upgrade its two remaining coke oven batteries at
Lackawanna. That will result in a 95% reduction of the 1.5
million pounds of benzene that the plant emits each year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem also must pay $700,000 of the fine within 30
days. Payment of the remaining $300,000 will be suspended
subject to Bethlehem's compliance with the July 1
cease-operation date.

   LOS ANGELES -- The principal subsidiary of First Executive
Corp. is a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed here yesterday
alleging that Merv Griffin, Donald Trump, Resorts
International Inc. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
misrepresented Resort's prospective financial results in the
sale of its debt in 1988.
   The suit, filed in federal court, cites registration
statements related to the sale of $325 million in notes. It
alleges that financial information provided in the statements
failed to reveal that the resulting company would lack
sufficient cash to cover its debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Drexel, now in bankruptcy proceedings, was named in the
suit as underwriter of the securities. Mr. Trump allegedly
acquiesced in the misstatements in order to spur the sale of
his interest in Resorts. Also named as a defendant was the
investment banking firm of Houlihan, Lokey, Howard &amp; Zukin.
   First Executive's holdings of Resort debt had a book value
of $148.7 million at Dec. 31. Executive Life Insurance Co.
unit, the plaintiff, is the principal holder of the notes,
which were issued in connection with Mr. Griffin's 1988
purchase of Resorts after a takeover battle with Mr. Trump.
   The suit alleges the defendants fraudulently
misrepresented the condition of Resorts properties, implying
that they were in good condition and had excellent cash flow.
It also alleges securities fraud and seeks unspecified
compensatory damages.
   Mr. Trump and his spokesmen, Mr. Griffin and his lawyer
were all attending the grand opening of Mr. Trump's Taj Mahal
hotel-casino in Atlantic City, N.J., and couldn't be reached
for comment. A Drexel spokesman in New York also was
unreachable late last night.
   Mr. Griffin issued the $325 million in senior junk bonds
on top of $600 million in existing Resorts notes. The
entertainer and businessman soon ran into serious cash-flow
problems when it became clear that assets tagged for sale to
pay off debt couldn't be sold as originally planned, and that
the resort required more capital improvements than previously
thought.
   In August 1989, Resorts suspended payments on the $925
million in notes. In late December, Resorts simultaneously
filed a petition for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code and a reorganization plan.

whatever is necessary to maximize shareholder value.

   Heard on the Street:
   TCBY, Frozen Yogurt Concern, May Benefit
   From New Competition, Some Analysts Say

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- To hear Wall Street tell it, investors in TCBY
Enterprises should positively be doing cartwheels over the
impending entry of two giant fast-food companies into the
frozen yogurt business.
   TCBY, a Little Rock, Ark., chain that now dominates the
frozen yogurt market, already is in a war with smaller
yogurt-chains and with Baskin-Robbins. In May, International
Dairy Queen will roll out a frozen yogurt product in 2,200
stores. And that same month, McDonald's plans to go
nationwide with a similar product in 8,000 outlets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street, however, isn't fazed. "The fact that
McDonald's is replacing ice cream with frozen yogurt sends a
clear message that frozen yogurt is bullish," says Shearson
Lehman Hutton analyst Caroline Levy. Yogurt, she says, has
captured only 14% of the frozen dessert market. With
McDonald's pushing it, the market is certain to expand. "If
someone tries a frozen yogurt in McDonalds," she adds,
"eventually they will become a TCBY customer."
   With its shares trading at 18 times trailing per-share
earnings and at five times book value, TCBY will need new
customers. In fact, the stock is trading at nearly four times
sales. Those are growth-stock multiples. The question is
whether the business is maturing. In its past fiscal year,
ended in November, sales in TCBY stores open at least 12
months rose by an ample, but hardly explosive, 3.6%. Sales in
stores open at least 24 months rose only 2%. And in the first
quarter of this year, same-store sales fell 8%. The company
blames bad weather in December (January and February were
mild) and a tough comparison with an unusually good quarter
last year.
   Analysts are believers. The Street is estimating that
TCBY's earnings growth will resume, and that net for the year
will outstrip last year's net by 30%.
   The bullish case is that TCBY has established a distinct
product and a dominant market share (roughly 34%). Its
customers can choose from among 50 flavors -- from white
chocolate mousse to pumpkin -- of which half a dozen are
available on any day, and a variety of toppings. McDonald's
restaurants will serve only one or two flavors.
   According to market research, one third of all Americans
have yet to savor their first frozen yogurt. And according to
bulls, there are only two types of Americans: those who eat
frozen yogurt now, and those who will. "We know there is
competition," Ms. Levy says. "We are simply betting that the
market is growing."
   The party line at TCBY is similarly jubilant. The chain
has close to 1,700 stores, mostly franchised, and plans to go
to 2,000 by November. "I don't think it will adversely impact
us," a spokeswoman says of the mushrooming competition. "If
anything, it broadens the market. Our plans are to continue
growing."
   It is possible, of course, that TCBY is planning a party
to celebrate its rush of good news. But don't bet on it.
   TCBY has recently had to deal with unrest among
franchisees, some of whom complained that TCBY was charging
them too high a price for its yogurt. Prices at McDonald's
are expected to be lower, analysts say, putting more pressure
on TCBY's price. At a suburban Atlanta TCBY, for instance, a
small yogurt is $1.09 and a medium-sized portion is $1.51,
plus 30 cents for a topping. McDonald's prices are expected
to be in the vicinity of 70 cents.
   Frozen yogurt executives say TCBY and other frozen yogurt
chains have more to fear from restaurants that specialize in
ice cream, such as Dairy Queen and Baskin-Robbins, than from
McDonald's, because ice cream is a natural competitor to
frozen yogurt.
   "If a Dairy Queen opens across the street from a TCBY,
they could take half its business," says Jeffrey Frankel,
president of Dallas-based I Love Yogurt. And as more Dairy
Queens promote yogurt there will be less room for new TCBY
franchises.
   But, Mr. Frankel says, "people aren't going to go to
McDonald's for yogurt." Analysts, in general, say the Golden
Arches are a turn-off to health-conscious yogurt lovers.
   They are, perhaps, writing off the nation's No. 1
fast-food chain too quickly. McDonald's is unmatched as a
marketer, and if it chooses to redefine itself in the
direction of yogurt eaters, people will take notice. And by
all appearances, some such redefinition is in place.
   McDonald's also plans to introduce lower-calorie shakes,
fruit sorbets and apple bran muffins. A spokesman says "our
mission is to respond to customer tastes in an evolutionary
way, not in a revolutionary way. People are eating a little
lighter and keeping an eye on their health." It is hardly
news that people are eating lighter, but when McDonald's
notices, that is news indeed. Regardless of what they say in
public, it's a good bet that competitors -- in yogurt and
other products -- agree.

   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. is holding discussions
on the possible sale of its Ford New Holland farm-equipment
subsidiary to Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, people familiar with the
situation said.
   Such a move would mark the second major retreat from
diversification by Ford in recent months. The No. 2 U.S. auto
maker already has announced that it wants to sell its Ford
Aerospace unit. The company wants to free capital and other
resources to concentrate on the increasingly competitive auto
industry worldwide, and to expand its financial-services
operations.

   Just three years ago Ford was aggressively expanding into
the agricultural-equipment business. The auto maker bought
the New Holland division of Sperry Corp. for $330 million and
combined it with the Ford Tractor division to form Ford New
Holland in January 1987. Later that year, Ford purchased
Versatile Corp., which makes large four-wheel drive tractors.
   In all, Ford New Holland had sales of about $3 billion
last year. While significant by farm-equipment industry
standards, that was just a small portion of Ford's overall
revenue of $96.15 billion in 1989.
   An announcement of the Ford-Fiat discussions could come as
early as today, said one individual familiar with the talks.
A Ford official referred inquiries to the Ford New Holland
subsidiary, where a spokesman said he wouldn't "comment on
speculation."
   Ford and Fiat have a mixed record on completing deals. In
the mid-1980s they held intense and prolonged discussions
about merging their European automotive operations. But the
discussions fell apart when each side insisted on having
control of the combined business.
   However, the two companies are partners in the heavy-truck
business in Europe. It's possible, said one industry insider,
that Fiat could swap its interest in that operation in return
for acquiring Ford New Holland.
   Taking over Ford New Holland would make Fiat an instant
powerhouse in the U.S. as farmers continue their recent
buying spree. Its chief rivals would be Deere &amp; Co. and the
JI Case unit of Tenneco Inc., which makes Case International
farm equipment.
   Fiat's Geotech farm-equipment unit, which has major
operations in Europe, already owns Hesston Corp. in the U.S.,
a relatively small maker of farm implements. It wasn't
immediately clear what a Fiat purchase of New Holland would
mean for the joint venture that Hesston has with Case to make
hay and forage equipment.
   However, if a deal is completed, it would "open up an
entire new market for exports of small farm tractors Fiat
builds in Europe," said John Stark, editor of Stark's
Off-Highway Ledger, a Chicagobased trade publication. "It
also gives Fiat flexibility for competing with Japanese
{farm-equipment} companies in Europe in 1992."
   In the U.S., Fiat would face the same challenge that
plagues Ford: Ford New Holland's tractors and farm equipment
have loyal customers in what industry officials call the
"horseshoe" from the East Coast through the South and up the
West Coast. But it is relatively weak in the heartland, where
Deere and Case are dominant.
   Ford New Holland has about 17,000 employees and does
business in 120 countries, but most of its sales are in North
America and Europe. Besides tractors, it makes combines,
forage equipment and hay-making machines.

   U.S. Needs a Few Good Investors
   As It Tries to Sell 40-Year Bonds

   NEW YORK -- Does anyone want to buy a 40-year government
bond?
   Last January, when the U.S. government tried to sell
40-year bonds for the first time since the 1950s, the $5
billion auction of Resolution Funding Corp. bonds was a flop.
Investor demand wasn't even close to the levels that dealers
had expected. After the auction results were announced,
prices of the bonds fell sharply, and yields soared.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Well, get ready for the games to begin again because the
government is back for another try. This time, Refcorp plans
to sell $3.5 billion of the "bailout bonds" Tuesday, the
proceeds of which will be used to finance the government's
rescue of the nation's troubled savings and loan industry.
   For the government, the 40-year bonds are attractive
because it can stretch out the cost of the thrift-industry
bailout over a longer period of time. The longest maturity of
government bonds is normally 30 years. Professional traders
and speculators are excited because the 40-year bonds are a
new way to make big money by gambling on interest rates.
   But for individual investors, there are big risks
associated with owning bonds that mature in 40 years. True,
the bonds are safe because they are backed by the federal
government. While Refcorp bonds don't actually carry a
government guarantee, interest payments are guaranteed by the
Treasury and principal payments are secured by Treasury
securities.
   But the interest-rate risk is enormous. That's because the
longer the lifetime of a bond, the more its price swings with
changes in interest rates. "These bonds are highly volatile,"
said Wayne Wong, managing director of fixed-income management
at MarinVest, a subsidiary of New York's Marine Midland Bank.
   For example, Mr. Wong said, if interest rates rise one
percentage point, the price of a 10-year government bond at
current yields would fall 6.26%. But the price of a 40-year
bond would fall 10%.
   Since interest rates are tough to forecast, "by the time
an individual may need the money, it may not be the right
time to sell the bonds," Mr. Wong said. He believes that
individual investors are better off in intermediate-term
government bonds maturing in six to 20 years. Currently,
these intermediate bonds yield about the same as do
longer-term bonds due to a condition referred to as a
flat-yield curve. "For individuals, it doesn't pay to go out
40 years," Mr. Wong said.
   So who would want a 40-year bond? One group of buyers is
expected to be pension funds and insurance companies who need
bonds with extra-long maturities to match future claims.
Another likely group of buyers is professional traders eager
for yet another vehicle to bet on swings in interest rates.
   Analysts think that Tuesday's 40-year auction will go a
lot better than the last time. One reason is the smaller size
of the issue. Another is changed conditions in the bond
market.
   James Fralich, an economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said
demand for long-term bonds is growing. "A lot of
institutional investors have accumulated a decent amount of
cash and now are looking to put that cash to work," he said.
   In addition, traders note, interest rates have risen more
than 1/2 percentage point since January, making long-term
bonds far more attractive. And because the first 40-year bond
auction went so poorly, some analysts expect investors to
demand a much higher yield relative to Treasurys than at the
previous auction. In January, the 40-year bond was priced to
yield about 1/4 percentage point more than the yield on
30-year Treasury bonds, but analysts say this time the
40-year bond could be priced at a yield that is 1/3
percentage point higher than the yield on the 30-year
Treasury bond.
   Michael Basham, deputy assistant secretary for federal
finance at the Treasury, said he solicited the opinions of a
dozen primary dealers who do business mainly with large
institutional investors. "Seventy percent of the dealers
suggested that we do the 40-year bond," he said. "They felt
there is sufficient demand."
   A large portion of the $3.5 billion of bonds is expected
to be stripped by securities dealers. Strips are created by
separating the semiannual interest payments from the
principal portion of the bond and selling the pieces
separately. The principal-only portion, called a zero-coupon
bond, is sold at a deep discount to its face value and is
considered one of the most volatile securities around.
   Dealers say that a 40-year zero-coupon Refcorp bond could
sell for as little as $35 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. An investor who buys the zero won't get any interest
payments but after 40 years will get $1,000.
   As trading vehicles, 40-year zeros can be lethal or
lucrative depending upon an investor's ability to
successfully time interest-rate moves. If rates rise one
percentage point, the price of a 40-year zero-coupon bond
could plummet by more than 30%. That's three times the
volatility of a regular 40-year bond. Of course, if rates
fall one percentage point, the price of a 40-year zero jumps
more than 40% -- a windfall profit.
   Paul Suckow, director of fixed-income securities at
Oppenheimer Management Corp., said trading a 40-year zero is
"almost like trading a futures contract. You don't have to
put up a lot of money to control a lot of volatility," he
said.
   More than half of the previous Refcorp 40-year bond issue
-- $2.5 billion of the $5 billion issue -- has been stripped
into zero-coupon securities, according to a recent report
from Federal Home Loan Banks. But a large percentage of that
activity was by Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., which now
is out of business.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   The corporate financing window swung wide open yesterday
as nearly $1.7 billion in new debt was offered, bringing the
total so far this week to $2.5 billion.
   Corporate heavyweights, ranging from blue chip industrials
to finance companies, were active in the debt market, taking
advantage of what some see as a finance opportunity ahead of
upcoming Treasury and agency supply.
   Among the sizable issuers that came to market were
Hydro-Quebec, General Motors Acceptance Corp. and Du Pont Co.
   The three accounted for $1.1 billion of the new debt
issuance, with Hydro-Quebec, a Canadian utility, being the
largest issuer. The utility offered $500 million of
noncallable 40-year debentures, which were priced at 99.873
to yield 9.387%.
   Salomon Brothers Inc. said in a report that its junk bond
index recorded a negative 3.08% return in the first quarter.
However, for March, the index managed to show a positive
return of 1.06%.
   Salomon said its deferred-interest index, which tracks the
zero-to-full coupon sector of the market, again showed more
price volatility than the cash-paying index. For the first
quarter, the deferred interest index recorded a negative
return of 8.15%.
   In trading, prices of most investment-grade corporate
issues were unchanged to slightly weaker. Junk bonds, or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, ended down about 1/4 point.
   But the junk bonds of Circle K Corp. surged in thin,
odd-lot trading. The Phoenix, Ariz.-based convenience store
operator, said late last night that it signed a preliminary
agreement with senior creditors and its largest shareholder
for a seven-month moratorium on debt and interest payments,
narrowly averting default on part of its debt.
   Circle K's 13% junior subordinated debentures, maturing in
1997, chalked up five points to close at 22 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury notes and bonds ended modestly lower in quiet
trading ahead of today's potentially market -- moving U.S.
employment report.
   "The day before the release of an employment report, the
market tends to be quiet," said Robert Chandross, an
economist at Lloyds Bank PLC. "Nobody wants to stick their
neck out."
   The employment report is considered among the most
important of the U.S. government's monthly economic
indicators. Because surprises in the data can upset the bond
prices, many investors stay inactive ahead of its release.
   The March employment data is especially important because
it will help determine whether January's and February's
explosive jobs growth was an aberration or the start of a
trend toward fast economic growth.
   Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets expect,
on average, non-farm jobs to have increased 178,000 last
month. In February, there were 372,000 new jobs created.
   In trading yesterday, the benchmark 30-year bond ended at
a price of 99 24/32 compared to 99 28/32 on Wednesday. The
yield was unchanged at 8.51%. The benchmark 10-year bond
ended at 99 19/32 compared with Wednesday's price of 99
22/32. That yield also was unchanged at 8.55%.
   Traders said short-term rates finished little changed. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at
7.75% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.99% while the rate on
six-month bills rose slightly to 7.75% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 8.16%.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury sold nearly $10 billion of 52-week
bills yesterday at an average rate of 7.71%. Here are details
of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   The bills are dated April 12 and mature April 11, 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals

   Municipal bonds were flat to up as much as 1/4 point in
late dealings.
   "It's very boring today (Thursday)," said a municipal
trader.
   Throughout the week, traders have said that, barring
unforeseen events, little spark is expected in the municipal
market before the release of March U.S. employment data,
scheduled for Friday.
   Among seasoned dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority
7.20% securities of 2018 were up 1/8 point at 97 1/2 to 97
5/8 to yield 7.40%, unchanged from yields quoted late
Wednesday.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended flat to
slightly higher.
   Prices tracked but outperformed Treasurys, which ended
lower but above the day's lowest levels.
   Government National Mortgage Associations 9% securities
for April delivery were quoted at 96 4/32, up 1/32.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 10% securities were
quoted at 100 1/32, unchanged.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Bank of Canada's bank rate rose to 13.57% yesterday, its
highest level in more than seven years.
   The rise followed a new inflation warning by Bank of
Canada Governor John Crow. In a speech Wednesday night to
business people in Brossard, Quebec, Mr. Crow said "cost and
price pressures in the Canadian economy remain strong." He
added that tightening of monetary conditions since
mid-January appears to have been well-advised in light of
"persistently strong spending and inflation pressures."
   Mr. Crow said Bank of Canada "will continue to encourage
sufficient monetary restraint to bring about a significant
improvement in Canada's underlying inflation performance."
   Canada's February consumer price index was up 0.6% from
January and up 5.4% from a year earlier. The March data will
be announced April 20.
   In early trading, Canadian bonds were modestly lower on
the news.

             How Interest Rates Move Bond Prices

   CONCERNS PROLIFERATE about the rapid spread of nuclear
technology.
   The Iraqi plot to smuggle nuclear trigger devices is "one
of hundreds of such enterprises they have going" around the
world, asserts Seth Carus, a Naval War College expert on
proliferation. Iraq also is shopping for high-speed
centrifuge components that can be used to make
highly-enriched uranium. Meanwhile, Iran has revived its
nuclear-research program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials finger China as a key supplier of
nuclear-weapons technology. Intelligence reports say Beijing
may be providing copies of short-range Soviet Scud B missiles
to North Korea, helping Iraq get centrifuge material, and
providing missiles to Iran. Despite U.S. complaints, Israel
and South Africa continue jointly developing missiles and
possibly nuclear weapons.
   Nations that signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
will soon consider condemning Iraq and North Korea.
                                                                                                       

   STAGGERING GIANT? Disenchantment grows within the Soviet
military.
   Draft-dodging is a special problem; more than 1,000
conscripts fled the Red Army during the first 10 days of
March alone. Unilateral Soviet force reductions in Eastern
Europe have cut younger officers adrift -- 173,000 military
families returning to civilian life are still seeking
housing. And last year, 59 Soviet officers were killed by
civilians, compared to just two in 1988.
   U.S. analysts fear mounting frustrations could lead the
Soviet military to withdraw support from Gorbachev. They
believe the Soviet president's crackdown in Lithuania,
especially his pursuit of military deserters, may be designed
at least partly to retain the loyalty of the officer corps.

   The budget chief calls on Senate Majority Leader Mitchell
and Budget Chairman Sasser for the first time in months, and
meets with scores of rank-and-file Democrats. He stresses
that a budget accord is needed to reassure markets. The
lawmakers say he is now more conciliatory.
   With up to $50 billion in across-the-board Gramm-Rudman
cuts looming if Congress doesn't act, "it's only a question
of when we get to negotiations," Darman says. But Democratic
leaders still shy away from a budget summit, and any accord
could take time to accomplish. Some expect no action until a
post-election session.
   Rostenkowski still boosts his big deficit-reduction
package, though an aide concedes it is doomed unless there is
a budget crisis.
                                                                                                       

   LAWMAKERS LAMBAST Cheney for favoring weapons over people
in the defense-budget battle. Sen. Glenn claims the defense
chief "pulled the rug right out from under" lawmakers
determined to maintain manpower levels. Even Gen. Hickey, who
is in charge of Air Force personnel issues, says, "I'm not
comfortable with how things are unfolding."
                                                                                                       

   REPUBLICAN WOMEN organize to back GOP candidates who favor

   CONSERVATIVES STEAM as the Bush administration quietly
lifts a ban on exports to the Soviet Union's Kama River truck
plant. Reagan imposed the ban to show his firm line against
Moscow. He said the plant, built with help from U.S.
companies, was churning out military trucks used in
Afghanistan.
                                                                                                       

   ACADEMIC PORK turns lean. Because of the budget crunch,
the House appropriations subcommittee on energy and water
development, a key benefactor for colleges, earmarks only
$37.5 million for them this year, down from $128 million two
years ago. A congressional backlash against academic lobbying
also lies behind growing opposition to pork barrel projects.
                                                                                                       

   FRIENDLY PERSUASION? The White House talks compromise on
most issues.
   After threatening vetoes last week over child care, aid to
Panama and Nicaragua and the Environmental Protection Agency,
the administration now says agreements are likely all around.
It looks to the House to fix the Senate's clean-air bill. The
Justice Department still recommends nixing the Senate's
job-discrimination bill, though.
   At the president's behest, Senate Republicans drop a plan
to attach the capital-gains tax cut measure to a minor trade
bill. Instead, Treasury officials and aides to Finance
Chairman Bentsen discuss altering the proposal to make it
cost less or raising other taxes to pay for it. Packwood,
however, says he will attach the tax cut to the pending
child-care bill.
   The conservative weekly Human Events says Bush "boots away
good GOP issues" by avoiding fights with the Democrats.

   EAST PEORIA, Ill. -- Caterpillar Inc.'s tough battle to
remain the international leader in heavy machinery is being
waged here at plant KK, where yellow-helmeted workers are
ripping out antiquated machine tools and putting in dozens of
octopus-shaped robots. The work is part of a $2 billion
overhaul of Caterpillar's manufacturing operations.
   But across the Illinois River at Caterpillar's world
headquarters, executives fret that a force beyond their
control is undermining this efficiency drive: the weakening
Japanese yen. Over the past 16 months, the dollar has climbed
30% against the yen, making Japanese goods comparably less
expensive in the U.S. and third-country markets and giving
Caterpillar rivals such as Komatsu Ltd. a substantial
competitive edge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, the difference in the exchange rates alone has
slashed Komatsu's costs by a greater percentage than the
reductions Caterpillar anticipates from its entire
modernization program.
   "It gets tougher and tougher to compete," complains James
W. Wogsland, a Caterpillar executive vice president. "We're
concerned about the (dollar's) trend, and we don't see how
it's going to stop."
   Caterpillar's factories obviously aren't the only ones
likely to be hurt. C. Fred Bergsten, who heads the Institute
for International Economics, a Washington consulting
organization, estimates that if the yen-dollar exchange rate
remains at its current level, U.S. exporters could lose $5
billion to $10 billion in business annually. In addition,
billions more could be lost as Americans buy more
Japanese-made goods.
   "It's a matter of great concern when you work so hard to
see it wiped out by something you don't control," says G.
Mustafa Mohatarem, the director of trade and competitive
analysis at General Motors Corp., which also has invested
heavily to modernize its U.S. manufacturing.
   Caterpillar, in seeking government help, faces a struggle.
So far, Japan has been carrying the load in trying to prop up
the yen, and the central bankers of other nations have, at
best, acted sporadically. In Washington, the Federal Reserve
Board and some in the Bush administration appear opposed to
any concerted moves; the problem in U.S. manufacturing is by
no means their only concern about currencies. At the Paris
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations this
weekend, officials are expected to take little concrete
action on foreign-exchange rates. (With traders skittish over
the meeting, the dollar eased to 157.40 yen in New York late
yesterday from 158.95 Wednesday.)
   Caterpillar's voice has become somewhat lonelier among
major U.S. companies. In the past 10 years, many American
corporations have built more overseas factories, increased
purchases of Japanese materials and components, and become
more sophisticated in using financial hedging instruments --
all moves that lessen the impact of a strengthening dollar.
   And their overseas investments are growing. The Commerce
Department said yesterday that U.S. companies plan to
increase their overseas capital spending 13% this year, up
substantially from a 2% rise projected six months earlier. In
the wake of increases of 14% in 1989 and 24% in 1988, the
majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. companies now plan
to spend $54.9 billion this year. So, even though major
multinationals' U.S.-based manufacturing operations suffer
when the dollar rises, the companies can still look good in
their financial reports.
   The result: There are fewer fired-up corporate advocates
for industrial America. The attitude among many companies
today is "Who cares where I make my money?" says Ben Fischer,
a former Steelworkers union official who directs the Center
for Labor Studies at Carnegie-Mellon University. "You do not
have sharp, black-and-white motivations in terms of what
happens in U.S. operations." Even Timothy L. Elder,
Caterpillar's chief lobbyist, concedes that "there aren't a
whole lot of folks getting concerned" about the declining
yen.
   Motorola Inc. was once a staunch advocate of a stronger
yen, but Robert W. Galvin, chairman of its executive
committee, says the electronic-equipment maker is less
concerned about the issue today. In the past 10 years,
Motorola has sharply increased production overseas, building
plants in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Today, Mr. Galvin
says, his bigger worries include such issues as building
products at low cost and opening Japan's markets.
   Like many U.S. companies, Caterpillar has taken some steps
to protect itself from currency gyrations, but it also has
retained a singular commitment to succeeding as a
predominantly American manufacturer. More than two-thirds of
its 60,400 employees work in the U.S., where it has 17
production sites.
   Caterpillar's executives express pride that it is second
only to Boeing Co. in the roster of U.S. exporters. Last year
alone, Caterpillar contributed $1.6 billion to the U.S.
balance of payments through exports of mammoth machines such
as its 103-ton, $950,000 bulldozer. Its familiar yellow
machines remain the market-share leaders throughout the
world. They are even popular in Japan, where they are widely
used in building golf courses.
   In the mid-1980s, it was Caterpillar that led corporate
America's charge against the then-sky-high dollar, which was
much higher than it is now. Enlisting the aid of such potent
groups as the National Association of Manufacturers and the
Business Roundtable, Caterpillar Chairman Lee L. Morgan waged
a crusade on Capitol Hill and met more than a dozen times
with top administration officials, including President
Reagan. The lobbying helped lead to the landmark Plaza
Agreement in 1985, when industrialized nations agreed to try
to drive down the dollar.
   Now, Caterpillar is again revving up its exchange-rate
activism. Its executives are warning any bureaucrat who will
listen that the dollar's rise against the yen damages
American competitiveness. "They are gearing up to make a
major point on the issue," says Jerry Jasinowski, the
president of the NAM, who has become a supporter of propping
up the yen. Caterpillar President Donald V. Fites has pressed
the case in visits to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   Caterpillar's point of view does have some supporters,
including a number of major companies such GM and Chrysler
Corp. Says Robert N. Spolum, senior vice president at Clark
Equipment Co.: "I wouldn't want to see the dollar get a hell
of a lot stronger."
   Caterpillar's lament can be illustrated at its
transmission factory here. Plant KK -- the company uses
letters to distinguish its factories -- is one of dozens of
Caterpillar operations being reworked from the ground up.
   Following the company's success in driving down the dollar
in the 1980s, Caterpillar made an intense commitment to
improving its U.S. manufacturing. Rather than join the
stampede of American manufacturers that set up low-cost
operations in Mexico and around the Pacific Rim, Caterpillar
sought to make its domestic plants competitive on a world
scale. To do so, it launched its so-called Plant With a
Future program -- PWAF for short. The program called for
overhauling virtually all the company's U.S. factories,
installing fancy new robotics and streamlining assembly
systems.
   Before the work started at KK in 1987, the plant's system
for making transmissions was "inflexible and cumbersome,"
says John Bennett, the plant's cigar-chomping manager. Today,
with new equipment, a lathe that once took eight hours to set
up can be rejiggered in nine minutes, saving both manpower
and the need to make parts in big, inventory-building
batches. Cat even raised the roof to make room for a
heat-treating complex that toughens gears and helps them
resist abrasion. Although the factory overhaul won't be
completed until 1993, the incidence of faulty transmissions
already has been sliced from 4% two years ago to less than
2%. KK's costs are expected to drop 19% eventually.
   But Caterpillar officials worry that the slumping yen
threatens years of work at factories such as this one. "How
long do you think it takes a company to take 20% out of its
cost structure?" asks D.G. Paris, a company economist. (The
answer for Caterpillar's PWAF program: seven years.) In
recent months, Mr. Paris has frequently telephoned Federal
Reserve officials to make this point.
   If Caterpillar hadn't undertaken its modernization
program, of course, it would be in even worse shape now. It
also would be suffering more if it hadn't moved to hedge its
position. Since 1984, its sales from Europe have more than
doubled to $1.9 billion, while sales from the U.S. rose 45%
to $8.1 billion. And Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. of
Japan, a joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,
posted sales exceeding $2.5 billion last year -- nearly a
fourfold increase from 1984.
   Many U.S. companies say they've limited the damage from
exchange rates because they are more competitive today than
they were in the 1970s and 1980s. "We've turned our nose to
the grindstone," says Adrian Dillon, the chief economist at
Eaton Corp., the Cleveland-based maker of truck and
electronic components.
   But the decline in the yen also makes it less likely that
companies will enjoy the fruits of their streamlining
efforts. Caterpillar, for instance, may not be able to raise
prices at all this year -- and may even have to offer
discounts. At the moment, Komatsu seems content to maintain
its prices and increase its financial war chest. But as its
margins fatten, it could easily trim prices in a drive for
market share.
   That's a disturbing thought for Cat dealers such as B.
Crane Patten Jr. of Elmhurst, Ill. Mr. Patten vividly
remembers the one-two punch of a strong dollar and weak sales
of the early 1980s, when he had to lay off 420 of 700
employees at his dealership and diesel-engine business. He
also sold his airplane, scrapped free coffee for employees
and closed the executive dining room.
   The problem today, Caterpillar dealers say, is that their
margins have shrunk by half. Thus, the dealers have less
flexibility in offering deals, while Komatsu dealers have
lots of elbow room.
   Some economists and manufacturers fear that a declining
yen carries repercussions that will be felt for months, even
years. "I'm worried the whole manufacturing sector could get
set back again," Mr. Paris says. U.S. auto makers say they
already are feeling increased heat from Japanese competitors.
"All of a sudden, they appear to have more of a margin to
offer (sales) incentives," says Mr. Mohatarem, the GM
economist.
   Caterpillar officials acknowledge, however, that there
aren't any clear solutions to their problems. In the first
half of the 1980s, the dollar was overvalued against most
major currencies. Today, some economists see it more as a
"yen problem." But a recent increase in Japanese interest
rates didn't boost the yen, as some observers had hoped.
   Caterpillar and other U.S. companies would welcome a
reduction in U.S. interest rates, which could make the dollar
less attractive and bolster their business. But the Fed fears
that if it acts to lower rates, U.S. inflation probably would
increase. In addition, attempts to intervene in currency
markets -- in the current situation, to buy up yen to
strengthen the currency -- might not work. With
foreign-exchange trading sometimes totaling a staggering $500
billion a day, according to some estimates, the financial
markets can easily swamp any central-bank maneuvers.
   So, some experts contend that it's better to let the
markets themselves correct any short-term imbalances.
   But that doesn't stop Caterpillar from pressing its point.
And if the yen doesn't stop slumping, more manufacturers may
join Cat's chorus. Vows Mr. Elder, the company's lobbyist:
"In the next couple of months, we'll turn up the heat."

   Major railroads muddled through the first quarter with

   The railroads said a surge in coal and grain traffic
partly offset the continued weakness in industrial freight.
Moreover, they said, aggressive cost-cutting and moderate
winter weather tempered the effects of declines in high-value
freight, particularly metals and automobiles. Rail analysts
even said slumping auto shipments appeared to have turned
upward at the end of the quarter.

   Analysts expect Consolidated Rail Corp., which relies
heavily on automobiles, to post a steep first-quarter
earnings drop. They said Conrail should earn between 60 cents
and 65 cents a share, compared with 88 cents in the
year-earlier period.
   But analysts expect sharply higher first quarter earnings
at Burlington Northern Inc., which derives about 50% of its
revenue from coal and grain. They predict that Burlington
Northern will earn between 70 cents and 80 cents a share.
That compares with 44 cents in the year-earlier quarter,
which was hurt by severe winter weather on the railroad's
Chicago-Seattle route.
   "The economy has been stronger than expected. I was
looking for rail traffic to be down 3% in the first quarter,
and it looks as if traffic will actually be up slightly,"
said Graeme Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston Co. "The
surprise element has been the spurt in coal and grain."
   Overall rail carloadings at the major railroads were up
less than 1%, according to the Association of American
Railroads. Shipments of coal rose 6.5%, reflecting strong
utility purchases, and grain was up about 2%, because of
robust export sales. But carloadings of higher-value freight
were generally down, with motor vehicles declining 19.7%,
metal products 1.6%, lumber 5% and paper products 3.2%.
   Some analysts were cheered by first-quarter carload
levels, which followed traffic declines of more than 3% in
each of the last two quarters. In addition, automotive
shipments began to improve toward the end of the quarter.
   "The industry has weathered yet another recession, which
was short, shallow and centered on the automotive industry,"
said Andras Petery, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "It
was short because it got under way in May 1989, and it looks
like we are coming out of it now."
   Anthony Hatch, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said
cost-reduction measures at the major railroads also helped
the industry through the slowdown. "It's been a cyclically
tough period, and the railroads have handled it reasonably
well," he said. Mr. Hatch predicted modest rail traffic gains
in the second quarter against the year-ago period, when
traffic levels flattened.
   But not everyone is confident about the rail industry
outlook. "Obviously things are better than they were, but I'm
not sure we're out of the woods yet," said Ms. Lidgerwood,
the First Boston analyst. She added that first-quarter
carloads, excluding coal and grain, were actually down 2.8%.
And she said the recent improvement in automobile carloadings
"could be a fluke. I don't know if it will be sustained."
   CSX Corp., the first of the rail group to release results,
reported early this week that its first-quarter net income
declined to $77 million from the year-earlier $82 million.
This year's first quarter included a net gain of $52 million
from disposal of CSX's natural gas liquids processing unit.
The company said strong coal, grain and fertilizer traffic on
its railroad more than offset weakness in automobiles and
metals. However, rail expenses increased as a result of
higher diesel fuel prices and an expanded locomotive repair
program to upgrade the company's fleet. In addition, a $33
million after-tax restructuring charge at the company's ocean
ship company, Sea-Land Service, hurt CSX's first-quarter
earnings.
   Although Conrail declined to comment on analysts'
projections, a company spokesman acknowledged its
first-quarter results were affected by a decline in traffic
and an "unfavorable" traffic mix. He added that Conrail
carried higher volumes of lower-revenue freight such as coal,
and lower volumes of higher-revenue freight such as autos and
auto parts.
   The Conrail spokesman also said lower levels of interest
income and higher levels of interest expense related to the
company's recent purchases of its own stock will affect the
results.
   Norfolk Southern Corp. declined to comment on analysts'
projections that its first-quarter earnings will be flat or
slightly down compared with net of 75 cents a share a year
ago. Although Norfolk Southern benefited from the improvement
in coal, its chief commodity, the company was hurt by the
slowdown in auto shipments.
   Union Pacific Corp. officials said first-quarter earnings
are likely to be up "slightly" compared with net of $1.22 a
share in the year-earlier period. They said earnings at the
company's rail unit will also be up "slightly," reflecting
higher coal and chemical shipments, increased labor
productivity and an approximately 1% increase in average
price levels. Shipment levels, which were weak early in the
quarter, improved by the end of the quarter. "Six weeks ago
we were a lot more worried about a recession this year," said
a Union Pacific official. "Now, it doesn't look like a
recession to us in 1990. It looks like growth, but very slow
growth."
   The company said first-quarter earnings of its natural
resource business will increase between 25% and 30%,
reflecting higher volumes and prices of oil and gas. But
Union Pacific's trucking unit, Overnite Transportation Co.,
will post reduced earnings, because of higher fuel, labor and
benefit costs and industry-wide rate cutting.

   UAL Begins
   Merger Talks
   On Union Offer

   UAL Corp. directors launched an effort to nail down a
purchase agreement with United Airlines' three unions
following a sweetened bid from the group valued at more than
$4.36 billion, or $200 a share, people familiar with the
situation said.
   However, people following the talks noted that major
differences, including the price, remained between the board
and unions. "As a rational matter, they're so close they
could reach agreement," one official said. "But it's very
emotional, very tense on both sides. It could just as easily
break down."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The board's decision to begin acquisition talks came
yesterday evening following a day-long meeting in Chicago and
signaled the directors may be ready to accept the union offer
rather than fight a proxy battle with UAL's largest
shareholder, Coniston Partners. The New York investment firm
is pressing for an employee buyout.
   Coniston, which owns 11.8% of UAL, was threatening to
begin soliciting shareholder votes to oust the board if the
directors didn't accept the offer at yesterday's meeting.
   Although the offer was said to fall short of the board's
asking price of $220 a share, the directors were faced with
an unappetizing alternative of a proxy slugfest with its
major employee groups that could have further damaged the
nation's second largest airline.
   The unusual union coalition of pilots, mechanics and
flight attendants coalesced earlier this year at the prodding
of both the board and Coniston following the collapse of a
$6.79 billion, $300-a-share, labor-management bid in October.
   This time, the union decided to proceed without the
cooperation of UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, who stands to be
ousted from his job if the labor group can pull off the
difficult task of obtaining financing.
   If the board accepts the union offer, the question will
become whether or not banks will be willing to lend more than
$3 billion in cash for a buy-out led by a labor group that so
far lacks a major equity investor.
   News of the board meeting to consider the union offer
lifted UAL stock as much as $3 a share in early trading
yesterday. But as the day wore on without any news of an
agreement, the shares weakened, closing down $1 a share to
$165.50 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The mechanics of the talks at yesterday's meeting were
complicated by the opposition of Mr. Wolf to an offer that
would cost him his job if the unions later obtain financing.
He is likely to remain in office as a lame duck until then if
a merger agreement is reached.
   The board meeting began at 10:30 a.m. Central Daylight
Time, and the merger talks were still under way more than 10
hours later.
   The unions sweetened the offer this week from their old
bid of roughly $4 billion, or about $185 a share, which they
made March 19. The offer, negotiated with Coniston, included
$150 a share in cash, $25 in debt, and an equity interest
totaling 25% in the airline.
   This week, the unions increased the debt portion,
eliminated the 25% equity interest, and instead threw in
proceeds, expected to be about $500 million, of a prospective
sale of UAL's 50% interest in its Covia computer reservation
system.

   TOKYO -- Shuwa Corp., a big Japanese property-investment
company, said it is among the bidders for one of the U.S.'s
top department stores, Saks Fifth Avenue.
   That would put Shuwa, a closely held firm with a
reputation for bold stock-market forays, into a competition
for Saks with a management-led group backed by a sedate Tokyo
retail chain, Tobu Department Stores Ltd.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The management group's offer was made public last month
after B.A.T PLC, a British conglomerate that owns Saks,
closed bidding on the 46-store, New York-based chain. B.A.T
said then that it had several offers for Saks, but it didn't
identify the bidders.
   Makoto Ichihara, Shuwa's managing director, confirmed the
bid, but wouldn't provide details of the offer for Saks. A
Tobu spokesman refused to comment on Shuwa's bid.
   Shuwa is one of the most active Japanese investors in the
U.S. and Japanese commercial-property market. The firm owns
more than 53 buildings in Japan and 34 in the U.S., with a
total value of more than $10 billion. But it is heavily
indebted. A credit-research agency in Japan estimates Shuwa's
borrowings outstanding total 750 billion yen ($4.72 billion).
   Some stock-market analysts said they doubt whether Shuwa,
which has used a lot of its money to invest in the market,
will be able to proceed with an Saks offer because of the
recent drop in share prices here. The Tokyo stock market is
off more than 27% since the start of the year.
   That has led to rumors in the market that such highly
geared investors as Shuwa could face funding shortages. The
Yomiuri Shimbun, a national newspaper, reported that more
than 30 securities firms were stuck with 10 million unwanted
shares when a group of speculators was unable to meet its 30
billion yen payment. The group wasn't identified.

   Durakon Industries Inc. Expects to Post
   Earnings of at Least $1 a Share in 1990

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
AUTO PARTS AND EQUIPMENT INCLUDING TIRES (AUP)
</IN>
<LP>
   LAPEER, Mich. -- Durakon Industries Inc. is "comfortable"
with analyst forecasts that the company will earn $1 a share
or more a share this year, David Laro, president and chief
executive officer, said.
   The maker of pickup truck-bed liners and other auto parts
posted a $17.1 million, or $2.78-a-share, net loss for 1989.
Those results included non-recurring charges totaling $19.3
million, or $3.13 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Laro, in an interview, declined to give first-quarter
earnings figures. But Mr. Laro did say that, because of a
cost-reduction program Durakon began last year and other
positive developments, the company expects to perform better
this year. For the 1989 first quarter, Durakon had a net loss
of $1.1 million, on sales of $22.3 million.
   Durakon was awarded a contract in early March to supply
three General Motors Corp. assembly plants with pickup
truck-bed liners. GM will market the liners under Durakon's
Duraliner brand and sell them as factory-installed options.
GM is the first Big Three auto maker to offer Durakon's
truck-bed liners, which typically are sold and installed by
dealers, as factory-installed equipment. Truck-bed liners,
made of polymer, are used to protect the metal frame of a
vehicle and help to inhibit rusting.
   The contract "will give us a place in the market that is
stronger than ever," said Mr. Laro, who declined to estimate
the increase in sales the contract will bring.
   But Mr. Laro did say that, as a result of the GM contract,
he expects the percentage of all new pickup trucks purchased
with truck-bed liners to increase to about 50% from about 32%
now. "We will get the lion's share of that business, he said.
The new GM work prompted analysts to raise their forecasts of
Durakon's earnings for 1990 to $1 or more a share, from about
80 cents.
   Durakon wants to strike agreements similar to its GM
relationship with other auto makers. Last year, Durakon
became a supplier to Nissan Motor Co's. plant in Smyrna,
Tenn., which now is the only auto maker besides GM to offer
Durakon truck-bed liners as a factory option.
   Mr. Laro said that as a result of efficiencies gained from
new automated equipment and the upgrading of other
instruments, the company will not have to hire additional
personnel to handle the expected order increase. Durakon
spent $4 million to improve its factories.
   The agreement with GM comes as Durakon nears completion of
its cost-cutting program begun a year ago. Since then,
Durakon has changed management, sold some operations and
discontinued others. Mr. Laro became chief executive in March
1989. The company also cut its payroll by 8% to 941 people.
   Durakon wrote down $15 million of goodwill in connection
with its 1987 purchase of DFM Corp. The company also wrote
down by $3.8 million a patent held by its Jerr-Dan Corp.
subsidiary. Both those actions took effect in the fourth
quarter.
   Mr. Laro said Durakon has renegotiated contracts with its
suppliers that will save costs. Durakon plans to announce
further cost-cutting measures in the second quarter. Durakon
also sold two unprofitable business lines: a sailboat
manufacturer and its trucking business.
   Meanwhile officials decided to keep the company's Jerr-Dan
division, which makes roll-back car carriers, which are
flat-bedded trailers used by big trucks to haul automobiles.
Last year Durakon agreed to sell the division, but the deal
fell through when the buyer was unable to obtain financing,
Mr. Laro said. Now Durakon intends to keep Jerr-Dan, which
plans to unveil a new product next month. "There's
substantial value to our shareholders in keeping Jerr-Dan,"
Mr. Laro said.

   Education:
   Schoolteachers Say It's Wrongheaded
   To Try to Teach Students What's Right

   Should public schools teach morality to children?
   A growing number of parents, worried that their children
aren't building good character, are pushing educators to cram
moral lessons into the already crowded school day. But school
districts are finding that many teachers are opposed to the
task and play hooky when assigned to teach such classes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About 84% of public school parents want moral values
taught in school, and 68% want educators to develop strict
standards of "right and wrong," according to a Gallup Poll.
Parental pressure has recently spurred some state
legislatures and education departments to urge public schools
to teach students values such as honesty, respect, and
patriotism. Hundreds of companies, including Glendale Federal
Bank, Glendale, Calif., and Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard,
Mass., pump millions of dollars into such programs.
   But polls also show that most teachers object to the
concept of morality education on philosophical or practical
grounds; many fear that such programs will stir up
controversy in classrooms where diverse student bodies
already cause plenty of headaches. Even districts that have
printed values curricula and issued teaching materials at
great expense find that such items often gather dust on
teachers' shelves.
   Concern over values among parents and educators is
reinforced by statistical measures. A recent Louis Harris &amp;
Associates Inc. survey conducted for the Girl Scouts found
that 47% of students would cheat on an exam; in another
survey, 66% said they would lie to achieve a business
objective. U.S. teen pregnancy, drug abuse and juvenile crime
rates are among the highest in the industrialized world.
   A Baltimore County, Md., public school survey showed
parents spend 15 minutes a week in "meaningful dialogue" with
their children, who glean values mainly from peers and
television. "We know kids have very little sense of right or
wrong," says Thomas Lickona, an education professor at State
University of New York at Cortland. "Schools must step into
the breach."
   They already have done so in several states, including New
York, New Jersey, New Hampshire and California, which ask
teachers to hold separate morality classes or infuse moral
values into language arts, social studies and history
lessons. Fresno, Calif., schools feature a value of the
month; February's was love. Los Angeles and other large
districts also are initiating programs.
   To decide what to teach, state education boards generally
round up diverse professionals -- a civil-liberties lawyer, a
fundamentalist preacher and a rabbi, for instance -- who
arrive at an acceptable list of values to be taught. Respect,
responsibility, compassion, honesty and civic participation
usually head the list.
   Districts often buy a prepackaged values curriculum, such
as one from the Thomas Jefferson Center, a Pasadena, Calif.,
nonprofit group that promotes values education. The center's
program promises to build character in children in just 10
minutes a day. Sales this year have jumped fourfold.
   Margaret Carlson, a teacher of English at Contoocook
Valley High School in Peterboro, N.H., says she supports
morals education because "there are some values -- like
courage and honesty, responsibility and self-control -- basic
things that really aren't debatable." She adds: "Building
moral character is good. Getting away from this has
impoverished our people."
   But organized programs have failed to score with many
teachers, as well as some parents and educators. Some
teachers at training sessions openly say that, on principle,
they will refuse to teach values courses, says Patrick J.
McCarthy, executive vice president of the Jefferson Center.
   When Barbara Kuhlman Brown, vice president of the Concord,
N.H., school board, went to a state seminar on teaching
morals last summer, the sponsors spoke of pushing
Judeo-Christian culture. "My God," whispered a board
colleague, who had been educated in Nazi Germany. "I can see
their brown shirts."
   Because of educators' opposition, New Hampshire has
delayed implementing a values-education program that was
supposed to start last fall. The Concord school board also
has vowed to keep values education out of its schools. "This
wipes out diversity and separation of church and state," Ms.
Brown says. "It negates everything public schools stand for."
   Using a hypothetical example, Ms. Brown says teachers
worry how to respond if a student asks whether her father is
a thief for bringing home pens from the office -- and then
another tells how his father, who loves him dearly and can't
afford a bicycle, picked one up on the street for him. To
what degree, she also asks, should teachers emphasize courage
if a child wonders about rushing into a burning building to
save someone?
   Mark Beauvais, superintendent of the Concord district,
adds, "It would be dangerous, sad and boring to have one view
of morality imposed on our people." At values-education
training sessions, some teachers express fear of foisting
white, middle-class values on highly pluralistic classes, he
adds. For example, some teachers say, because values are
culturally determined, some groups stress competitiveness
over cooperation.
   After a decades-long drive for teachers to be
value-neutral, some say they can't adjust to openly teaching
right and wrong. McGuffey Readers, with their strong moral
messages, have long been shunned for value-neutral texts and
teacher-training courses. Texts describe the Pilgrims not as
seekers of religious freedom but as "people who take long
trips."
   Other hard-pressed instructors resist moral education as
an added burden. In Chicago, teachers complain that it takes
time away from English and math classes, on which they are
evaluated. Teacher skepticism increases when mandates arrive
without funds attached: In a study of a Chicago public school
program, Northwestern University found that some schools
didn't have money to photocopy materials needed for
character-building classes.
   "Every year, something new comes down the pike. Teachers
don't listen anymore," says Ms. Carlson, the New Hampshire
teacher, who despite her support for moral education expects
it to fizzle in the face of teacher opposition. "They have
seen too many saviors."
   Teachers also fear sparking lawsuits or parental wrath.
Some Portland, Maine, parents have already protested when the
teaching of tolerance raised the issue of homophobia. Howard
County, Md., plans to promote "respect for life" as one of 18
approved values, but teachers expect tricky questions about
abortion and the death penalty. Some junior high school
teachers in San Marcos, Calif., fear they will foster family
discord by lifting the moral standards of students above
those of their parents, says Jerry Harrington, a
seventh-grade life-sciences teacher.
   Some teachers respond by ignoring morals programs. The
Chicago Foundation for Education, a private group that funded
that city's program, asked Northwestern to see how much
morality it was buying. The university found that 35% of
sixth-grade teachers weren't implementing any part of the
mandatory program, even though teachers conferred twice
yearly with Northwestern researchers and had to keep logs
detailing their efforts.
   Where the program was at least partially implemented, 70%
of principals detected significant reductions in truancy and
80% saw substantial drops in disciplinary problems, the study
found. But just two of 45 classes monitored completed the
curriculum. Now, to give parents and educators a stake in the
program, the foundation funds it only in schools where
principals seek it and where parents and others try to
provide up to 20% of the cost.
   Despite misgivings about teaching moral values, some
teachers are warming to the task. At Dundalk Elementary
School in Baltimore County, one teacher's husband built CO3,
a robot that champions compassion, courtesy, and cooperation.
Students displaying those values get to take the robot to
lunch. Some districts find that grading teachers for
imparting values stimulates interest.
   But Boston University figures teachers will embrace the
concept only if it's taught to them in college. Last year,
the school opened its Center for the Advancement of Ethics
and Character for teaching students. Maine and New Hampshire
also have begun values-education seminars, where teachers
learn Socratic teaching methods and read the Bible, Plato's
"Republic" and Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From
Birmingham Jail."

   LEXINGTON, Mass. -- Unitrode Corp., plagued with
quality-control problems that prompted the Pentagon to ban
taking shipments of some semiconductor products, said its
president is resigning and its chairman will retire.
   The electronics company said Howard F. Wasserman, 45,
president and chief executive officer, is resigning to
"pursue other interests" and George M. Berman, 64, chairman
and founder, is retiring. Both moves take effect June 5.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Robert L. Gable, 59, an outside director who headed a
special committee overseeing an investigation into the
quality-control problems, will become chairman and chief
executive. Franklin P. Weigold, 51, who is a Unitrode vice
president, will become president and chief operating officer.
   Although Unitrode said the departures of Messrs. Wasserman
and Berman are voluntary, analysts said the quality-control
problems may have led to the change.
   Mr. Wasserman said he was "frustrated by the lack of
results I had been able to bring about in the last three
years. The potential for the company to succeed is still very
high and . . . some other people in the organization may be
able to achieve it."
   Mr. Gable is the former president of Computervision Corp.,
a Bedford, Mass., computer-aided design and manufacturing
systems concern that was acquired by Prime Computer Inc. in
1988.
   "Our immediate task is to restore {Unitrode} to
profitability as soon as possible and to enhance its position
as a dependable supplier of quality products," Mr. Gable
said.
   Partly because of the shipment ban, Unitrode posted a
$20.6 million loss in the fiscal year ended Jan. 30.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Unitrode closed at $4.625, up 25 cents.

   Shearson to Transfer
   Part of Boston Co.
   To New Joint Venture

   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. agreed to
transfer part of its Boston Co. money-management unit to a
new joint venture, a move that will raise more than $10
million for Shearson.
   In a move that was expected, Shearson, a securities-firm
unit of American Express Co., said it would transfer about $6
billion of Boston Co.'s money-management business into a new
joint venture with Nippon Life Insurance Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The joint venture, in which Nippon will hold a 50% stake,
will be called PanAgora Asset Management Inc. and be based in
Boston. A related PanAgora joint venture was established last
year in London.
   Shearson said it will receive compensation from Nippon in
exchange for the asset transfer. The amount of the
compensation wasn't disclosed, but individuals in the
industry said it was probably $10 million to $15 million.
   The part of Boston Co. being transferred to the PanAgora
venture is its Structured Investment Products Group, which
specializes in so-called index funds, asset allocation and
research for institutional investors.
   Shearson has been trying to cut costs and replenish its
capital. The securities firm on Monday said it expects to
report a first-quarter loss of $897 million to $917 million,
a securities-industry record, mainly because of charges it
will take to pay for office closings and other parts of its
big retrenchment plan. Included in the expected first-quarter
loss, Shearson said, is $25 million in reserves for losses
primarily on loans made by Boston Co.
   Nippon has had a 13% interest in Shearson since 1987
through its holding of Shearson preferred stock. That
interest will decline to approximately 8% when American
Express completes a plan in which it will buy the rest of
Shearson's common stock outstanding.

   Foreign Exchange:
   Dollar and Mark Weaken Against Yen;
   Trading Range Is Extremely Narrow

   NEW YORK -- The dollar and mark slid against the yen on
further squaring of long dollar positions against the
Japanese unit ahead of the Group of Seven industrial nations
meeting tomorrow in Paris.
   The dollar finished generally softer against other major
currencies in trading that grew so narrow in the U.S. that
one dealer was even reluctant to describe it as moving within
ranges.

   New York traders had walked into a trap Wednesday, buying
dollars on rumors of financial difficulties at Japanese
securities houses and expectations of another plunge in the
Tokyo stock market, said Dan Brooks, chief dealer at Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd. in New York. When the Japanese didn't follow
through by pushing the dollar up early yesterday, the New
York dealers had to dump their dollars, he said.
   Tokyo traders gave the yen a strong boost even during
their morning activity, despite a decline of 1,088.94 points
in the Nikkei stock index during the morning. The index
finished the day down 193.88 points, at 28,249.06.
   Traders in Tokyo, where most of the U.S. unit's slide
occurred yesterday, also attributed the yen's advance to
growing sentiment that a correction is under way after the
dollar's recent surge to 160 yen.
   The market is watching closely for signs that the trend
has turned, said Christa Bleyleben, vice president at the
Bank of Boston in Boston. Dealers aren't sure what might
emerge from the U.S.-Japanese trade talks in Washington this
week and from the G-7 meeting, she said. "If in doubt, be
careful."
   And after the U.S. unit's surge from the mid-140-yen level
in February to 160 yen this week, she said participants are
taking profits.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6995 marks, unchanged from late Wednesday, and at 157.40
yen, down from 158.95 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was quoted
at $1.6422, up from $1.6401 Wednesday.
   The dollar opened in Tokyo Friday at 156.90 yen, down from
the close in Tokyo Thursday of 157.90 yen.
   Many dealers said it will be difficult for the G-7 to
agree on a means to prop up the yen, particularly because of
doubts about the risks in the two most likely tools to do so.
Recent intervention hasn't succeeded and a Japanese
interest-rate increase could jolt Tokyo stock markets
further.
   Jack Griffin, assistant vice president and corporate
trader at Banque Indosuez in New York, said the currency
market is especially jittery ahead of the G-7 meeting because
of recent events. He cited Germany's unification and
nervousness in Japanese markets.
   Dai-Ichi's Mr. Brooks said he expects the G-7 to agree on
intervention to show unity. He added that if nothing else
changes, the market will view central bank dollar sales as an
opportunity to buy dollars at a lower price.
   And Mr. Griffin said that there is some speculation in the
market about central bank intervention that would involve
mark sales against yen rather than just the more common
dollar sales.
   The mark slid to 92.66 yen in late New York trading from
93.49 yen late Wednesday.
   The dollar finished mixed in Tokyo. The U.S. unit ended at
157.90 yen, down from 158.90 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo, and
it ended at 1.7008 marks yesterday in Tokyo, up from 1.6971
marks the day before.
   The dollar ended European dealing generally steady against
the major currencies, although the U.S. unit skidded
moderately lower against the yen.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery dropped $2.30 to $374.80 an ounce in moderate
trading. Estimated volume was three million ounces.
   In Hong Kong, gold opened Friday at $378.25 an ounce.

   Business Brief -- Durham Corp.:
   Group's $315 Million Offer
   Called `Highly Speculative'

   Durham Corp. turned a cold shoulder to an investor group's
offer to buy the company for $37.50 a share, or an indicated
total of about $315 million.
   Durham, based in Raleigh, N.C., said its lawyers and
financial advisers were reviewing what it called the "highly
speculative" cash-and-debt proposal, made by a group
including Bailey Financial Group Inc., a Rocky Mount, N.C.,
investment concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a statement, George M. Womble, Durham's chairman and
president, called the proposal "both grossly inadequate and
highly unfavorable to Durham's shareholders." Mr. Womble said
those were his preliminary reactions to the bid, which is
subject to financing, and that he planned to discuss the
proposal with the board.
   Bailey Financial said it could remove the contingencies on
its offer -- and possibly even raise the bid -- once Durham
allows it to review financial and actuarial information. "We
are serious about our offer, and we look forward to a
friendly, negotiated transaction being consummated," Bailey
Financial said.
