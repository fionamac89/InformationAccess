   Kohl Backs Earlier Elections to Secure
   Victory as Burden of Unification Grows

   BERLIN -- West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, by backing a
proposal to move all-German elections closer by seven weeks
to Oct. 14, is trying to ensure his own electoral victory
despite the growing economic costs of unification.
   The East German Labor Ministry reported Friday that
unemployment levels nearly doubled since June despite $7
billion in subsidies to troubled companies in July alone.
Economic experts believe three million East Germans could be
unemployed by autumn, or more than a third of the work force.

   Farmer and labor-union protests are growing, hundreds of
companies are going bankrupt, foreign investment remains low
and the overall financial burden of unification -- vastly
underestimated by the two governments -- has become a
political danger to Mr. Kohl that grows with each additional
week before elections.
   East Germany's woes could result in widespread street
protests during the campaign and growing financial pressure
on Mr. Kohl to raise West German taxes. Mr. Kohl has promised
to avoid raising taxes, although he retreated from that vow
in a television interview yesterday. Partially in response to
this bleak economic outlook, East German Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere proposed the stepped-up election plan that
would require his parliament to approve unification shortly
before all-German elections on Oct. 14. Currently, the
elections are set for Dec. 2.
   The plan was agreed to early last week during secret
meetings between Mr. de Maiziere and Mr. Kohl in Austria,
where the chancellor was vacationing. Both leaders have been
working increasingly closely and will be campaigning for a
common Christian Democratic party.
   Mr. de Maiziere argued that a more rapid unification was
needed to give investors and East Germans "political clarity
and thus economic security." However, his opponents believe
he is merely acting quickly before voters feel the entire
burden of unification. "The sooner the vote, the better the
Christian Democrats' chances of victory," says Baerbel
Bohley, a member of the New Forum, the major force behind
demonstrations against East Germany's communist regime last
year. "They want a vote before individuals feel the social
effects of economic and monetary union on their own skin."
   Social Democratic candidate Oscar Lafontaine, whose
electoral chances sank further with the prospect of early
elections, charged Mr. Kohl with "transparent manipulation."
His party will fight the plan when parliament returns early
from vacation this week to discuss an election treaty with
East Germany. The Social Democrats won't question East
Germany's right to unify with West Germany in October.
   Even the Soviet Union, which recently cleared obstacles to
unification, reacted with unhappiness to the de Maiziere-Kohl
proposal. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskykh said
his government expected unification to come in an orderly
fashion only after completion of the "two-plus-four talks"
between the two Germanys and the four World War II victors
and after the 35-nation Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe gives unification its blessing. Mr.
Kohl said Friday he hopes to bring two-plus-four talks to a
close in Moscow in September.
   The two sides have also agreed that Berlin would become
the "capital city," but the "seat of government" could only
be decided by the parliament elected during all-German
balloting.
   Mr. Kohl's government has exacerbated the governmental
crisis in East Berlin that gave rise to the call for earlier
elections by rejecting increased financial requests from the
East German government, funds Bonn will sooner or later have
to invest in the country anyway. West Germany already plans
to spend $16 billion to cover the East German budget deficit
this year, but East Berlin's government last week said it
would need a further $7 billion.
   Bonn government officials have argued against giving more
money to East Germany until their institutions have more
influence on how funds are used. They also say the low level
of foreign investment in East Germany is partially the result
of continued legal and other uncertainties that unification
will do much to erase.

   Mideast Tensions Will Affect Producer
   And Consumer Prices, Analysts Say

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Statistical casualties of the oil war:
producer prices will suffer first, but consumer prices will
suffer longer.
   The July producer price index narrowly escaped impact from
the roiling of energy prices that occurred when Iraq seized
Kuwait as August began. Economists note the July PPI report,
due out Friday, is expected to gain only 0.2% in what's
expected to be the last mild inflation reading for some time.
The July consumer price index, due out next week, is also
likely to be relatively tame.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But starting in August, the PPI could jump as much as one
percentage point and the CPI could log a gain of 0.5% to
0.8%, said Michael Englund, economist with MMS International,
a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.
   "It's unclear what to expect because oil prices are
changing by the hour," Mr. Englund said on Friday. But he and
others noted that one thing seems certain: the heavier
weighting of energy in the PPI forces that index to respond
faster and stronger to change while the CPI takes a while
longer to reflect price moves. But once ingrained at the
consumer level, energy price increases tend to linger,
largely because they become embedded in labor contracts and
long-term pricing strategies. Energy accounts for about 9.2%
of the PPI and 7.6% of the CPI, according to the government.
   The CPI is an especially pervasive indicator. Among other
things, it indicates the effectiveness of government economic
policy; affects wages of three million union workers covered
by collective bargaining pacts, and influences the income of
60 million Americans who receive benefits as diverse as
Social Security payments and school lunches.
   Mr. Englund noted that when oil prices jumped around
year's end, "the January PPI showed it hard while we saw
gains filter out several months in the CPI."
   In June, the PPI rose a moderate 0.2% and the CPI rose a
sharper 0.5%. Oil wasn't the only thing heating up inflation
forecasts last week. The July employment report was anemic in
most respects except wages: average hourly earnings rose 0.6%
to $10.09. That sort of higher inflation coupled with an
economy near standstill underscored economists' concerns
about stagflation.
   "That reflects the severity of the cost-push problem"
right at the time the economy is shrinking, said Donald H.
Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, New York.
"That's very reminiscent of stagflation," he added, "even
without the oil crisis."
   Analysts were reluctant to predict just how severely oil
prices could affect the economy down the road because there
is now so much uncertainty in the Middle East. Based on
movements through last Friday, Mr. Straszheim expected oil
prices to add 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point to the PPI and 0.2
percentage point to the CPI in August and September. Such
increases brought his overall PPI forecast to a gain of 0.7%
in August and a gain of one percentage point in September.
Mr. Straszheim's overall CPI forecast increased to a gain of
0.6% in August and 0.8% in September.
   "Your headlights aren't very much good after that, since
you don't know what's going to happen" in the Mideast, he
said.
   Economists added that the weak July employment data
virtually assured lower readings on July industrial output
and capacity utilization.
   Other economic indicators could also feel the brunt of
higher energy prices hitting just as the economy flattens.
Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc.,
Chicago, noted that higher oil prices could pinch consumer
spending. He added that consumers could be forced to pay
substantially more for petroleum products just as the
important services sector of the economy begins to cool.
Normally, a slowdown in the service sector -- which accounts
for about half of the CPI -- could set the stage for cooler
prices in that sector. "But energy could offset that," Mr.
Kahan said.
   For the moment, Mr. Kahan isn't making radical changes to
his full-year inflation forecast. "The problem is more than
the price increases we've seen to date. The problem is
uncertainty on how high prices can go," Mr. Kahan said
Friday. "We have to see if Mr. Hussein gets away with it."
   The week's only other major indicator is June consumer
credit due out tomorrow. The consensus view calls for an
increase of $2.5 billion, down from May's $3.9 billion.

   Business Brief -- Huntway Partners L.P.:
   Second-Quarter Distribution
   Cut 71% to 10 Cents a Unit

   Huntway Partners L.P., Valencia, Calif., slashed by 71%
its second-quarter distribution to its preference unitholders
to 10 cents a unit, from 34.5 cents a unit.
   Huntway, an owner and operator of three refineries that
produce liquid asphalt for road construction and repair, said
the distribution will be paid Aug. 29 to unitholders of
record Aug. 14.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The partnership said it expects the reduced distribution
to be paid in future quarters until cash flow improves,
reflecting an expected deterioration in operating margins
because of lower liquid asphalt prices and "rapidly rising
crude oil costs."
   Funds available for unitholder distributions also will be
depressed by "significant bank principal payments and capital
expenditures" in coming quarters, Huntway said. "Management
believes that the reduction of Huntway's outstanding
indebtedness and the upgrading of its facilities are the
appropriate actions" for the partnership's long-term health.
   Huntway also reported second-quarter net income of $3.4
million, or 29 cents a unit, compared with a restated net
loss in the year-earlier quarter of $475,000, or four cents a
unit. Revenue in the latest quarter rose 24% to $29.9 million
from $24.1 million.
   However, operating results fell short of forecasted levels
due to lower-than-expected sales volume in Southern
California, Huntway said. The partnership said that it "does
not anticipate that the operating performance of the second
quarter is sustainable" for the rest of the year.
   Huntway said it anticipates increased demand for liquid
asphalt late this year, reflecting the implementation last
week of a five-cent-a-gallon increase in the California gas
tax. The increased revenue is earmarked for state
transportation spending, including construction and
maintenance of roads and highways.

   So far this year, 26 companies in the Small Business
Administration's Small Business Investment Company (SBICs)
have gone into liquidation, double the program's annual
average. "I think we may have a tripling or quadrupling of
liquidations. . . . That's even more reason to get on top of
this now," Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.), chairman of the
Senate Small Business Committee, said at a hearing.

   "I really think the economy is going into the toilet, and
small business will be affected first," he said. SBICs are
SBA-sponsored venture-capital concerns. Despite giving
successful companies like Cray Research Inc. and Nike Inc.
their starts, almost a third of all SBICs ever licensed have
gone into liquidation. As previously reported, the 170
investment firms now in liquidation owe the government more
than $500 million. The SBA is recovering only 40% to 50% of
that debt, compared with 64% in past years.
   Sen. Bumpers, however, praised SBA Administrator Susan
Engeleiter for taking forceful action to control the mounting
losses from the SBIC program. Ms. Engeleiter said the program
wouldn't look so troubled if losses over the years had been
written off appropriately. She outlined a detailed salvage
program that includes installing new top managers in the
investment division and tightening auditing and
asset-valuation procedures for SBICs. In June, she also
declared a 90-day moratorium on licensing new investment
firms.
   Until recently, the SBA had only five staffers handling
SBIC liquidations for a caseload requiring 50 people by
private industry standards. Seven more positions recently
were approved.

   TREE PLANTING through the SBA gets a boost in Congress.
   The House Small Business Committee approved an amendment
to permit the SBA to spend $180 million over the next four
years to plant trees on public land. Under the measure, the
SBA would grant funds to state and local governments, which
would contract with small firms for the work. Companies that
agree to pick up 25% of the cost would be the preferred
contractors, but the contribution could be met in-kind by
performing care and maintenance of the trees, for example.
   Committee member Rep. Andy Ireland (R., Fla.), led an
effort to ax the tree provision, arguing the program doesn't
belong at the SBA. "At a time when we can't find extra money
for international trade or minority-business programs, he
feels we shouldn't have the agency spending a lot of money to
plant trees," says an aide.
   The amendment's sponsor, Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa), won
adoption of the SBA-run tree effort in 1983 as part of
emergency jobs legislation and has fought to revive the
program each year since. The Senate Small Business Committee
doesn't have a similar proposal so far.
   Rep. Smith defends his plan to have the SBA branch out:
"It's the best way the government can carry out the
president's request" to plant more trees.

   SOUR GRAPES: The wine industry, in which small family
businesses predominate, is up in arms about another tax
proposal. As part of a proposed excise tax on alcoholic
beverages under consideration in White House-congressional
budget talks, federal taxes on a bottle of wine would
increase from three cents to 76 cents, according to the
Washington-based National Wine Coalition. No one is claiming
credit for the idea, which coalition executive director John
Volpe believes to be a Bush administration proposal.
Meanwhile, the federal government still is considering
raising the occupational tax on wineries to $19,000 from
$500. The two tax proposals combined, Mr. Volpe says, would
be devastating for the nation's 1,300 wineries.
   ---
   TRAINING EMPLOYEES of small companies is the aim of a bill
just introduced by Rep. Joseph McDade (R., Pa.), the ranking
Republican on the House Small Business Committee. The measure
would offer a small business a tax credit of up to 30% of its
investment (over a base amount) in formal training programs.
The base amount is determined as a percentage of the average
payroll over three years. Workers employed by small firms are
only one-third as likely as other employees to receive formal
training, according to the SBA. Labor Department studies have
found that the informal training often provided by small
businesses is ineffective, Mr. McDade says.

   MINORITY FIRMS seek to overcome a Supreme Court ruling on
set-asides.
   Advocates are asking Congress for legislation to get
around a 1989 decision in which the high court said state and
local governments must have specific evidence of
discrimination to justify business set-aside programs for
minorities and women. The ruling has resulted in court
challenges to such programs and the cancellation of many
others, advocates of the programs told a Senate subcommittee.
   The court said local governments can do studies to prove a
history of bias, but such efforts are expensive. A recent
study for the city of Atlanta documented "every form of
marketplace discrimination," said consultant and economist
Andrew Brimmer. These included discrimination in bonding,
financing and denial of a chance to bid on contracts, he
said.
   Former Maryland Rep. Parren Mitchell, who for years headed
the House Small Business Committee, called for legislation
authorizing states and localities to enact strong contracting
programs to aid women and minorities. There is a "sharp, hard
color line" affecting all facets of enterprise, he told the
subcommittee hearings. Ray Marshall, former labor secretary
in the Carter administration, suggested that cities and
states establish a pre-contract rating system. It would give
extra credit to contractors that work with minority and
female-owned firms.
   Blacks, who made up 12.3% of the population and 10.2% of
employment last year, took in only a third of 1% of business
receipts, Mr. Marshall said.

   Allegheny International Directors Agree
   To Surrender Company to Rival Japonica

   PITTSBURGH -- Directors at Allegheny International Inc.,
succumbing to pressure from banks, creditors and
shareholders, agreed to a plan that will turn the company
over to archrival Japonica Partners.
   But directors did manage to get in one last dig: rewarding
themselves with a half-year's severance pay.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The reorganization plan, a modified version of a
company-sponsored plan, was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court Friday and effectively ends a contentious 2 1/2-year
process. The plan calls for a completely new board and
management. Japonica is expected to take control Aug. 15,
when the company will be renamed Sunbeam/Oster Corp.
   Directors initially balked at amending their own plan to
allow Japonica to buy newly issued stock from banks,
creditors and shareholders, thus boosting its stake to an
estimated 90% from 50%, and to install new management.
   However, the board relented on Friday after disgruntled
creditors wrote letters saying that failure to support the
Japonica modifications, which had a consensus backing them,
would be considered a breach of fiduciary duty and subject to
lawsuits.
   The modified agreement calls for Japonica to pay banks
$6.60 a share, creditors $7 a share and warrant holders $1.53
per warrant. A key revision, which helped gain creditors'
support, gives creditors 45 days to decide whether they want
to take cash or retain their shares.
   "Usually security holders don't get a choice," said Wilbur
Ross of Rothschild Inc., who advised unsecured creditors.
"Here they can make up their own mind as to whether they want
to remain as investors with Japonica."
   Japonica will combine $270 million in the company's
existing cash and $97 million in equity commitments from its
primary investors, Steinhardt Partners Inc. and Mutual Shares
Fund, to pay banks and creditors of Allegheny's Sunbeam unit.
By Aug. 15, Japonica must also provide commitments for about
$95 million to buy remaining stock and warrants, and a $110
million credit facility for working capital.
   The additional financing doesn't seem to be an obstacle,
said Robert Sable, an attorney representing unsecured
creditors. "Barring any unforeseen catastrophe, I'm confident
this thing will finally be over and we can go on living
normal lives," said Mr. Sable, who has seen a series of
earlier buy-out and reorganization plans fizzle.
   As part of the agreement, board members will receive a
half year's severance pay. Although executives often receive
severance pay, such payments to directors are considered
highly unusual by those working on the bankruptcy case. The
board severance pay and the one-year severance pay to
chairman Oliver S. Travers total $650,000.
   The agreement also gives James D. Milligan, whom Allegheny
had tapped to run the reorganized company, a $1.5 million
severance agreement as long as he doesn't compete with
Allegheny for two years.
   Paul B. Kazarian, one of the Japonica partners, would be
named chairman, succeeding Mr. Travers. Mr. Kazarian said
presidents of operating units would remain and that employees
would be offered equity in the company.
   "This is as close to a win-win-win situation as you can
get," Mr. Kazarian said. "Creditors get top dollar, the
company gets its own plan confirmed with slight
modifications, and the company and stakeholders get a balance
sheet with close to $300 million of new equity."
   Mr. Travers said he was optimistic the company would
emerge from bankruptcy under this agreement and "that the
company would work closely with Japonica."
   Allegheny International is a manufacturer of small
electrical appliances. Japonica Partners is an investor group
based in New York.
   Separately, Allegheny reported that losses in the third
quarter ended July 1 widened to $32.1 million from $15.3
million. Sales rose slightly to $237.3 million from $234.9
million.

   Quarterly Review of Profits:
   Second Quarter, 1990
   ---
   Companies' Net Income Fell 11%,
   And More of the Same Is Expected

   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup

   The continued weakness of the economy was reflected in
another poor profits showing in the second quarter. On a
year-to-year basis, it was the fourth consecutive decline,
and analysts see little hope for improvement in the current
quarter.
   In the second quarter, net income of 639 major
corporations fell 11% from a year earlier, a Wall Street
Journal survey finds. This compared with an 18% drop in this
year's first quarter. After-tax earnings on continuing
operations dropped 7% in the second quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lynn Reaser, vice president and senior economist of First
Interstate Bank of Los Angeles, thinks the only chance for
improved profits is a stronger move toward easier money by
the Federal Reserve. "If that happens we might even get a
modest year-to-year gain in after-tax profits by the fourth
quarter. At the moment, however, earnings are still being
squeezed by rising wage-and-benefit costs."
   Analysts at Goldman Sachs, a brokerage firm, see
indications that companies are already bolstering profit
margins, mainly by holding down labor costs through slower
hiring.
   In an advance report late last month, the Commerce
Department estimated that the inflation-adjusted gross
national product rose at an annual rate of only 1.2% in the
second quarter. That's below the level most economists had
been predicting for GNP, which is the total value of the
nation's output of goods and services. At last report the 52
economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, had been looking for
a 1.8% growth rate in the second quarter.
   "Below-average economic growth will hold profits
essentially flat over much of the 1990-92 period," say
economists at the Lexington, Mass., consulting firm of
DRI/McGraw-Hill. "Although no recession is expected soon,
neither is a boom."
   Most analysts, however, expect economic growth to begin to
show some improvement late this year and in 1991. The Blue
Chip group at last report was expecting GNP to rise 2.2% next
year, not exactly a roaring upturn but enough to be of some
help to profits.
   Among major groups, earnings fell for autos, banks,
thrifts and steel in the second quarter, while oil companies
and the computer industry posted mixed performances.
   A weaker U.S. economy, strong Japanese rivals and troubles
overseas combined to batter profits for the Big Three U.S.
auto makers. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all blamed
weak demand and discounts that averaged about $1,000 a
vehicle for slumping U.S. auto profits. Despite massive
cost-cutting, the Big Three can't simultaneously maintain
earnings growth and charge prices that a soft market will
bear. Meanwhile, Ford and GM had big losses in Brazil, where
economic upheaval is hobbling many manufacturers' operations.
   Detroit won't get much relief during the rest of the year.
The Big Three are bargaining with the United Auto Workers
union to replace national contracts that expire Sept. 14. If
talks break down, a strike could cut output and hurt
suppliers, too. Meanwhile, Ford and Chrysler have signaled
plans to widen profit margins by boosting prices. But
analysts say big increases may not stick in a recession-wary
market flooded with competitively priced Japanese cars.
   Chrysler faces a special problem. Output of its profitable
minivans will slump this summer as the plants that build the
vehicles close for major retooling.
   Bank earnings were weak because of continued high levels
of problem loans, especially for commercial real estate.
Manufacturers Hanover took a $100 million onetime charge for
the elimination of about 1,400 jobs. At several banks,
including J.P. Morgan, strong trading results helped offset
otherwise flat corporate finance activities. A few banks,
including Norwest and Banc One, managed to post healthy gains
in earnings.
   Analysts expect banks' nonperforming loans to continue to
rise in the third quarter, keeping up the pressure on
earnings. However, the rate of increase in problem loans is
expected to slow somewhat.
   Thrifts were pounded by real estate problems, which
increasingly reflected weakness in California. That's
troubling to many big thrifts, because California has been
the last major real estate market to withstand the localized
real estate slumps plaguing the Southwest, Northeast and
other regions.
   CalFed said its loss in large part reflected deterioration
in California markets. HomeFed, after special credit reviews,
added $234 million to its reserve for loan losses in the
second quarter.
   Other thrifts avoided the trouble. Great Western boosted
its return on assets to 0.82% from 0.58% a year earlier.
Golden West, bouyed by some of the lowest costs in the
business, saw its return on assets jump to 0.95% from 0.86%.
   Steelmakers, faced with higher costs and lower prices and
shipments, saw profits plunge from last year's robust levels.
   Nucor, one of the few steelmakers with improved earnings,
had higher shipments on all key products and wasn't squeezed
by new union contracts signed by most major steelmakers last
year. Along with those higher labor costs, Bethlehem Steel
was hampered by scheduled maintenance programs at its prize
Sparrows Point plant, which significantly reduced capacity
and forced it to buy steel from other producers to meet
customer orders. Armco, the only major steelmaker to report a
loss, took about $101 million in unusual charges, including
$56 million relating to a litigation settlement, while Inland
Steel Industries was penalized by start-up costs from a
high-tech steel finishing mill.
   Still, steelmakers -- which had expected a soft 1990 --
have been buoyed by recent strength in automotive orders and
the partial realization of price increases.
   Oil profits were mixed depending on the strength of
companies' gasoline refining and marketing operations, which
in some cases posted record results. Sharply lower crude
prices reduced exploration and production profits almost
across the board. But those lower prices for oil -- the
feedstock for gasoline -- combined with stable pump prices to
propel big increases in refining earnings. Petrochemical
results declined sharply as a glut continues. Exxon's
year-earlier quarter included an $850 million provision to
clean up the Alaskan oil spill. Mobil had one-time gains and
losses in the 1990 and 1989 quarters; without them earnings
would have declined 18%.
   With the surge in oil prices already this quarter, major
oil companies expect to report much stronger results, mostly
reflecting the run-up since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The computer industry's results in the latest quarter were
again mixed, as competition remained cutthroat. Some
companies also reported slowing demand in parts of Europe,
which would cause big problems, because the European market
has been making up for weakness in U.S. sales for the past
few years.
   IBM did better than expected, but, even there, there were
worrying signs. Mainframe sales slowed, and IBM may face
problems starting in the second half as it tries to manage
the transition to a new generation of the big computers.
Digital Equipment reported its first loss because of a $400
million charge related to a plan to cut 5,000 to 6,000 jobs.
It was also one of those companies seeing weakness in Europe.
NCR and Amdahl had strong quarters, but Unisys and
Hewlett-Packard posted lackluster results, and Tandem had
problems in Europe.
   Cray's results showed their normal sharp fluctuation,
which reflects the timing of supercomputer sales.
   The spotty results are likely to continue for the next
quarter or two, especially if IBM does run into problems on
its mainframes or if the problems in Europe spread to more
computer makers.
   Here are the second-quarter profits for various industry
groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When
individual companies report for three-month periods other
than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are
used. In all the tables, 000s are omitted.

   Earnings for most aluminum producers were hurt by slumps
in the automotive and construction markets. Maxxam's
consolidated earnings include forest products and real
estate, and also reflect above-market prices for aluminum
under long-term contracts and increased production from a
Jamaican refinery.
   Copper company earnings were generally lower because of a
3%-4% decline in the average spot price of copper. Cyprus
Minerals earnings were also affected by a large write-down
for its coal operations. Magma Copper, however, boosted
profit by increasing output.
   Gold prices changed moderately compared with the
year-earlier quarter, but the cost of recovering gold
increased. Newmont Mining slashed costs and increased its
gold output. Net income at Newmont Gold, the company's
primary business unit, rose 35%. Homestake Mining's earnings
increased because of an asset sale.
   Lingering overcapacity continued to hurt forest-product
companies. Newsprint and uncoated white paper producers
managed price increases in the quarter, but markets and
prices for linerboard and containerboard weakened. Pulp
prices also declined from a year earlier.
   Several companies blamed operational difficulties for poor
earnings. Some analysts believe the cost of raw materials has
peaked. But there are growing worries in the Pacific
Northwest over restrictions brought by the designation of the
spotted owl as a threatened species. Moreover, analysts said
timber sales will begin to reflect the drop in housing starts
as the year proceeds.
   Dow Chemical, Quantum, Vista and Carbide were hurt by the
continuing slump in prices for basic plastics and other
commodity chemicals. Dow Chemical's results also reflected
higher manufacturing costs because of prolonged plant
maintenance, a strike in Brazil and power outages. More
diversified companies, such as Du Pont and Monsanto, fared
better, though their sales of agricultural chemicals were
hampered by adverse weather. Du Pont also noted lower demand
in the U.S. for apparel and carpet fibers. Lubrizol benefited
from higher prices for its specialty chemicals. Hercules had
higher interest expenses, and its effective tax rate rose to
49% from 38%. Analysts expect continuing low
commodity-chemical prices this year, given additions in
production capacity.

   In the oil field sector, a pickup of more than 20% in U.S.
drilling activity along with steady overseas activity boosted
re sults. The giant equipment and service companies reaped
the benefits of several years of cost-cutting and industry
consolidation. A number of companies also said they were able
to make price increases that stuck. And drilling companies
narrowed their losses as restructuring is paying off. This
sector could show steady improvement if expected increases in
drilling activity materialize.
   With prices and volume low for the quarter, natural-gas
pipeline companies felt the pinch. Customers in the Northeast
switched to other fuels, while markets in the Midwest
continue to be overrun with competitors. Those and other
factors combined to hammer Panhandle Eastern, which slashed
its dividend 60% and expects more belt-tightening because of
environmental cleanup costs and adverse regulatory rulings.
That company has tabled a number of expansion projects and
could see a further drop in volume when certain rates to the
Northeast go up in December. Meanwhile, Burlington Resource's
pipeline unit saw a 4% increase in operating profit.
   Coal companies posted higher earnings for the quarter
largely from stronger prices and volume. Another reason for
the improvement was that last year's results were hurt by
wildcat strikes staged in support of the United Mine Workers
union against Pittston.

   Slow industrial freight shipments pared rail earnings at
Consolidated Rail, Norfolk Southern and Santa Fe Pacific. But
Burlington Northern benefited from strong coal shipments, and
CSX reported improved results at its rail, barge and
container shipping units. Excluding gains of $62 million from
sale of subsidiaries in the 1989 quarter, CSX's earnings from
continuing operations rose 20%.
   Trucking-company earnings were hurt by overcapacity and
higher fuel and labor costs. Consolidated Freightways said
losses at its Emery air-freight unit more than offset
earnings improvement at its truck units. A 3% rate increase
implemented in June is expected to boost third-quarter
results for carriers that handle less than full-truckload
shipments.
   The slump in second-quarter net at American President, an
ocean, rail and truck transporter, reflected a decline in
international shipment volumes, rate pressures and increased
equipment costs.
   The air-freight industry performed about as expected, with
Airborne Freight continuing its torrid growth and Federal
Express still having problems overseas. Airborne, known as
the industry's lowest-cost producer, is still benefiting from
problems at Consolidated Freightways' Emory unit, and may
also be eating into Federal Express's U.S. business. Federal
Express continues to post international losses of millions of
dollars a month, and is facing lower Asian demand and slower
U.S. volume growth as well. Airborne is expected to continue
its heady growth, while there's no end in sight for Federal's
woes.
   In transportation equipment, the downturn in the market
for big trucks continued to squeeze profits, and there's no
consensus on when a rebound might start. Navistar sees an 18%
decline in industry shipments of heavy trucks and a 4%
decline in medium trucks for its fiscal year, which ends Oct.
31. Cummins Engine says third-quarter production of heavy
trucks is expected to fall 10% from a year earlier; it
expects a loss for the period. But Eaton, which makes truck
transmissions and axles, sees "indications" the heavy truck
market will improve by year end.
   Profit gains continued for heavy machinery, but a steep
decline at giant Caterpillar dragged down overall results.
Brazil's stiff anti-inflation and economic-reform plan was
partly behind the tumbling profit at Caterpillar. Troubles in
Brazil also curbed the profit gain at Clark Equipment. Sales
of Caterpillar's construction equipment slowed in the U.S.
and other industrialized nations. For the full year, the
company expects "substantially lower" profit than in 1989.
While farm-equipment sales for companies such as Deere are
likely to continue robust, there are signs of a slowdown for
other heavy machinery. Clark says "emerging softness in world
markets" could reduce its second-half earnings. Deere is "cau
tious" on the outlook for sales of its construction equipment
in North America.

   Housing starts fell again in the second quarter,
particularly in the northeastern U.S., reflecting weakening
demand and a liquidity crunch affecting small builders
brought on by the S&amp;L debacle. In California, where
homebuilding had remained relatively healthy, concern over
anticipated defense cuts has stalled consumer confidence and
started to weigh heavily on new construction. Standard
Pacific and Kaufman &amp; Broad said the weakening California
market contributed to earnings declines. Analysts predict a
continued drop in homebuilding through year end.
   Retailers are likely to report mixed results for the July
quarter. But some companies posting higher profits are
expected to show smaller increases than in recent quarters.
   Sears Roebuck, which operates on a calendar year, already
reported a 39% decline in net income; but sluggish sales and
higher expenses resulted in a 78% profit plunge at the
company's core U.S. retail business. Analysts expect J.C. Pen
ney to report sharply lower earnings, and Nordstrom and
Dayton Hudson are likely to post slightly lower net. U.S.
Shoe projects a profit decline because of falling sales at
its Lenscrafters stores. Earnings growth is likely to remain
robust at Wal-Mart, Dillard, Limited and Gap. K mart is
expected to show a small increase in profit.
   Hotel and casino companies faced continued overcapacity in
the lodging market, as well as new casino competition. Some
hotel operators, including Marriott, Motel 6 and La Quinta
Motor Inns, reported slight to moderate improvement in
operating results. Hilton Hotels experienced mixed results
from its hotels and a sharp drop in operating revenue at one
of its Las Vegas, Nev., casinos. Golden Nugget's large new
Las Vegas casino-resort produced a major improvement in
earnings, while Aztar's operating improvement was
overshadowed by a provision for a legal judgment against the
company. Circus Circus Enterprises' fiscal quarter ended
April 30 didn't include results from its big new casino in
Las Vegas.
   Some analysts worry that sluggishness in consumer spending
may rub off on travel and tourism in this quarter.
   The restaurant business generally remained soft. Price
discounting at fast-food sites was rampant, intensifying
competition and squeezing profit margins. McDonald's 10%
earnings gain trailed analysts' expectations. The quarter was
brighter for casual sit-down places, such as Shoney's.
   Casual sit-down restaurants have benefited from the
narrowing gap in non-promotional menu prices between
midpriced diners and fast-food outlets. For the third
quarter, with the same trends intact, Montgomery Securities
forecasts a 12% increase in McDonald's per-share earnings and
a 44% gain for Shoney's.
   Entertainment-industry earnings "are becoming weaker,"
said Harold Vogel, a first vice president at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. "The domestic box office is down from a year ago and the
cost of making and releasing films is up." Theme-park
attendance, he said, "has flattened out for the current
quarter." Lisbeth Barron, a vice president of research at
S.G. Warburg Securities, said Time Warner was hurt by
weakness in magazine earnings and flat performance in its
Home Box Office unit. "The record business has slowed
dramatically," she added. Paramount's year-earlier results
include $70.9 million in after-tax income from discontinued
operations.
   Demand for outboard engines continued to decline.
"Sluggish demand for boats continues. It's more of the same
for Outboard Marine and Brunswick," said Mr. Vogel.
   In the media sector, television networks stood out with
moderate to strong results. CBS was boosted largely by its
telecast of the National Basketball Association playoffs and
championship game, and by a drop in programming cost from a
year earlier. At Capital Cities/ABC, lukewarm results were
due to sluggish advertising sales at its television and radio
stations and to losses on the new baseball contract at its
80%-owned cable channel, ESPN.
   Ad demand continued its fall for most newspapers, and that
led to poor results for most newspaper-based media companies.
Gannett, the country's largest newspaper publisher, reported
its first quarterly drop in earnings in more than 22 years.
   Although fuel prices moderated somewhat,
weaker-than-expected domestic traffic and select fare wars
depressed airline earnings. Results at AMR's American
Airlines also were hurt by start-up costs for its new service
to Latin America. Midway Airlines' loss reflected continuing
expenses at its new Philadelphia hub. Delta was aided last
year by a strike at its chief competitor on the East Coast,
Eastern Airlines. UAL would have seen its profit fall if it
hadn't been for a one-time gain of $77.3 million from the
sale of aircraft.
   Analysts are predicting the third quarter will be even
more disappointing for the airlines than the second quarter
was because of slow traffic and fare discounting. "We were
looking to start to see improvement in the third quarter, but

   The food sector's strong showing reflected healthy sales
and lower commodities prices. More abundant soybean and corn
crops helped Archer-Daniels-Midland's results grow
substantially. General Mills benefited from continued good
volume gains of ready-to-eat cereals. Campbell Soup cited
better cost controls in North America and higher profit in
Argentina. Dean Foods, alone in reporting a decline in net
income, actually posted an operating earnings gain, but
year-earlier figures included proceeds from the sale of its
Baskin-Robbins business. Hershey Foods' latest results
include a $35 million gain from sale of a Swedish
confectionery unit. Prudential-Bache Securities food analyst
John McMillin expects many sector companies to report
low-double-digit profit gains for the current quarter.
   Food retailers continued to enjoy healthy to
better-than-expected overall gains, thanks to robust sales,
improved margins, better cost controls and lower interest
rates. Analysts cited the greater control that supermarket
companies are exercising in wholesale buying and continued
expansion of upscale specialty departments.
   Von's reversed the loss it sustained a year earlier after
absorbing the acquisi tion of Safeway's stores in Southern
California.
   From beer to soft drinks to bottling, the big beverage
companies uncorked profit increases. Strong business overseas
more than offset weak sales at home for Coca-Cola. Pepsi's
domestic soft-drink volume growth outpaced Coke's, and
Pepsi's earnings were bolstered by higher sales of snack and
restaurant foods. Coca-Cola Enterprises' net included several
extraordinary items, notably a $55.6 million pretax gain from
the sale of a business. Anheuser-Busch and Adolph Coors
reported higher beer shipments, reflecting strong sales of
new brands.
   Personal care companies reported solid earnings.
International sales remained strong, while continued low
materials costs and slight price increases boosted profits.
Neutrogena, a specialty soap and shampoo maker, was the clear
exception; earnings plunged because of increased competition,
swollen inventories and problems with new products.
   Profits continued strong for household product concerns,
and profit margins continued to expand, thanks in part to a
long truce in the consumer goods marketing wars. With
international sales healthy, profits got a boost from
favorable currency translations. More of the same is expected
for the current quarter.
   Once again, tobacco makers reported large gains, despite
the industry's troubled image. Strong sales overseas and
smaller-than-expected volume decreases in the U.S. are
expected to continue.

   Industry "fragmentation" is the watchword in
semiconductors, with Intel enjoying big profit from its
microprocessor monopoly while companies selling more standard
chips, such as Advanced Micro and National, see profit
margins eroded by price competition. Analysts expect Intel to
maintain a fat profit in the current quarter while a seasonal
summer slowdown brings continued sluggishness for other chip
makers and for equipment makers such as Applied Materials,
which still feel lingering effects of last year's chip slump.
Companies expect the profit picture to remain fragmented
until next year, when chip demand is expected to pick up
across the board. National had a $174 million special gain in
the 1989 quarter.
   Software makers continued to benefit from strong sales of
desktop computers and the growing appetite for more
sophisticated business software. Lotus Development posted the
biggest profit gain on the strength of broad acceptance of
its newest spreadsheet products. Microsoft's net income was
boosted by rapid growth in Europe and the initial reaction to
its new version of its Windows product. Novell and Oracle
Systems were aided by the continued shift to networked
computing, which puts a premium on the data base and
networking software sold by them.
   At American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, a costly credit-card
launch and sluggish equipment sales shaved long-distance
gains and cut profit. Motorola's profit increase was powered
mainly by higher semiconductor and cellular equipment sales.
Communications Satellite inched up after software problems in
its Video Entertainment unit offset gains in its
International and Systems businesses.
   Most aerospace companies' results reflected general
weakness in Pentagon contracting. The big loser was General
Dynamics, which took a stunning $500 million in write-offs to
reflect overruns on the Navy's A-12 attack plane program and
the Army's Sincgars radio project. McDonnell Douglas,
co-developer of the A-12, used a different accounting method
and sidestepped any charges. A year earlier, it posted $93
million in write-offs on its C-17 military cargo and KC-10
tanker programs. Northrop's year-before results included a
$150 million loss provision on a classified research
contract.
   The outlook is mixed, with commercial aircraft makers and
defense-electronics companies expected to outperform the
field. Peter Aseritis of First Boston says the picture will
become clearer only after the pending military budget is
complete.
   Many medical-equipment makers continued to benefit from
dominant positions in specialized and stable markets. In the
biotechnology field, Amgen remained one of the few concerns
that could cultivate a profit, as many companies remained in
the start-up phase.
   St. Jude Medical said the latest period's results
reflected continued penetration of its primary heart-valve
market. Stryker has achieved its growth rate by bringing out
such well-received products as hip implants and surgical
tools.
   In general, "there is a greater certainty of earnings
growth with health care relative to other industries," said
Leonard Yaffe, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. "Given
the demographics and pricing flexibility, companies can grow
at more predictable rates."

   Many insurers saw their property/casualty results shrink.
Pricing continues soft as companies vie for commercial
business. Higher earnings in the group health insurance area
boosted results for several of the multiline insurers. For
life insurance companies, better interest-rate spreads,
expense reduction and a continued decline in policy
cancellations helped improve profitability.
   Kemper took $161.1 million in special charges. Cigna said
the poor conditions in the property/casualty market will
constrain its results this year and in 1991. It expects to
take a charge of no more than $65 million as it accelerates
the consolidation of some offices. Aetna benefited from gains
in its group health insurance and its pension and investment
businesses.
   Securities firms' profits rebounded a bit from a depressed
first quarter, with Merrill Lynch and Salomon reporting a
modest revival in investment-banking revenue. But
year-to-year profit comparisons were poor because 1989's
second quarter was particularly strong. Despite the rebound
at Merrill and Salomon, investment-banking and underwriting
revenue at most firms stand at six-year lows. Many securities
firms continued to increase the customer assets they manage,
which rake in steady fees.
   But even near-record levels in the stock market couldn't
revive sluggish trading, a revival that analysts say is
necessary to jump-start the flagging earnings at many big
firms. This quarter won't be much better for many brokers,
particularly compared with 1989's strong third quarter,
analysts say.

   United Telecom's local phone business remained strong, but
profit was hurt by big losses at long-distance unit US
Sprint. At other carriers, regulatory changes and sluggish
regional economies hampered earnings. Profit at Southern New
England Telecommunications slumped on slow growth in its
Connecticut base and a 5% cut in rates. Contel was bruised by
a first-quarter acquisition of some McCaw Cellular
Communications properties. But Centel gained from traffic
growth as well as reduced interest expense.

surplus of $500 million for July, its first surplus in seven
months.
   The Finance Ministry attributed the turnaround to a
surplus in the visible-trade balance in July. The ministry
estimated the merchandise trade surplus at more than $400
million on a free-on-board basis; the invisible-trade balance
also showed a surplus, estimated at $80 million.

   BOSTON -- In Massachusetts, where everybody talks about
the weather, restaurant owners want to do something about it
-- the talk that is.
   They want Boston TV weather forecasters to stop predicting
on Monday and Tuesday bad weather for the weekend ahead.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I understand their side. There is a demand for it," says
Thomas Larson, owner of the Pillar House Restaurant in Newton
and chairman of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association
Weather Task Force. "But if the {long-range} forecast doesn't
look so good, hey, keep it a secret because it's so harmful
to business."
   To that end, the association has solicited complaints and
forwarded packets of its members' letters to the weathermen.
   Mr. Larson says the problem is that long-range forecasts
aren't very accurate. He doesn't object to three-day
forecasts, which he concedes are usually right.
   Restaurateurs are bitter about predictions that keep
tourists away from Cape Cod or the Berkshires. "Before
Memorial Day weekend, weathermen forecast terrible weather on
the Cape," recalls Cindy Eid, public-affairs coordinator for
the Massachusetts Restaurant Association. "They told people
if they wanted a peek of sun to head north. But it turned out
to be one of the best weekends of the summer."
   Frank Cardullo, owner of the Wursthaus Restaurant, says
his Hyannis branch suffered $75,000 in lost revenue last
summer on good weekends after rain had been predicted.
   Other restaurant owners say winter-storm warnings are even
worse.
   M.S.M. Management Co., Danvers, says that two years ago
inaccurate predictions of a big storm for Feb. 24 cost its
restaurants $100,000 in lost revenue. That same weekend, the
Harvard Club of Boston says, "the irresponsibility of the
weather forecasters" led to the cancellation of a dinner
party for 250.
   Some weathermen are sympathetic. Dick Albert, of WCVB-TV
in Boston, says the letters have sensitized him to the
problem, but he adds that he has avoided five-day forecasts
for many years.
   But most stations say it's more important to give the
public what it wants. "Whenever we don't have time to do it,
the public complains," says Barry Burbank, of WBZ-TV. He says
he makes it clear that the long-range view is less reliable
than the short-range picture: "We don't call it a forecast.
We call it an outlook," he says.

   Canadian Operating Profits Fall 29%;
   High Rates, Strong Canada Dollar Cited

   TORONTO -- High interest rates and a strong Canadian
dollar continued to push Canadian corporate profits down in
the second quarter. With economic growth slowing, economists
are debating whether the country has entered a mild
recession.
   In a Wall Street Journal survey of 190 early-reporting
companies, second-quarter operating profits were 2.36 billion
Canadian dollars (US$2.05 billion), down 29% from a year
earlier but up 21% from the first quarter. Six-month
operating earnings were down 34% to C$4.31 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's not exactly a vintage year this year," said Douglas
Peters, chief economist for Toronto-Dominion Bank. "There has
been little positive in all sectors."
   Forestry and manufacturing companies suffered the brunt of
the downward trend, with operating earnings among surveyed
companies down 76% and 39%, respectively, from the previous
year. The mining sector showed signs of recovery after a poor
first quarter, boosted by higher prices for precious metals,
while energy concerns continued to struggle with volatile
world crude oil prices. In all, companies with lower earnings
relative to the 1989 second quarter outnumbered companies
with gains nearly 2 to 1.
   Analysts expect profit declines to continue through the
end of the year. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Burns Fry
Ltd., said she expects corporate earnings to show an 18.5%
decline in the third quarter from a year earlier and an 8.5%
drop in the fourth quarter, resulting in a decline for all of
1990 of about 16%.
   Statistics Canada, the government statistical agency, said
last week that gross domestic product declined 0.2% in May
from April, after recording no change in April. That has most
economists estimating that GDP fell about 0.25%, or 1% on an
annual basis, in the second quarter from the first quarter.
That would represent the first quarterly decline in GDP since
the 1982 fourth quarter.
   Some forecasters see slight growth in the third quarter,
but others say the GDP will fall again, giving Canada its
first technical recession in almost eight years. There is
general agreement that growth will return in the fourth
quarter because Canadian consumers will buy big-ticket items
before a new 7% tax on goods and services takes effect Jan.
1.
   The Bank of Canada's tight monetary policy has widened the
gap between Canadian and U.S. interest rates, and propped up
the Canadian dollar. Three-month Canadian treasury bills are
yielding about 550 basis points more than their U.S.
counterparts, and the Canadian dollar has hit 10-year highs,
reaching 86.90 U.S. cents Friday.
   Analysts say the tight policy has eroded corporate
earnings by quashing exports and stifling consumer spending.
The higher Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar makes
Canadian goods more expensive for U.S. buyers.
   Mr. Peters said the policy has also dealt a major blow to
Canada's competitiveness in the North American market, where
tariffs are being removed under the Canada-U.S. free-trade
agreement that came into effect at the start of 1989.
   "It's very hard to run a marathon with a bullet in each
foot," Mr. Peters said of the effect of the dollar and
interest rates on Canada's early free-trade performance.
   The Bank of Canada is expected to allow rates to ease
slightly through the rest of 1990, with three-month rates
falling below 12.5% from the current 13.17%. The Canadian
dollar should also decline relative to its U.S. counterpart,
but is expected to be at about 85 U.S. cents at year end.
   The Canadian government expects that its new 7% tax will
result in a one-time boost to inflation of 1.25 percentage
points. Analysts say that effect will keep upward pressure on
interest rates through the first half of 1991.
   The forest-products industry was hardest hit in the second
quarter, as profits from 20 companies fell to C$95.9 million
from C$397.8 million a year earlier. Six-month earnings fell
77% to C$184.5 million. Analysts said high interest rates
have slowed construction of new houses on both sides of the
border. As well, the high Canadian dollar has lowered revenue
from exports to the U.S.
   Earnings for Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. dropped
to C$6.6 million in the quarter from C$72.9 million a year
earlier. Noranda Forest Inc. had a loss of C$4 million
compared with earnings of C$68.3 million a year earlier. Both
companies also blamed a depressed pulp market for their
earnings woes.
   Manufacturing profits, hit by the slowdown in consumer
spending, dropped 39% among the 43 companies surveyed, with
second-quarter earnings of C$536.8 million compared with
C$875.8 million in 1989. But excluding Alcan Aluminium Ltd.,
Dofasco Inc. and Ford Motor Co. of Canada, the sector was
down a more modest 13%. Six-month earnings for manufacturers
were down 40% to C$972.2 million.
   Alcan's profit fell 66% to US$84 million, because of lower
prices for its products. Ford Canada, a victim of the auto
industry slowdown, saw its second-quarter earnings fall 54%
to C$54.4 million. Dofasco blamed the high Canadian dollar
for a drop in steel prices and shipments, sending its
earnings down 68% to C$27.7 million.
   Volatile prices have put the mining and petroleum sectors
on an earnings roller coasters in the past four quarters, but
there are signs of recovery. In the mining sector, profits
for 23 companies fell 25% to C$401.3 million in the quarter
and were down 46% to C$652.3 million in the six months. But
the quarterly total was up 60% from the 1990 first quarter.
   Earnings for precious-metal companies were up 2% in the
quarter on the strength of higher world gold prices. The
base-metals companies saw earnings fall 28% in the quarter,
but rise 86% from the first quarter.
   Inco Ltd., a major nickel producer, earned US$203.9
million in the quarter, up 4% from a year earlier. However,
operating results actually fell substantially, because the
latest quarter included a US$112 million after-tax gain from
the sale of part of its interest in P.T. International Nickel
Indonesia.
   The oil and gas sector is expected to be stronger for the
remainder of the year, following recent developments among
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait, as well as an OPEC
agreement in July to set a crude-oil target price of US$21 a
barrel, have raised the prospect of higher oil prices. The
industry has contended with crude prices ranging from about
US$15-US$24 a barrel since the start of the year.
   Profits for 18 energy concerns slipped 42% in the second
quarter, to C$196.6 million, while six-month earnings were
off 20% to C$570.4 million. Imperial Oil Ltd., 70%-owned by
Exxon Corp., saw its earnings rise 65% to C$238 million in
the quarter, but the 1990 results include an afte-rtax gain
of about C$195 million from the sale of its stake in
Interhome Energy Inc.

   A Turncoat for Love and Money

   It started when he told the British of Washington's plan
for a campaign on the Hudson. Then he turned over details of
the American troop strengths and the movements of the French
fleet. Finally Benedict Arnold offered to betray West Point.
   In "Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor" (William Morrow,
667 pages, $27.95), the first new biography of Arnold in more
than three decades, Willard Sterne Randall portrays Arnold as
a man at ease neither as a rebel nor as an aristocrat. He
lunged from supervising whippings to courting the chic women
of New Haven's most established families. Later he would feel
an outsider both among the American troops he commanded (and
betrayed) and the British troops he sought to lead.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Benedict Arnold was a trader long before he was a traitor,
though in the end one would lead to the other. An artful
smuggler who openly identified himself as a partisan of the
American resistance to Britain, he lined up with the
Connecticut radicals who fought new British taxes and joined
the elite shock troops and undercover operatives of the Sons
of Liberty.
   But the principal tension in the portrait Mr. Randall
sketches came from the tugs between Mammon and Mars. Though
he became one of Connecticut's richest men -- his fortune
included ships, wharves, horses, carriages and servants --
his movement in New Haven society was curtailed by rumors of
venereal disease and stories about duels over a prostitute.
He sought respectability in the rebellion, leading volunteers
only days after Lexington and Concord and winning their
loyalty by feeding them in taverns along the way.
   For all his bluster and bungled relationships, he was a
remarkable military strategist, time and again coming up with
innovative ideas to frustrate the British or, often, to
outfox them. But the human element often blunted the
brilliance of his ideas, and it wasn't for nothing that an
Abnaki chieftain called him Dark Eagle. With 200 pounds of
gunpowder, 200 pounds of lead, 20 barrels of pork and 4,000
biscuits he set out to haul artillery east from the forts
around Lake Champlain. But soon the mission turned into a
race with Ethan Allen for glory (and for the prize money for
a captured British warship).
   Arnold undertook the first American offensive of the
Revolution, the first American invasion of a foreign country
and commanded the first American naval force. There was real
valor; Arnold personally led a charge on foot against a
British outpost, capturing both a fort and a man-of-war in a
crisp, smooth operation.
   Soon, however, flashes of temper overshadowed flashes of
brilliance. At one point during the northern campaign, a
tavern keeper barged into an Arnold meeting. As he put it, "I
took the liberty of breaking his head." His behavior
repeatedly brought on challenges to his authority that seemed
to grow in magnitude because of the decentralized, and
oftentimes disorganized, colonial war effort.
   Perhaps Arnold's most famous (though ultimately
frustrating) military operation under the American flag was
his idea for a surprise attack on Quebec. It took his men
through the lake and forest country of Maine, "a pathless
wilderness where only a few men in canoes had ever been
before."
   There were setbacks: The bateaux he ordered were sloppily
made and badly caulked. The light-infantry regiment designed
for long-range amphibious raids grew fatigued by weary
portages. The food supplies turned into soggy barrels of
maggoty mush. The weather grew cold and stormy. The rations
became so meager that one man ate a candle. Some of the force
deserted. Much of the ammunition was ruined.
   The Quebec mission didn't end with his retreat; for the
rest of his life he would fight charges that he had looted
Montreal. Soon Arnold would be passed over for advancement,
shunned by high society, rebuffed on strategic questions,
crippled when his leg was fractured by a musket ball at
Saratoga and, in his own words, "received with the greatest
coolness at headquarters."
   In a brisk narrative that gives a panoramic view of the
military and political scene against which the early days of
the nation were played, Mr. Randall shows how eventually
Arnold's interests turned again from patriotism to profit. As
military governor of Philadelphia, eastern Pennsylvania and
southern New Jersey, he bought goods unavailable to other
merchants, stocked his own basement with food, and began to
consort with British sympathizers, falling in love with Peggy
Shippen, herself a Loyalist. Finally -- besieged by political
battles, infighting, a court-martial and enormous financial
pressure -- he decided to have his revenge. He changed sides
in the greatest struggle of his time.
   He did it for love and for money, and probably for ego,
too; it was more than simply that, as Mr. Randall puts it, "a
young and beautiful woman was capable of helping Benedict
Arnold plot the greatest conspiracy of the American
Revolution." But there was a certain poetic justice to it
all. Shortly after he switched sides, Benedict Arnold
presented his British betters with a bill for his services.

   McDonald's Rolls Out Pizza for Testing,
   But Firm's Pies Apparently Lack Pizazz

   EVANSVILLE, Ind. -- The banner over the counter proclaims
"Pizzaaah]" But nearly everyone in the restaurant is eating
something else. After all, this is McDonald's, where people
usually go for burgers and french fries.
   Evansville is among a half dozen test-market towns where
McDonald's Corp. is selling its version of pizza. But if
visits to several Midwest test sites are indicative,
McDonald's pizza has little pizazz. Orders are only
occasional, and customer reviews are mixed. A competitor says
that McDonald's share of the Evansville pizza market has
shrunk to barely 2% from an initial 7%. To stimulate sales,
McDonald's is heavily discounting some pies, and it has
broken its vow not to sell pizza before 4 p.m.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We continue to get good customer acceptance of the
product," a company spokesman insists. But he won't say when
McDonald's will decide whether to go national with the
current product.
   McDonald's fiddled with salads for seven years before
rolling them out. It is counting heavily on pizza to increase
evening traffic -- its slowest part of the day -- and to
offset what it admits are disappointing U.S. sales.
   But the product's future may not depend on adults' tastes,
as Debbie Reid of nearby Newburgh attests. She recently
ordered $1.99 slices of McDonald's bacon double cheeseburger
pizza for her family for lunch. Her children -- who soon
abandoned their pizza for the carousel and slide in Ronald
McDonald's playland -- wanted to eat at McDonald's. Like
millions of other parents, Mrs. Reid acquiesced. "The kids
like it -- it's tolerable to me," she says.
   Indeed, child power may be as important as the pepperoni
in McDonald's pizza; if kids like it, they will drag their
parents along for yet another meal.
   McDonald's is also testing pizza in Fresno, Calif.,
Hartford, Conn., and Las Vegas, Nev., as well as a few
Chicago suburbs, but Evansville was the first site, and the
arrival of pizza there has touched off a veritable war.
Motorists are bombarded by billboards from Pizza Hut,
Domino's and Noble Roman's as well as McDonald's, whose
latest sign says simply, "Pizza tonight."
   Price-cutting abounds. A McDonald's 12-inch pepperoni pie
is on sale for $4.99, down from $7.35 -- a price Pizza Hut
and Domino's quickly matched. Lunchtime offers a bargain
hunter's bonanza. Godfather's in nearby Henderson, Ky.,
features an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet for $2.99 between 11
a.m. and 2 p.m. A Mazzio's outlet across the road from a
McDonald's in Owensboro, Ky., advertises 99-cent slices.
   At first, McDonald's avoided selling pizza for lunch
because it weakened the company's dinner-building strategy
and required making pies in advance, undermining freshness.
But last month it joined the noon feeding frenzy with
quarter-pie pieces. The company won't comment on its
lunchtime slices, other than to characterize them as "a
limited-time offer in Evansville only."
   Pizza Hut, with 25 outlets in the market, continues to
snipe at the interloping hamburger giant, which has 27 stores
here. Its initial ads belittled McDonald's use of frozen
dough. Commercials now mock the entire product. "When we'd
mention McDonald's pizza in our focus groups, everybody
thought it was a joke," says David Novak, senior vice
president, marketing, for the PepsiCo Inc. unit.
   That may be why McDonald's radio spots here refer to its
fare as "serious pizza." Also, while it can't match pizzerias
selling beer, McDonald's restaurants feature soda pop by the
pitcher at night.
   Pizza Hut's Mr. Novak contends the battle -- though not
the war -- is over. "Our sales are growing in all of our
service segments in Evansville -- delivery, carryout and
dining," he says of the nation's largest pizza chain. Mr.
Novak cites the 2% market-share estimate for McDonald's but
adds, "We think they're going to get into the pizza category.
. . . I wouldn't say it's going to be this product, though."
   The current pizza is McDonald's third public try. Samples
of the product here and in Downers Grove, Ill., west of
Chicago, found it uncharacteristically inconsistent. Toppings
weren't always evenly spread. Sometimes cheese slid off the
crust when slices were pulled from the pie. Often there was
only a blush of tomato sauce. And several patrons complained
about the crust's taste; one likened it to a biscuit.
   To turn pizza into a winner, McDonald's must overcome
several problems. One is the speed issue. The promised
six-minute wait -- an ambitious and sometimes-elusive goal --
may be too long, even in the more leisurely dinner hour.
Drive-through customers may object to the inconvenience of
pulling over to the side to wait for orders.
   Price is another factor. Restaurant industry analysts
blame some of McDonald's sales slippage on high menu prices.
At a minimum of $4.99 a pie, pizza becomes its most expensive
item. Even the $1.99 lunchtime slices cost more than any
sandwich on its Evansville menu boards. McDonald's seems to
be searching for the ideal price; its pies in Downers Grove
were costing about $1 more until last week, when prices fell
below those in Evansville.
   There are also operational bugs. Although it was a slack
time, the Downers Grove crew got one couple's two-pizza order
fouled up. Drive-through pizzas sometimes come without
napkins. An Evansville menu board had different prices for
the same item. Stores in the Evansville-Owensboro market had
"save big dough" coupons for patrons charging pizzas on Visa
or MasterCard, but the discount price was $1 more than the
pizza was selling for at the time. Discount coupons at
Downers Grove had already expired.
   "Pizza to them is like sandwiches to us. They throw a
wrench in the operation," a Pizza Hut supervisor here says.
   Still, McDonald's seems committed to pizza. One Owensboro
restaurant has a separate "Pizza Shoppe" built into it,
including large windows for patrons to watch the cooking
operation.
   Since starting its test, McDonald's has shrunk its pie to
12 inches from 14. One innovation: No polystyrene is used in
its pizza's packaging. Whole pies come in heavy-duty
cardboard boxes, while slices are boxed in slick white paper.
   When customers order pizzas at the counter, they
immediately receive their drinks and other food. Later, red
wire racks are brought to their tables. The racks, which
serve as stands for the pizza, contain jars of grated cheese
and red peppers along with salt, pepper and a candle. The
pizzas arrive on perforated aluminum plates on red plastic
trays.
   Consumer opinion on the product is mixed. "I love it,"
says Linda Mullins at Downers Grove. "Everything's fresh,
nothing's greasy. It's definitely different. Most pizzas,
everything's mooshy."
   But Steven Rothman, a Wheaton, Ill., real estate broker,
likens it to "a supermarket product" that's neither tasty nor
spicy enough. "I don't think the product is going to last,"
he says.
   Only a few pizzas were sold each hour during a recent
Friday night at the Downers Grove site a few miles from
McDonald's corporate headquarters. Unlike restaurants in
Evansville, the store there has no signs outside indicating
it has pizza. "We're not allowed to advertise it," the
manager on duty says. "We don't want the media to know."
Nonetheless, she says, "it's starting to catch on."
   But in Henderson, Ky., Lori Putman, 19 years old, remains
unimpressed. A onetime crew trainer at a McDonald's
restaurant, she recently left for a Godfather's pizza house a
few doors away. When she quit, she says, her boss told her,
"`We're going to put Godfather's out of business.'" I told
him, `I don't think so, honey.'"

   Taking the Heats

   East Rutherford, N.J. -- In a day of frantic and
often-tortured matings between champion athletes and
products, a heaven-made match turned up here Saturday
afternoon. Harmonious, a dark-brown trotting horse of
imposing mien, won the historic Hambletonian stakes at
Meadowlands Race Track with a stomach full of Maalox.
   Osvaldo Formia, Harmonious's Argentine-born trainer, said
the animal was given several, horse-sized doses of the
antacid after he was found colicky and scratched in his
paddock at White Birch Farm in Allentown, N.J., early
Thursday morning. The wounds apparently were incurred when
Harmonious sought succor by rubbing against the enclosure's
fence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We couldn't do much about the scratches, but we could
treat the colic," said Formia, unsolicited. "The Maalox
quieted him right down."
   Thus fortified, Harmonious frisked to victory over nine
other three-year-olds in the second division of the
best-of-three-heat race, then repeated the performance an
hour later in what would be the finale. His second-heat
victims included first-division winner Embassy Lobell, who'd
entered the showdown as an even-money favorite to
Harmonious's 6-to-5.
   Starting from the No. 2 post position, Harmonious trailed
Embassy Lobell and early-leader Royal Troubador until the
head of the homestretch before high-stepping away to win by a
generous head. That was pretty much the pattern he'd followed
in capturing his earlier go at odds of 8 to 5. It was a
tribute to his constitution, and abdominal well-being, that
he traveled that second mile in 1:54 1/5, a whit faster than
his 1:55 first circle, before the crowd of 32,000.
   It's fitting that Maalox was associated with this 65th
Hambletonian, because harness racing has been suffering from
the box-office equivalent of heartburn for some time. U.S.
attendance in the sport slid to about 15.5 million last year
from a peak of 28.1 million in 1975, and while per capita
wagering has increased it hasn't kept total handle from
falling steeply, too.
   Harness-racing stalwarts are adamant about the main reason
for the slide. "It's politics," snorts Delvin Miller, a
longtime horse owner, trainer and driver, and track owner.
"Off-track betting is killing us in New York, and so are the
casinos and state lotteries elsewhere. Who needs to go to a
racetrack to bet these days?"
   But it also could be that the rural roots of the
horse-and-buggy sport are stretching ever thinner in this
urban age. The Hambletonian, named for a plenipotent, 19th
century sire, is a notable transplant, having been moved to
the huge, glass-enclosed Meadowlands plant across the Hudson
River from New York in 1981 after a 24-year run at the Du
Quoin State Fair in bucolic Southern Illinois. While the move
has boosted the event's purse to Saturday's record $1,346,000
from $293,000 in 1980, there are many who'll tell you it just
ain't the same.
   Starting next year, the Hambletonian will be altered in
another basic way. The event has been a multi-heat affair
since its inception in 1926, with the winner having to cross
the finish line first twice before hostilities cease. Next
year, to satisfy television's lust for predictability, it
will be decided in a single, one-mile dash if 10 or fewer
trotters enter.
   If there are 11 or more starters, the field will be split
into divisions, with the top handful of finishers from each
qualifying for the final. The winner of that run will be the
champ, whether or not he or she won either of the initial
heats. If Harmonious or Embassy Lobell hadn't won Saturday's
second heat, they would have had to go at it yet again,
head-to-head, risking the rancor of the anti-cruelty lobby.
In 1976, the colt Steve Lobell collapsed from exhaustion
after finally winning the Hambletonian in a fourth heat, and
narrowly survived. That triggered the race's last format
change.
   It was a relief that anyone won on Saturday, because
they're still arguing about who took last year's Hambo. That
one's third-heat runoff ended in an unprecedented dead heat
between Probe and Park Avenue Joe. After much travail, in and
out of court, the two were declared co-champs, but the
winner's purse went to Park Avenue Joe's owners because his
2-1-1 placings in the heats were better than Probe's 1-9-1.
Probe's owners, contending that their animal's faster winning
times should prevail, are appealing, legalwise. One would
think they'd get the rules straight after all these years.
   Saturday's race provided an interesting twist on that saga
because many of the same humans involved in the Park Avenue
Joe-Probe hassle came down to the wire again. Harmonious is
owned by the Antonacci family, which also owns Probe; Embassy
Lobell's proprietor is Lou Guida, who also owns Joe.
   Guida, a multiple Hambletonian winner as are the
Antonaccis, said the purse hassle was "nothing personal, just
a business situation," and Guy, the Antonacci clan head, went
along. But trainer Formia, who'd also guided Probe, demurred.
The dispute "took the fun out" of the 1989 co-title, and it
was nice to win this one outright, he declared.
   Among those taking bows for Harmonious's triumph, none was
more deserving than Formia. The lean former groom, a
prospective U.S. citizen, brought Harmonious to the race with
but $15,900 in winnings, the smallest wallet in the field.
But he'd prepped him with six races over the Meadowland strip
and had enlisted as his driver John Campbell, harness
racing's all-time money leader and winner of the race in 1987
and '88.
   "He's a big horse, and not pretty, and he was a late
bloomer. The more I raced him, the more I liked him," said
Formia. "It made no sense to travel him. This is where we
wanted him to do well."
   "They did a great job in preparing this horse. He kept
improving every race, even though it was against lesser
competition," testified Campbell. At the suggestion that the
Hambo is becoming "his" race, the mustached Canadian did not
bridle. "It's a good race to be lucky," said he.

   WASHINGTON -- Cambridge Capital Fund L.P. said it
increased its stake in Whitehall Corp. to 12.2% even though
it had disclosed in an earlier filing that it could not
structure an acquisition of the Dallas-based defense
contractor that was economically justifiable and still
acceptable to Whitehall shareholders.
   In April, Cambridge proposed a tender offer at $20 a
share, but withdrew it when it lost a proxy contest later
that month. Cambridge said then it would explore
alternatives. Cambridge bought 43,600 shares Wednesday and
Thursday at $11.75 to $12 a share.

   Why So Many U.S. Errors in the Mideast?

   When Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait Thursday morning, the
world quickly turned to the U.S. for leadership in dealing
with the crisis. The measure of trust reflected in that makes
it all the more poignant that the U.S. has such limited means
for restoring the status quo ante in Kuwait and punishing the
Iraqi tyrant for his outrageous act.
   To be sure, it was something of a feat for the U.S. to so
quickly organize a wide-ranging trade boycott and freeze of
Iraq's foreign assets, plus suspensions of arms shipments to
that country. But asset freezes and trade boycotts are a
dubious way of dealing with tyrants. The one results in
incredible legal tangles that hurt both sides. The other is
hard to enforce when it involves oil, a much sought-after
commodity that cannot easily be traced to its origins. There
are many holes to plug.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the boycott fails, nothing happens. If it has
significant success, it might cost the West far more in
higher oil prices than it would cost Saddam Hussein in lost
revenues. His refusal to pay foreign debts would add to the
cost. It's the old cutting-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face
problem.
   President Bush is threatening military action if Hussein
presses his campaign into Saudi Arabia, but the Iraqi
freebooter probably has judged his ground carefully. The West
has little prospect for deploying enough forces to overwhelm
a 1 million-man Iraqi army. Punishing Iraq with air power
probably involves risking a U.S. aircraft carrier in the
Persian Gulf against a sizable Iraqi air force equipped with
Exocet missiles. Winning permission from the Saudis or the
Arab emirates to base strike aircraft on their soil faces
their usual ambivalence over whether the U.S. is a reliable
protector. A blockade would require Persian Gulf military
action and the interruption of oil flows through pipelines
passing through Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam also can be expected to display further cleverness.
He now may pull some troops out of Kuwait and claim that he
has met world-wide demands. He learned from the Soviets in
Afghanistan and from the Vietnamese in Cambodia that
withdrawing troops is not the same as surrendering control.
He has installed his own puppet government in Kuwait and will
run it from Baghdad.
   What friends does the West have in the area? Turkey and
Israel, of course. But they too have recent cause for
reservations about the reliability of their western allies.
After the Iraqi move last week, the initial Israeli statement
was that it would retaliate if attacked. That hardly needed
saying other than to possibly convey the meaning that Israel
intends to sit this one out if it isn't attacked. The
Israelis also couldn't resist saying, "we told you so," to
all those critics in the West who lately have been carping at
their "intransigence" toward the Arabs. They wondered whether
Iraq, by attacking another Arab country, now has demonstrated
to everyone's satisfaction that it, not Israel, is the
greatest threat to Mideast peace.
   The Turks, for their part, are the stepchildren of NATO,
welcome to help defend the West if they can find the weapons,
but too "different" to merit membership in the best clubs,
such as the European Community. If they are asked to help
pull the West's chestnuts out of the fire through such
hostile acts as shutting down Iraq's pipeline across Turkey
or basing a NATO attack force on Turkish soil, they could
justifiably demand better future treatment.
   Democrats in Congress and press critics are flogging the
Bush administration for its failure to foresee the Iraqi
strike. This time, some flogging is deserved. Having been
embarrassed by a tyrant it had assiduously courted with trade
subsidies, the administration attempted an alibi, saying that
Saddam's move was unexpected. In fact, few knockout punches
have been better telegraphed. London's Economist, among
others, had called the invasion a near-certainty a week
before it happened. Columnist William Safire had been
screaming at the top of his lungs about the attempt to cozy
up to a man with such a long and bloody record of treachery.
   There is plenty of blame to go around, however. If
Congress was more prescient than the administration it wasn't
evident while it was whacking away at the defense budget just
before Saddam made his move. Indeed, it was whacking the very
things, such as the B-2 Stealth bomber, the C-17 airlifter
and a forward air base at Crotone, Italy, that would be most
useful in dealing with a war in the Middle East.
   Such confusion is hardly new. U.S. policy in the Middle
East has been schizoid for years. In part, this is because
there is no area of the world where U.S. foreign policy has
been subject to a greater number of competing domestic
political pressures. U.S. politicians have so often given
Turkey the back of their hands, for example, because of
lobbying from powerful anti-Turkish Greek and Armenian
lobbies in the U.S.
   While the U.S. has had a longstanding special relationship
with Israel and has invested large sums in Israel's security,
U.S. politics have mirrored the dove-hawk debate in Israel
itself. The fiasco that ultimately resulted from Israel's
1982 invasion and then withdrawal from Lebanon, leaving that
country a permanent abattoir presided over by Syria, was a
direct result of policy divisions in the U.S. and Israel.
   Before that came the Carter administration's abandonment
of the Shah of Iran, another U.S. friend in the region, after
a revolutionary campaign against the shah had stirred loud
sympathetic echoes from the American left. President Carter,
of course, paid for that mistake with the hostage crisis. The
Reagan administration's effort -- by means of Israel and
unorthodox methods -- to reopen contact with Iran exploded
into the Iran-Contra affair, one of the most vicious fights
in the history of American politics.
   Through it all, State Department operatives have persisted
in trying to build relationships with the Arab world. The
most notable success of such efforts was the Camp David
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. But the failures have been
equally prominent. Yasser Arafat has continued to foment
terrorism despite U.S. efforts to convert him into a
statesman. King Hussein of Jordan and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,
two other putative U.S. friends, set up a cooperation council
with Saddam not long before he pulled last week's power play.
That complicates efforts to organize a moderate Arab front
against Iraq.
   It can be argued that U.S. failures in the Mideast are
mainly a product of the complexities of the problem and the
fact that the Soviets have been competitors for influence in
the region. There is truth in that, but one still wonders how
Saddam's move could have been "unexpected" and how much it
will cost to remedy the oversight.

   How to speed up product development is the primary concern
of nearly every senior executive of every major industrial
corporation. We can learn a lot from those who lead in their
ability to speed new products to the market without
sacrificing product quality or marketability. My own top-10
list would be:
   Honda, Compaq, Motorola, Sony, Canon, Boeing, Merck
pharmaceuticals, Microsoft, Intel microprocessors and Toyota.
There are others I could have chosen. 3M comes to mind. So
does Ford, lately. Nonetheless, I believe my picks are the
best.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The following management themes are common to most, if not
all of these suppliers:
   -- They focus on one or only a few businesses. They are
not diversified conglomerates. The senior management of the
company is able to direct its attention to the business at
hand. Typically more than 80% of the sales at these companies
come from one or two highly related businesses. Merck is the
second most focused major pharmaceutical company in the world
with 84% of its sales coming from pharmaceutical products.
Canon's optical based products account for 88% of sales.
Boeing gets 89% of its sales from aircraft. Automobiles
account for 84% of Toyota's sales.
   Intel and Honda produce many different products, but they
both have an underlying technology that drives them. All of
Honda's sales come from engine-based products (e.g. autos,
motorcycles, lawn mowers). All of Intel's sales come from the
design, development, manufacture and sale of microcomputer
components and related products (at various levels of
integration).
   Compaq focuses almost solely on the personal computer
market, and more specifically, on the business PC market.
Michael Swavely, president of Compaq's North American
Division commented: "We don't spend a lot of time worrying
about the home market or the educational market or some of
the industrial markets. We focus our resources on developing
new products to meet the needs of the business PC user."
   -- They are global. Two points are worth making here.
First, their capability is so strong that they are able to
compete globally. Second, many actively pursue international
markets specifically where the competition is stiff to ensure
that they remain world class by being tested against the
best.
   In fact, world-class developers usually are among the top
ten competitors in each of the major global markets -- U.S.,
Japan and Europe. Boeing holds a bigger share than Airbus or
McDonnell Douglas in each of the three markets. Merck is
first in the U.S., sixth in Europe and ninth in Japan. Toyota
is first in Japan, fifth in the U.S. and would be higher than
its twelfth position in Europe were it not for protectionist
policies. The same holds true for Honda which is third in
Japan and fourth in the U.S. Compaq is the second supplier of
business PCs in the U.S. and Canada, and second in Europe
too.
   Motorola spares no effort to break into tough markets.
Motorola pressured the Japanese to open up its
telecommunication market and has become a significant player
in the cellular market. In 1988, Canon initiated a five-year
Global Corporation Plan intended to increase production
world-wide by relocating some of its manufacturing
capabilities, and extending R&amp;D outside of Japan. Merck is
the most aggressive of all large pharmaceutical companies in
obtaining approvals for and marketing its new drugs in the
top world markets. Between 1982 and 1988 Merck launched 10
new drugs in 47% of the top 12 markets world-wide against an
industry median of 33%.
   Typically world-class developers have 35% to 70% of their
sales outside their home market. Merck led all U.S. drug
companies in 1988 with 50% of its sales outside the U.S.
Honda had 63% of its sales outside Japan, while both Canon
and Sony had 69%. Motorola had 36% outside of the U.S. and
Intel had 43%. In 1989, international sales accounted for 45%
of Compaq's revenue, 46% of 3M's and 55% of Microsoft's.
Perhaps reflecting the increasing importance of global
markets, Ford's new chief executive, Red Poling, has seven
years of experience with Ford of Europe.
   -- Senior management is actively involved in defining and
improving the product development process. At Merck there are
numerous senior management committees that meet on a monthly
basis to manage the development process and the portfolio of
candidates in the pipeline. At Microsoft, Bill Gates keeps in
contact with its engineers by dispatching memos over the
company's electronic mail network, sometimes as many as 30 in
a day. Many CEOs were themselves involved in the product
development process. Roy Vagelos of Merck is a physician and
a biochemist. He became research chief in 1976. Honda has had
a tradition of engineering executives. All four presidents in
Honda's history have been engineers and had previously led
the R&amp;D organization.
   -- They have the ability to recruit and retain the top
people in their fields. One of Merck managers' more important
responsibilities is to recruit stars. Consequently, Merck
boasts that its people are higher quality than found at some
of the best academic institutions. In order to retain the
talent, Merck is known to skip several rungs on the ladder
when promoting its top people. Microsoft, too, is known for
hiring the best and brightest possible.
   -- They understand that speed to market reinforces product
quality, rather than threatening it. If Honda and GM are both
designing an auto for the 1992 market, and it takes Honda two
years to design the model while GM takes five, Honda has a
number of advantages. It can design in 1990 available
technology, whereas GM must design in 1987 technology. Honda
need only forecast customer need two years into the future,
whereas GM requires a five-year time horizon, and is much
more likely to miss. Finally, Honda's development teams gain
development experience 2.5 times more quickly than GM's.
   World-class product development requires senior management
leadership, involvement and commitment. It requires a
disciplined new-product development process recognized and
understood by all who "touch" it in the organization. It also
requires aggressive goals to ensure continuous improvement.

   Hong Kong Aids Satellite Broadcasting,
   Also Helps Colony's Only Cable-TV Firm

   HONG KONG -- A delicate balancing act by Hong Kong's
government has offered the satellite-broadcasting industry a
new lease on life while attempting to allay the concerns of
the territory's cable-television company.
   The government of the British crown colony announced
recently that it will legalize the use of satellite dishes in
Hong Kong but will require communal-dish operators and
satellite broadcasters to first obtain licenses. A ban had
been in effect on the installation and use of satellite
dishes, although it was enforced only loosely.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new ruling grants individuals the right to own and
operate a satellite dish for personal use, without a license.
Operators of communal dishes, serving more than one viewer,
must apply for a license.
   The decision will allow HutchVision, a unit of the Hong
Kong trading company Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., to proceed with
its plans to offer satellite-broadcasting service in Hong
Kong.
   At the same time, some observers said, the requirement
that communal-satellite dishes be licensed marked an attempt
to protect Hong Kong Cable Communications, or HKCC, the
consortium that is to operate Hong Kong's first
cable-television service. HutchVision and HKCC have failed to
agree on a broadcast-sharing arrangement.
   Officials of HKCC, owned by Wharf (Holdings) Ltd., Sun
Hung Kai Properties Ltd., U S West Inc., Shaw Brothers (Hong
Kong) Ltd. and Coditel S.A., couldn't be reached for comment
on the government's announcement.
   HutchVision said it welcomed the government's ruling.
However, an individual close to HutchVision called the
decision far from satisfactory because the requirement that
dishes be licensed in some cases "could be potentially
restrictive and prohibitively expensive for the ordinary
citizen."
   Another potential roadblock could be the drafting of the
regulations governing satellite broadcasting, which could
take as long as a year.
   Last year, prior to HKCC's winning the cable award, Hong
Kong's Executive Council proposed to legalize the dishes. But
the government, not wishing to jeopardize the pending
cable-franchise agreement, put the proposal aside. The
successful launch of AsiaSat, Asia's first privately owned
satellite, rekindled local interest in developing an Asian
satellite-telecommunications industry.
   The plan announced recently, though, goes one step further
than last year's proposal by also requiring that satellite
broadcasters be licensed. By broadening the regulations, a
telecommunications consultant said, the government attempted
to reassure HKCC that it won't allow unchecked competition
from satellite broadcasters.
   With a commitment to invest between HK$4 billion and
HK$5.5 billion (US$515 million and US$708 million) in the
cable system, "HKCC might abandon the project if it becomes
economically unfeasible," the consultant said.
   Added John Ure, a telecommunications expert and research
fellow at Hong Kong University: "The government is committed
to a cable system. Cable's capacity is much greater than that
of satellites. It would be a pity for Hong Kong to lose the
possibility of getting cable simply because satellite gets to
broadcast first." Even so, he noted that from HKCC's
perspective, the government decision on satellite dishes
"certainly doesn't give {HKCC} what they wanted, which is to
hinder the broadcast of satellite-TV in Hong Kong."
   HKCC has said that it has exclusive rights to all the
territory's cable-related services. It argues that to provide
Hong Kong viewers with television broadcasting services via
satellite, as HutchVision plans, requires the partial use of
cable services. Communal-satellite dishes, HKCC says, operate
like mini-cable systems, relaying satellite signals from the
dishes along cables into the homes of independent viewers.
   HutchVision has reserved half of the available capacity on
AsiaSat. Last week, it reached an agreement with the
satellite's operator under which HutchVision will pay rent on
the satellite's reserved capacity until year's end. For 1991,
full leasing agreements are to be signed or the space will be
relinquished.

   Italian Concern Is Working
   On Buying de Havilland
   And Building Bigger Jet

   The Italian aerospace group Aeritalia S.p.A., faced with
an uncertain outlook for defense-related sales, is driving to
expand its commuter-aircraft business and develop markets in
other sectors of civilian aviation.
   Following the signing of its first contract with the
Airbus Industrie consortium earlier this year, Rome-based
Aeritalia is negotiating jointly with Aerospatiale S.A. of
France to buy the troubled commuter-plane maker de Havilland
Aircraft of Canada Ltd., a unit of Boeing Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Italian state-owned group also is working with
Aerospatiale on studies for a 100-seat regional jetliner to
complement the smaller ATR-42 and ATR-72 turboprop commuter
planes that the two companies already build in a 50-50 joint
venture, Avions de Transport Regional.
   For the moment it is the de Havilland talks that top the
agenda. Seattle-based Boeing bought the company from the
Canadian government for $112 million in 1986 and has since
invested hundreds of millions of dollars in an unsuccessful
attempt to turn it around. Now, Aeritalia and Aerospatiale
have a chance to snap up a major competitor and gain access
to a wider market.
   "Today it is certainly important to have a large share of
the market . . . The ATR consortium already has 23% of the
world market, and if we add de Havilland we'll have 45%,"
Fausto Cereti, Aeritalia's managing director, said in an
interview in Rome.
   The ATR consortium was set up in 1982, initially to build
the 48-seat, $9.2 million turboprop ATR-42 plane. The
consortium later added a larger version, the 66-seat, $12
million ATR-72. Between them, the two aircraft have won a
total of 435 orders and options from 45 customers, with 185
planes delivered so far.
   De Havilland is competing in a similar market with its
three versions of the Dash 8. The two types currently flying
seat as many as 39 and 54 passengers, respectively, while de
Havilland is planning to build a new series seating 65 to 70
people.
   "We have an outline accord on the eventual purchase of de
Havilland by Aerospatiale and Aeritalia. But we have to see
whether the conditions are acceptable for the shareholders of
Boeing, Aeritalia and Aerospatiale and the Canadian
government," Mr. Cereti said. News of the talks has provoked
a stormy debate in the Canadian press, with critics
contending the European companies are more interested in
eliminating a competitor than developing the company.
   "If we buy de Havilland, we'll see what products to
develop," Mr. Cereti said, refusing to be drawn on specific
plans for the company.
   While pursuing the de Havilland acquisition to broaden its
commuter plane sales, the 100-seat regional jet project is
another angle Aeritalia is pursuing to deepen its penetration
of the civilian market.
   "The demand is there in the market. There are many
airlines asking us if we can supply a 100-seater plane," Mr.
Cereti said. But he added that the specifics of any eventual
production model would depend on customer requirements.
   Aeritalia's interest in acquiring joint control of de
Havilland is part of the group's wider strategy to become a
world market leader, not only in commuter planes but also in
other sectors of civilian aviation, particularly the
refurbishing and maintenance of aircraft and avionics.
   Defense-sector sales accounted for nearly 60% of
Aeritalia's 1989 consolidated revenue of 2.4 trillion lire
($2.06 billion). With defense budgets under pressure in Italy
and the West following the disintegration of the communist
regimes, the group is anxious to reduce its reliance on
defense contracts to about 50% of sales within the next
couple of years.
   As part of this aim it is about to embark on a major
corporate restructuring, merging with Selenia S.p.A., another
state-owned group in the electronics and aerospace sector.
Both companies are owned by Finmeccanica S.p.A., the
engineering holding company for the giant state industrial
conglomerate Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale. But
despite past cooperation, the concerns have until now
operated as separate corporate entities.
   "It's the sum of two forces who already work together . .
. It's a question of putting the right label on a bottle of
wine that has already matured," Mr. Cereti said.
   But analysts, while recognizing the company's success in
winning contracts in a competitive market, have been somewhat
critical of its overall business performance.
   "It's true that Aeritalia, according to what they say, has
had a very good performance in terms of orders, but that
hasn't translated into any reasonable profit," said Gabriele
Muzio, analyst for SBC Stockbroking in London.
   Consolidated net profit attributable to the company fell
to L60.4 billion last year from L77 billion in 1988, despite
a rise in orders to L5.89 trillion from L4.89 trillion.

   ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Elco Industries Inc., hurt by continued
softness in its auto-related business and start-up losses at
a joint venture, expects to report profit fell 30% in the
fourth quarter ended June 30.
   Jack W. Packard, chairman and chief executive of the maker
of fasteners, said earnings fell to about $1.4 million, or 29
to 30 cents a share, from $2 million, or 43 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales rose slightly, to about $40 million from
$39.4 million a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Elco's consumer business was strong, Mr. Packard said, but
failed to offset lower margins in its auto-parts business.
Mr. Packard said losses at the Rocknel Fastener joint venture
with Japan's Nagoya Screw Manufacturing Co. reduced
fourth-quarter earnings about $300,000, or six cents a share.
The joint venture was set up to supply U.S. factories of
Japanese auto makers.
   Mr. Packard said he expects the venture's sales to reach
an annual rate of about $8 million by June 1991 and for it to
show a profit by the fall of that year.
   Elco's fourth-quarter estimates indicate earnings for the
year of about $4.8 million, or $1.01 a share, down from $7.8
million, or $1.65 a share, a year earlier.

   HHS Proposes
   Lab Inspection
   Fee Schedule

   WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services
proposed a schedule of basic fees ranging as high as $2,870
to be paid by medical laboratories to cover the cost of new
federal inspection.
   Even labs that are exempt from regulation would have to
pay $156 every two years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under a 1988 law designed to improve the accuracy of
clinical tests, all laboratories, including those in doctors'
offices, must be certified as meeting new federal standards
in order to receive payments from Medicare and Medicaid.
These federal health programs for the elderly and the poor
pay about 40% of the nation's clinical lab costs.
   The law requires that the government charge fees high
enough to pay for the cost of the inspection and
certification program. It will cover more than 300,000 labs,
a huge expansion of current Medicare regulations that cover
some 12,000 labs.
   The American Medical Association and other groups have
complained that regulations that HHS proposed in May to carry
out the law are too costly and complex. The large volume of
comments the department has received on the May proposals
could delay the start of the program.
   Many labs will be inspected every two years, although labs
that perform only simple, low-risk tests, such as urine
pregnancy tests, will be exempt from regulation. Under the
fee proposal, however, they would still have to pay $156
every two years to maintain their certificate of waiver. All
other labs would have to pay a one-time fee of $261 for a
provisional certificate of compliance.
   When regulated labs are inspected they would then pay a
fee ranging from $840 to $2,870, depending on their size. The
inspection fees would be paid every two years. The
department's Health Care Financing Administration also
proposed fees for follow-up investigations, if necessary, and
for hearings if sanctions are imposed.
   The federal government would pass most of the fees on to
the state agencies that will perform inspections. A separate
set of fees would cover inspections performed by professional
accreditation groups rather than state agencies.
   "Patients demand and deserve accurate, high-quality
medical laboratory work," HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said.
"The fees will support our system to assure that these
requirements are met." The department is allowing 60 days for
comment on the proposed fee schedule before deciding on its
final form.

   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Perini Investment Properties Inc.
said it suspended its dividend and announced a decline in
second-quarter cash flow to three cents a share from 23 cents
in the year-ago period.
   The real-estate investment trust blamed the decline on a
drop in distributions from joint ventures, which it called
"largely a timing item," increased interest payments in the
quarter and a decline in cash flow from certain operating
properties.
</LP>

   The company said it expects these conditions to affect
operating cash flow for the remainder of the year. But it
said that certain planned transactions "could significantly
improve" results.
   In a statement, the company said it elected to suspend the
dividend in keeping with the board's policy of paying out 50%
to 60% of current cash flow. But the statement said the board
reaffirmed its belief that the net current per-share value of
the company's assets is "substantially in excess" of the
current share price.

   Randall D. Hubbard, a horse-racing enthusiast and chairman
of AFG Industries Inc., acquired 9.9% stakes in two companies
that own and operate the Hollywood Park race track in
Inglewood, Calif., and said he may seek their control.
   Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises Inc. owns the
thoroughbred race track and 347 acres of surrounding land
roughly five miles east of the Los Angeles International
Airport. Hollywood Park Operating Co. operates the track.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, the
companies' shares, which are paired for trading, rose 75
cents to $30.
   Mr. Hubbard said that "if you took a survey of patrons and
employees I think you'd find a lot of dissatisfaction with
the park. . . . I think the park can be brought back to being
one of the premier tracks in the country."
   Mr. Hubbard said he wants board representation initially,
but that he hasn't ruled out a proxy contest. "I haven't seen
their business plan. We're willing to listen. If we're
satisfied, then representation on the board would be fine."
   Hollywood Park Realty's board has seven members and
Hollywood Park Operating's board has 11 members.
   In a statement, Hollywood Park said "it makes no sense to
turn control of the company over to someone with no
experience managing a major thoroughbred race track." Mr.
Hubbard, however, owns Ruidoso Downs in Ruidoso, N.M.,
Woodlands Race Track in Kansas City, and is a partner in the
Los Alamitos race track, which Hollywood Park sold last year.
   Hollywood Park has reported three consecutive years of
losses, stemming in part from its disastrous attempt to
expand into real estate development with the purchase of the
Los Alamitos track and adjacent land in Cypress, Calif.,
several years ago. Last year, the Hollywood Park companies
had a combined loss of about $11 million, compared with
losses of $10 million in 1988 and $6.3 million in 1987.
   Hollywood Park management "drained all the cash out of the
company" to pay the interest on the loan used to acquire Los
Alamitos, said Kenneth Campbell, editor of Realty Stock
Review, a Montale, N.J., investment newsletter. Development
was blocked by a zoning dispute and Hollywood Park finally
sold Los Alamitos last year to restore Hollywood Park's
financial stability.
   Hollywood Park said second-quarter profit rose 87% and
that recently implemented initiatives promise future profits.
In June, the companies paid their first dividend on common
stock in nearly three years.
   The initiatives include experimental night races and an
expanded program to simulcast races at other race tracks and
legal betting parlors, said a spokesman for the companies.
The track has undergone a major renovation in recent years
and was the site of the national Breeder's Cup race in 1984
and 1987, he said.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Hubbard said he acquired 391,882 paired shares of
Hollywood Park Realty and Hollywood Park Operating, including
271,983 shares bought in the open market from June 19 to July
31 for $26.50 to $30.52 each.
   Mr. Hubbard may have an ally in Denver investor Thomas W.
Gamel, who owns a 5.6% stake. Last year, Mr. Gamel threatened
a proxy fight and called for the ouster of Marjorie L.
Everett, chairman and chief executive officer of Hollywood
Park Operating. After he was offered a board seat, Mr. Gamel
withdrew his rival slate and agreed not to acquire more stock
as long as he is a director.
   Mr. Gamel declined to comment on Mr. Hubbard's actions.
Mr. Gamel, Mr. Hubbard and a third investor offered to buy
Hollywood Park in 1986 for about $133 million, or $35 a
share. The offer was rejected by the board.
   Last month, a Beverly Hills, Calif., partnership headed by
Harry Ornest increased its stake to 9.9%. Mr. Ornest is an
executive with Hollywood Park Realty.
   At Dec. 31, according to an SEC filing, Mrs. Everett held
an 11.1% stake in the realty company and a 6.2% stake in the
operating company; other directors who own paired shares
include investor and former talk-show host Merv Griffin,
1.3%, and investor Marvin Davis, 4.8%. Mr. Davis resigned as
a director in May.
   Two years ago, Mr. Hubbard led an investor group that took
AFG Industries private and moved the glassmaking concern to
Fort Worth, Texas, from Irvine, Calif. He also was involved
in an unsuccessful bid by AFG and other partners in 1986 for
Lear Siegler Inc. The aerospace and industrial concern later
was taken private by Forstmann Little &amp; Co. in a $2.1 million
leveraged buy-out.

   NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc. reached a revised
agreement to sell interests in four investment partnerships
to Krupp Cos., in an apparent setback to CRI Inc., which has
sought control of the partnerships by another route.
   Integrated is a former real-estate syndicator and
financial-services firm that has been operating under
bankruptcy court protection since February.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Krupp is a Boston-based investment firm that manages more
than $2 billion in investments, of which more than $1 billion
are mortgage funds similar to the Integrated investments.
   CRI is a real-estate syndicator based in Rockville, Md.
   The agreement in principle between Integrated and Krupp,
for as much as $45 million in cash and notes, would give
Krupp the general-partner interests in the partnerships,
known as American Insured Mortgage Investors. It eliminates a
previous condition, that CRI's competing bid be dropped. CRI
wants to gain control of the partnerships through a proposed
offer for the partnership units.
   At the same time, Integrated obtained a second court order
blocking CRI from proceeding with two lawsuits against it
until Aug. 13. CRI's proposed offer is outside the
court-approved auction of the partnership interests.
Integrated has been seeking to sell assets to satisfy
creditors, who are owed a total of about $1.8 billion.
   "A significant concern of many of the {AIM} investors was
the uncertainty of finding a qualified investment manager to
replace Integrated, and that matter is now resolved," said
Laurence Gerber, president of Krupp.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard C. Buschman III, who is
overseeing Integrated's reorganization proceedings here, also
agreed to consider on Aug. 13 whether to approve Integrated's
revised agreement to sell to Krupp. But he denied a request
by Integrated to stop CRI from proceeding with its exchange
offer for the AIM units, which is pending before the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Under the revised terms, Krupp agreed to pay Integrated
$28 million in cash, a $10.6 million interest-bearing
promissory note at closing and $6.5 million a year after the
closing. The previous Krupp offer was for $38.6 million in
cash and the $6.5 million a year after closing.
   CRI couldn't be reached for comment.

   Stock Manipulation
   Victims Are Covered
   By RICO, Says Court

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Victims of stock manipulation may use
civil racketeering suits to recover losses, even if the
victims weren't the direct buyers or sellers of the
manipulated securities, a federal appeals court held.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act contains no
limitation that a person damaged by stock manipulation must
be a purchaser or seller of the security.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling expands the power of the Securities Investor
Protection Corp. to recover damages from brokers and dealers
accused of defrauding customers. Attorneys said the decision
could expand the ability of private investors to file such
suits, too.
   The decision reinstates a 1983 lawsuit against 75 people
accused of conspiring to defraud investors of $14 million
through the manipulation of stock prices in six companies
traded over-the-counter between 1964 and 1981.
   The ruling will allow SIPC to pursue its efforts to
recover the $14 million it had to pay investors when it
liquidated two securities brokerage firms, First State
Securities Corp. and Joseph Sebag Inc.
   Although SIPC wasn't an investor in the allegedly
manipulated securities, it sued for triple damages under
RICO, claiming it had losses as a result of racketeering. A
Los Angeles federal court previously dismissed the claim
because SIPC had neither bought nor sold the manipulated
securities, a usual requirement in stock-fraud suits. But the
appeals court held that RICO didn't contain any such
limitation.
   SIPC was created by Congress in 1970 in the wake of the
collapse of numerous brokerage houses. It was established to
provide protection to customers of brokers and dealers and
members of the national securities exchanges.
   The six firms allegedly involved in the stock manipulation
were: Aero Systems Inc., Aerosonic Corp., Bunnington Corp.,
Creditbank Inc., Dash Industries Inc. and Osrow Products
Corp.

   U S West's Chief Executive MacAllister
   To Retire, but He'll Remain Chairman

   U S West Inc. said Jack A. MacAllister, who has headed the
Denver-based regional telephone operating company since it
was created in the Bell System breakup, will retire as chief
executive officer Dec. 31 but remain chairman.
   Mr. MacAllister, 63 years old, will be succeeded by
Richard D. McCormick, 50, who also will remain president and
chief operating officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said the transition should be smooth. "This is
not a dramatic change," Daniel Reingold of Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co. said. "Perhaps Mr. MacAllister has a little more time for
golf, but he remains chairman of the board."
   Mr. McCormick said in an interview that he plans to build
U S West's core and related businesses by improving products
for the telecommunications company's 25 million customers. U
S West, which also has interests in directory publishing,
real estate, cellular phones and computer software, has begun
an ambitious five-year, $10 billion program to upgrade its
network with digital switching and fiber optics. New products
and services are expected to bring in about $100 million in
revenue next year. In 1989, U S West earned $1.11 billion, or
$6.02 a share, on revenue of $9.69 billion.
   Faced with a sluggish economy in much of its 14-state
territory, U S West has been looking for growth overseas. Mr.
McCormick said the company will continue this effort,
building its foreign business along the lines of its cellular
and network agreements with Czechoslovakia and Hungary. He
mentioned Eastern Europe as potential markets.
   Mr. McCormick, an engineer who began his career with
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. in 1961, was president of
Northwestern Bell Co. before moving to U S West as executive
vice president in 1985. Northwestern Bell became part of U S
West when the regional Bell operating companies were created.
   Mr. MacAllister probably will continue his role as an
industry and U S West spokesman, though he said he wants to
spend more time with his family. He also said he plans to
focus on public education issues and on job training and
employment for the homeless. At U S West, Mr. MacAllister has
put a premium on education, setting up programs aimed at
assisting public schools, rewarding outstanding teachers
throughout the company's territory, and exploring ways to
improve early childhood education.
   Mr. MacAllister was named to head U S West shortly after
the breakup of the Bell System was announced in 1982. Prior
to that assignment, he was president of Northwestern Bell in
Omaha, Neb. He began his 40-year career as an
installer-repairman in Council Bluffs, Iowa, and held a
number of executive positions at Northwestern Bell and AT&amp;T.
   Of the initial chief executives of the seven Baby Bell
companies, only two others remain: John Clendenin at
BellSouth Corp., Atlanta, and William Weiss at Ameritech,
Chicago.

   High-Tax States Are Low-Growth States
   ----

   TAXES
</CO>
<LP>
   The 1990 census will almost certainly show that population
-- and therefore voting power -- is continuing to shift from
the Eastern and Midwestern states to the South and West.
Americans are not just moving toward better weather. They are
escaping from high-tax states to states that let them keep
more of their money.
   The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, a
permanent bipartisan body created by Congress in 1959, has
attempted to calculate the state-by-state tax burden. The
commission arrives at its conclusions by dividing each
state's tax base by the actual taxes paid per capita. This
exercise yields an index number of "tax effort" for each
state. An index number above 100 indicates relatively heavy
exploitation of the tax base; an index number below 100
indicates relatively light exploitation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The states with the heaviest tax burdens have been losing
population to the states with the lightest. Between 1975 and
1988, New York had the heaviest tax burden in the country --
62.6% above the national average. It also will have lost more
electoral votes between 1972 and 1992 than any other state.
Florida, among the four lowest-tax states over those 13
years, had a tax burden almost 25% below the national
average. Between 1972 and 1992 it gained eight electoral
votes, more than any other state in the nation.
   Altogether, the 10 states whose relative population grew
fastest between 1970 and 1990 -- Nevada, Arizona, Alaska,
Florida, Utah, Texas, California, New Hampshire, New Mexico
and Washington (in that order) -- had a relative tax burden
nearly 12% below the U.S. average. Collectively, those 10
states will have 31 more electoral votes in 1992 than they
did in 1972.
   In contrast, the 10 states that have been losing relative
population fastest -- Iowa, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Illinois, North
Dakota and Indiana -- had tax efforts more than 10% above the
U.S. average. These states will together have lost 29
electoral votes since 1972.
   Taxes seem to depress employment even more than
population. The best 10 states for employment growth --
Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Alaska, New Hampshire, Washington,
Georgia, Vermont, California and Utah -- averaged 77% growth
in the number of jobs between 1974 and 1989. The worst 10 --
West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, New York,
Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Montana and Louisiana -- averaged
just 18%. The top 10 job-producing states had a relative tax
effort 6% below the U.S. average. The worst 10 job producers
posted results 4% percent above the national average.
   These grand totals are confirmed by surveys of individual
behavior. A 1989 investigation of emigrants from Michigan in
1984 and 1985 found that 86% percent of the 39,674 tax filers
who moved to another state chose states that had discarded
their separate death or inheritance tax. Because Michigan
maintains its own death taxes, in addition to federal taxes,
a person who has been left a $1 million estate will typically
receive nearly $38,000 less than in most other states.
Michigan also imposes punitive taxation on wealth and income.
It enjoys the dubious distinction of the highest unemployment
insurance premiums of any of the nation's 15 most populous
states -- largely because it pays weekly benefits $50 higher
than the national average. This is tantamount to an
employment tax.
   The superior population and employment growth of low-tax
states is unaffected by size or region. Small low-tax states,
such as Arizona and Colorado, do just as well as big low
tax-states, such as Florida and California. Low-tax states in
the North, such as New Hampshire, do just as well as low-tax
states in the South, such as Georgia.
   If deductibility of state and local taxes is capped, as
has been suggested in Washington's budget negotiations, high
income-tax states, such as New York and Massachusetts, would
experience disproportionately great capital flight because
the effective marginal tax rate on income in those states
would escalate dramatically. The Heartland Institute in
Chicago confirms that for each 1% increase in a state's tax
effort relative to the national average, personal income
growth in that state will fall behind the U.S. average by
0.6% per year.
   Americans are voting with their feet. States that are
dreading the results of the current census can easily, then,
improve their performance on the one coming in 2000 simply by
cutting taxes.

   Black Groups Plan a Miami Boycott
   To Protest City's Treatment of Mandela

   National black organizations are planning to protest
Miami's snubbing of Nelson Mandela by boycotting the city as
a convention site.
   Maurice Wallace, executive director of the Metro Miami
Action Plan, says he asked about 30 black groups to send
representatives to a meeting on Wednesday about the proposed
boycott. Mr. Wallace, who heads the coalition of local black
groups, says he supports the boycott proposal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In June, the Miami City Commission, which includes Miami
Mayor Xavier Suarez and the Metro-Dade Commission, refused to
honor Mr. Mandela after he made comments supporting Cuban
leader Fidel Castro. Those comments angered Miami's powerful
Cuban-American voters.
   In the wake of the city's chilly reception of Mr. Mandela,
H.T. Smith, a member of the Dade County Black Lawyers
Association, started a campaign to persuade fellow members of
the 1,500-lawyer National Bar Association to reconsider plans
to hold their convention in Miami in 1993. Mr. Smith says the
dearth of black hotel employees in the city as well as
Miami's treatment of Haitian immigrants are other reasons for
the proposed boycott.
   At its convention in Houston last week, the bar
association voted not to hold its 1993 meeting in Miami. A
spokesman estimated that NBA members spend about $1 million
at their conventions.
   "The action we take has to be economic," Mr. Smith says.
"That's the only thing people of power understand."
   The 50,000-member Omega Psi Phi fraternity has also told
the Greater Miami Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau that it will
not hold its conference in Miami next year because of the
Mandela incident.
   A spokesman for the 5,000-member Alpha Phi Alpha
fraternity, convening in Miami this week, said the
organization did not have time to change its plans. But, he
said that as another form of protest, the fraternity plans to
limit its spending to black merchants.
   The 10,000-member Delta Sigma Theta sorority convened in
Miami in July. The sorority -- which counts Mandela's wife,
Winnie, as an honorary member -- asked for an apology from
the county and municipal governments, but did not receive it.
   William Talbert, vice president of operations for the
Greater Miami Tourism &amp; Convention Bureau, a private
marketing organization, says the Miami-area tourism industry
could lose millions of dollars if black fraternities,
sororities and political, professional and trade
organizations reject Miami as a convention site.
   "We're still aggressively seeking to attract black
conventions and meetings in the greater Miami area," Mr.
Talbert says. Regarding the "perceived snub," of Mr. Mandela,
Mr. Talbert says, "We had no control of that."
   A spokeswoman for Mayor Suarez says the mayor does not
intend to lobby to keep black conventioneers. "He doesn't
plan to issue a public apology," the spokeswoman said.

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said anti-dumping
duties ranging from 1.7% to 3.17% should be assessed on
imports of synthetic-fiber sweaters from South Korea.
   Before the duties can be applied, however, the U.S.
International Trade Commission must decide whether the
imports, which totaled $476.1 million last year, have injured
the domestic industry. Affirmative rulings by both agencies
are required in anti-dumping cases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The duties would offset the advantage of imports priced
below the cost of production or below the price charged in
South Korea's home market.
   The Commerce Department delayed until Aug. 20 its
determination on what anti-dumping duties should be imposed
on sweater imports from Taiwan. Earlier, the department found
that some Hong Kong sweater manufacturers also have violated
the U.S. Anti-Dumping Act.
   The ITC has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on sweater
imports from all three major Asian suppliers.
   The Commerce Department said the dumping margins on the
imports from South Korea averaged 3.17% on man-made fiber
sweaters -- including jackets, vests, cardigans and pullover
garments -- manufactured by Hanil Synthetic Fiber Industrial
Co. and smaller amounts for sweaters produced by other
companies. These included 1.2% for Chunji Industrial Co.,
1.11% for Shinwon Tongsan, 0.92% for Yurim Co., 0.73% for
Young Woo &amp; Co. and 1.3% for all other South Korean
producers.

   Nine High Priests
   Interpret U.S. Holy Writ

<LP>
   Regarding your June 27 editorial "The Court's Angels": the
U.S. Constitution can hardly be ". . . transformed into Holy
Writ. . . ." It always has been Holy Writ. The English
refugees who first settled these shores came here in large
part because the medieval mind-set of Tudor England was being
replaced by James I's modernizing ideas, and those who
couldn't adapt emigrated.
   The essence of medieval polity was that all authority was
ultimately vested in "natural law," i.e. God's law, which was
interpreted for the people's use by the church. While the
drafters of our Constitution were far removed from medieval
times ecclesiastically, their political instincts were still
rooted in Tudor England, not Stuart, Orange or Hanoverian.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Compare Britain and the U.S. in terms of the locus of
"sovereignty." In the former, the law is whatever the House
of Commons says it is, and that House is by and large a fair
reflection of the "vox populi". "The people" are, through the
representational mechanism of the House of Commons, indeed
sovereign.
   In the U.S., by contrast, sovereignty is vested in a piece
of paper, the meaning of which, while reasonably clear when
written, is now available to the people only through the
interpretation of the Supreme Court. Our elected
representatives, both executive and legislative, are helpless
in the face of contrary "interpretations" by a majority of
our nine high priests.
   You and I may understand, for example, that so long as the
U.S. does not have an "official" church, the Constitution's
prohibition of the "establishment" of religion is being
complied with, and no further action or decision is
necessary. However, the simple words in the Constitution no
longer mean what they say; they mean whatever our unelected
lifetime-appointed neoclergy decides they mean.
   Therefore, unless there is a fundamental restructuring of
the American system of government, the Constitution will
remain, rather than be transformed into, "Holy Writ." I leave
it to you and your readers to figure out what can be done
about it.

   LONDON -- Coats Viyella PLC, a U.K. textile maker, said it
satisfied regulatory conditions for a bid for Tootal Group
PLC, another U.K. textile group.
   Coats Viyella said it sold its U.K. thread business to
Amann &amp; Soehne G.m.b.H., a West German textile group, for an
undisclosed sum.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission said in October that
Coats could only take over Tootal if it disposed of all of
its U.K. interests in domestic sewing thread supply and its
shares in Gutermann Group.
   In December, the friendly #395 million ($732.6 million)
bid foundered following the breakdown of talks between the
two companies. Tootal said at the time that the offer failed
to reflect the company's strengths and prospects.
   Russell Walls, finance director of Coats Viyella, said the
company was now "free from any restrictions" to bid for
Tootal. He added that no negotiations were taking place
between the two companies.
   Coats Viyella sold its stake in the Gutermann Group to the
Gutermann family in May for an undisclosed sum.

   WASHINGTON -- Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein has left
President Bush with a very unattractive set of options. The
economic sanctions the president is attempting to impose may
inflict as much pain on the U.S. as they do on Iraq, yet
there was growing concern last night that the president may
have to resort to even more drastic military measures to keep
Iraq's hands off Saudi Arabia.
   Mr. Bush is having surprising early success on the
economic front, getting both Western Europe and Japan to sign
on to the U.S.-led global embargo of oil exports from Iraq
and the Kuwaiti oil fields Iraq seized last week.

   The administration is now considering a move to gain
United Nations support for a plan to blockade Iraqi oil
shipments through the Persian Gulf or either of two major
pipelines carrying oil out through Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
The blockade, which would be carried out in international
waters, would be accomplished by an international fleet,
including U.S. warships.
   But the more the embargo succeeds, the more painful it
will be for American consumers. In all likelihood, there
isn't enough extra oil capacity in other countries to make up
for the more than 4 million barrels a day of oil that a
boycott and such a blockade would bottle up in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   Under such a scenario, world oil prices could skyrocket,
at least temporarily, perhaps to as high as $35 a barrel, 40%
higher than they are today, an increase of about 25 cents a
gallon at American gas pumps.
   The resulting disruptions could, in the short run, wreak
havoc on industrial economies world-wide.
   The president yesterday used his toughest language yet
condemning the Iraqi move against Kuwait. Mr. Bush declared
that "these are outlaws -- international outlaws and
renegades," and he flatly pledged to roll back the Iraqi
invasion: "This will not stand. This will not stand, this
aggression against Kuwait."
   And though Iraq claimed yesterday that it had begun
pulling troops out of Kuwait, Mr. Bush charged that Baghdad
"lied" and that its forces remained. He declared that Arab
leaders had "failed" to find their own solution within 48
hours of the invasion, as promised.
   The president again refused to rule out the use of
military force against Iraq, and it seems clear that the U.S.
would move militarily if Saudi Arabia were attacked. U.S.
intelligence officials yesterday told the White House of
signs Iraq is actually preparing to seize the so-called
neutral zone on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border or to invade Saudi
Arabia itself, according to officials familiar with the
intelligence reports.
   In one sign that the U.S. is preparing to react to such an
event, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney was dispatched for
talks to Saudi Arabia, which still doesn't want to allow
American forces on its soil as a precaution.
   In the event of Iraqi aggression against Saudi Arabia, the
U.S. would have to hope that the quick dispatch of jet
fighters and big B-52 bombers from distant domestic and
foreign bases and the rapid deployment of a small contingent
of light ground forces would be enough to offset Iraqi
troops, who would be far closer to Saudi oil fields and more
heavily armed.
   One option under study in the Pentagon, according to
defense officials who asked not to be identified, is the
possibility of bombing secret Iraqi facilities where Mr.
Hussein has scientists and foreign mercenaries working on
nuclear and biological weapons research. Iraq also has
underground storage sites for chemical weapons that are
vulnerable to U.S. bombs, some of which have the capacity to
penetrate deeply into the earth. Mr. Hussein "has a great
deal to lose here," says one expert.
   Yet the complications facing any American military move
are sobering. In addition to the U.S.'s inability to position
forces ahead of time in the region, the puppet government
Iraq has installed appeared to raise a new obstacle yesterday
by hinting that it is prepared to take reprisals against
foreigners trapped in Kuwait, including an estimated 3,800
Americans.
   There is disagreement among U.S. officials and Arab
diplomats about the chances of Mr. Hussein actually ordering
his troops to drive on into Saudi Arabia. Some diplomats
reported that Iraq has moved into at least part of the
neutral zone.
   The intelligence assessment was based on satellite photos
and human intelligence reports showing the configuration of
Iraqi troops, movements between Iraq and Kuwait and the types
of arms and logistical supplies soldiers near the
Kuwaiti-Saudi border are receiving. Publicly, the White House
said Iraqi forces are five to 10 miles from the border.
   But some American officials discount the new warnings of a
possible Iraqi move against the desert kingdom and its
enormous oil reserves. Middle Eastern diplomatic sources say
the Saudis themselves doubt that Iraq is preparing to move
and don't see the evidence in either satellite photos --
which the U.S. has begun providing to them in the last few
days -- or movements on the ground.
   Although the movement toward meaningful sanctions picked
up momentum over the weekend, there remains doubt that the
international community has the will to make such measures
severe or long-lasting enough to be truly painful to Iraq.
   The European Community agreed to impose broad sanctions,
including embargos on oil purchases from Iraq and Kuwait and
on arms sales to Iraq. And, crucial to hopes for a meaningful
trade embargo, Japan announced yesterday that it also will
embargo oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait.
   But Japan seemed to want further international political
cover, suggesting its move depends on the United Nations
Security Council passing a resolution calling for broad
sanctions. American diplomats were busy trying to draft such
a resolution for quick passage. And there were hints that
China, though it has joined the international move to cut off
arms shipments to Iraq, may balk at endorsing broad trade
sanctions. As a Security Council member, China could block a
resolution it didn't approve of.
   Even if a boycott is successfully assembled, bottling up
all crude exports from Iraq and Kuwait would drain more than
4 million barrels from the world's daily flow of oil. Other
oil exporters have 4.5 million to 5.5 million barrels a day
in currently spare surge capacity, estimates Daniel Yergin,
president of Cambridge Energy Associates, a
Massachusetts-based research and consulting firm. But perhaps
2 million barrels of that is in Saudi Arabia and another
800,000 barrels in the United Arab Emirates, both sources
that might be reluctant to pump full out while looking down
the barrels of Saddam Hussein's guns, Mr. Yergin notes.
   As a result, the world could quickly find itself short
more than a million barrels a day in total crude supplies, a
situation almost certain to set off a price-boosting
scramble. In time, the higher prices would call forth
increased supplies and would help induce conservation. And in
the interim the U.S. and other countries could let some oil
out of their strategic stockpiles to ease the shortage. For a
time, however, the turmoil would likely be intense.
   Meanwhile, there's no way of telling precisely how quickly
a full-scale embargo would pinch Iraq. But over time, the
sting would become painful, particularly because the country
already is in sad economic shape.
   On the military front, two U.S. naval task forces are
converging on the Persian Gulf area. One, including the U.S.
carrier Eisenhower, is expected to take a position in the
eastern Mediterranean. A second, led by the carrier
Independence, is moving from the Indian Ocean toward a
position near the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of the
Persian Gulf.
   A third U.S. naval task force, which will include the
cruise-missile-carrying Wisconsin and the carrier Saratoga,
is scheduled to leave Norfolk tomorrow for the Mediterranean.
A Defense Department spokesman asserted, though, that the
move was planned as part of the normal rotation to replace
the Eisenhower task force.
   While attack aircraft from the carriers could reach
targets in Kuwait and Iraq with in-flight refueling, military
experts believe that the Saudis would let them operate from
Saudi airfields if the desert kingdom were attacked.
Airfields at King Khalid Military City, near the Saudi border
with Kuwait, have been equipped with spare parts and fuel for
such a contingency.
   Such landing privileges would be seen by Iraq as a serious
provocation, and so far the Saudis have been reluctant to
give them, raising concerns in Washington. Sen. David L.
Boren (D., Okla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said yesterday on ABC-TV's "This Week with David
Brinkley" that the Persian Gulf countries at risk "have to
give us forward basing rights, to put the air power and other
kinds of military forces physically into the region."
   The U.S. could fly in heavier aircraft, such as tankers,
transports and bombers, to a staging point in Oman. The
Pentagon has spent over $300 million preparing an airfield
there, however the Omani government must approve U.S. use
during a crisis.
   Mr. Hussein's tank columns, which have operated with
little air cover up to now, according to U.S. analysts, would
be extremely vulnerable to U.S. precision-guided weapons. If
the Iraqi dictator was tempted to use his missiles against
Saudi oil installations, the U.S. could retaliate with
heavier strikes against Iraqi targets, using FB-111's based
in the United Kingdom or B-52's from the U.S.
   Squadrons of U.S. fighters based in Europe also could be
ferried quickly into the Persian Gulf region, once permission
is given to use the Saudi bases. Some planners think the
combined U.S. and Saudi air forces could defeat Iraq's
Soviet-equipped air forces within a day or two, barring
political constraints that would force the U.S. to operate
from distant bases.
   The U.S. would probably move quickly into Saudi Arabia
some additional tactical radar equipment and operators, to
coordinate with American-made Airborne Warning and Control
System planes to monitor skies over Saudi Arabia and direct
Saudi and American fighter planes.
   Far more difficult than air or sea support, military
planners say, would be to quickly get any significant
American ground force into Saudi Arabia to defend against
Iraq's heavily armored ground troops. Former Defense
Secretary Harold Brown says that a contingent of Marines or
troops from the 82nd or 101st Airborne Divisions could be
flown in, perhaps in as little as one day, because they
travel lightly.
   "The trouble is that because they're light they wouldn't
do well against heavy forces," says Mr. Brown. And, he notes,
Iraq's Mr. Hussein "isn't Gen. Noriega," and his troops
wouldn't be as easy to repel as the Panamanian leader's
forces were. Though American and Saudi air forces have worked
closely together to plan and practice moves that would have
to be taken in a crisis, the U.S. doesn't have any experience
in moving significant ground forces to the kingdom.
   Military planners say the Saudis are confident, though,
that they have the ability-using fighter aircraft, helicopter
gunships and ground forces of their own -- to cut the two
main roads that lead from Kuwait down the Saudi coast to the
kingdom's giant Persian Gulf oil fields. If those roads were
cut, the tanks would be forced onto the desert to travel,
slowing them down and making them far easier targets for air
attack by the Saudi's American-made F5 and British-made
Tornado aircraft.
   One of the Iraqis' most inviting early targets would be an
industrial city the Saudis have built up through investment
of billions of dollars at Jubail, on the Persian Gulf coast.
But invading forces would have to move much further down the
gulf coast to reach the biggest Saudi oil fields and refining
facilities near Dhahran.

   Loss of National
   Intergroup Is
   $281.7 Million

   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. posted a $281.7
million loss for the fiscal first quarter ended June 30 as
gains in its wholesale drug distribution business failed to
offset expected losses from the sale of non-core operations.
   In the year-earlier quarter, National Intergroup earned
$13 million, or 53 cents a share. Revenue rose 16% to $666.8
million from $577.2 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dismal results are the latest bad news to hit the
company. Last month, National Intergroup lost three board
seats, including one held by Chairman Howard M. Love, in a
proxy battle to dissident shareholder Centaur Partners. While
still representing a minority on a 10-member board, Centaur
Partners wants to liquidate National Intergroup, which has
had seven consecutive years of operating losses.
   With the stock market already skittish about the
Iraq-Kuwait situation, the reported loss of $13.01 a share
sent National Intergroup stock tumbling even further. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday,
National Intergroup stock closed at $15.875 a share, down $1
a share.
   National Intergroup said earlier that it expected charges
from the sales of its Ben Franklin general merchandise chain
and Permian Partners L.P. oil operations, but it didn't
signal the extent of the write-off. The company created a
$239.5 million reserve to cover anticipated losses on the
sales of those operations, including $30.3 million in good
will relating to the Ben Franklin chain. The company also
recorded charges of $26.7 million to close its Pittsburgh
headquarters and $14.8 million relating to the sale of most
of its interest in National Steel to NKK Corp.
   Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher &amp; Singer, said
no one expected such large write-offs but added that most
reflect the discontinuation of losing operations and not an
actual cash loss.
   The company tried to put its best face forward, noting
that FoxMeyer Drug Co. posted a 40% rise in operating profit
and that National Intergroup should be profitable in the
second quarter. FoxMeyer, which is the only going operation,
earned $10 million on sales of $666.8 million, compared with
last year's $7.2 million on sales of $577.2 million.
   "Though the loss is significant, it clears the decks and
allows us to move forward with our plan to focus our
attention and resources on the drug distribution business,"
said Mr. Love. He contended that the sales will "enhance our
ability to reduce debt and pay a special dividend or buy back
stock."
   Centaur, which has questioned the company's commitment to
paying shareholder dividends, said it was disappointed in the
size of the write-offs. "We remain committed to a timely sale
of all of the assets of National Intergroup and distribution
of the proceeds to shareholders, as the best means to
maximize shareholder values," Centaur said.

   RICO Reform Risks
   Aiding S&amp;L Swindlers

   Current efforts to reform civil RICO, one of the nation's
most powerful anti-fraud laws, could well walk this country
into a darker chapter of the S&amp;L disaster. Nevertheless, it
was supported by L. Gordon Crovitz ("Two Cheers for This Bill
to Reform RICO," Rule of Law, June 27). "Anything to limit
RICO would help," he argued. Not quite, particularly if the
bill would retroactively deprive victims of the S&amp;L scandal
-- as well as other similar frauds -- of effective relief.
   In 1970, Congress enacted the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act. It prohibits patterns of
racketeering activity against various kinds of enterprises,
including savings-and-loan associations. Racketeering
activity, too, includes fraud -- specifically bank fraud. In
addition to criminal sanctions, RICO -- like the antitrust
statutes -- authorized for victims a treble-damages claim for
relief. Like antitrust laws that underwrite freedom in the
marketplace, civil RICO underwrites integrity in the
marketplace.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And now that those who clearly bear a major blame in the
S&amp;L crisis -- real-estate brokers who set up deals,
accountants who cooked the books and lawyers who papered
bogus transactions -- may be held accountable in civil
litigation, they have come to Congress to ask that they be
exempted, retroactively, from the treble-damages provisions
of the law. Notwithstanding a financial crisis of
unparalleled proportions, they make the argument that we need
weaker, not stronger, anti-fraud laws.
   At their urging, the RICO Amendments Act contains a
"gatekeeper" provision designed to winnow out inappropriate
civil litigation. The idea is fundamentally sound, but a
fight is fast developing in Congress over the size of the
gate. The lawyers, accountants and other professionals want
to narrow the gate to let pass through only "major
participants," which would be defined to include only the
"trigger men" of the fraud and to exclude those who only
"helped" pull the trigger -- the lawyers, accountants and
other professionals. In extolling reform at any price, Mr.
Crovitz did not tell his readers about this brewing fight,
and cheated readers out of the information needed to make up
their own minds about this important legislation.
   Our deepest legal traditions stand squarely against
changing the substance of legal rights retroactively.
Retroactive penal legislation violates the ex post facto
clause of the Constitution. Among the founders, Madison
argued eloquently against all retroactive legislation in the
Federalist Papers.
   RICO may be in need of rewriting as it applies in ordinary
commercial litigation, but it is not in need of such radical
surgery that would let off the swindlers -- and their lawyers
and accountants -- in the current thrift scandal. By making
the reform retroactive, we would be bailing out the Charles
Keatings and leaving their victims holding the bag, including
Mr. Keating's 23,000 bondholders, who were cheated out of
$200 million.

   Who's News:
   Tinker Gets Serious With a New TV Drama

   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- Grant Tinker's latest show, "WIOU,"
is a one-hour drama about a struggling Midwest TV station
that just can't seem to get anything right.
   The same might have been said about Grant Tinker Gannett,
or GTG Entertainment, the ill-fated joint venture between the
former chairman of the National Broadcasting Co. and Gannett
Co. That three-year partnership was terminated last March
after a series of programming failures, including a costly
syndicated version of the Gannett-owned national newspaper
USA Today, and prime-time series such as "TV 101" and
"Raising Miranda" for CBS and "Baywatch" for NBC. The shows
weren't liked by critics or viewers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, like the fictional TV station that will be depicted
in "WIOU" for CBS Inc.'s network, Mr. Tinker is poised to
begin again, this time without a company handing him a blank
check. He has yet to find another financial partner despite
hiring the investment-banking firm of Furman Selz Mager Dietz
&amp; Birney in January. New backers may well be leery; Gannett
spent more than $40 million in prime-time production costs,
more than another $45 million on "USA Today on TV," $24
million to buy the Culver City studios for the venture and
another $25 million in renovations.
   Mr. Tinker insists the need for a new backer "is not that
urgent," and "we're not as desperate as you might think." The
production of "WIOU," which will premiere this fall, is being
financed by Orion Television Entertainment, a unit of Orion
Pictures Corp. "Orion's development season didn't work as
well as they might have hoped, so they're a willing partner,"
says Mr. Tinker. Orion has three series on the 1990-91
network prime-time schedule; the other two are "Lifestories"
on NBC and "Equal Justice" on ABC.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Tinker's difficulty in jump-starting his
career as a supplier of TV shows underscores the fickle
nature of the broadcasting business. While he was chairman of
NBC in the early 1980s, Mr. Tinker turned around the
third-place network, focusing on high-quality shows such as
"Cheers" and "Hill Street Blues." Before joining NBC, Mr.
Tinker had built one of the most respected small programming
suppliers, MTM Entertainment, which produced "The Mary Tyler
Moore Show" and "The Bob Newhart Show."
   With such past successes under his belt, Mr. Tinker seemed
like a sure bet for Gannett, which had been anxious to enter
the television-production business. But three of Mr. Tinker's
first offerings never made it past their initial production
orders from CBS, and NBC canceled "Baywatch" after one
season. Other projects, including a situation comedy about
two bakers and another about an alien visiting Earth, didn't
make it past the pilots.
   In part, Mr. Tinker appears to be a victim of changing
tastes and expectations among viewers, who have come to
expect the unexpected, whether it's the oddball nature of
"Twin Peaks," or the off-kilter animated family, "The
Simpsons." So, Mr. Tinker is eschewing his trademark
touchy-feely situation comedies, and betting instead on a
hard-edged office drama, the first project of the new GTG --
which no longer stands for Grant Tinker Gannett, but now
conveniently stands for Grant Tinker Group. Notes Mr. Tinker,
"It saves on new stationery and business cards."
   Mr. Tinker, 64 years old and looking fit, trim and
relaxed, says he doesn't quite understand all the attention
placed on his start-up attempts. "You get tired of people
taking hits on you for things that didn't work," he says
evenly. "Sure, I'm disappointed the Gannett venture turned
out as it did. It was a disappointment. But it takes a while
to get up to speed."
   Other network bosses have tried to make the transition
into programming with mixed results, and success often takes
years. Fred Silverman, Mr. Tinker's predecessor at NBC,
failed as an independent producer for four years in the early
1980's, but finally struck pay dirt with a
made-for-television film based on the vintage TV character
Perry Mason. He is now one of the most successful independent
producers for television with four one-hour dramas,
"Matlock," "Heat of the Night," "Father Dowling Mysteries"
and "Jake and the Fatman," spread over the three major
broadcast networks. He also has an animated series, "The
Pigsburg Pigs," for News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co.'s
Saturday morning lineup this fall.
   "Grant Tinker has nothing to prove to anybody," says Mr.
Silverman. "I had huge flops when I first started." He cited
as examples "Thicke of the Night," a syndicated talk show
with Alan Thicke that disappeared shortly after its premiere,
and a situation comedy, "We Got It Made." "That failed
twice," he says. "Once on network, once in syndication. In
television production, you can be a hero one day and a bum
the next day."
   But Mr. Tinker's snail's pace surprises even some
supporters. "I would have expected more Grant Tinker shows on
the air by now," says Warren Littlefield, president of NBC
Entertainment. "Grant's the first to admit he's made
mistakes, and he's certainly someone I'd bet on for future
success."
   Mr. Tinker has hired some younger executives, notably the
creators of "WIOU," Kathryn Pratt, 38, and John Eisendrath,
31, both novices to prime-time television. Both, however, are
veterans of TV newsrooms, having worked at WBBM, the
CBS-owned station in Chicago, where Ms. Pratt was an on-air
health reporter and Mr. Eisendrath was a writer-producer.
They joined GTG and worked as story editors on "TV 101,"
which depicted a high school TV-production class.
   "They're writing about what they know about," says Mr.
Tinker. "We're going back to what we did at MTM. We always
believed in letting writers do what they want to do."
   Initial reaction to "WIOU" is positive. Tom Shales, the
Washington Post's influential TV critic, wrote that the show
"is certain to restore luster to" Mr. Tinker. He described
"WIOU" as a "high-gloss, quality show with a fresh, flashy
cast . . . a snappy, crackling, richly entertaining hour in
the tradition of `L.A. Law.'"
   Mr. Tinker is creating and producing "WIOU" even though,
he says, "doing dramatic shows for TV isn't much of a
business right now." One-hour dramas aren't selling well in
the syndicated market, as opposed to half-hour comedies. It
is in syndication where production companies make their
money. Studios sell their shows to networks for less money
than it costs to produce them in the hopes of making a
financial killing in syndication.
   Sitting with his feet up on a coffee table, shoes off
revealing pale pink socks, Mr. Tinker says, "You know, it's
funny. At MTM, we had four, five shows going at once. Here,
we have only one." But he adds, "that's how I want it now.
Slowly start over. First get one on the air and have it
stick, then another, and then another. We'll be fine."

   That when there's a lull,
   It's hard not to notice or mention
   That eyelids are lifting
   On those who were drifting,
   And everyone snaps to attention.

   Regarding Henry Grunwald's June 26 editorial-page article,
"A Backward Glance From the Animal-Rights Future": Mr.
Grunwald's is a fictional tale from a future in which the
"animal-rights" people have had their way. In this future
world the self-proclaimed former "masters of the earth"
(humans) have lost their almighty power to look upon the
planet as a banquet set out for them exclusively to use,
abuse, consume, pollute and kill, as they see fit.
   According to Mr. Grunwald, the ability of the human race
to destroy animals and the environment is the basis of human
intelligence. Funny, I always thought human intelligence was
something quite different. To me, the truly intelligent
realize the interconnectedness of all life, respect all life,
consider the possible consequences of their actions, and make
use of a gift given to most of us -- a conscience -- before
acting.

   To destroy the environment is wrong, and we are paying the
price in increasing violent crime, immorality and diseases
such as cancer, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular
dystrophy, diabetes, AIDS, leukemia, lupus, etc., etc. Then
we think we can solve those problems by further destruction
of animals in experiments. True health is not drugs and
technology; true health is exactly what the term implies, and
animal experimentation has no place in it.
   Respect for animals and the environment is the only hope
for a bright future for the human race.

   Mr. Grunwald's article uses off-color remarks about
animal-rights activists. I'm surprised you would print
something that would so obviously offend those of us who
believe that causing pain and suffering to animals is wrong.
Animal rights is a very sensitive issue to those of us
civilized enough to realize that treating animals in an
inhumane manner is simply wrong.
   Finally, I'm surprised Mr. Grunwald actually went to the
time and expense to have his terrier diagnosed (as neurotic);
wouldn't it be easier to just kill it?

   Mr. Grunwald, through humor and satire, makes an excellent
point: Animal-rights activists, in their zealous approach to
protect their "constituency," are losing touch with reality.
   One example of how they have become blind to any sort of
acceptable reasoning is on the issue of scientific
experimentation using animals. Science, by using animals as
experimental subjects, has made much progress toward curing
diseases that kill millions of people every year. There would
be no other way to test such drugs and procedures. And most
of the animals used are mice or other animals that are not
endangered species.
   I would propose to the animal-rightists a market solution:
All those opposed to scientific experimentation on animals
should not purchase any drug or related outcome of this kind
of research. Soon, if animal-rightists were the majority
among us, these drugs or medical procedures would not sell
and investment in research using animals would cease.
   But if the majority were composed of people who believe a
human life is worth much more than the life of a lab animal,
then we would continue to use the results of medical research
using animals -- and, it is hoped, we would be able to cure
diseases that are still killing millions every year.

   Maybe Saddam Hussein has done the world a favor. The Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait is the first major act of aggression in
the post-Cold War era. We may well be getting a first look at
how nations define their interests in the new world order,
and what it may portend for piracy and terrorism.
   It is of course too early for anything but the most
tentative suggestions. The political air in the Middle East
is even more volatile than usual. Mr. Hussein may have more
surprises in store. There is little prospect that his booty
can be quickly recovered, even if promised troop withdrawals
materialize. Still, we are somehow impressed that world
reaction in the immediate aftermath of the invasion was
remarkably positive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far at least, few nations are hiding behind the sort of
craven silence or diplomatic mush -- speak that used to
attend these events. The condemnation of Iraq has been wide,
and many nations appeared eager to participate in the
economic punishment of Iraq.
   The United States, Great Britain and most major nations
moved quickly to freeze Kuwaiti assets lest they be
transferred to Iraq. The U.S. and the European Community
banned the import of Iraqi oil, and Japan has now joined.
Italy and France suspended arms shipments to Iraq, and now
China has done the same. The French and British governments
have sent warships into the Gulf to join the U.S. fleet.
   The vote in the U.N. Security Council to condemn Iraq was
14-0, with only Yemen abstaining. Finland, Romania, Ethiopia,
Malaysia, Zaire and even Cuba voted to condemn. Condemnation
statements also were issued by the governments of Austria,
Czechoslovakia, Venezuela, Mexico, Algeria and Poland. The
Arab league was divided, but Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon and (at
least rhetorically) Iran joined the condemnation. Most
telling of all, the Soviet Union announced it would cut off
arms supplies to Iraq.
   We understand that words are cheap, and yield to none in
our cynicism about so-called world opinion. Yet it's striking
that Col. Gadhafi's Libya was alone in what once would have
been a widespread stance, warning that any foreign
intervention would be regarded as "an aggressive act." Has
something changed?
   We suspect it has, and that the West and the U.S. in
particular should recognize the opportunities it opens. The
reaction to the Iraqi aggression is different because the
Soviet factor in the geopolitical equation is radically
different than it's been the past 40 years. During the entire
Cold War period, one of the chief worries of governments was
that any regional dispute would almost surely involve the
competing interests of the U.S. and Soviet Union, and thus
had the potential of escalating to the nuclear level.
Similarly, the Soviet Union's more bellicose clients -- Iraq,
Syria, North Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba, Arab terrorists --
fully exploited this grim assumption. Don't push too hard,
was the message, or the Soviet bear will rise up on its hind
legs.
   Well, the Soviet bear is flat on its back, more in need of
Western economic support than it is of Saddam Hussein's
not-very-reliable cash payments for Soviet arms. The Soviets
are preoccupied with problems at home, not interested in
expanding their costly empire, and not in a mood to be
manipulated by one-time regional allies. We are hardly
suggesting that the Soviet military machine has evaporated
into the mists, but surely the world's leaders can recognize
that there has been some marginal, significant improvement in
the nuclear threshold. In regional conflicts, there is now
more freedom to maneuver.
   While the world reaction will not put Saddam Hussein back
in his lair, it opens opportunities for leadership to that
purpose. Perhaps this time the French government might allow
American F-111s to overfly its territory. With President Bush
raising the possibility of stopping Iraqi oil exports by
shutting down the oil pipeline through Turkey, this would be
a good time for NATO to reiterate that an attack on Turkey
would be an attack on a NATO nation and by treaty an attack
on all.
   The favorable world reaction presumably sets a climate for
consultation and concerted action. In recent years
consultation has become a recipe for inaction, while
unilateral U.S. reaction has been a cause of Western
disunity. Perhaps this has changed, but the United States has
to recognize that it still bears the main responsibility for
leadership. We don't see West Germany, the much-lauded new
leader, volunteering to handle the Bully of Baghdad.
   Our hopes here may be overly optimistic. Probably Saddam
Hussein will make off with Kuwait, teaching the lesson that
piracy works. Still, we must stare directly at the reality of
a world that has before it a future of increased political
and economic interdependency. The global market of the future
won't work well unless its participants can at least
recognize that they have common interests. Some instinctive
lurch toward this recognition seems to be taking place around
Saddam Hussein's threat to the world's oil supply.
   The Iraqi problem is far from over, but Western and
especially American diplomacy ought to test the depth of the
apparent consensus, seeing whether it will support still
stronger actions. It's an early test of whether the
international community will do what's necessary to ensure
that the emerging world order remains orderly.

   Japan and the European Community nations, which in
previous years hesitated to support U.S. initiatives in the
Middle East, made strong commitments to Washington's call for
economic sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
   Japan, which took a heavy economic gamble to do so, said
late Sunday it would ban all oil imports from Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, halt all exports to the two states and
freeze economic aid to Baghdad. Not only does Japan import
12% of its oil from Iraq and Kuwait, but it also has 700
billion yen ($4.67 billion) in loans outstanding to Baghdad,
which are now at risk.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And in what is being called the strongest punitive action
ever taken by the European Community, the 12-nation bloc
agreed Saturday to impose a series of tough sanctions aimed
at "the heart" of Iraqi economic and military interests. The
sanctions include an oil embargo on Iraq and Kuwait, a halt
on military sales to Iraq and suspension of cooperation with
Iraq in military, technical and scientific fields.
   The strength of the EC measures and the unanimity were in
marked contrast to past crises, when the EC members have been
divided over whether to impose sanctions and how strong they
should be. During the U.S.-hostage taking in Iran, for
example, trade sanctions imposed by the EC fell short of U.S.
expectations. There have also been differences among the
member nations on policy toward Libya.
   The EC imports 10.9% of its oil from Iraq and Kuwait, and
an oil embargo could hurt some EC members such as Denmark,
which depends on Iraq and Kuwait for more than half of its
oil.
   The EC members said they were also prepared to support and
enforce United Nations sanctions against Iraq if Baghdad
failed to heed calls for the immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of its troops from Kuwait. (Members of the U.N.
Security Council met informally yesterday, and the U.S. urged
the imposition of broad economic and military sanctions on
Iraq. Diplomats expect the measures to be adopted, perhaps as
early as today.)
   "We will not be satisfied until there is not a single
Iraqi soldier in Kuwait and until there is a legitimate and
sovereign government in Kuwait," Italian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Giovanni Castellaneta said.
   In a speech yesterday in Aspen, Colo., British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Iraqi invasion and
called for a "total economic embargo" against Iraq unless it
withdraws from Kuwait "without delay." She added: "The U.S.
and Europe both support this. But to be totally effective it
will need the support of all U.N. members. They must stand up
and be counted because a vital principle is at stake: An
aggressor must never be allowed to get his way." Mrs.
Thatcher is expected to meet with President Bush in
Washington today.
   In opting to impose an oil embargo, Japan departed from
its usual oil-first policy. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
overrode the opposition of the powerful Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, which feared a long-term
impact on Japan's economy. In 1979, Tokyo refused to follow
suit when the U.S. and Western Europe imposed an oil embargo
on Iran after Tehran took Americans hostage at the U.S.
Embassy.
   "It is the very first time for Japan to take such a
drastic move before the U.N. has decided anything on
sanctions," a Foreign Ministry official who requested
anonymity told Japan's Kyodo news service.
   This time, the decision was clearly in favor of
international solidarity. "Japan will face hardships due to
the ban on oil imports, but this is a bold start in
international cooperation," said Deputy Chief Cabinet
Secretary Nobuo Ishihara. Although Japan imports 99% of its
oil, it has almost five months' supply in reserve against any
oil cutoff.
   The new Iraqi-installed government in Kuwait, meanwhile,
has warned countries with nationals in Kuwait not to take
sanctions against it or Iraq. Well over one million
foreigners work in Kuwait, among them thousands of Westerners
and Japanese with senior positions in banks and the oil
industry, and a substantial group of Western military
advisers.
   "These countries should also not expect us to act
honorably at a time when they are conspiring against us and
other brothers in Iraq in an aggressive way," Iraqi-imposed
Foreign Minister Walid Saud Muammad Abdullah said on Iraqi
radio.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and French President
Francois Mitterrand, meanwhile, discussed the invasion by
telephone Saturday, Soviet news media reported. They
exchanged views, assessed the situation as serious and agreed
to continue contacts, according to the Tass news agency and
Radio Moscow.
   Mr. Mitterrand discussed a punitive blockade of Iraq with
key cabinet members on Saturday, Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas said. Mr. Dumas said a blockade and military action
were considered in response to the invasion. A blockade "was
examined with all the country's service heads, notably the
military," Mr. Dumas said in answer to a reporter's question.
He didn't specify if this referred to a naval blockade, and
said a blockade was a measure that had to be taken in concert
with all major powers.
   In an apparent rebuff to Iraqi efforts to stop at least
part of the embargo, Turkish President Turgut Ozal yesterday
declined to guarantee that Iraq's vital trans-Turkey pipeline
will be safe from international economic sanctions, according
to a Turkish individual close to the talks. Iraq sent a top
official to Ankara yesterday to confer with Mr. Ozal, but
"President Ozal was noncommittal about the pipeline," the
individual said.
   More than half of Iraq's oil exports are pumped through
the pipeline from the Kirkuk oil fields to the Mediterranean
coast. On leaving Ankara, the Iraqi official appealed to
Turkey to "take their joint interests into account" and not
to create an "atmosphere of distrust" by cutting the vital
artery. Iraq earns almost all of its foreign exchange from
oil.
   Foreign diplomats think it unlikely that Turkey will close
the pipeline but note a hardening of the Turkish position on
the Iraq-Kuwait crisis, despite its important ties with
Baghdad. In public statements, Turkey has called only for the
implementation of the U.N. resolution calling for Iraq's
withdrawal. But Mr. Ozal's spokesman said the Turkish
president had demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from
Kuwait and the restoration of the deposed Emir of Kuwait.
   President Bush has called Mr. Ozal twice so far to discuss
the crisis and Mr. Ozal has been conducting intense telephone
diplomacy in the region, but Turkish and U.S. officials say
there has been no direct U.S. pressure on Turkey to cut the
pipeline.
   Meanwhile, the prospect of higher oil prices is unraveling
the silver lining in Britain's bleak economy and further
clouding the already faltering United Kingdom stock market.
Inflation, which was expected to be capped at around 10.5%
this month, now is expected to keep rising. And any cut in
Britain's 15% base interest rate probably won't come until
early 1991 instead of occurring later this year, analysts and
economists predict.
   Until last week, many U.K. fund managers and other market
experts were predicting a lagging stock market through year
end, followed by a sharp recovery spurred by expected
interest rate cuts.
   But that timetable now may have to be revised. The market
impact of the gulf crisis is likely to be adverse, sharp and
broadly based, analysts say. With the obvious exception of
defense and oil stocks, shares of industrial and
consumer-oriented companies -- many of which were already
reeling before last week -- are expected to come under
greater pressure.
   The West Germans have special reason to worry about
another oil crisis. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has pledged not to
boost taxes to pay for his unification plan. This means that
Bonn is borrowing money on international credit markets and
would feel the direct impact of higher interest rates
prompted by a global economic downturn.
   But West German officials insist that the country is
well-positioned to deal with whatever comes out of the
current crisis. They point out that West Germany's strong
economy and large trade surplus give them at least a partial
buffer against events beyond their control.
   The 12 EC nations didn't cut diplomatic relations or
withdraw their ambassadors from Iraq because that would make
it impractical to defend their citizens in the area. In a
written statement, the EC countries described as "groundless
and unacceptable" Iraq's justification for the military
action. They said they would do everything they could to
avoid an implicit recognition of the so-called provisional
government installed in Kuwait.
   The Soviet Union, following the invasion, demanded that
Iraqi troops withdraw from Kuwait, and it cut off arms
supplies to Baghdad. Soviet officials and the state-run press
have unanimously condemned the action. Straight news reports
on the invasion have dominated newspapers, television and
radio. Saturday, several papers described Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein as a dictator and a liar and said the invasion
was a crime.
   Such coverage marks a radical reversal of decades of
silence during which Soviet officials and journalists
wouldn't criticize any close ally. The Soviet Union has been
Iraq's main source of weapons for 30 years and has a
friendship and cooperation treaty with Baghdad.
   Indeed, the attack has provoked unprecedented cooperation
between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which issued a joint
appeal for a world ban on arms shipments to Iraq. That had
led to speculation that China, believed to be the
third-largest supplier of arms to Iraq after the Soviet Union
and France, would fill the breach as Paris and Moscow stemmed
the flow of their arms to Baghdad.
   But Sunday, China announced after two days of talks with a
special U.S. envoy that it wouldn't sell weapons to Iraq.
   Senior Chinese officials wouldn't, however, commit
themselves to supporting wider economic sanctions against
Baghdad.

   Times Mirror Enters Hispanic Market
   With Pact to Buy 50% of La Opinion

   LOS ANGELES -- Times Mirror Co.'s agreement to purchase
50% of Los Angeles-based La Opinion, the nation's largest
Spanish-language daily newspaper, is a strategy to tap the
fast-growing Hispanic market, one of the few growth areas
open to newspapers.
   "It makes a lot of sense for Times Mirror to buy a stake
in this market," said Paul Marsh, an analyst for Bateman
Eichler Hill Richards Inc., a Los Angeles brokerage firm.
"It's one of the few newspaper revenue expansions left -- a
way to tap the Hispanic advertising dollar."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror's agreement is "a way of getting into the
Hispanic marketplace with a great deal of speed," said Kevin
R. Gruneich, analyst for First Boston Corp. "They could have
started up their own Spanish-language daily but that could
have bruised their audience's feelings and taken longer. They
could have looked like outsiders coming in to steal the
Hispanic market. This way, they are going through the
backdoor and ringing the doorbell on the way."
   Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times and other
newspapers, didn't disclose what it paid for the stake. Jose
I. Lozano, president of La Opinion, said that the Times
Mirror investment won't change the newspaper's editorial
content, management or Spanish-language format. The two
companies negotiated for about two years before reaching the
agreement, he said.
   Times Mirror and La Opinion will form a new California
limited partnership, and La Opinion's current five board
members will be joined by four Times Mirror nominees on the
board.
   "The infusion of capital will allow us to develop a number
of different plans, including expanding home delivery, market
research and infrastructure," Mr. Lozano said. The
newspaper's goal is to increase its daily circulation to
175,000 by 1995 from its current circulation of 101,300,
nearly all of which is newsstand sales.
   Mr. Lozano said he is considering other steps, such as
opening news bureaus outside the Los Angeles area, including
Latin America. He also hopes to improve the newspaper's news
analysis and expand its news staff beyond its current 60
members, he said.
   La Opinion is owned by the Lozano family, with Ignacio
Lozano Jr. serving as its chairman and editor-in-chief. With
the recent influx of immigrants from Central America and
Latin America into the Los Angeles area, La Opinion has been
attempting to broaden its audience by expanding its coverage
of those countries' communities.
   About four million Hispanics live in the five-county Los
Angeles region, and about 800,000 households identify
themselves as Spanish-language dominant, Mr. Lozano said.
Unlike many English-language dailies, which have suffered
declines in readership in recent years, several
Spanish-language publications have expanded their readership
in areas such as Los Angeles, Miami and New York. According
to Times projections, Southern California's Hispanic
population will swell from about 29% of the region's
population to 40% by 2010.
   The Miami Herald, a Knight-Ridder Inc. newspaper, was
among the first to approach the Spanish-language market with
a supplement in 1976. That supplement, now known as El Nuevo
Herald, has been expanded and refined into a daily section
that has helped the Miami Herald expand circulation and raise
its profile in the regional Hispanic community.
   Hispanics in the U.S. tend to be younger than the
population as a whole, and expanding Spanish-language
publications may encourage future readership in either
language. "Studies show the key predictor of newspaper
readership is the presence of a newspaper in the home," said
Felix Gutierrez, vice president of the Gannett Foundation and
an authority on Spanish-language media. "If these people are
reading newspapers in Spanish, their kids and grandkids will
become acquainted with it."
   Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive officer of
Times Mirror, said the company will continue to publish its
bilingual supplement, Nuestro Tiempo, which is distributed 15
times a year in heavily Hispanic communities. If approved by
antitrust regulators, the transaction is expected to close in
September, Mr. Lozano said.

   Bank of New England's 2nd-Period Loss
   Increases Pressure to Raise New Capital

   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp.'s report of a
second-quarter loss -- despite a one-time windfall --
increases the odds that it will have to seek new capital and
may be sold outright.
   The bank reported a quarterly loss of $33.3 million, or 49
cents a share, despite one-time gains of $91 million from the
sale of assets and the successful launching of many programs
in its recovery plan. A year earlier, it reported net income
of $37 million, or 52 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, the bank didn't show any improvement in its
precariously low capital ratio.
   "We're fighting a great fight," said Lawrence K. Fish,
chairman, who was hired to rescue the bank in March. "The
things we're doing are the right things. But we need time."
He added that the success of the moves depends on "the
economy and factors outside of our control."
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, the bank's common closed at $2.625, unchanged, on
volume of 346,600 shares.
   Bank of New England, with $23.07 billion in assets, is one
of the nation's 30 biggest banks. It is trying to survive in
the wake of huge losses caused by helter-skelter expansion
and loosely monitored lending practices during New England's
1980s boom.
   One analyst calls Mr. Fish's survival moves -- selling off
assets, improving liquidity and revamping credit policies --
"a case study in how to rescue a bank." But, "in its core
operations, the bank is continuing to lose money," says Don
Kauth, a regional bank analyst with First Albany Corp. "With
their capital levels what they are, they simply can't afford
to lose any more."
   The most merciless number on the bank's balance sheet is
nonperforming assets, which climbed from $2.2 billion on Dec.
31 to $2.67 billion at the first quarter's end, and rose $110
million in the second quarter to $2.78 billion. Mr. Fish
termed them "the gorilla on our books."
   Nonperforming assets continue to drain bank earnings until
they can be sold off. "You have to take a step back and
realize they still have to pay interest to customers who
deposited all that money. . . . so every interest payment {to
depositors} becomes a loss," says Gerard Cassidy, an analyst
with Tucker Anthony.
   Bank officials estimate that carrying the nonperforming
assets costs it $250 million a year. That cost hinders
efforts to improve its meager 1.65% capital ratio, a measure
of bank health that regulators monitor closely.
   Last March, federal regulators ordered the bank to boost
its capital ratio to 3% by May 31. Most banks are expected to
have at least a 6% capital ratio.
   Bank of New England hasn't been able to meet that
requirement despite a large reduction in assets and a
one-time windfall from sale of its leasing company,
commercial loan offices and custody business in the second
quarter. The bank needs at least $300 million in fresh
capital to meet its capital-ratio requirements.
   Analysts speculate that the bank will have to seek
capital, possibly overseas. Mr. Fish confirmed that he
recently went to Japan but declined to elaborate. He added:
"We will do whatever we need to do, as promptly as possible"
to address the capital situation.
   Leo R. Breitman, the bank's vice chairman and chief credit
officer, conceded that "we haven't yet found the last bad
loan on our books." The bank is foreclosing on a growing
number of the nonperforming loans. To sell them, the bank has
begun looking to institutional investors and foreign buyers.
   One of its largest foreclosed properties, a 1,000-acre
Cape Cod development with a golf course, country club and
luxury homes, has drawn substantial foreign interest, says
Mr. Breitman. "Of course, they want the golf course, but not
the homes," he says, adding: "Residential real estate up here
is tough to sell."
   "All real estate in New England is tough to sell," adds
Tucker Anthony's Mr. Cassidy. "Land values are falling,
people are losing jobs and it doesn't look like it will get
better anytime soon."
   Meanwhile, Mr. Fish says, the bank is vigorously attacking
the "areas it can control."
   The bank's credit policies have tightened markedly under
Mr. Fish and a group of managers he has hired from outside
who meet once a week to handle the bank's 50 largest problem
loans.
   Liquidity, as well, has improved. The bank has not tapped
the Federal Reserve for funds in six weeks and doesn't expect
to do so anytime soon. In case of a liquidity problem, the
bank, in a shrewd move, has begun discussions aimed at
becoming a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, where
terms for borrowing by banks are somewhat easier. The bank's
improved cash position is largely attributable to its robust
retail banking program, which brought in more than $1 billion
in certificates of deposit in the second quarter.
   However, the CDs, some paying almost 9% interest, are
among the highest yielding CDs in the country, says Robert K.
Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach,
Fla., monitoring service.
   Such expensive products are squeezing the bank's net
interest margin, which fell 0.23% in the second quarter to
2.31%. Now that liquidity has improved, a priority in the
currrent quarter, according to Mr. Fish, will be to reduce
expenses in the bank's retail and commercial areas, which
will form the core of its future business.
   "Commercial loans will continue to be the bank's bread and
butter, especially among midsized companies of between $2
million and $100 million" in revenue, says Mr. Breitman. The
commercial loan portfolio shrunk in the second quarter by
$2.1 billion, largely from the selling off of profitable
communications loans and repayments by clients who have moved
to other banks. But, the bank added about $500 million in new
commercial loans.
   While Mr. Fish notes that less than 2% of the bank's
customers have left, many of the defections are among large
commercial accounts and holders of CDs worth $100,000 or
more.
   "The fellow we used to work with at the bank left; his
boss left, his boss's boss left and his boss's boss's boss
was fired," says John Bartlett, chief financial officer of
Unifirst Corp., a Woburn, Mass.-based uniform manufacturer
and leaser with about $200 million in annual revenue. Mr.
Bartlett said he pulled the company's $8 million in CDs from
the bank and is now looking to move a $12 million line of
credit as well. "This is a business of continuing
relationships and we really don't know anyone there anymore,"
he added.
   The process of shrinking the bank from last year's $31.5
billion in assets to its current $23.1 billion, has meant the
departure of as many as half the original officers corps,
according to estimates by current and former executives.
   Among those who remain, morale is generally high, largely
due to Mr. Fish's tireless cheerleading. He says he spends
part of each day calling branch managers and loyal bank
clients with "telephone hugs," and regularly sends employees
baskets of candy and notes of encouragement.
   But the bank's uncertain prospects are causing good
feelings to fray even among the faithful.
   "We're getting a little tired of Larry saying `This is the
best job he's ever had,'" said one bank manager after a
meeting with Mr. Fish and other top officers last week. "This
is the worst job some of us ever had. Cheerleading is fine,
but, in here, some of us are worried about the future."

   SEOUL -- South Korea's latest moves to ease regulations on
share ownership -- which are designed to stimulate the
sagging stock market -- are expected to prompt takeover
attempts by corporate raiders, according to industry
officials.
   The Korean Securities and Exchange Commission decided last
week to lift a rule prohibiting minor shareholders from
increasing stakes in listed companies to more than 10%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The securities regulation agency also chose to lift a
restriction on major shareholders' stock purchases, allowing
them to hold as much as 51% stakes, to protect their
management rights.
   The government aims to expand new demand and boost a
sluggish market, which has undergone 17 months of
bearishness. The new rules require commission approval for
purchases beyond former limits, but that approval will come
easily, commission officials said.
   The new measure makes it easier for corporate raiders to
take over listed firms, says Hong Jin-Ki, an analyst at
Daishin Securities Co. By accumulating stock, or allying with
other shareholders, minor shareholders can increase their
stakes and outweigh major shareholders, he says. On the other
hand, major shareholders will try to enhance their ownership
to protect their management rights, he notes.
   The rule was announced Wednesday and went into effect
immediately. Since then, investors have placed heavy emphasis
on small-capital and medium-capital shares, which are easy
targets for takeover attempts.
   On Wednesday, small-capital shares with capital of less
than 5 billion won (US$6.9 million) rose 2.4% in their index
value, compared with a 1.8% gain for large-capital shares
with more than 15 billion won of capital.
   On Thursday, that difference widened. Small-capital shares
rose a further 1.7% and middle-capital shares 1.2%, while
large-capital shares fell 0.4%.
   Major shareholders of smaller firms are buying back shares
to protect management rights, says Kim Chong-Dae, general
manager at Tongyang Securities Co. Mr. Kim doesn't detect any
takeover attempts for small firms currently, but he expects a
lot of such attempts in the near future.
   Analysts say the new measure will greatly stimulate
lackluster merger and acquisition activity. While there have
been friendly takeovers in South Korea before, there has
never been a hostile takeover before, partly because of
regulations on shareholdings and partly for cultural reasons,
says a foreign broker.
   The average ownership of major shareholders in local
listed firms is estimated at about 25%, down from about 30%
at the time of original listing, Tongyang's Mr. Kim says. If
all major holders were to bring their stakes back to 30%
through stock buy-backs, about 4 trillion won would be
funneled into the stock market, he adds.

   Ogilvy Maps Eastern European Expansion

   With a pack of U.S. ad agencies jockeying for position in
Eastern Europe, Ogilvy &amp; Mather is to name an executive to
spearhead the agency's ambitious expansion plan in the
region.
   Ogilvy is expected to announce today the appointment of
Wolfgang Slupetsky, currently head of its Austrian office, to
oversee the expansion. Mr. Slupetsky also will oversee
Ogilvy's fledgling offices in Budapest and Moscow. Ogilvy, a
unit of WPP Group of London, opened an agency in East Berlin
last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Brody, Ogilvy's head of international operations
and a man not known for taking things slowly, says Ogilvy
initially had planned to enter the rest of Eastern Europe
over a 10-year period. But with the political upheaval
transforming the region, "that has narrowed itself down to
the next two or three years," he says. "There is a sense of
urgency in getting there. Eastern Europe doesn't need all the
leading 50 agencies from abroad."
   Mr. Brody says his immediate goal is to establish
footholds in Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Poland.
Czechoslovakia makes the list, he says, because it has
industry and a middle class. Yugoslavia is intriguing
because, despite a poor economy, it traditionally has had
more freedom than the rest of the Eastern Bloc. And Poland,
while in terrible economic straits, is the largest and
potentially most important of the countries.
   Ogilvy faces stiff competition in the race to expand,
though. Several ad agencies are already setting up shop in
some of those countries. Archrival Young &amp; Rubicam, which
already has operations in Moscow and Budapest, expects to
announce this week a joint venture in Czechoslovakia. It
plans to look at East Germany next, a spokesman says.
   Omnicom's BBDO unit, which earlier this year entered into
a joint venture in the Soviet Union, is in the final stages
of a move into Yugoslavia, says Bruce Crawford, Omnicom's
chairman. The company's DDB Needham agency unit is nearing an
agreement to enter Hungary, he says. "We look at Hungary and
Czechoslovakia as near-term, 1990-1991" prospects, Mr.
Crawford says. "It's what everybody is doing. All the major
people are looking at these markets."
   The Hungarian-born Mr. Brody, who before joining Ogilvy
had spearheaded international expansion for rival Young &amp;
Rubicam, has a reputation in the industry for wanting to
plant flags everywhere -- to leave his mark by expanding
first, fastest, in the most places.
   "It isn't who's first; it's landing on your feet," says
Omnicom's Mr. Crawford, who advocates a more cautious
approach and who, for example, has no immediate plans to
pursue Poland or some other Eastern Bloc countries.
   But Mr. Brody insists that "we aren't going in for ego
value. If our clients need us, we're there. If they don't,
there isn't much sense in being there."
   Mr. Brody says he created the new Eastern European
position because entering those countries requires a far
different approach than before liberalization. When ad
agencies entered Eastern Europe before the liberalization,
Mr. Brody says, they had little choice in creating ventures.
They couldn't own or buy companies, so they had to settle for
an alliance with one of a handful of government-owned ad
agencies. "Your partners were prescribed by law," he says.
Now, scores of independent marketing companies are springing
up, started by entrepreneurs and free of government
intervention.
   "Now we have an embarrassment of -- I won't call it riches
because none of these people are very well versed in
marketing -- but at least we have a choice," Mr. Brody says.
In East Germany, for example, rather than joining with one of
the state-owned agencies, Ogilvy set up a new ad agency using
local talent. Among the principals: a former professor and an
economist who had been financial director of a furniture
company.
   As Ogilvy attempts its expansion, it must grapple with a
problem faced by all major ad agencies: whether to move in on
new turf before or after big clients need the agency to be
there. Most big agencies take the cautious route, fearful of
setting up unprofitable offices with no major clients. Ogilvy
tends to be slightly more pro-active. "We're going in
response to moves that we see our clients making," Mr. Brody
says, "but we don't wait for them to knock and the door and
say, `Hey, Ogilvy, it would be nice if you were here.'"
   But he adds that some Ogilvy clients have already beaten
the ad agency into Poland and Czechoslovakia, and others are
expanding in other Eastern European countries. He notes
Ogilvy's fledgling Budapest office already includes such
clients as Shell, American Express and Mattel.

   Law -- Washington Docket:
   Bush's Plan to Prosecute Antitrust Cases
   Could Fail Because of Reaganite Judges

   WASHINGTON -- Fans of old-time aggressive regulation of
corporate mergers celebrated the Bush administration's early
declarations that the antitrust cops were back on the beat.
   In carefully orchestrated speeches, Bush officials have
stressed that the strident pro-merger ideology of the Reagan
era has ended. Justice Department investigations of alleged
pricing conspiracies in the airline industry, among other
businesses, suggest the administration's intention to get
tough -- or at least tougher than its predecessor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But free-market rumblings from two influential federal
appeals courts may foreshadow hard times for antitrust
enforcers who back their rhetoric by bringing lawsuits. In
unusually harsh opinions, three-judge panels from the Ninth
Circuit court in San Francisco and the Washington, D.C.,
Circuit court have recently rejected Justice Department
attempts to stop mergers.
   Legal scholars observe that Reaganite hostility to the
very idea of merger enforcement has become increasingly
fashionable among sitting federal judges, roughly half of
whom the former president appointed. Judge Alex Kozinski, a
Reagan appointee writing for the Ninth Circuit in a movie
theater-merger case decided in May, said, "The market has its
own fail-safe mechanisms. . . . More fundamentally, in a free
economy the market itself imposes a tough enough discipline
on all market actors, large and small."
   Were this true, notes Prof. Stephen Calkins of Wayne State
University Law School, no mergers should ever be challenged
by the government.
   Judge Clarence Thomas, a Bush appointee who served in the
Reagan administration, last month scolded senior antitrust
prosecutors as if they were ill-prepared law students.
Writing for a divided D.C. Circuit panel in a merger case
involving a drilling-rig business, Judge Thomas said the
government's basic argument was "devoid of support in the
statute, in the case law and in the government's own merger
guidelines."
   James Rill, the Justice Department's antitrust chief,
insists that two defeats don't constitute a trend. "Losing
any cases is losing too many," he says. But "if you are going
to have a strong merger-enforcement program, you are going to
lose some." In the movie theater case, he has asked for a
rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit. He hasn't decided
whether or how to appeal in the D.C. Circuit case.
   Mr. Rill acknowledges -- approvingly -- that since the
mid-1970s, judges from the Supreme Court on down have looked
more skeptically at government claims that mergers in
concentrated industries necessarily impair competition. But
he notes that under his leadership, the Justice Department's
Antitrust Division has won many more court cases than it has
lost.
   More importantly, Mr. Rill says, the division typically
"wins" without having to go to court at all. In more than a
dozen instances over the past year, companies have dropped or
restructured deals in response to the mere threat of a
government lawsuit, he says. Indeed, private lawyers report
that corporate clients considering mergers are more concerned
today about possible antitrust problems than they have been
since 1981.
   But that deterrent effect will fade if it becomes apparent
that calling the government's bluff may result in a courtroom
victory. The Kozinski and Thomas opinions, which upheld
earlier trial court decisions, provide potent ammunition for
future defendants.
   Broadly speaking, both opinions rejected the Justice
Department's central contention that mergers eliminating
competitors in an already concentrated market tend to give
the surviving companies the power to raise prices
excessively. Judges Thomas and Kozinski underscored the
government's failure to prove that consumers or companies
doing business with the defendants would suffer as a result
of the challenged mergers.
   In reviewing the acquisition of a hard-rock hydraulic
underground drilling rig business, Judge Thomas observed that
buyers of such complicated and expensive machinery are highly
sophisticated. This sophistication, the judge concluded,
ensures that manufacturers will have to scramble to please
buyers, keeping prices reasonable even in a concentrated
market.
   Judge Kozinski took every opportunity to praise the
defendant movie-theater acquirer in the Ninth Circuit case as
a hard-driving capitalist who provided good service and
continued to face the prospect of new competitors entering
his market in Las Vegas. Demonstrating his scornful amusement
at the government's case, Judge Kozinski peppered his 25-page
opinion with the names of some 200 movie titles.
   "It is a tribute to the state of competition in America,"
he wrote, "that the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice has found no worthier target than this paper tiger on
which to expend limited taxpayer resources."
   Among the lessons to be drawn from these cases, according
to Prof. Calkins, is that "the government can't afford to
file a lawsuit where customers aren't concerned about the
merger."
   The cases discussed were U.S. vs. Baker Hughes Inc. (D.C.
Circ.) and U.S. v. Syufy Enterprises (Ninth Circ.).

   Newfound Amity Between Superpowers
   Limits Peacemaking Efforts Elsewhere

   WASHINGTON -- After Iraq attacked Kuwait, the Soviets
announced they would cut off arms shipments to Baghdad.
Quietly, however, they went one step further, ordering
weapons ships en route to Iraq to reverse course.
   This account, provided by a senior State Department
official, underscores the new Soviet willingness to cooperate
with the U.S. But just as the Soviets are powerless to force
President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait,
so too are the superpowers limited in how far they can use
their newfound unity to ease tensions among their client
nations elsewhere -- in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia and
Central America.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As the superpower conflict ends, the Soviets are no longer
interested in dominating Third World states. Moreover, their
foreign aid is declining rapidly because of domestic
problems. For the U.S., the end of the Cold War means that
the nations that once followed Washington because it was
their shield against communism are now more inclined to go
their own way. And pressing domestic needs prevent the U.S.,
like the Soviet Union, from buying influence abroad.
   "When something bad happens, the Soviets no longer assume
it's us causing it and we no longer assume it's them," says
Burton Pines, senior vice president of the conservative
Heritage Foundation. "Now the question is how much leverage
do we {the superpowers} have over everybody else?"
   Moscow and Washington have been edging closer, for
example, to a common formula to resolve the thorny issue of
Cambodia. When the five permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council met in Paris in January, the Soviets
supported the general idea of elections there, but wouldn't
go along with setting up an international structure that
would have authority to actually administer an election.
   Last week, when Secretary of State James Baker discussed
this issue with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
during talks in Irkutsk, Siberia, the Soviets endorsed a more
active role for the United Nations and for a Supreme National
Council in an election process. "It sure looked like our
positions were not very far apart," says a U.S. official who
participated in the sessions.
   But getting real-world benefit from the agreement may be
another matter. U.S. officials aren't sure that Moscow can
get Vietnam, which installed the government in Cambodia, to
cooperate. Soviet aid to Vietnam has declined, and the
substantial assistance that Hanoi once received from Moscow's
former East European satellites has evaporated.
   "Nobody knows how much leverage the Soviets still have
over Vietnam until they try to use it," says a U.S. official.
   Concerning Afghanistan, Moscow and Washington are steadily
narrowing their differences but neither superpower is able to
impose solutions on the participants. Some of the U.S.-backed
mujahedeen guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's Communist
government are Islamic fundamentalists who are as
anti-American as they are anti-Soviet. And, one U.S. analyst
says, Moscow has never been succeeded in exercising total
control in Afghanistan.
   Similarly, in El Salvador, Moscow "has made clear to us
that they'll make every effort to support a political
process," says a senior State Department official. "But we
just can't say if they will be able to deliver," he adds.
Leftist guerrillas in El Salvador still are being supplied by
Cuba, which shows no signs of bending to Moscow's new
cooperative line.
   Mr. Pines of the Heritage Foundation says the new
U.S.-Soviet partnership may be most effective in bolstering
the efforts of the United Nations and other international
organizations in underdeveloped countries. During the Cold
War, many of these nations became embroiled in the East-West
ideological struggle and adopted Marxist economies. Nearly
all have become economic basket cases.
   Now, Moscow could join the U.S. in promoting free market
economics. "All the Soviets would have to do is take some of
the resolutions passed recently by the Moscow city council,
send them off to places like Tanzania and say, try this,"
concludes Mr. Pines.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Control Over Drexel Liquidation
   Goes to Court-Appointed Outsider

   In an unusual arrangement similar to the appointment of a
bankruptcy-court trustee, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.
turned over control of its asset liquidation to a
court-appointed outsider.
   The move puts George D. Gould, a former U.S. Treasury
undersecretary, in charge of selling off and reinvesting the
assets of Drexel and its subsidiaries. Mr. Gould, 62 years
old, is now vice chairman of Klingenstein, Fields &amp; Co., a
New York money-management firm, and will not relinquish that
post.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Drexel filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in February and began liquidating its assets.
   The appointment of Mr. Gould stems from a dispute over
whether the creditors should be privy to Drexel's liquidation
plans. Although the company and the creditors had earlier
operated under an oversight procedure that gave creditors
notice of the transactions, Drexel backed out of that
arrangement in late May -- spurring the creditors to begin
legal action demanding a role in reviewing the liquidation
transactions.
   The new arrangement, negotiated under the supervision of
federal bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III, goes far beyond
the earlier review process. While previously Drexel decided
on the transactions -- after conferring with creditors -- now
Mr. Gould will decide. He will serve as the chairman and only
voting member of a court-appointed investment committee. The
other members of the committee will be one representative
each of Drexel, the parent's creditors' committee and the
creditors' committee of Drexel's brokerage unit.
   "This provides an unprecedented degree of intervention by
an outsider in a bankruptcy proceeding," said Wilbur Ross of
Rothschild Inc., financial adviser to the parent's
creditors'committee. "It's a more elaborate process than we
had before. It is more powerful than what we had."
   Mr. Ross said the arrangement will speed up efforts to
work out a reorganization plan for Drexel because it
eliminates the likelihood of court battles between the debtor
and creditors over the asset liquidation.
   A Drexel spokesman said, "We view this as a workable
solution in our effort to maximize the value of our assets."
   Mr. Gould, well known to players on both sides of the
case, said his appointment is "an attempt to come up with a
referee. . . . My employer, if you will, is the court. I must
be fair to both the creditors and Drexel."
   Under the new plan, Drexel management will recommend
securities transactions to Mr. Gould. He will make decisions
after consulting with the committee. Any member can appeal
Mr. Gould's decision to Judge Buschman. The arrangement also
requires Drexel to provide a regular update of its securities
transactions and the value of its assets to the creditors'
financial advisers. The review process will continue at least
until early November, when a Drexel reorganization plan is
expected to be proposed.
   Mr. Gould will be paid $37,500 a month. Mr. Ross said Mr.
Gould was selected from a list of more than 30 candidates. He
served as Treasury Department undersecretary for domestic
affairs under President Reagan, dealing mainly with finance
and banking issues.

   AN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS doesn't have to be perfect,
appeals court rules.
   The Federal Aviation Administration's analysis of the
environmental impacts of the new Denver airport, now under
construction, wasn't fatally flawed by the use of
inappropriate noise standards, the District of Columbia U.S.
Court of Appeals ruled.
   A group of residents who live north of the airport
contended that the FAA had inadequately addressed their
concerns that noise from airplanes using the airport would
harm waterfowl and other wildlife at the Barr Lake State
Park, northeast of the airport site. The judges agreed that
the FAA had used noise standards with no relevance to the
wildlife refuge. Nevertheless, they ruled, the FAA's
conclusion that the new airport wouldn't substantially
increase the noise levels could have been reached using other
data included in the environmental impact statement.
   Attorneys for the city and county of Denver said the
decision removes the last legal roadblock to the $2.3 billion
airport, expected to be a hub for Continental Airlines and
United Airlines.
   The decision could help smooth the way for Chicago, Dallas
and other cities to build new airports or expand existing
ones.

   NORIEGA'S ATTORNEYS WIN a round in their efforts to get
paid.
   U.S. Magistrate William C. Turnoff ruled in favor of the
lawyers late Thursday in a hearing to determine whether three
European banks should release information about accounts that
may contain funds belonging to the deposed Panamanian leader.
   Manuel Noriega's attorneys, led by Frank Rubino, have been
trying to unfreeze about $5 million in assets from European
bank accounts so that Mr. Noriega will be able to pay for his
defense. In June, the U.S. government agreed to help the
defense lawyers unfreeze the assets.
   Mr. Rubino had subpoenaed records from the three banks --
Deutsche-Sudamerkanische Bank of Hamburg, West Germany; Union
Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, and the Marseille, France,
branch of Paris-based Credit Lyonnais -- in late June and
early July. The banks, however, moved to quash the subpoenas,
saying bank secrecy laws in their countries prohibited them
from releasing the documents.
   After hearing arguments Thursday, Magistrate Turnoff gave
the banks 14 days to comply with the subpoenas.
   The banks could appeal the decision to U.S. District Judge
William M. Hoeveler, who is presiding over the Noriega trial.

   JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL WAS HOSPITALIZED for observation
after suffering a fall in a hotel lobby in Chicago. The
82-year-old Supreme Court justice was in stable condition at
Bethesda Naval Hospital, where he was admitted on Friday
afternoon. Court officials wouldn't disclose whether Justice
Marshall had suffered any injury, but said he didn't have a
heart attack. Justice Marshall arrived in Chicago on Thursday
for the American Bar Association annual convention, but fell
on Thursday evening. He decided to return to Washington on
Friday to see his own doctors, canceling a speech he planned
to give tonight.

   Drug-Testing Firms
   Eschew Pop Quizzes

   FOR YEARS, help-wanted classifieds have ended on a note of
invitation: The advertiser is an "equal opportunity
employer." Now, some end with a warning: "Drug-Testing
Employer."
   Some companies view this as a courtesy. "I don't think
it's fair to spring something like that on someone," says
Linda Williams, human-resource manager at HomeFed Bank. The
San Diego financial institution began pre-employment
screening last fall, and thinks the warning itself may be a
deterrent. Besides, a surprise test is no way to begin a
relationship, says Ms. Williams. "You don't want to say,
`Hey, we really like you. Now go take a drug test.'"
   As companies' drug policies evolve, firms are wrestling
with when and how to tell job candidates about the tests.
Most employees learn about them during the application
process.
   Paris Couturiaux, vice president for human resources,
Twentieth Century Investors, a mutual fund, says the ad
warning helps prevent arguments later with people who believe
tests violate their privacy. The ad is like a prospectus, he
says. "If you don't want to {be tested}, don't apply."
                                                                                                       

   Recruiters Faulted
   For Resume Touch-Ups
                                                                                                       

   WOULD AN executive recruiter lie on his own resume? Yes,
contends a recruiting-industry watchdog. And many recruiters
agree.
   The watchdog is James Kennedy, publisher of Executive
Recruiter News, a trade publication. In recent issues, he
claims that various recruiters list credentials they don't
have.
   His commentary hasn't gone unnoticed. Robert L. Smith,
chairman of the Association of Executive Search Consultants,
shot off a memo to members: "You might want to review your
own materials {to make sure they reflect} the level of
professional pride that you so justly feel." The group's
ethics committee made a brief inquiry into one headhunter's
background and cleared him.
   Some in the industry complain that Mr. Kennedy exaggerates
the problem, harping on small or outdated inconsistencies.
For example, Andrew Sherwood of Goodrich &amp; Sherwood, a New
York firm, acknowledges that for several years he used a
brochure claiming a Master's degree he almost finished but
never got. But that was 20 years ago.
   The AESC's Mr. Smith says the recruitment industry has
"matured" only recently. Some people who once fudged have
long since come clean. The group's members, he notes, are
required to sign an ethics pledge. But its membership makes
up only a fraction of the industry.
   Some of Mr. Kennedy's jabs have been aimed at claims made
by some executives in a new book, "The Career Makers," which
profiles 100 recruiters. The author, John Sibbald, a Chicago
headhunter, stands by his book. Mr. Kennedy, he maintains,
"does these little witch hunts." But he agrees that
recruiters occasionally misrepresent themselves. If their
firms find out, he says, they clean house quietly or sweep it
under the carpet.
                                                                                                       

   Electronic Mail: Is It
   For Your Eyes Only?
                                                                                                       

   MOST EMPLOYEES use the office phone without much thought
about privacy. They apparently are no more careful about
electronic mail systems, or e-mail. But, sometimes, their
bliss is ignorance, experts contend.
   A common hazard is "masquerading," when colleagues slip
into privileged networks or private mailboxes, says Lee
Sproull, an e-mail expert at Carnegie Mellon University.
"Borrowing" passwords is relatively easy, warns Michael Baum,
an attorney concerned with electronic security, especially if
users make obvious choices, such as a nickname.
   Scarier for employees, though, may be management
monitoring. Most companies say they have policies protecting
privacy. But some do monitor, says Mr. Baum, even if "they're
not going to advertise it." The issue already has hit the
courts. One suit involves Alana Shoars, former e-mail
administrator at Epson America, who says she assured
employees of the computer maker that the system was private.
Then, she alleges, she found her boss reading reams of e-mail
printouts. When confronted, he fired her, she claims. His
stated reason, she adds, could only have been based on
something he read -- and misinterpreted -- in her own e-mail.
   Ms. Shoars has sued Epson for wrongful discharge. Epson
claims she was fired for "insubordination" and that it had
"nothing to do with e-mail." Either way, says Mr. Baum, the
suit is sending "cold shudders" down some corporate spines.
                                                                                                       

   Drucker Puts Name
   On Nonprofit Group
                                                                                                       

   PETER DRUCKER is lending his moniker to a group only
recently credited with management savvy.
   The Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Non-Profit Management
will be launched this fall with the highly regarded author as
honorary chairman and Frances Hesselbein, former national
head of Girl Scouts, as president.
   The foundation will provide service and education to
nonprofit groups, which Ms. Hesselbein terms the "third
sector" of the economy and its fastest-growing. Its founding
underscores that, as Mr. Drucker wrote last year in the
Harvard Business Review, nonprofits no longer consider
"management a dirty word."
   In fact, he says, they often excel where for-profit
companies fail. Because they don't focus just on the bottom
line, they truly understand the customer, whether a Brownie
Scout or Salvation Army parolee. Ms. Hesselbein is the one
manager Mr. Drucker has said he would recommend to head GM.

   The Outlook:
   Treasury Is Attacked
   For Its Dollar Policies

   WASHINGTON -- Wild forces have buffeted the dollar on
international exchange markets in recent days. First, signs
of a weak economy drove it to historic lows. Then, Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait brought investors scurrying back
to the greenback's safety and sent it soaring again.
   But one force has been noticeably absent from currency
markets for months: the U.S. Treasury. After a bout of
hyperactive intervention early this year, the Treasury's
dollar operatives have been unusually silent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In part, the Treasury's quiesence results from a
preoccupation with domestic problems. Secretary Nicholas
Brady has been tied up in budget talks. And the other major
nations in the Group of Seven, which coordinates
international economic policies, have also been focused on
events at home. Germany is concentrating on unification.
Japan is trying to fulfill its obligations to lower barriers
as part of its "structural impediments initiative" with the
U.S. For all three nations, exchange-rate concerns have moved
to the back burner.
   "There appears to be an unwritten G-7 agreement that the
U.S., Japan and Germany will take a pause and bring their
domestic policies in line as part of their coordination
agreement," says David Smick, a Washington-based consultant
who closely monitors international monetary affairs.
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's restraint, however, also reflects a new
political reality. Since the first of the year, the
Treasury's exchange-rate policies have come under heavy
attack, first from the Federal Reserve and now from Congress.
The double-barreled assault may have given the Treasury
second thoughts.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury officials have long claimed autonomy in acting in
international markets. Their efforts to influence exchange
rates by buying or selling dollars are conducted in
conjunction with the Fed, but the Treasury secretary has the
final word. "The Fed doesn't intervene unless the Treasury
approves," says Robert Solomon, a former Treasury official.
   Moreover, the money used for such operations isn't
appropriated by Congress, but rather comes from an "exchange
stabilization fund," established in 1934 and free from
congressional scrutiny. Treasury officials are quick to cite
the wording of the 1934 law, which states that "decisions of
the Treasury Secretary as to the use of the ESF are final and
may not be reviewed by another officer or employee of
government."
   Nevertheless, the Treasury this year has discovered there
are limits to its powers. That recognition began in March,
when the Treasury sold $1.7 billion in an effort to drive the
dollar down against the yen. The move had the unintended
consequence of sparking a revolt at the Fed. Central bank
officials complained the Treasury's massive and frequent
interventions were potentially costly and having little
effect. And they said that by selling dollars on the
international market, the Treasury was putting more money
into circulation and undercutting the Fed's efforts to
control inflation.
                                                                                                       

   The revolt peaked in late March, when three Fed policy
makers -- Cleveland Fed President Lee Hoskins and Governors
Wayne Angell and John LaWare -- took the unusual step of
voting against an increase in resources for the Treasury's
exchange-rate efforts at a meeting of the Fed's policy
committee.
                                                                                                       

   At about the same time, Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson
publicly criticized the Treasury's policies. And Chairman
Alan Greenspan did so privately, in urgent phone
conversations with Secretary Brady. The message finally got
through, and by early April the dollar bashing had stopped.
   More recently, the attack on Treasury has come from House
Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat
who helped the Treasury shepherd its savings and loan rescue
bill through Congress. Mr. Gonzalez believes the Treasury's
use of the exchange stabilization fund violates the
constitutional notion that Congress controls the nation's
purse strings.
   Mr. Gonzalez is forfeiting a portion of his vacation to
hold a hearing on Aug. 14 looking into the matter. In a press
release announcing the hearing, he complained that the
exchange stabilization fund is a "$25 billion slush fund that
lacks accountability."
                                                                                                       

   He said the Treasury's efforts to sell dollars and buy
foreign currencies had caused the foreign-currency holdings
of the U.S. to rise from $10 billion in July 1988 to more
than $46 billion today. If those currencies depreciate, he
said, "the taxpayer could be faced with the loss of billions
of dollars."

   Mr. Gonzalez proposes to allow Congress's General
Accounting Office to audit the stabilization fund. And he has
even suggested that Treasury be stripped of its intervention
authority. His committee, he said, "will evaluate whether or
not the Treasury Department should be in the business of
manipulating the foreign-exchange value of the dollar" and
will question "whether this powerful monetary tool should
rest entirely within the central bank."
   Does Mr. Gonzalez really intend to take Treasury's
exchange rate intervention powers away? Probably not. But
he's clearly trying to make a point. "A spoiled brat
sometimes doesn't take a reprimand," he says in an interview.
"You have to whip him a little."
   Treasury officials say there has been no change in their
policies, and that "intervention levels reflect market
condition." But with both the Fed and the Congress
questioning its authority, the Treasury may have to pull in
its horns. The result: The government's efforts to influence
exchange rates may become less aggressive in the future.

   OTTAWA -- Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark
said the Canadian government has reached an agreement with
the Canadian Bankers' Association to prevent Kuwaiti money
from being withdrawn from Canadian financial institutions.
   Mr. Clark said Canada doesn't have the same legal basis as
other countries, including Britian and the U.S., to freeze
foreign assets. But the move, he said, will add up to a "de
facto freezing of Kuwaiti assets in Canadian institutions,
whether those institutions are in Canada or elsewhere."

   Mr. Clark said he couldn't estimate the size of Kuwaiti

measure wasn't applied to Iraqi holdings because there aren't
"significant amounts of Iraqi assets" in Canada.

   WASHINGTON -- Congress went home for the summer amid a
rush of legislation demonstrating a renewed aggressiveness in
the Democratic leadership and underscoring major policy
differences with President Bush going into the fall
elections.
   Landmark oil-spill and AIDS-treatment bills were sent to
the White House with broad support from both parties. But the
tone was set more by the forceful role of Speaker Thomas
Foley in partisan debates over civil rights and campaign
finance. Commanding strong discipline in the South, the
Democratic leadership crushed a Republican, pro-business
amendment on employment discrimination standards. And in one
rowdy, late-night fight, Mr. Foley overrode objections in his
own party to win adoption of legislation seeking to limit
election spending.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, intelligence legislation approved by the
Senate would curb U.S. covert funding for wars in Cambodia
and Afghanistan. And the administration suffered a major
setback on what became an almost party-line, 54-44 vote in
the Senate over the direction of the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   The Democrats' show of force served to divert attention
from the failure of Congress to act on the budget. But when
lawmakers return in September, they will be faced with the
immediate threat of massive across-the-board spending cuts. A
two-month debt extension, approved before adjournment, will
continue government borrowing until the new fiscal year
begins in October. But the greater test will be meeting an
ambitious schedule agreed to by the leadership and the White
House calling for the completion of budget negotiations by
Sept. 10 and swift enactment of a deficit-reduction package.
   Following is a summary of major legislative action before
adjournment Saturday:
                                                                                                       

   Debt and Budget
                                                                                                       

   Congress sent to the White House legislation raising the
federal borrowing limit by about $73 billion, to $3.195
trillion from $3.122 trillion. The increase is judged
sufficient to keep the government operating through Oct. 2,
and the bill won quick approval after threats from lawmakers
to attach amendments failed to materialize.
   Left pending in the Senate is a long-term debt resolution
that would extend the borrowing limit through fiscal 1991 and
raise the debt ceiling to $3.44 trillion. Efforts to bring up
the measure late Saturday failed when conservatives objected
because the leadership wouldn't permit them to offer their
proposal for a capital-gains tax cut as an amendment. The
debt-ceiling bill could yet serve as a vehicle to carry any
deficit-reduction agreement that emerges this fall but, for
the moment, both parties find it easier to agree on new
spending.
   Minutes before adjourning, the Senate rushed through a
more than $28 billion transportation bill for the new fiscal
year, after tacking on a $10.9 million provision sought by
GOP Leader Robert Dole of Kansas for a highway project in
Wichita. The bill represents a $1.31 billion increase above
the administration's budget and proposes federal rules to bar
interstate truckers and bus drivers from using radar
detectors.
                                                                                                       

   Campaign Finance
                                                                                                       

   Adopted 255-155, the bill proposes a $550,000 spending
limit for most House elections and a matching tax credit of
up to $50 for in-state individual contributions. The measure
stops far short of a Senate-passed ban on political action
committees and, to prevail, the leadership was forced to kill
a more far-reaching package calling for public financing and
deeper cuts from both PAC contributions and those of wealthy
individuals.
                                                                                                       

   Civil Rights
                                                                                                       

   By a 272-154 margin, the House approved legislation to
reverse Supreme Court decisions last year regarding the
application of laws prohibiting employment discrimination.
The measure closely resembles a comparable Senate-passed bill
but faces strong opposition in the administration, which
argues that the standards of proof and level of damages
permitted in the measure would impose an unfair burden on
business and encourage quotas.
   In response, proponents agreed to a $150,000 cap on
punitive damages for employers with fewer than 100 workers,
and language was added to say that nothing in the bill should
be interpreted as requiring hiring or promotion quotas. The
Republican alternative, backed by the Chamber of Commerce,
failed 238-188. The Democratic victory reflected strong
pressure in party ranks by the Black Caucus and Majority Whip
William Gray. Rep. John Lewis (D., Ga.), a hero of the 1960s
civil rights movement, delivered an emotional appeal in a
meeting of the party's whip organization. The Democratic
delegations from his native Alabama as well as the Carolinas
later voted en bloc with the party. Georgia's delegation, by
comparison, was conspicuous in its opposition to the
leadership and, in Arkansas, Rep. Beryl Anthony, chairman of
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Rep.
Bill Alexander, who received help from black lawmakers in his
campaign this year, sided with the GOP.
                                                                                                       

   Environment
                                                                                                       

   Ending a 16-year stalemate, the oil-spill legislation
requires all new tankers operating in U.S. waters to be
equipped with double hulls. Federal liability limits are
increased and, despite administration objections, the measure
leaves states free to set unlimited liability for shippers
and other parties responsible for spills. Final approval came
on a 360-0 roll call but only after the House voted 281-82 to
block an industry effort to strip an attached provision
imposing a moratorium -- opposed by Mobil Corp. -- on
drilling off North Carolina's coast.
   Separately, a House-Senate conference on clean-air
legislation reached agreement on provisions designed to phase
out production of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals
used in refrigeration and insulation but harmful to the
stratospheric ozone layer. The standards would generally
demand that production be phased out faster over the next
decade than now required under international agreements
signed by the U.S. Production of CFCs and carbon
tetrachloride would end by 2000, and methyl chloroform by
2002. For HCFCs, which are less damaging substitutes for
CFCs, output would be banned in 2030.
                                                                                                       

   Health &amp; Safety
                                                                                                       

   AIDS-treatment legislation sent to the president would
initially authorize an estimated $880 million annually for
health care and early-intervention services by states and
emergency-relief grants to areas hardest hit by the epidemic.
Fifteen metropolitan areas, including New York, Boston,
Dallas and San Francisco, are expected to qualify in fiscal
1991 for the emergency aid, which is authorized at $275
million but still subject to actual appropriations.
   Separately, the Senate approved legislation that would
require the use of child safety seats for infants and
toddlers on domestic commercial airline flights.
                                                                                                       

   Trade
                                                                                                       

   Congress approved an amalgam of trade provisions,
including a restructuring of the customs user fee charged on
most imports. Trade benefits under the Caribbean Basin
Initiative would be made permanent, and the bill also would
make permanent the current ban on the export of unmilled logs
from federal land in the lower 48 states.

   Oil-Price Surge Sparked by Invasion
   Of Kuwait Could Spur Texas Economy

   WASHINGTON -- A silver lining in Iraqi's invasion of
Kuwait could be a boost in the Texas economy caused by a
surge in oil prices.
   But anyone who hoped, as some in Washington did, that a
resurgence in Texas might shrink the costs of the savings and
loan bailout is likely to prove wrong in this case,
economists and others said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half the real estate the government seized from
savings and loan associations is in Texas -- in raw land,
office buildings and abandoned homes. The final cost of the
S&amp;L cleanup -- at least $130 billion, plus hundreds of
billions more in interest -- depends largely on how quickly
the government can sell that property, and at what price. The
Texas real estate market is heavily influenced by oil prices.
   But even the more optimistic analysts don't believe an
oil-price increase would substantially reduce the costs of
the S&amp;L mess. "To the extent that it sticks, that will help
the asset values of S&amp;L portfolios," said Bernard Weinstein,
an economist at University of North Texas, "but it's not
going to solve the S&amp;L problem."
   Officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas met early
Friday to assess regional economic effects of the invasion,
but following the meeting one official said he didn't expect
a big effect on the Texas economy. The Dallas Fed said Texas
is no longer as dependent on energy jobs as it was 10 years
ago. The energy industry represents just 9% of the Texas
economy, compared with 19% in 1981, said Harvey Rosenblum,
chief economist for the Dallas Fed.
   Still, both economists said, it will spur jobs. Mr.
Weinstein projects that if oil stays at $24 a barrel, the
Texas economy could get an $8 billion annual boost. That
translates into 64,000 new jobs, Mr. Weinstein said. "It
could be just the tonic Texas needs to avoid slipping into
recession."
   But the key question for Texas is whether the prices
remain high. Fluctuating oil prices have taught some hard
lessons to Texas oil men in the past decade, said Paul
Horvitz, an economist at the University of Houston and
formerly a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas.
   "There's a lot of fear that higher prices won't be
maintained. People are afraid to make the investment in more
production or exploration."
   Overall U.S. economic health could more broadly influence
the cost of the bailout. "No one factored in an Iraqi attack
on Kuwait," said Martin Regalia, chief economist for the
National Council of Savings Institutions. "When the economy
is growing so darn slow, we could get a lot of short-term
negative effects of a recession -- marginal institutions
would fail, property prices would fall," which would drive up
the bailout costs.
   Moreover, noted Mr. Horvitz, many of the real estate
developments that now are wards of the Resolution Trust
Corp., the S&amp;L bailout agency, were built during the dizzy
1980s boom. "Those were planned when the motto was
$85-a-barrel oil by 1985," he said."Developments feasible at
that price just aren't going to come back when oil is $25."
   While the jump in oil prices produced some excited
speculation in Washington, most Texas businessman were
wearily skeptical about another boom driven by Arab oil
states clamping down on production.
   That would be "the worst thing that can happen to Texas,"
said Thomas Wageman, president of Sunbelt Savings in Dallas.
"The previous boom was driven by a cartel and it wrecked
Texas. We sure as hell don't need anything else like that
again."
   "We're not going back to the thrilling days of yesteryear
and that's probably good," said Mr. Weinstein, the economist.

   World stock markets tumbled last week along with the
Kuwaiti government, and money managers fear that share prices
will continue to drop.
   Behind the world-wide stock decline are fears of an oil
shock that traders and investors believe will accelerate
already rising interest rates in many economies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The mood is very bearish, very troubled. People are
looking for direction and can't really find it," said Andrew
Smith, vice chairman and chief investment officer of London &amp;
Bishopsgate International Inc., a New York money-management
firm. "There's always the fear in everybody's mind of a
repeat of the 1973 oil shock," when oil prices quadrupled and
precipitated a major recession.
   That fear is plaguing world markets. At the end of the
morning session Monday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
Nikkei index, an average of 225 stocks, stood at 28409.07,
off 1106.69 points, or 3.7%, from its closing level Friday.
"There is great uncertainty about what will happen in Iraq
and to world oil prices," said Mikio Fujino, an institutional
salesman at Nikko Securities Co.
   Since Wednesday, the day before Iraqi troops invaded
Kuwait, the Nikkei index had fallen 6.9%; the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange's DAX index of 30 blue chips, 2.7%; the Paris
Bourse's CAC 40 index, 4.6%; and London's Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, 2.3%. Over the same
period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 3.1%, 60%
of that drop coming on Friday.
   Smaller foreign markets fared no better. Last Thursday and
Friday, Taiwan plunged 11.1%, Spain, 5.1%; Thailand, 3.9%;
Italy, 3.6%, and Hong Kong, 3.2%.
   And the worst may be yet to come. Michael Woodward,
investment director at Ivory &amp; Sime PLC in Edinburgh,
Scotland, said, "The whole supertanker that's the investment
world takes time to react to these things." He notes that
when oil prices suddenly fell 35% in late 1985 and early
1986, short-term interest rates hardly budged, and it was a
month before stock markets took off.
   But this time, world interest rates have already begun to
climb, reducing the appeal of stocks to investors. The yield
on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose to 8.43% Friday from
8.28% on Wednesday. In the same two-day period, equivalent
yields on West German bonds jumped 0.19 percentage point to
8.64% on a compounded semiannual basis; yields on 10-year
British government bonds, or gilts, were up 0.20 percentage
point to 11.55%. And the yield on Japan's benchmark 10-year
government bond climbed to 7.15%, a seven-year high, from
7.02% on Wednesday.
   Worse, rates are headed even higher in Japan and Germany,
predicted Nicholas Sargen, an international economist at
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Even before last week's crisis, major world equity markets
were anything but euphoric. Slow growth and poor corporate
earnings hurt the U.S. market -- the world's largest -- while
high inflation, steep interest rates and a stumbling economy
threw a pall over British share prices. Meanwhile, worries
about rising inflation and expectations of higher interest
rates were hurting the West German and Japanese markets.
   Now investors must contend with the specter of higher oil
prices. In conquering Kuwait, Iraq gains control of roughly
20% of the world's oil resources and raises fears of a cut in
supplies and higher prices. Taking Saudi Arabia -- Iraqi
units reportedly had been massed near that country's border
-- would boost that figure to about 45%.
   "For equity markets, higher oil prices mean inflationary
pressures because they raise the unit costs of production,"
said Mr. Smith of London &amp; Bishopsgate. At the same time,
central banks are expected to battle that inflation with
higher interest rates, which, in turn, raise borrowing costs,
squeeze corporate profits and make fixed-income investments
more attractive.
   Salomon Brothers is warning clients that a $5-a-barrel
increase in oil prices will boost consumer prices by one
percentage point in Japan and Germany.
   Investors haven't panicked yet. But they don't have much
appetite for buying stocks either. "Fund managers are all
sidelined, basically," said Stephen Wallace, director of
European equities for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Holdings Ltd. in
London. "It's like sitting on a fence with a wind; you can
get blown in either direction," he said.
   By contrast, brokers are passing stocks around like hot
potatoes because no one wants to hold stocks in a war. "I
don't want to sit here with 5,000 of, say, Veba AG (a West
German power generation and chemical company); I sell to
Mary, and Mary sells to Tom, Dick and Harry," said Mr.
Wallace. "You can't sit there owning 5,000 to 10,000 shares
and see the price drift off 2%, 3% or whatever."
   Confused about oil prices, interest rates and currency
movements, "people don't know how to interpret the situation.
They have been reluctant to use falling prices as a buying
opportunity," said Siegfried Hoecker, chief equity investment
officer for DB Capital Management International G.m.b.H., a
money-management unit of Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfurt.
   "Equity markets are trading in a vacuum," said Nicholas
Duphie, senior vice president in charge of European equities
at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. in New York.
   Furthermore, declines are being compounded by the low
trading volume in many overseas markets that were already
thin because of summer. "One order puts the market down
straight away," said Mr. Wallace of Barclays.
   There are also signs that traders and investors are
getting more nervous with each day. On Thursday, markets in
the Netherlands, Australia and Norway rose. But on Friday,
the dam broke: Dutch shares fell 2.8%, Australian stocks,
1.8%, and Norwegian shares, 1.6%.
   On Thursday, aggressive investors, particularly in France,
were willing to bottom fish. But on Friday, "they didn't want
to buy shares, fearing that today's low would be tomorrow's
high," said Jill Eisner, a vice president at Societe Generale
Securities Corp. in New York. French stocks continued to fall
on Friday even after the Paris exchange officially closed.
   Those investors not frozen by fear and events are
maneuvering defensively. To some degree, Ivory &amp; Sime,
primarily an equity manager, has moved into cash and
short-term government securities.
   Within world stock markets, "investors are putting tin
hats on," buying oil stocks, food companies and brewery
shares, said Marcus Padley, an equity salesman at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew Ltd. in London. British stocks that have
bucked the downward trend include British Gas PLC, British
Petroleum Co., ASDA Group PLC, a food and dairy company, and
British Aerospace PLC, a defense company.
   Some markets, particularly West Germany's and Japan's,
were already having problems before the Mideast crisis
erupted last week. "East Germany is taking up a lot of the
credit that has been provided {by West Germany} and taking it
up quite quickly," said Mr. Hoecker of DB Capital. "People
think the spending will add to inflation and drive {German}
interest rates back up," he said.
   Interest rates in Japan had also begun to climb in
response to inflation fears. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait only
makes a bad situation worse.
   "The key economic component for Japan is oil prices," said
Peter Davies, a vice president at Nomura Securities Co. in
New York. The Japanese import nearly all their oil, and about
70% of that from the Persian Gulf. He added, "They have a
rather heavy bet on the Middle East situation." Now, Mr.
Davies said, the Tokyo stock market suffers from "a triple
negative: higher oil prices, a weaker yen and pressure for
higher interest rates."
   The Iraqi invasion sent Japanese institutions fleeing to
buy "safe-haven" dollars. That depressed an already weak yen.
At the same time, Japanese and foreign investors have been
selling stock-index futures so heavily, as a hedge against
slipping share prices, that they are pulling down prices in
the Tokyo stock market as well.
   Moreover, to cushion losses from sales of poorly
performing stocks, Japanese institutions are also unloading
the shares of healthy companies on which they can realize a
profit, said Yumiko Miura, an institutional saleswoman at
Daiwa Securities Co. in New York. "This magnifies the
negative aspects of the market," she said.
   Now some money managers predict the Nikkei index will fall
an additional 8.5% to 12% to 26000 or 27000 points before
stabilizing.
   "Fear and uncertainty prevails, certainly more than
greed," said Ms. Miura.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Tokyo stocks plunged broadly in light trading Friday,
falling back from morning highs in the afternoon on a U.S.
news report that Iraqi troops were approaching the Saudi
Arabian border following their Thursday invasion of Kuwait,
and confusion and nervousness continued to dominate the
market.
   The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 729.42 points to
29515.76 -- below 30000 for the first time since May 1. The
index lost 592.81 points Thursday. First section volume was
estimated at about 430 million shares, up from 374 million
shares traded Thursday. Losers outpaced gainers 861 to 140,
and 111 issues were unchanged. The number of stocks dumped
was relatively small, traders said, noting that prices were
pushed down more severely by waves of selling related to
stock-futures arbitrage.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first section issues,
which lost 31.25 points Thursday, ended off 40.76 at 2174.67.
The second section index, which gained 8.13 points Thursday,
lost 46.94 to 4397.45.
   London share prices, battered in another somber session
marked by rumors about more Iraqi military moves, closed
lower, weighed down by the specter of rising inflation and
higher borrowing costs in response to dearer oil prices.
Market watchers said the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index also was pressured, as the premium between
futures and cash prices collapsed, while others said the
decline in the index below the 2300-point barrier added to
the malaise. The FT-SE 100 closed at 2284.6, down 19.9
points.
   The Financial Times 30-share index retreated 18.0 points
to 1793.4. Volume registered a moderate 523.4 million shares,
compared with 561.5 million shares a day earlier.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Frankfurt,
Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, Zurich, Stockholm, Milan and
Madrid. South African gold stocks closed higher.
   Equities finished lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Seoul.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   The Mideast Conflict:
   Japan Faces Higher Interest Rates,
   Which May Hurt U.S. Treasurys

   TOKYO -- Volatile world oil prices ensure that interest
rates will increase in Japan, a country haunted by memories
of torrid inflation during the oil crises of the 1970s. Some
analysts fear that tighter credit will inhibit Japanese
buying at this week's big U.S. Treasury refunding auctions.
   To ward off the inflationary effects of higher oil prices,
economists say, the Bank of Japan is likely to boost its
discount rate, which it charges on loans to financial
institutions. Most economists expect the increase to come as
early as this week, in light of the jump in world oil prices
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is the last nail in the coffin of the current
interest-rate structure," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an
economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. here. Added another
analyst at a U.S. securities firm: "This is probably just the
excuse {Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi} Mieno has been
looking for."
   If rates in Japan rise, economists worry that the
country's big institutional investors, who normally are major
buyers at U.S. Treasury auctions, may decide to keep their
money at home, where it will earn more in interest and won't
be exposed to foreign-exchange market gyrations.
   Even before the invasion, Japan's financial markets were
warily anticipating tighter credit. Last week, commercial
banks effectively raised their prime lending rates, and
government bond yields crept higher.
   Then came the Iraqi invasion. The ensuing volatility in
oil's price whipsawed Japan's already-jittery markets. On
Friday, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks plummeted 729.42
points to 29515.76, its first time below the 30000 mark in
more than three months. The No. 119 10-year government bond
dropped 0.54 to 84.76 to yield 7.15%, up 0.1 percentage
point.
   Late Sunday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu overrode the
opposition of the powerful Ministry of International Trade
and Industry to join ranks with the U.S. and the European
Community in imposing an international trade embargo against
Iraq.
   By joining the trade embargo, Japan risks 700 billion yen
($4.67 billion) of commercial and other loans outstanding to
Baghdad, but the overall economic effects would hardly be
crippling. Unlike the two previous oil crises, the country
wouldn't face a shortage of supply by cutting off Iraq, even
if it also loses supplies from occupied Kuwait. In the first
six months of the year, Japan imported about 220,000 barrels
a day from each country, or a total of about 12% of its oil
imports. Although Japan imports 99% of its oil, 70% of it
from the Middle East, the country has a strategic reserve
that could supply the nation at full capacity for nearly five
months.
   In the 1973 oil crisis, a sudden embargo on oil by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries resulted in a
quadrupling of world oil prices and severe inflation in
Japan. At the time, Japan was importing five million barrels
a day, and the cost of crude was the equivalent of almost 5%
of gross national product. In 1979, when oil prices suddenly
doubled, oil dependency was only marginally less.
   Today, however, although Japan still consumes one in 10
barrels of the world's oil, its oil bill accounts for less
than 1% of GNP, about the same as in the U.S. and less than
other industrialized countries, including West Germany. Its
dependence on oil for energy has dropped to 58% in 1989 from
78% in 1973. Even a long-term increase in crude prices to $21
a barrel, about $5 more than prices a month ago, would raise
consumer prices in Japan only about 0.08 percentage point,
according to Nomura Research Institute, an arm of Nomura
Securities Co.
   Some analysts argue that a higher import bill could
benefit Japan by trimming its persistent trade surpluses and
cooling industrial expansion. UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew
International Ltd. predicted that a $5-a-barrel increase in
oil prices would shave Japan's trade surplus by 10% a year.
   The risk to Japan's economy, analysts say, really lies in
the credit policy of the Bank of Japan. Mr. Mieno is known
for his anxiety about repeating the mistakes that allowed
inflation to rage at 25% after the first oil crisis in 1973.
   It would be the fifth official tightening of credit since
May 1989, when the discount rate stood at a historic low of
2.5%. The rate now is 5.25%.
   In Japan, higher rates would tend to damp consumer
spending and capital investment by big companies. But
economists say the economy appears healthy enough to
withstand another rate rise.
   The greater threat of higher Japanese rates may lie
abroad. As rates on Japanese government bonds trend higher,
rates in the U.S., where the economy is showing signs of
slowing fast, are likely to weaken, making U.S. bonds look
less attractive to big Japanese investors, economists say.
   That could create problems for the U.S. Treasury, which
plans to try to raise $32.25 billion this week at auctions
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. If Japanese investors, who
normally take up about a third of the total, aren't
aggressive bidders, interest rates in the U.S. may creep up.
"What will determine the auction is exchange rates," said
Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research
Institute. He believes that if the dollar is strong against
the yen, investors will steer clear of dollar-denominated
investments such as U.S. Treasurys out of a long-term view
that the currency will weaken.

   After aggressive oil-industry lobbying, the Bush
administration reversed course to allow hundreds of millions
of dollars of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude already on tankers
headed to the U.S. to unload.
   Initially the president embargoed all Iraqi imports,
including crude already ordered and paid for. That sent oil
companies scrambling for substitute supplies and partially
contributed to last week's big run-up in crude and gasoline
prices. Customs officials for a time even seized at least one
cargo belonging to Coastal Corp. in Corpus Christi, Texas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Late Friday the Treasury department issued rules stating
that any oil loaded before last Thursday morning with a bill
of lading issued before then was exempt if it arrived in the
U.S. before Oct. 1. Any remaining payments due on such oil
would be made into a "blocked account" rather than to Iraq.
   The precise amount of oil involved couldn't be determined.
But the U.S. had been importing about 633,000 barrels of
crude from those two countries a day; at current prices a
month's worth would exceed $430 million. Some industry
reports have put the amount of oil at sea 50% higher. A Coast
Guard spokesman in Washington said about 15 tankers carrying
Iraqi crude were due to dock at five ports along the Gulf
Coast just through next week.
   A Treasury spokeswoman said the rules were issued "to
minimize the negative effects on the U.S. economy" while
making sure "that no benefits accrued to Iraq."
   "I talked directly to Henson Moore," the deputy energy
secretary, said Ron Haddock, chief executive officer of
American Petrofina Inc. in Dallas. The company was awaiting
five million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude loaded before
the embargo was issued. "Once people understood the situation
we had a sympathetic ear," Mr. Haddock said.
   The company's Washington law firm also pressed the issue,
as did a group of companies through their main trade group,
the American Petroleum Institute, Mr. Haddock said.
"Embargoing that oil wasn't hurting Iraq, it was hurting U.S.
companies and consumers," he said.
   In San Francisco, a Chevron Corp. spokesman said: "We had
people in our Washington office working with the government
on it." Chevron has nine million barrels of Iraqi crude on
order, including 1.9 million barrels that was waiting to be
unloaded at its Pascagoula, Miss., refinery. That process
began yesterday morning, he said.
   A spokesman for Ashland Oil Inc., a large refiner and
retailer in Ashland, Ky., said: "We had a tanker on the water
with one million barrels." But he said Ashland hasn't decided
whether to try to take delivery because it hasn't paid for
the crude yet. About 500,000 barrels of Iraqi crude is
nearing an Amoco Corp. refinery, a spokesman said, with
several more cargoes also en route.
   A Coastal spokesman said it was unloading the 500,000
barrels of crude that had been embargoed. "We have several
more tankers that apparently will be coming and will be
exempted," he added.

and emirs," says the businessman. To prove his point, he
polls passing waiters, and diners at adjoining tables. The
vote is unanimous. "You see," he says, "we are all soldiers
for Saddam now."

   The view from a sidewalk cafe in Cairo is precisely the
opposite. "We all know Saddam is the son of a dog," says Atif
Khalid, who like many Egyptians worked in Iraq during its war
with Iran. A dozen men bang tables to show their assent. "If
he comes here," shouts one, "we will cut his throat."
   Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait has sundered the Arab
world, separating two of America's closest allies in the
region and pushing the Middle East toward further conflict.
While Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak leads a
campaign-backed by Saudi Arabia and Syria -- to condemn and
contain the Iraqi leader, Jordan has thrown itself into the
Iraqi camp, joined by the Palestine Liberation Organization
and Libya.
   The rift bodes poorly for American influence in the region
and confirms what leaders across the Arab world have been
warning: that U.S. neglect of moderates such as Mr. Mubarak
has paved the way for Iraqi extremism.
   "Demagoguery plays to the gallery. Moderation doesn't play
unless it brings results," says Tahseen Bashir, a veteran
Egyptian diplomat. "We were bringing home empty baskets."
   In Jordan, where the population is half Palestinian, the
failure of both diplomacy and the Palestinian uprising to
gain any ground has bred despair, and fervent
anti-Americanism. The almost unanimous view of both officials
and ordinary people is that strong leadership and a strong
show of force is now the only way to break the stalemate.
   Saddam Hussein has become the symbol of that defiance.
Jordanians appear remarkably unconcerned by both the plight
of Kuwait, and Mr. Hussein's brutality at home and abroad.
"We do not have the luxury to concern ourselves with
democratic niceties," says Hazem Nuseibeh, a veteran
Jordanian diplomat. "The need for Arab unity and pride
overrides all that."
   Jordanian officials repeatedly liken Mr. Hussein to Otto
von Bismarck, who unified Germany with iron and blood. If Mr.
Hussein needs oil and territory to advance Arab nationalism,
so be it. Many Jordanians go so far as to suggest that Iraqi
tanks would be welcome in Amman.
   "The colonial powers vivisected the Arab world to make us
weak," says Mr. Nuseibeh, voicing a common view. Adds Deeb
Marji, a member of Parliament: "If Saddam can put the Arab
map together again, who will regret what he did in Kuwait?"
   In Egypt, the overwhelming view is that Mr. Hussein's
action has destroyed hopes for Arab unity. And they fear it
will provoke foreign intervention that will cause a lasting
rift in the region.
   On Saturday night in Cairo, a group of senior military
officers drew up a list of winners and losers in the wake of
Iraq's action. Israel topped everyone's list of winners. All
reasoned that the invasion will likely increase U.S. military
aid to Israel and harden Israeli attitudes toward ceding land
to Palestinians.
   Mr. Mubarak tended to turn up on the list of losers. Last
week, he frantically tried to defuse the conflict and even
assured both the Kuwaitis and the West that Iraq wouldn't
invade. Iraq's action humiliated Mr. Mubarak, and the Arab
world's divided response suggests that his leverage as a
regional power broker is waning.
   Egypt also appears to have lost its role as the PLO's
go-between with America and Israel. "Iraq is the PLO's
godfather now," says a senior Jordanian official.
   Both the PLO and Jordan were among those who refused to
join an Arab League vote condemning Iraq. And PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat helped scuttle plans for an Arab summit
yesterday.
   But not everyone is comfortable with the PLO's tilt toward
Baghdad. At a seaside lunch in Tunis just before the
invasion, a PLO official tried to justify the shift, saying,
"The West talks about Saddam's lack of human rights, but what
about human rights in Saudi Arabia? They're abysmal too."
   His wife shook her head in disbelief. "You know very well
Saddam is a butcher," she said. The couple lived in Iraq for
several months until she insisted they leave. "I couldn't
stand the repression," she says.
   Arab acquiescence to Iraq's action also reflects
resentment of Kuwait's vast oil wealth. A Jordanian official
who often went begging to the deposed emir calls Kuwait and
other gulf states, "oil wells with flags." A legislator says
"what they spend in one year on houses, women and cars could
pay off our entire national debt."
   In fact, the Kuwaitis have given quite a bit to Jordan,
including most of $125 million promised this year in aid. But
Jordanian officials say Saudi Arabia has paid much more, and
they feel confident Saddam Hussein will do the same if he
controls Kuwait's oil wealth.
   Palestinian officials, who say Kuwait pays a meager $2
million dollars a month to the PLO, also expect largesse from
Mr. Hussein. There is some concern, though, that support of
Iraq by Jordan and the PLO could spark a backlash against
hundreds of thousands of Jordanians and Palestinians working
in the gulf states.
   Kuwait's gulf neighbors responded to the invasion with
predictable alarm. State-controlled media in some states
failed to even mention the invasion for more than 24 hours
after it occurred. Saudi television showed the deposed
Kuwaiti emir in Saudi Arabia, but noted only that he was
"visiting" the kingdom.
   While some impoverished Egyptians resent the Kuwaiti
tourists who flock to expensive Cairo hotel suites, many have
been enriched by work in the emirate.
   "It's a luxury life there," says Jamaa Abdul-Fadil, who
arrived home in Cairo on his annual vacation just four days
before the invasion. Eight years of work as a legal clerk in
Kuwait has comfortably furnished his apartment and allowed
him to buy a small shop in Cairo.
   By contrast, Egyptian workers' experiences in Iraq often
have been bitter. More than a million Egyptians flocked to
bolster Iraqi manpower during the eight-year gulf war.
"Saddam used us up, and when the war was over he tossed us
aside," says Atif Khalid, who worked in Baghdad as a waiter.
Some Egyptians were beaten and shot at by Iraqis, and others
haven't been able to transfer home their earnings as part of
a campaign to clear the way for Iraqi jobseekers returning
from the front. Many Egyptians also served and died in the
war with Iran and more than 10,000 are believed to still be
prisoners of war.
   Egyptians, deeply religious, also identify with Kuwait's
Islamic character. They are outraged that Iraq has once again
breached the Koranic prohibition against Moslems killing
Moslems, as it did when it attacked Iran in 1980.
   If Iraq's action has forced Arab enmities into the open
and forced countries to choose sides, the fate of its
invasion also is likely to determine the Arab world's winners
and losers. Some analysts think King Hussein may be repeating
the error he made in 1967, when he entered the war against
Israel on the side of the Egyptian president, Gamal Abdel
Nasser. Then, the king mistook bluster for strength and lost
half his kingdom -- the West Bank -- to Israeli occupation.
   A senior Jordanian official, though, says Iraq's ascent
marks a return to a much more potent Arab nationalism after
two decades during which Islamic fundamentalism had become
the dominant ideology. Unlike Mr. Nasser, "who bragged of
missiles and had only tin," the official says, "Saddam has
real force and is willing to use it."
   He also has oil, and by not sharing a border with Israel,
he is safer than Mr. Nasser was from Israeli reprisals. And
Western military action against Iraq is widely viewed in the
Arab world as potentially disastrous, because it would make a
martyr of Mr. Hussein and confirm suspicions that many gulf
states are little more than American protectorates. But the
situation is in such flux that many Arabs fear violence could
erupt from unexpected directions.
   "People are thinking with their hearts, not their brains,"
says Asad Abdul Rahman, a member of the Palestinian National
Council, the Palestinian parliament in exile.

   MIAMI -- The Eastern Airlines pilots union said its
members authorized a strike if they don't reach agreement on
a new contract, but any such job action will have little
effect on the carrier.
   Most of the union pilots still aren't flying for the
airline. After being nearly grounded by a strike and
subsequent bankruptcy-law filing last year, Eastern refilled
its cockpits with 1,800 replacement pilots and pilots who
crossed the picket lines. By the time the Air Line Pilots
Association abandoned its job action last November, the
airline said it had all the pilots it needed and refused to
reinstate the former strikers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eastern has said repeatedly that any pilots strike would
be a "non-event." Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the court-appointed
trustee who is running Eastern, said, "It's hard to
understand how pilots who are not working can go on strike."
   Eastern's 3,600 pilots initially went on strike in
sympathy with the airline's machinists. The current dispute
centers on the contract for pilots, in which they have said
they are willing to forfeit wage increases in favor of
getting their old jobs back.
   The pilots union said contract talks are scheduled to
resume this week, supervised by the National Mediation Board,
the federal agency that oversees airline labor.
   Federal mediators last month declared the two sides at an
impasse, and began a 30-day countdown that expires at
midnight EDT Aug. 10, after which the airline could impose
its own contract and the pilots would be free to strike.

   P&amp;G May Face
   Maalox Moment
   Over Antitrust

   The Justice Department threatened to block Procter &amp;
Gamble Co.'s plans to market Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.'s
Maalox antacid because the pact violates antitrust laws.
   The joint marketing pact would make P&amp;G, which makes Pepto
Bismol, the biggest player in the U.S. over-the-counter
stomach remedies market, which could "substantially lessen
competition," said James F. Rill, assistant attorney general
at the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pact could result in higher prices for consumers, he
said. "This lack of market competition would generally harm
consumers nationwide," Mr. Rill said.
   Federal prosecutors said they will file a civil antitrust
suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia to challenge the
pact. P&amp;G and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said they disagree with the
department's conclusion and are assessing their alternatives,
but declined to elaborate.
   In March, P&amp;G acquired the U.S. marketing and distribution
rights to a variety of Rorer Group Inc.'s over-the-counter
drugs, such as Perdiem, a laxative, and Ascriptin, a
combination analgesic-antacid.
   The Cincinnati consumer products company had tried to
acquire all of Rorer's over-the-counter drug business, but
was rebuffed. Earlier this year, Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of Paris,
a chemical company, merged most of its drug business with
Rorer, of Fort Washington, Pa., to form Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
   The Maalox marketing alliance was considered a coup for
P&amp;G's drug business because it gave the company the leading
antacid without the high costs of developing a new brand.
Rorer, in turn, would receive payments from P&amp;G and gain
rights to develop and market certain P&amp;G prescription drugs.
   Rorer says Maalox has a U.S. antacid market share of about
15%, but the brand has faced stiff competition from rivals
Tums and Mylanta.
   Justice department officials estimate that 1989 sales of
over-the-counter stomach remedies were more than $900
million. P&amp;G and Rorer had combined sales in that market of
more than $236 million, officials said.

   Senate Approves Broader Powers for SEC
   To Gather Data, Shut Down Stock Market

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a bill that would broadly
expand the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to
gather Wall Street information and for the first time allow
the agency to close the stock market in times of extreme
stress.
   The bill, passed by voice vote shortly before the Senate
recessed for the summer, marks the Senate's first broad-based
reaction to the sharp stock-market drops of October 1987 and
October 1989 and to the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the Senate bill lacks a measure contained in the House
version allowing the SEC to ban some forms of program
trading, a provision opposed by the Bush administration.
House-Senate conference discussions are likely to focus on
how to recast the program-trading provision into something
the Senate and administration can support. The House bill
grants the SEC the power "to constrain during volatile
markets legitimate trading strategies which nonetheless
result in extraordinary volatility."
   Moreover, both the House and Senate versions of the bill
exclude a Bush administration-sponsored proposal to grant the
SEC regulatory oversight of stock-index futures, which allow
investors to buy the equivalent of a basket of stocks but are
traded on a commodity exchange. Those futures currently are
regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The Senate legislation would allow the SEC to gather
information on holding-company parents of Wall Street
brokerage firms. Those parents often hold many of the risky,
short-term loans taken on by firms as interim financing for
takeovers.
   But the SEC had expressed concern that it didn't have
jurisdiction over the parent -- only the brokerage unit --
and couldn't properly assess the risk to both entities. When
Drexel was forced to file for bankruptcy earlier this year,
the SEC noted, it moved huge sums to its financially strapped
holding company from the brokerage unit, eventually forcing
the subsidiary to fall under SEC capital rules. The SEC
argued that it was hampered in monitoring the situation by
the fact that it couldn't tell how badly the parent was
doing.
   The bill gives the SEC other major data-gathering
abilities as well. It allows the agency to set up
record-keeping procedures for large securities transactions,
a measure designed to help the agency monitor troublesome
trades.
   "It was clear from the events of last October, just as it
had been in October 1987, that the regulators did not have
sufficient information to fully assess the risks to the
system," said Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), a sponsor of
the bill. The measure also will help the agency "detect
manipulative or other illegal trading activity."
   The bill also would aim to strengthen the clearance and
settlement system for stocks, options and futures, reducing
the threats of systemic risk to financial markets.
   Both the House and Senate versions also would grant the
SEC the power to close the stock market in times of severe
market stress. Currently, only the president can halt trading
on the overall market.
   The provision was weakened in negotiations over the past
year after SEC Chairman Richard Breeden expressed concern
that investor uncertainty over whether the SEC would take
such a step would have a chilling effect on the market. So
the measure now would permit the SEC to close the market if
the president doesn't oppose the move.

   ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Northwest Airlines said it will raise
ticket prices for domestic flights $8 each way starting
Thursday to offset rising jet-fuel prices, prompted by the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   But other carriers said only that they were studying the
issue. Airlines generally don't raise fares across the board,
if a major competitor balks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move by the Northwest Airlines unit of NWA Inc. comes
during a disappointing travel season that has prompted many
airlines to offer unusual discounts. Northwest stressed that
its fuel surcharge isn't a "permanent revision" to its
pricing structure and will be reviewed periodically.
   The airline said the surcharge is necessary because its
fuel prices have risen eight cents a gallon since Wednesday
and are expected to increase further. Fuel is an airline's
second-largest expense after labor costs.

   HONG KONG -- In one of the richest building sales since
the local property market slump began more than a year ago,
Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd. has agreed to sell a 44-story
office tower to a former subsidiary of Bond Corp. Holdings
Ltd. for 1.72 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$221 million).
   The bluechip landlord, which controls much of Hong Kong's
prime office space, purchased the building's site at the
colony's first land auction in 1841 through the antecedents
of its parent, Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd.

   Hongkong Land's managing director, Alasdair Morrison, said
the sale of the World Trade Centre in the Causeway Bay
shopping district is part of the company's strategy to
concentrate on properties in Hong Kong's core business
district and pursue other investment opportunities. While it
has indicated intentions to expand in Thailand, he said the
group doesn't have any specific projects in mind.
   Analysts said Hongkong Land is likely initially to use a
portion of the cash to pay off a portion of its debt,
estimated around HK$6 billion, and may apply part to buy back
its sharply undervalued shares in the market, once such a
move is permitted probably later this year by local
regulators.

   RasterOps Corp., riding strong demand for high-end
computer graphics products, estimated that earnings in its
fourth quarter ended June 30 exceeded analysts' forecasts
about 7%.
   Keith Sorenson, chief executive officer, said RasterOps
should post net income of 16 cents a share, or $809,600, on
revenue of $13 million. RasterOps, based in Santa Clara,
Calif., makes computer-peripherals, including high-end color
monitors and graphics devices for desktop computers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most analysts are expecting RasterOps to report net of 15
cents a share on revenue of $12 million. RasterOps is
expected to release its financial results today.
   In the year-ago period, the company earned $301,000, or
three cents a share, on $7.2 million in revenue.
   This is the first time RasterOps has disclosed quarterly
results since its initial public stock offering in May. The
stock was offered at $12 and closed Friday at $16.75 in
over-the-counter trading.
   Founded three years ago, RasterOps has ridden burgeoning
demand for computers used in publishing and graphic arts. In
recent years, Apple Computer Inc. has been the major supplier
to the arts and publishing world because its Macintosh
computers are designed to process and display graphics. Apple
offers large-screen monitors and extra circuit boards that
improve its standard machines, but it did so only after
RasterOps and several other companies carved out the market.
   About 85% of RasterOps's sales come from Macintosh-related
products, but the company is moving quickly to piggyback its
business onto that of International Business Machines Corp.,
the largest supplier of personal computers, and Sun
Microsystems Inc., the biggest supplier of workstations.
   This week, RasterOps expects to begin shipping its first
products for IBM's PS/2 line of personal computers. The
company already sells products for Sun's Sparcstation models,
desktop machines popular with engineers and scientists.
   RasterOps also intends to build peripheral devices for
Digital Equipment Corp.'s computers. Today, the company will
announce plans to develop devices for Digital's machines that
provide improved color and live video feeds or television in
a window on the monitor's screen.

Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee -- including some
from Sen. Shelby. Things looked so bleak that in an unusual
statement before the full Senate, committee Chairman Donald
Riegle (D., Mich.) said that Mr. Ryan's approval appeared
unlikely. But Sen. Shelby, acknowledging that he had
"vacillated" on the decision, surprised the panel by
providing the swing vote in an 11-10 victory for Mr. Ryan.
   Mr. Roberts, 39 years old, said in an interview that he
knew nothing about the White House's motives for his
nomination, and contended that "basically, I intend to be a
prudent regulator." Sen. Shelby couldn't be reached for
comment over the weekend.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Roberts will fill one of
the commission's two Democratic seats and would succeed
Joseph Grundfest, a free-market Democrat who left the
commission in January. Mr. Roberts wasn't a hand-picked
choice of Chairman Richard Breeden, agency officials said,
though Mr. Breeden apparently had veto power over the
selection, which he obviously opted not to exercise.
   Mr. Roberts said that he expects to bring legislative
expertise to the panel, which currently comprises securities
lawyer Edward Fleischman, former Time Inc. counsel Philip
Lochner Jr., former futures-industry attorney Mary Schapiro
and Mr. Breeden, a securities and banking lawyer. Mr. Roberts
is also a lawyer.
   The nominee's legislative background could help the
commission in situations where it wants Capitol Hill
assistance, Mr. Roberts said. For example, he said he would
like to see the commission work with Congress to cobble
together a definition of insider trading -- an area in which
a recent appeals court ruling may force the agency to rethink
which cases it brings. Prior efforts to create such a
definition have encountered heavy resistance on Capitol Hill.
   Mr. Roberts also said he plans to help the commission
press its recently stepped-up enforcement effort. "I think
the commission has a strong tradition in the enforcement
area," he said. "I'd be interested in joining them to push
these very important basic investor safeguards."
   In other areas, Mr. Roberts said he hopes to help the
commission "strengthen investor confidence in our securities
markets." He said he favors "circuit breakers," which set
artificial stopping points to allow the markets to take
breathers during sharp price moves. But he added that he
wouldn't back a ban of program trading because "I don't think
you can take people's computers away from them."
   He also said he generally agrees with Sen. Shelby's view
on corporate governance and takeover issues. In the past,
Sen. Shelby has supported confidential voting in proxy
fights, forcing shareholder votes on whether a company may
adopt a "poison pill" takeover defense and forcing
shareholder votes on "golden parachutes," in which managers
get large cash payouts in the event of a takeover.
   Mr. Roberts, a native of Birmingham, Ala., also worked for
Sen. Shelby in the House, where the congressman was a member
of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the SEC.
When Sen. Shelby was elected to the Senate, Mr. Roberts moved
with him as his administrative assistant. In April, Mr.
Roberts left the senator's staff to join the Washington
office of the Alabama law firm of Miller, Hamilton, Snider &amp;
Odom.

   Commodities:
   Higher Oil Prices Will Eventually Crimp Demand
   For Copper and Other Base Metals, Dealers Say

   LONDON -- Higher oil prices will eventually crimp the
demand for copper and other base metals, dealers say.
   "The negative impact on world economic growth is likely to
reduce consumption of base metals," says Hans Murmann,
managing director of Metallgesellschaft Ltd. in London.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By paying more for gasoline and heating oil, consumers
will have less money to spend on washing machines,
refrigerators and automobiles, he says. And because profit
growth is already under pressure, many companies are
beginning to postpone plans to invest in plant and equipment.
   "I was edgy about the copper market before the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait," Mr. Murmann says. "Now, I am downright
concerned."
   During the oil crises of the 1970s, base metals prices
initially surged before declining, says Angus MacMillan,
analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals Ltd. This time around,
high interest rates and slack economies could restrain the
market, he says.
   Copper futures prices peaked at $1.29 a pound last week
and the September contract closed at $1.2550 on Friday, down
3.4 cents from Thursday but up from $1.05 in June. The summer
surge was the result of reduced supplies from Chile, Peru and
Zambia and a spurt in orders from a Japanese buyer, London
dealers say.
   But since the middle of July, London Metal Exchange stocks
jumped to 104,000 metric tons from 46,000 tons. While the
rise in stocks indicates there isn't a critical shortage of
copper, dealers say, Japanese buyers withdrew on Friday as
soon as they became worried about higher oil prices.
Moreover, producers are taking advantage of the higher price
levels by hedging future production on the metals exchange,
dealers say.
   Previous to last week, the copper, zinc and other base
metals markets ignored the U.S. economic slowdown because of
surging orders in Japan, other Far Eastern countries and West
Germany, dealers say.
   But Far Eastern nations are geared to imported oil and a
prolonged period of higher petroleum prices will hurt their
economies, dealers say. As a result, metals consumption could
wane.
   Earlier this year, dealers were also optimistic on hopes
that the liberalization of Eastern Europe would eventually
generate a boom in base metals demand, dealers say. Instead,
Eastern European mines are selling more copper and zinc to
Western merchants, dealers say. Demand at home is weak.
   "The market was far too optimistic, says Philip Sewell, a
consultant at Commodities Research Unit Ltd. in London. His
company is forecasting a drop in Eastern European metals
consumption in the next three to four years, he says.
   Now that the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have
abandoned their special trading relationship, Mr. Sewell
says, they must import oil and other commodities at free
market prices. That situation means they must export as much
as they can.
   Eastern Europe produces 800,000 tons of copper, nearly 10%
of world output, he says. About half the copper comes from
Poland, the fourth largest producer in the world.
   Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Poland are also large-scale
miners of lead and zinc, Mr. Sewell says. And scrapped
equipment from obsolete factories in East Germany and other
Eastern states could also raise supplies of base metals, he
notes.
   "The destruction of the Iron Curtain is a statement of
bankruptcy, which will increase the burden on Western
Europe," says Roger Hornett, a director of Sassoon (Europe)
Ltd., London securities dealers. Meanwhile across Europe,
steel prices have fallen as demand softened, bulk chemical
prices have dropped drastically and increased competition has
produced a price war in the auto market.
   Despite these concerns, other analysts are confident that
base metals prices will hold firm.
   "I will only be worried if oil prices soar to $30 a
barrel," says Neil Buxton, metals analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton. At current oil prices, economic growth will underpin
demand for base metals, he says. Meanwhile, a "myriad of
supply problems and political unrest in major producing
nations" should keep the market tight, he says.
   Edwin Arnold, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner &amp; Smith in London, predicts copper prices will recover
because the major economies are unlikely to slip into
recession.
   Looking ahead to commodities markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   U.S. petroleum futures prices are expected to continue
their meteoric rise this week, driven mostly by the response
of the industrialized world to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. An
embargo by the U.S., echoed in Japan and Europe, of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti goods including oil, can't help but push world crude
prices higher. Late last week, even before economic sanctions
were announced outside the U.S., crude prices gained as much
as $3.50 a barrel in a day's trading, with outer months on
the New York Mercantile Exchange reaching their trading
limits immediately and staying there. Refiners have increased
their posted prices for crude oil and service stations are
already passing the costs on to motorists.
   Traders and analysts will be relying on their considerable
international intelligence gathering mechanisms this week to
figure out what Iraq President Saddam Hussein has in mind for
Kuwait's oil production, now that Iraqi troops have begun
their exit from that tiny sheikdom. Prices could falter a bit
as rumors that Iraq would proceed to Saudi Arabia are proved
untrue.
                                                                                                       

   Gold
                                                                                                       

   This week promises more of the same volatility that shook
the gold market following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   December gold futures ended little changed, up only 50
cents an ounce at $386.40. The uncertainty of the market was
reflected in the inconclusive ending, which was about in the
middle of a trading range of almost $9. After falling at the
start in a continuation of selling from late Thursday, the
December contract rose on a report that Iraq had massed
troops on the Saudi Arabian border and had even penetrated
Saudi soil.
   This report was later denied, causing prices to fall. They
retreated further on another report that the Soviet Union had
been assured Iraq would soon withdraw its troops from Kuwait.
   They fell still further just before the close on a news
service report that said Iraq's president would meet with his
defeated opponent, Kuwait's Emir, Sheik Jabar al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, in Saudi Arabia.
   "The most anyone can foresee at the moment is that the
principals are going to sit down and talk about the
situation," says Alan Posnick, senior vice president of MTB
Banking. "That creates the perception that a solution might
be found, which would be negative for gold."
   However, until there is a resolution, this week will see a
continuation of the nervous volatility in gold prices, Mr.
Posnick says.
                                                                                                       

   Livestock and Meats
                                                                                                       

   Last week featured a roller-coaster ride of gains and
retreats in the prices of pork-belly and hog futures
contracts, and this week isn't likely to be much different.
Analysts predicted a choppy week of trading, especially in
pork-belly futures, as dual pressures of relatively strong
demand and increasing fresh supplies of slaughtered hogs push
prices up and down.
   Hog slaughter increased about 9% last week from the
previous week. On Wednesday and Thursday, as more fresh pork
became available, demand decreased for frozen pork bellies
out of storage, exerting downward pressure on pork-belly
futures prices. Yet demand is fairly strong, which caused
prices to rebound Friday and likely will continue as a price
factor this week. Pork bellies are used to make bacon, and
low cash prices for pork bellies have generated interest in
bacon among retailers, says Thomas Morgan, president of
Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill.

   Saddam in the Shadow of His Undoing

   It is easy to see on a map, in color, that the land
between the Tigris and the Euphrates has what most of the
Middle East lacks -- water. In addition, Iraq's position,
expanse, arable land, and oil might suggest to someone even
other than a compulsive empire-builder like Saddam Hussein
the possibility of making the country the leader of the Arab
nation, as it was in the days of the caliphs. Although the
world has never known an empire that did not require many
generations to create, men like Napoleon, Hitler, Nasser, and
Saddam are willing to race their mortality against the
overwhelming inertia of history and its clearest and most
apparent laws. The rashness born of their impatience always
leads them through a string of bright victories to the
darkest chamber of defeat. In the light of his victories,
Saddam inspires fear and doubt, but he is moving in the
shadow of his undoing.
   Those who urge the United States to reduce its military
capacity because they say the world is safe will now call for
restraint because the world is dangerous. Forgetting that
even under President Carter the United States pledged to
defend the Persian Gulf against even the Russians, even with
nuclear weapons, "pragmatists" will not understand Saddam's
99% discount. Their habitual alternation of nonchalance and
fear will lead them to the conviction that he holds all the
cards. If, uninfluenced by dreams of a world permanently
cleansed of war, one looks clearly at Saddam's hand, one can
see that he actually holds very few.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His is a country of 17 million people arrayed against the
many hundreds of millions in the countries he antagonizes, of
a GDP of $40 billion as opposed to the nearly $15 trillion of
NATO and Japan. He is surrounded by enemies, unfriendly
allies, seas he cannot control, and desert that would eat his
columns as readily as it would soak up water. Although he is
cheered on by Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Yasser Arafat, and King
Hussein, this only means that his friends are either insane,
impertinent, or afraid, which guarantees him very little in a
pinch. The Iraqi population is three-quarters urban, and
therefore vulnerable to the kind of civil and industrial
disruption to which Vietnam, for example, was not.
   The list of development projects and foreign contractors
in Iraq is almost as long as that detailing the Iraqi debt.
Without foreign activity and foreign trade, which accounts
for a third of its gross domestic product, Iraq stops short,
and so do Saddam's megalomaniacal ambitions. Not only is he
dependent upon the industrialized world for his major
weaponry, his primary income, and the necessities of his
economy, but his oil facilities, dams, and precious few
routes of communication are eminently bombable, burstable,
and blockadable.
   Iraq is like an island in the desert. It can be virtually
shut down by dealing with a very short list of targets: the
multiple pipelines and associated pumping stations that
convey oil to the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Persian
Gulf; the half a dozen major roads leading out, and a like
number of international railroads and internal feeder lines,
all with reference to bridges and viaducts; hydroelectric and
flood control dams; aqueducts; and ports, which need not be
destroyed but only blocked, either close-in with mines, or at
more remote choke points and straits.
   Further to his disadvantage, Saddam's timing is no more
precise than Hitler's military astrology. The American and
allied response is now favored not only by the fundamental
measures of power but by an extraordinary coalition of
historical coincidences. In threatening the world's oil
supply, Saddam reduces the equation of national interests to
its prime factors and stimulates every industrialized nation
to militate against him. Just a few years ago, the Soviet
Union would have been the threat behind Saddam, as China was
with Vietnam, protecting it from unrestrained American
action. Now the Soviets are more like a threat with which
Saddam must contend, and from which, he recently has been
told, most of his arms and spare parts will no longer
continue to flow. The Soviets will probably be delighted to
demonstrate the new world order that they proclaim -- and
upon which their domestic tranquility curiously depends -- by
close cooperation with the western powers during this crisis.
   While oil prices are rising, Iran may see a temporary
advantage in acquiescence to the occupation of Kuwait, but as
soon as Iraq is properly overextended Iran will be tempted to
attack it, and no one knows this better than Saddam Hussein.
Although the radical Arabs and leftist fronts in the Arab
world will hope for a complete conquest of the Gulf, the real
powers -- Egypt, Syria, and the Gulf States themselves --
will accommodate the enemies of Iraq even while piously
invoking non-existent Arab solidarity.
   If it is all so easy, then why is it so difficult? If the
broad correlation of forces runs overwhelmingly against
Saddam, how can he move with impunity? He just acts
naturally. In this instance he intimidates the world by
holding Saudi Arabia hostage, using the threat of invasion to
discourage a proper reaction to the subjugation of Kuwait.
More specifically, he hopes that by threatening the Saudis he
will deter a blockade of Iraq and enjoy his recent conquests
free of charge.
   If Iraq's original intent were to strike Saudi Arabia, it
would have no reason to have paused in Kuwait and alerted the
whole world. Kuwait is neither the seat of military
opportunity nor a point of requisite consolidation. But, like
Nasser after he surpassed his own expectations in blockading
the Straits of Tiran, Saddam may be sufficiently emboldened
by success to follow his options as they are created. Still,
if he does strike south, either now or next time, the game is
not over.
   His vaunted army is fit mainly for attacking fat and
defenseless sheiks or fighting the most primitive war of
attrition. The army began the conflict with Iran knowing
little other than the worn Soviet doctrine of static defense,
and exited a world leader in mowing down waves of suicidal
Iranian teen-agers. The Iraqi air force is fairly impressive
on paper but nearly somnolent in the air. Iraqi conscripts
are sick of war, and their generals have never had to fight
at a distance even halfway that of the potential Saudi
objectives. Their lines of communication, in flat treeless
terrain, would become a shooting gallery for the United
States once it took control of the skies, something that is
entirely possible if the Saudis will finally summon the grit
necessary to defend themselves other than by jumping in bed
with their tormenters. Absent Saudi conversion, little can be
done, but, with everything to lose, the Saudis may now summon
enough backbone to allow someone else to fight their battles
for them. If they don't, they are finished by their own
invitation.
   Several American and European air wings, staging through
Egypt, could settle on the assiduously prepared Saudi bases
and, in conjunction with half a dozen aircraft carriers in
the Arabian Sea and the eastern Mediterranean, B-52s from
Diego Garcia, and cruise missiles from almost anywhere, make
an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia the wrong decision. With
Iran, Syria, and, in limited fashion, Israel ready to move on
Iraq if the best of its forces tarry in the desert, the
Iraqis must hold back an enormous reserve. The "million-man
army" of television lore would be reduced in Saudi Arabia to
an expeditionary force that could be cut off, pieced apart,
and destroyed by NATO air power and light forces. Nor are
Western rapid deployment forces the only timely response. No
strangers to fighting in the Arabian Peninsula, the Egyptians
could ferry well equipped armored divisions across the narrow
Straits of Tiran to a paved Saudi road directly opposite, or
transit small sections of Israel and Jordan even faster.
   A hundred ways exist to apply huge reserves of military
and economic power, vastly superior to that of the Iraqis, to
deter an Iraqi invasion or dislodge Iraqi invaders. It is
simply a matter of will, and in this the Saudis above all
should heed the lesson of Rukn al-Din, an Ismaili chieftain
who failed to stem the Mongol conquest, because he could not
summon enough faith in his impressive power to resist. At the
Battle of 'Ain Jalut the Mongols were finally stopped by the
Egyptian Mamluk Baybars, who had formed a temporary allience
with the Crusaders. It wasn't that Baybars was so strong, it
was that the Mongols had overextended themselves.
   Saddam Hussein wants us to believe that if we dare defend
our interests, if we blockade Iraq until Kuwait is free, he
will move on Saudi Arabia. But we can defend Saudi Arabia,
or, if necessary, retake it. By all means the United States
and its allies should enlist the cooperation of the Saudis,
make meticulous preparations for their defense, and call
Saddam's bluff.

   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of newsprint in June
dropped 3.4% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
95% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 762,000 metric tons of
newsprint in June, compared with 789,000 a year earlier. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the first six months, output fell 1.9% to 4,733,000
metric tons from 4,826,000 a year earlier.
   The June operating rate of 95% was down from 97% in May
and unchanged from a year earlier.
   June shipments fell less than 1% to 804,000 metric tons
from 809,000 a year earlier. Shipments to the U.S. fell, and
shipments to Canada and other markets rose. In the first
half, shipments rose less than 1% to 4,738,000 metric tons
from 4,705,000 a year earlier.

   Star Wars Program Is Jolted as Senate
   Reverses Its Longtime Bipartisan Support

   WASHINGTON -- The $289 billion Pentagon spending bill
approved by the Senate relegates Star Wars research, once the
leading symbol of America's military buildup in the 1980s, to
the back burner.
   Reversing six years of solid bipartisan support, the
Senate voted by a surprisingly large 54-44 margin to
effectively bar deployment of any proposed space-based
anti-missile system for at least a decade -- and probably
much longer. Lawmakers for the first time imposed strict
spending limits and long-range priorities on the program's
various technologies, thereby frustrating Bush administration
hopes of beginning in the next few years to put up thousands
of small rockets -- dubbed Brilliant Pebbles -- designed to
provide a shield against Soviet or Third World missiles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While still earmarking $3.67 billion for the overall
research program, now called the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the vote nevertheless reflects fundamental
changes in Congress's fiscal and strategic view of the world.
Despite loud complaints from the Pentagon, strong objections
from Senate Republican leaders and even hints of a veto, the
Senate essentially decided to turn the program into another
long-term research effort -- one that most likely will be
forced to fight further cuts year after year.
   "We're still fighting the . . . Cold War with Reagan
relics," asserted longtime SDI critic Sen. Tom Harkin (D.,
Iowa), "and SDI is the biggest relic of them all." Sen. Jeff
Bingaman (D., N.M.) who led the fight to reshape the
program's goals, complained during the debate that lawmakers
over the years gave SDI managers "a blank check" because it
remained "the only area in the defense budget {lacking}
direction from Congress." Before the vote, Sen. Bingaman
blasted the Pentagon for pursuing "the craziness" of seeking
early deployment.
   SDI's problems have been building for a long time. Since
the mid-1980s, Pentagon brass have shifted gears several
times as to what would be the most effective network of
space-based and land-based interceptors. Congressional
investigators and Air Force auditors have complained about
inadequate financial controls. Just last month, the Senate
Armed Services Committee's report on the authorization bill
for the fiscal year starting in October complained that
members don't "endorse an arbitrary deadline" embraced by the
White House for shifting Brilliant Pebbles from the
laboratory into space.
   But above all, the Senate's turnabout was evident in the
comments of moderate and pro-defense Democrats, including
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.),
who steadfastly has supported the Pentagon on the issue but
this time voted to clip its wings. "No one can tell you where
the money is coming from, and yet they're charging straight
ahead" toward deployment, Sen. Nunn said.
   Even the Senate's rejection of amendments calling for
deeper overall SDI spending cuts is likely to be a
short-lived victory for the White House. Support for the
program is considerably weaker in the House, which could
reduce SDI funding to about $2 billion for next fiscal year.
The administration requested nearly $4.7 billion for fiscal
1991, but even supporters conceded that SDI outlays would
have to climb to twice that level by the mid-1990s in order
to seriously consider deploying actual hardware.
   Leading the battle for the administration, Sen. Malcolm
Wallop (R., Wyo.) said too many lawmakers are "in absolute
terror of coming to grips with the reality . . . of building
real systems to help real people." The new restrictions on
the program, he said, ensure that "near-term promises will be
put on the shelf for long-term promises, which will then be
put on the shelf again for longer-term promises."
   Sen. Bingaman and Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), the
other leading proponent of restructuring the program, contend
that their approach is the only way to retain robust SDI
funding. But the administration and its congressional
supporters have noted that laboratories and research
facilities in the two states Sens. Bingaman and Shelby
represent are bound to benefit the most from the changes.
   The defense bill, approved by bleary-eyed senators
Saturday afternoon after they slogged through more than 100
amendments and came back to the Senate floor following a
marathon session lasting into the early morning hours, also
reaches out in some other new directions. Paving the way for
the deepest cuts in military spending since the end of World
War II, the measure withholds production or full-scale
development money for four of the Pentagon's major aircraft
programs, seeks to cut 100,000 troops from the active-duty
force by the fall of 1991, and leaves in limbo further
spending on mobile MX missiles and the Navy's superquiet
Seawolf attack submarines.
   The bill also continues production of the B-2 Stealth
bomber if the plane passes radar-eluding tests. And it
provides the most extensive proposals since the mid-1960s to
enhance reserve forces and provide medical, financial and
other assistance for officers and troops being forced out of
the military for budget reasons. The Senate also rejected
efforts to limit spending on anti-satellite weapons, mothball
additional battleships, and shift money from the Pentagon for
drug treatment and other social programs.

   Raynes Will Sell
   Real Estate Firm
   To Macklowe

   Real estate investor Martin J. Raynes agreed on Friday to
sell a real estate company that manages $3.5 billion in New
York residential properties to the Macklowe Organization, a
New York real estate development, construction and hotel
management company.
   The move capped a week of restructuring that also cost Mr.
Raynes his general partnership in a massive Manhattan
cooperative conversion project. As a specialist in apartment
conversions, Mr. Raynes built a residential real estate
empire in the 1980s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Neither party disclosed how much Macklowe paid for the
operation, which manages 11,300 cooperative apartments in New
York City. Macklowe's executive vice president, Kent Swig,
said the cash transaction would be financed by the Macklowe
company.
   Mr. Swig said that his company had been "looking to go
into third-party management for some time now." He said,
"Under the present contracts, it's not a tremendously
profitable operation." But he predicted that co-op boards
would be willing to pay more for improved services under
future contracts.
   Earlier in the week, Mr. Raynes was forced to restructure
his debt with Chase Manhattan Bank in connection with the
troubled Lincoln Towers cooperative conversion project in
Manhattan. In exchange for refinancing a $5.5 million
personal loan guarantee that Mr. Raynes failed to meet, Chase
required him to cede control over the 6,200-apartment
conversion project to his two partners in the deal, Mendik
Co., a large New York property owner, and the Equitable Life
Assurance Society of the United States.
   The Lincoln Towers project was the largest in a string of
acquisitions by Mr. Raynes that he planned to convert into
cooperatives and sell to investors as tax shelters. The 1986
Tax Reform Act, however, eliminated the tax-shelter incentive
for investors to buy co-ops occupied by renters. The
subsequent collapse of real estate prices saddled Mr. Raynes
with maintenance obligations for many apartments still
occupied by renters. Earlier this year, his company, M.J.
Raynes Inc., also lost control over 1,900 apartments on the
Upper East Side.
   Other real estate developers suggested that Mr. Raynes's
cash squeeze forced him to sell his co-op management business
last week.
   But a spokeswoman for Mr. Raynes said the sale was not
connected to the debt restructuring. She characterized the
sale as part of the "winding down of his entire apartment
conversion business." She described the managment business as
only "marginally profitable."
   The sale, she said, would leave Mr. Raynes with a small
real estate company that would focus on the massive Hunter's
Point mixed-use project in Queens, in which Mr. Raynes is an
investor, as well as on marketing for other developers.

   Court Blocks Bid
   To Make S&amp;L Chief
   Set Aside Money

   A Los Angeles federal judge invalidated a novel government
order that would have forced former Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association Chief Executive Officer Thomas Spiegel to place
$21 million in escrow before a hearing on charges that he
wasted assets of the insolvent thrift for personal gain.
   Judge Stephen Wilson held that the Office of Thrift
Supervision exceeded its authority when it made the escrow
demand last month as part of an administrative complaint
against Mr. Spiegel. Mr. Spiegel is charged with misapplying
$21 million in thrift funds for a variety of personal uses.
The OTS also is seeking a $5 million civil penalty. The case
is considered the largest single civil matter that thrift
regulators have brought against an individual.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judge Wilson held that, under relevant federal statutes
passed by Congress, the OTS was limited to taking emergency
action only in cases where there was evidence of ongoing or
future harm to an institution, as opposed to cases in which
it was acting primarily to correct past alleged abuses. Mr.
Spiegel hasn't been an official of the Beverly Hills, Calif.,
thrift since last December, and thus hasn't been in a
position to affect the affairs of the institution, his
attorneys argued. The government had argued that there was a
threat that Mr. Spiegel might move his assets offshore or
otherwise dissipate them.
   Judge Wilson also held that the order would have resulted
in an unconstitutional taking of property without a hearing.
   Previously, the judge had temporarily barred the
government from enforcing the order, and late Friday he made
his decision permanent. The government could appeal the
ruling. OTS officials couldn't be reached.
   Rather than a major turning point in the case, the
decision is more of a public relations blow to government
regulators' recent efforts to assume a tough-cop legal
posture against operators of troubled or failed S&amp;Ls.
   Dennis Perluss, Mr. Spiegel's lawyer in Los Angeles, said
he was "delighted" at the ruling. In the past, he said,
thrift regulators have "only been interested in taking
actions before an administrative hearing that were designed
to prevent future injury, such as to remove an officer. What
we had is a much more aggressive and far-reaching action. In
effect, they wanted the judgment to be paid in advance."
   Mr. Perluss added, however, that he understood that the
OTS was considering adding charges to its complaint against
Mr. Spiegel. A hearing on all charges is currently scheduled
for Sept. 4 in Los Angeles.
   Columbia's insolvency reflects nearly $1 billion in losses
from declining values and losses in junk bonds that Mr.
Spiegel and Columbia purchased, largely from Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. and junk-bond chief Michael Milken. Despite the
losses, Columbia hasn't been taken over by regulators,
although a takeover is considered likely. The thrift's new
managers recently agreed to sell the junk-bond portfolio to a
Canadian investor partnership for $3 billion.

   U.S., Japanese Technology-Sharing Stalls

   Pentagon Inertia in Defense
   Field Seems Obstacle

   The U.S. military's decade-long campaign to reverse the
one-way flow of technology to Japan has been stalled by
persistent bureaucratic snafus, government and industry
officials said.
   The major obstacle to sharing defense technology appears
to be U.S. government inertia. Even U.S. officials admit that
the Defense Department has been slow to make crucial
personnel decisions, submit specific requests for cooperation
to Japan and respond to feelers from Tokyo.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It continues to be a very low priority for the Pentagon,"
says Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.), chairman of a Senate
Armed Services subcommittee advocating closer U.S.-Japanese
cooperation. "The military still has the general attitude
that if it's worth knowing, we pretty much know it here."
   Sen. Bingaman's committee recently tried to jump-start the
process by authorizing more than $20 million for cooperative
research between the two nations. But despite encouragement
from major U.S. defense contractors, the record is one of
missed opportunities.
   In spite of growing concern about America's dependence on
Japan for basic security needs, no new technology transfer
projects have been discussed for nearly two years. That is
when the last meeting of the main bilateral forum overseeing
Japan's efforts took place. A session was scheduled for last
month, but was delayed, until November at the earliest,
officials familiar with the process say.
   U.S. defense officials complain that they are preoccupied
with more pressing matters these days, such as trying to
salvage their budget in the post-Cold War era. But the issue
of U.S. technology ties to Japan -- both military and
commercial -- will grow only more urgent.
   Recent Defense Department studies have warned of Japan's
growing control of crucial military technologies. The flap
over the FSX fighter plane last year stemmed from growing
U.S. fear that Japan was taking U.S. military technology to
build its industrial base, while the U.S. was getting little
in return.
   Overall, Japan had a 126 billion yen (US$844 million)
technology transfer deficit with the U.S. in 1988, according
to a study released last week by Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, or MITI. The same study
showed that Japan sends 10 times more researchers to U.S.
labs than the number of U.S. researchers it hosts. The
ministry, sensitive to charges of technology sponging, says
it is drafting policies to encourage Japanese companies to
share their research, patents and licenses.
   U.S. military interest in tapping Japan's technology
started more than a decade ago, as it became clear the
Japanese wanted to develop their own independent advanced
weaponry. In 1980, the two sides set up the Systems and
Technology Forum. From that came then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's 1983 decision to exempt the U.S. from a post-war
ban on military exports, and to encourage the flow of
"dual-use" technologies, which have commercial and martial
applications.
   But since the first official steps toward that goal,
efforts by the two sides have generated little more than
paperwork. "Things didn't happen as I expected at the time,"
says Hiroo Kinoshita, who spearheaded Japan's technology
transfer activities in the 1980s at Japan's Defense Agency
and at MITI.
   The biggest reason for lack of recent progress appears to
be disarray at the Defense Department. The deputy
undersecretary for international programs is officially
responsible for such matters, but the post has been filled by
a temporary appointee since October. The result, critics say,
is that technology-sharing has been left in the lap of
mid-level bureaucrats who lack the clout to get things done.
   Many Pentagon officials also say the government, despite
making general noises about wanting more technology from
Japan, rarely makes specific requests. "If they know what
they want to receive, they could ask for it," says Mr.
Kinoshita. He notes that "people from DOD have their own
programs" and "If they allow the transfer of technology from
Japan, it will become unnecessary."
   Many U.S. government officials privately concur. "DOD is
really punting on this," says one U.S. official closely
involved in the process.
   Philosophical differences, meanwhile, split the two
nations. The Japanese are proposing joint development in
specialized areas where the two nations are probably even,
according to U.S. officials. But the U.S. is targeting basic
technologies where the Japanese have a clear lead, with the
objective of getting U.S. companies steeped in those
practices.
   Indeed, many Japanese companies still have "a lingering
reluctance to get involved in a project, particularly if it
involves any public attention to Japanese technology going
into weapons development," says James E. Auer, who recently
retired from the Defense Department, and now runs a center
for U.S.-Japan studies at Vanderbilt University.
   U.S. companies say Japan is very slow about turning over
dual-use technologies, and some U.S. Defense Department
officials say they complained last year to MITI that Japan
was blocking such exports.
   The FSX agreement, finally signed earlier this year, was
the first major technology-sharing project. While most of the
attention focused on U.S. transfers to Japan, Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Ltd. did agree to share a handful of its
proprietary technologies with General Dynamics Corp. But
experts in both countries believe it was such a painful
process that it might damage prospects for major technology
sharing.
   "With the FSX, we tried to do too much too soon," Sen.
Bingaman notes. "Concentrating on cooperative agreements on a
smaller scale," he adds, "can build trust" while providing
"practical economic and military benefits for both
countries."
   A few smaller-scale projects have been discussed. One of
the first official projects involving surface-to-air missile
technology fell apart after Toshiba Corp., the developer, was
blacklisted by the U.S. government for a subsidiary's
technology sale to the Soviet Union. The Japanese
subsequently did turn over to the U.S. know-how in two cases
involving naval ship repair.
   The last official meeting of the Systems and Technology
Forum was in October 1988, though it was originally supposed
to take place every six months. During that session, Japan
presented a list of five technologies it wanted to codevelop
with the U.S. The Americans expressed interest in three of
the proposals: rocket engines, missile seekers, and
detection-shields for submarines. The two sides have
exchanged notes but have done little work since.
   During a February visit to Tokyo, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney handed the Japanese a list of general
technologiescomposite materials, large-scale integrated
circuits, gallium arsenide semiconductors, artificial
intelligence, phased-array radar, and genetic engineering --
that the U.S. wants better access to. But there has been no
official followup, U.S. and Japanese officials say.

   To Name a Chief
   Of M&amp;A Operation

   NEW YORK -- Oppenheimer &amp; Co. will name a new mergers
chief and launch a restructuring group in a bid to beef up
its deal-making presence.
   The securities firm plans to announce today that Managing
Director Edward C. Stanton III will lead its 10-member
mergers-and-acquisition department. It also will name Charles
A. Tulloh III to head a new restructuring group, and J. Brian
McGrath to run the firm's leisure and entertainment group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Stanton, 47 years old, fills a void left since early
1989, when former Oppenheimer merger head John Sanzo left for
First Boston Corp. Since 1987, Mr. Stanton has been a
co-general partner at a Houston leveraged buy-out fund; he
earlier had worked as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers
and Blyth Eastman Dillon.
   In an interview, he conceded that Oppenheimer "needs more
M&amp;A firepower"; the firm has never been a force in investment
banking. But he said Oppenheimer plans to move slowly. "We
don't want to do anything outlandishly aggressive," he said.
   Mr. Stanton expects energy companies, including oil and
gas exploration concerns and electric utilities, to be
acquisition candidates in the coming months. The
financial-services areas, particularly banks and insurance
companies, also will be active, he said.
   Oppenheimer has a lot of mergers ground to make up. It has
advised on just 14 deals since January 1989, including six
with a disclosed value that totals just $166 million,
according to Securities Data Co.
   However, Mr. Stanton said, "You don't have to be No. 1 to
make a lot of money."
   Oppenheimer's investment banking department has a staff of
60; the firm has 2,400 employees, including 600 brokers.
   Mr. Tulloh, 44, joins Oppenheimer as a senior vice
president from Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, where he built and
directed the bank's commercial-credit recovery group. At
Oppenheimer, he will arrange exchange offers, debt
restructurings and private placements, among other things.
   Still, some analysts say Oppenheimer is getting into the
restructuring game late; big Wall Street firms have been
jostling to repair the problems at debt-laden companies since
before the collapse of the junk-bond market last fall.
   Oppenheimer "wasn't a major reason for the overleveraging
of corporate America," Mr. Stanton said. "Maybe it'll have a
niche in restructuring."
   Mr. McGrath, 48, will head the firm's leisure and
entertainment investment-banking group, based in Los Angeles.
Since 1988, Mr. McGrath has been a management consultant to
the entertainment industry; he earlier had been president and
chief executive officer of Coca-Cola's international
entertainment operations and spent 10 years at Viacom
International.

14-week strike at the Anglo-Irish glass and dinnerware
maker's crystal division, which ended in July, will hurt 1990
earnings, but he didn't make any specific forecasts.
   In a letter to shareholders, he said, "The strike has been
extremely damaging to us, both in financial and human terms,"
though new work rules should result in "significant cost
savings" in the future; the crystal division's plant was shut
in the April strike, when workers refused to implement a
cost-cutting plan. "The heavy costs associated with the
strike will clearly have a seriously negative effect on our
1990 results," he said, "but it is obviously premature for me
to make any forecasts of a financial nature at this time."

   Mr. Kilroy also said supply difficulties and a weak dollar
"were working seriously against us." The company depends
heavily on the U.S. market.

   Bongrain S.A. said its consolidated revenue rose 7% in the
first half of 1990 to 4.36 billion French francs ($821
million) from 4.09 billion francs in the year-earlier period.
   The French food group said in a communique that after
adjustments for changes in group structure and exchange
rates, the sales gain would have been limited to 1.7%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It didn't elaborate on the structural changes, but
significant acquisitions made by Bongrain since the first
half of 1989 include the Italian cheese group Ludovico S.p.a.
Bongrain also bought the California dairy company Alta-Dena
Inc. in February 1989.
   For all of 1989, it reported consolidated net profit of
391 million francs after payments to minority interests, on
revenue of 8.48 billion francs.

   Nevada Power Co. said second-quarter profit fell 49.6%
because of cooler than normal weather, the effects of a rate
decrease and higher costs of service for a growing customer
base.
   For the quarter, Las Vegas-based Nevada Power posted net
income of $6.5 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with
year-ago profit of $13 million, or 46 cents a share. There
were 28.6 million shares outstanding in the recent quarter
compared with 26.7 million in the year-ago period.
Second-quarter revenues climbed 10% to $112.1 million from
$101.8 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the 12 months ended June 30, the utility reported net
income of $45 million, or $1.54 a share, down 14% from the
previous year's profit of $52.3 million, or $1.85 a share.
Revenues rose 6.3% to $441.6 million from $415.2 million a
year earlier. There were 27.3 million shares outstanding in
the recent 12 months compared with 26.7 million a year ago.
   Nevada Power said that lower rates went into effect April
1. Expenditures to maintain generating units and support to
service the company's rapidly growing customer base, which
increased at an annual rate of 9.7%, also hurt earnings.

   Cerus S.A. said that it has agreed to sell a 1% interest

first step toward unwinding its 15% stake in the Belgian
industrial holding company.
   A spokeswoman for Cerus, the French holding company of
Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti, declined to provide the
price for the sale, but 1% of Generale de Belgique can be
valued at about 2.09 billion Belgian francs ($63.9 million)
on the basis of 3,270 Belgian francs a share.

   As reported, Cerus built up its 15% interest during a

   Which Petroleum Stocks Will Gain
   The Most From Mideast Turmoil?

   Saddam Hussein's military moves have suddenly made
investors look at oil stocks in a new light.
   The prospect of shrinking supplies from the Middle East
propelled oil shares higher Thursday and Friday morning even
though stock prices generally were collapsing. Although the
oils weakened Friday afternoon on profit-taking, many market
strategists believe more gains lie ahead as oil prices
stabilize at higher levels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now that the first indiscriminate surge in oil stocks is
over, analysts are left to ponder which companies will be
helped most by the expected higher prices for crude.
   "My oil-price forecast is that oil prices will be whatever
Mr. Hussein says that he wants them to be," says a Friday
market bulletin from Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait "could lead down 50 different
paths, and 40 or 45 of them mean higher oil prices," says
Stephen A. Smith of Bear Stearns.
   "The whole stock market, unfortunately, is going down, and
oil basically is the only game in town," said Kidder Peabody
analyst William Brown in a Wall Street Journal television
interview Friday.
   Charles Maxwell of C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell, often
considered the dean of oil analysts, thinks oil prices will
average about $24 a barrel next year, up from about $20 this
year and $19.50 last year.
   To Bernard J. Picchi, Salomon Brothers' oil specialist,
companies involved mainly in exploration and production have
the advantage over those that also do a lot of refining and
marketing. For explorers, higher oil prices are a blessing.
For refiners, they're an added cost.
   Accordingly, Mr. Picchi's favorites are Oryx Energy and
Louisiana Land &amp; Exploration. Both are
exploration-and-production companies, both are mainly
domestic, and both produce a lot of natural gas.
   At the moment, Mr. Picchi notes, natural gas can produce a
given quantity of energy more cheaply than oil. And natural
gas is less polluting. Yet natural gas stocks haven't moved
up as much as oil stocks, partly because much gas use is
seasonal -- for home heating.
   After the pure explorers and producers, his next choices
lie in the realm of the big integrated companies -- those
that do refining and marketing of petroleum products, as well
as exploration and production. Mr. Picchi prefers those that
are "more production oriented," such as Atlantic Richfield
and Pennzoil.
   In the next tier, he places the large international oils
like Royal Dutch/Shell, Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and British
Petroleum. He says they're too large to grow very fast, and
they "tend to be fairly large refiners." They "will benefit,
but less than the first category," he says.
   Mr. Picchi says he'd be least likely to buy smaller
integrated oil companies "that have been mentioned repeatedly
as acquisition candidates" such as Murphy Oil, Amerada Hess,
and Kerr-McGee. In many cases they're "very fine companies,"
he says, but takeover speculation has bid up their prices too
much.
   Mr. Maxwell, the industry veteran, sees things
differently. He says people look down their noses at refining
because the business was typically unprofitable in the past.
But that reputation stems from the days when exploration
enjoyed big tax advantages. Back then, it was in the oil
companies' interest to run their business so that the profits
were attributed to the exploration side.
   Now the tax code has changed, he says, so this incentive
has vanished. Meanwhile, by his calculations, U.S. refineries
are running at about 95% of their true capacity, which is
often less than the officially stated capacity. Hence, he
doesn't view big refining operations as a drawback.
   Mr. Maxwell likes the international oils such as Chevron,
Mobil, Royal Dutch, British Petroleum and Texaco, with Exxon
"slightly behind." He reasons that it's too expensive to find
significant amounts of new oil in the U.S. Oil consumption is
growing fastest in the Far East and Europe, he says, which
should benefit the internationals.
   Mr. Maxwell also is fond of oil-service companies such as
Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Halliburton. However, he
cautions that "these companies have done so well, they are
now a little on the expensive side."
   Mr. Smith of Bear Stearns gives a little edge to domestic
producers. "Back in 1979, when oil was getting very
expensive, there was frequently a domestic premium," he
recalls. "I'll give a couple of extra points for having it
{oil} in a secure location."
   His three favorites are Atlantic Richfield, Amoco and
Unocal. He, too, favors producers with extensive natural-gas
operations and expects natural gas prices to catch up with
oil. Freak weather last year is one reason gas prices
currently lag, he said. The winter started with the coldest
December in decades, then turned unusually mild, leaving many
users stuck with oversupplies of gas.
   Walter Kass, a New York money manager, says he's getting
ready to take a flier on Devon Energy (traded on the American
Stock Exchange). He likes it because it's "all U.S., all
exploration." He plans to buy convertible preferred stock
rather than the common stock.
   Mr. Kass already owns one unusual energy play -- Maritrans
Partners, a master limited partnership traded on the Big
Board. Maritrans transports oil with tugboats and barges (its
stock symbol is TUG). Though it recently had an oil spill in
the New York area, Mr. Kass says it responded quickly to
minimize the damage.
   Marine transportation of oil is likely to be a growth
area, he says, because environmental concerns mean "you're
not going to see too many more pipelines built."
   Of course, not everyone is on the bullish side of energy
stocks. In a report dated July 27, just before the Iraqi
invasion, Sanford C. Bernstein strategist David Eisenberg
wrote that oil service stocks are "20% overvalued" and that
investors should "gradually cash in your winnings here." The
energy sector as a whole should be slightly underweighted,
Mr. Eisenberg wrote. He couldn't be reached for comment
Friday.
   Also, some analysts are fretting about the outlook for
companies that specialize in refining, since they will have
to pay more for oil to refine. For that reason, Dean Witter
Reynolds analyst Gene Nowak advised clients Thursday to avoid
Ashland Oil, Sun Co. and Mapco.
   ---
   Kuwait's rulers weren't the only royalty deposed by Iraq's
attack last week. By driving up oil stocks and punishing most
others, the Mideast war also helped dethrone General Electric
from the top of the stock market.
   GE reigned for just a week as the U.S. company with the
largest market capitalization -- defined as stock price times
the number of shares. It lost $2 billion of market value last
week as the shares slid to 69 3/4 from 72. Its market
capitalization fell to $61.98 billion from $63.98 billion.
   International Business Machines, long the U.S. leader in
market capitalization, also fell back to a market
capitalization of $61.98 billion at Friday's closing price of
108 1/8, down from $63.85 billion the week before.
   The new leader? Exxon, whose shares rose 3 1/8 last week
to close at 53 1/8, adding $3.9 billion in market value for a
total of $66.3 billion.

   Laidlaw Inc. said it increased its holdings in ADT Ltd. to
28.8%, from 27.7%.
   The transaction, which has an indicated value of $34.1
million, brings Laidlaw's stake in ADT to about 284.6 million
common shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The shares were acquired from Michael Ashcroft, a director
of ADT. Laidlaw granted Mr. Ashcroft an option to repurchase
the stock at the price the company paid for it, $3.10 a
share, for a period ending Dec. 31, 1999 -- an agreement
Laidlaw can terminate on six months' notice any time after
Jan. 15, 1993.
   A spokesman for Laidlaw said the Burlington, Ontario-based
transportation and waste-services concern would continue to
evaluate market and economic conditions before deciding to
purchase additional stock in ADT.
   Laidlaw earlier indicated it would be reluctant to
increase its stake in ADT beyond 30% because of British
takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more
than a 30% holding to extend an offer to the rest of the
company's holders.
   ADT is a Bermuda-based security services and auctions
concern. Laidlaw is 47%-controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd.,
a Montreal transportation, resources and industrial holding
concern.

   Loral Corp., a New York-based defense contractor, said it
definitively agreed to buy the Ford Aerospace Corp. unit of
Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich., for $715 million and the
assumption of some debt.
   Loral and Ford said jointly that the transaction is
subject to final regulatory approval and customary closing
conditions, and that they expect to complete the deal within
three months.

   Loral earlier won a bidding contest for Ford Aerospace. On
Friday, Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz and a Ford spokesman
said the terms of the transaction are basically unchanged
from the bid made late last month. At the time, a person
familiar with the bidding negotiations said the cash part of
Loral's bid was about $811 million. But Mr. Schwartz said
Loral and Ford hadn't disclosed any figures prior to Friday's
announcement.
   Loral said it doesn't plan now to shed any Ford Aerospace
operations or make any major changes.

   The Amalgamated Transit Union has begun negotiating with
Blackstone Group, a New York investment banking firm, on a
plan to buy Greyhound Lines Inc. "We are trying to put a deal
together that would lead to the purchase and reorganization
of Greyhound Lines and get striking drivers back to their
jobs," said Earle Putnam, ATU general counsel.
   The ATU's strike against Greyhound began March 2. On June
4, the company filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, blaming
strike-related losses for its action.

   The involvement of Blackstone Group, with its $800 million
buy-out and investment fund, adds muscle to the union's
recent efforts to wrest control of the ailing unit of
Dallas-based GLI Holding Co. away from Chairman Fred Currey.
   Blackstone Group's efforts are being led by one of its
general partners, Richard Ravitch, a turnaround specialist
and former public official who devised a successful bailout
plan for the New York State Urban Development Corporation
during the mid-1970s. Mr. Ravitch helped rebuild the New York
State Metropolitan Transit Authority following a bitter 1980
strike. In 1989, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York
City.
   "We are exploring the situation, but before we make a
decision, we have to collect more information," Mr. Ravitch
said through a spokesperson.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the company hadn't
yet heard from Blackstone Group. "They haven't contacted us;
we don't have anything to say," he said. Greyhound officials
have previously said the company is not for sale.
   Persons close to the situation said Blackstone Group plans
to ask closely held Greyhound for detailed financial
information in the near future. If the company refuses such
data, the union or Blackstone Group will try to get it
through federal bankrupcty court, union leaders said, adding
that an ATU-Blackstone Group buy-out bid might also be made
through the court in the form of a competing plan of
reorganization to Greyhound creditors.
   Under federal bankruptcy court rules, Greyhound maintains
until Oct. 4 the exclusive right to propose a reorganization
plan, but Mr. Putnam said the union might petition the court
to shorten that period.
   "We'll do what we have to do to proceed," said Brian M.
Freeman, who has been retained as investment advisor to the
ATU.
   In recent weeks, Mr. Freeman and ATU officials have met
with other Greyhound creditors in an effort to gain support
for a union buy-out bid. None have yet agreed to support a
possible ATU-Blackstone Group bid, but those talks continue,
said Mr. Freeman, who recently engineered a proposed union
buy-out of UAL Corp.
   Union leaders said any proposal would probably include an
employee stock ownership plan, reinstatement of striking ATU
members that Greyhound has replaced with new hires, and a
settlement of the union's unfair labor practices case pending
against Greyhound.
   That case, the result of a complaint filed by the
Milwaukee, Wis., regional office of the National Labor
Relations Board, is set for trial before a federal
administrative law judge in next month. A ruling in the
union's favor could force Greyhound to reinstate striking ATU
members and give them back pay totaling an estimated $3
million per month, or more.
   With the prospect of such a huge backpay claim looming,
some Greyhound creditors have said that peace with the ATU is
crucial to Greyhound's successful emergence from Chapter 11.

   Spending Cutback Is Slated

   Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. said it was trimming planned expense
outlays by $7 million for the rest of 1990 and $11.5 million
next year, reflecting the soft national real estate market.
   The real estate services concern said in San Francisco
that the cuts amount to about 8% of budgeted expenses for the
1990 second half and a 6.4% reduction for next year. Its
plans include the closure or trimming of nine offices,
elimination of 75 staff positions and "major reductions in
travel and advertising."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The real estate services industry is in the midst of a
difficult economic period and we need to adapt to changing
market conditions," said Harold A. Ellis Jr., chairman and
chief executive officer. He said the firm was taking the
steps "in response to reductions in revenue expectations due
to softness in real estate markets nationwide."
   For the second quarter, Grubb &amp; Ellis reported a net loss
of $1.8 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with profit of
$340,000, or two cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
declined to $84.6 million from $91.7 million.

   Central Capital's
   Chairman, Chief
   Unexpectedly Quits

   TORONTO -- The chairman and chief executive officer of
Central Capital Corp., Peter Cole, unexpectedly resigned from
the financial services and real estate concern to "seek other
opportunities."
   Thomas Hodgson, vice president of Central Capital, said
the board hadn't had an opportunity to appoint a successor to
Mr. Cole, 53 years old, who had been chief executive for five
years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Hodgson said he wasn't aware of Mr. Cole's plans or
the specific reasons for his resignation. "There certainly
weren't any corporate developments that triggered this," he
said. "If there had been any problems at the company, he
wouldn't have left."
   Mr. Cole said in a statement that he oversaw the building
of Central Capital into a major player in the Canadian
financial services industry and that he thought it was "an
appropriate time to move on." He also said he will remain a
director of Central Capital and be a consultant to the
company. Mr. Cole couldn't be reached to elaborate.
   During Mr. Cole's tenure as chief executive, Mr. Hodgson
said, the company's own assets grew from 3.5 billion Canadian
dollars (US$3.04 billion) to C$16 billion, with another C$20
billion in fiduciary assets under management. This aggressive
growth has made Central Capital one of the major non-bank
participants in Canada's financial services industry.
   Among other acquisitions, Mr. Cole oversaw the C$420
million purchase of Trader's Group Ltd. in 1987, which gave
Central Capital control of what now is Central Guaranty Trust
Co. and Canadian General Insurance Co.
   But the aggressive expansion left the company with a debt
of about C$1.4 million by the end of 1989, which resulted in
one of the company's two major shareholders, the financier
Reuben Cohen, taking the unusual step of publicly challenging
Mr. Cole at the annual meeting in April to improve Central
Capital's performance. Mr. Cohen voiced concern about the
company's debt and said he wanted to see its net income
increase from C$92.2 million in 1989 to $200 million by 1993.
   In the first quarter, Central Capital earned C$11.1
million, or 10 Canadian cents a share, down from C$28.2
million, or 34 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier.
   Mr. Hodgson said Leonard Ellen, Central Capital vice
chairman and, with Mr. Cohen, one of the major shareholders,
will step in to run the company on an interim basis as the
board's executive committee chairman. Messrs. Cohen and Ellen
together hold a 60.5% voting stake in Central Capital.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, Central
Capital common shares closed at C$8.50, down 25 Canadian
cents, and Class A shares closed at C$6.50, down 38 Canadian
cents.

   DETROIT -- A surge in late-July sales by General Motors
Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. pushed up
domestic car and truck sales for the month by 1% over a year
ago.
   For the final 10 days of July, sales of North
American-made cars rose 9.5% to 395,803 vehicles. That
translated to a seasonally adjusted annual selling pace of
7.7 million cars, up from a 7.4 million pace a year ago and
6.9 million rate in the middle 10 days of the month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, the late-July gains didn't dispel uncertainty
about the auto industry's near-term future in the face of
rising oil prices and a weakening U.S. economy. On Friday,
the government said the nation's jobless rate rose to 5.5% in
July, a hefty jump of 0.3 percentage points. And gas prices
shot up as much as 15 cents a gallon at service stations in
the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   "The whole business world is very concerned," said analyst
Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "And the auto world has
to be a little more concerned than other sectors."
   Indeed, Ford Motor Co., fighting a slump in sales of its
cars, said it will idle the Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant
that builds Mustangs for one week beginning Aug. 13.
   But one car dealer said he's yet to see evidence that the
Persian Gulf crisis has shoppers worried. "All I know is we
had a showroom full of customers {Thursday night} and we sold
28 new vehicles," said Bill Curry, general sales manager of
Art Moran Pontiac GMC in Southfield, Mich. "I didn't have one
customer talk about the situation in Kuwait."
   GM outpaced the overall market in July, posting a 2.3%
increase in overall car and truck sales. In the last 10 days
of the month, GM's total car and truck sales jumped 15.1%.
Sales of GM cars rose 14% in the late July period. GM's share
of the car market rose to 36.2% in the month from a weak
34.8% a year ago.
   Dealers said much of GM's gain was at the lower-price end
of the market.
   "General Motors dealers are learning how to equip cars
better on the low end," said John Bergstrom, who owns five GM
dealerships in Wisconsin. "We just had them too expensive for
a long time. We're learning if we don't put too much
equipment on them and we keep the price down we can compete
against the Japanese."
   Meanwhile, Japanese auto makers continued to boost their
share of the car market, improving on a record performance
during the first half of the year. Japanese nameplate cars
captured 29% of the car market in July, up from 26% in July
of 1989. Toyota's overall vehicle sales surged 21.1% while
Honda posted an 11.3% gain. However, Nissan Motor Co. had a
4.9% drop in overall sales during the latest month and some
of the smaller Japanese companies also had poor results.
   Ford, however, saw its share of the car market fall to
20.4% for the month, down from 23% a year ago. Chrysler's car
market share dropped to 8.1% in July from 9.4% a year ago.
Both Honda and Toyota sold more passenger cars than Chrysler
in July.
   Ford suffered an 8% drop in total car and truck sales for
July. In the final 10 days of the month, sales of Ford cars
tumbled 14.1%, more than offsetting an 11.7% rise in truck
sales. The No. 2 car maker is being dragged down by the
sluggish performance of its new Escort economy car. Ford sold
20,826 Escorts in July, a 35% drop from year-ago sales.
   "We used to sell 125 Escorts a month and now we're selling
25 Escorts," says John Noble, general manager of Town &amp;
Country Ford in Charlotte, N.C. The problem, he says, is that
many potential Escort buyers are having trouble getting loans
for the higher priced 1991 models.
   Chrysler Corp., which has been struggling since February,
saw its total vehicle sales drop 15.1% in July. Chrysler's
car and truck sales fell 9.5% in late July.

   BUSH WEIGHED military moves against Iraq and sent Cheney
to Saudi Arabia.
   Baghdad said it had begun pulling its troops out of
Kuwait, but Bush called the claim a lie. He said the U.S. and
its allies wouldn't accept the Iraqi-installed "puppet
regime" in Kuwait, and declared that Arab leaders had failed
to resolve the situation. The president refused to rule out
the use of military force against Iraq, and he dispatched the
defense secretary to Saudi Arabia for talks. U.S.
intelligence officials told the White House of signs Iraq is
preparing to seize the neutral zone south of Kuwait or to
invade Saudi Arabia itself, according to officials familiar
with the reports. The Saudis deployed 200 to 300 tanks near
to Kuwait, according to one report. Japan and the EC imposed
an oil embargo on Iraq and Kuwait, and Moscow cut off arms
shipments to Baghdad and ordered weapons ships en route to
Iraq to reverse course.

The Americans were ferried to the helicopter carrier Saipan,
while a Marine contingent reinforced security around the U.S.

are prepared to evacuate more U.S. citizens if they want to
leave. There were reports out of Gambia that West African
leaders were expected at a summit today to give Nigeria a

   Lotus, in Profit Slump, Moves to Reduce
   Costs With Hiring Freeze, Some Layoffs

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp., struggling
with slumping earnings, has begun a cost-cutting program that
includes a hiring freeze and layoffs of as many as 40 people.
   The layoffs, while small relative to Lotus's 3,100-member
work force, indicate management's concern about the company's
outlook. In the past, Lotus has occasionally closed small
divisions, but employees were generally absorbed elsewhere by
the fast-growing software producer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue is growing more slowly than it used to, so
"They're doing everything they can to keep the lid on" costs,
said Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
But he warned that with growing competition, Lotus will have
to be careful about reducing advertising and marketing
spending. "Market share may be more difficult to hold," he
said.
   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Lotus shares
fell 50 cents to close at $22, amid the market collapse. The
stock, which traded at $34 as recently as July 17, has fallen
steadily since officials warned that earnings are likely to
decline in the current quarter.
   By most measures, Lotus isn't overstaffed, analysts said.
Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter, an industry
newsletter based in Watertown, Mass., said Lotus's revenue
per employee last year of $188,000 was above the industry
average of $175,000.
   But William Bluestein, an analyst with Forrester Research,
a market research firm in Cambridge, said, "Their cost
structure is out of line, considering they are a mature,
single-product company." Lotus continues to get about
two-thirds of its revenue from its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, despite
repeated efforts to diversify its product line. In the second
quarter, earnings more than doubled to $23.5 million, or 54
cents a share, on revenue of $175.2 million, from a year
earlier.
   Robert Schechter, chief financial officer, played down the
significance of the job cuts. He said that through
consolidation and re-evaluation of some positions in the
marketing area, 17 jobs were eliminated. As many as 20
additional people will be fired, but they will be replaced
later by people with different skills, Mr. Schechter said.
   In a memo sent to all Lotus managers last month, Mr.
Schechter said that through year end, hiring is frozen, with
a few exceptions, and that any new hires must be approved at
the senior vice presidential level. Even filling vacancies
created by attrition will require approvals, he wrote. Only
senior vice presidents can authorize hiring search firms.
About 10% to 14% of Lotus employees leave annually.
   Lotus is trimming in other areas, too. Even purchases of
new personal computers now require special approvals. The
small army of contract programmers that had been working in
the company's spreadsheet division isn't being retained;
their work will be done by current employees. And Lotus aims
to cut travel and entertainment spending 50% in the second
half.
   Nevertheless, Lotus will add employees in some areas,
including paid customer support, consulting, and sales and
support of its Notes software product, Mr. Schechter said.
"We continue to see lots of ways to grow this business," he
said.

   NEW YORK -- In the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
short-term and long-term interest rates are parting company.
   Investors, worried about the inflationary impact of rising
oil prices, are shying away from buying long-term Treasury
bonds, driving long-term interest rates higher.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But convinced that the Federal Reserve may soon cut
short-term interest rates to revive a weakening economy, they
are snapping up short-term notes.
   "I think short-term rates will continue to go lower" on
expectations that the Fed will ease credit, said Maria
Fiorini Ramirez, president of Maria Ramirez Capital
Consultants Inc., a unit of John Hancock Freedom Securities.
   But even if the Fed reduces short-term interest rates, she
said, long-term rates may spurt still higher on fears that a
weak economy won't reduce stubborn inflation.
   The bond market's schizophrenic behavior is showing up
clearly in the gap between yields on two-year Treasury notes
and 30-year bonds, which is now the widest it has been in two
years.
   Traders refer to this as a "steepening yield curve," and
economists generally regard it as a sign that investors have
become jittery about the prospects of rising inflation.
   Yields on two-year Treasury notes have fallen sharply in
recent weeks and now are about 7.8%. Meanwhile, yields on
30-year Treasury bonds have risen slightly to about 8.56%.
The difference between the short-term and the long-term
yields, which is called the yield spread, is about 3/4
percentage point. Ms. Ramirez said the spread is likely to
widen to one full percentage point.
   The yield curve had been slowly steepening for several
weeks as short-term interest rates fell faster than long-term
rates. But last week, when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait,
investors made a mad dash for short-term Treasury securities,
buying up three-month and six-month bills as well as
two-year, three-year and five-year Treasury notes.
   "Nobody was willing to sell" short-term securities, said
James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc.
   Some of the buying was so-called "flight-to-quality"
purchases made by investors rushing to get cash out of the
Middle East and into the U.S., which is considered a safe
haven. But the bulk of buyers last week were domestic traders
and arbitragers who are betting that the Fed will soon cut
the benchmark federal funds rate from its current level of
8%, which in turn will boost the value of securities
purchased when rates were higher and allow those investors to
book profits.
   A cut in the federal funds rate, which banks charge each
other on overnight loans, could also nudge other short-term
and intermediate-term rates lower. Commercial bankers could
react to such a move by cutting the prime, or base, lending
rate for corporations as well as short-term consumer lending
rates like those on home-equity loans.
   Speculation that the Fed will soon ease interest rates has
been swirling for weeks, but the prospects that such an
easing will occur sooner, rather than later, were heightened
on Friday when the government released a bombshell July
employment report.
   The biggest surprise was that employment growth actually
declined, the first time that has happened since June 1986.
The Department of Labor said the number of non-farm jobs
declined 219,000 last month. Even when layoffs of temporary
census workers were excluded, the decline was 57,000.
   With so many workers handed pink sheets, the unemployment
rate jumped 0.3 percentage point to 5.5%.
   "The employment numbers confirmed that the economy is
weak; I think the Fed will ease," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief
financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. He said that if
the Fed decides to make its move, it will likely do so early
this week -- before the Treasury's huge quarterly auction of
government securities. Otherwise, he said, the Fed may wait
until late this month to ease rates, after its next
policymaking Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
   Mr. Kahan and many other economists on Wall Street think
the Fed will probably ease despite oil-inspired inflation
fears.
   "Central bankers always say that their job is to fight
inflation, no matter what," Mr. Kahan said. "But the truth of
the matter is, this central bank will only fight inflation
when it is sure that economic activity is growing. If it
looks like the economy is sliding toward recession, the fight
against inflation will be postponed -- not aborted -- but
postponed."
   But the long-term end of the bond market is worlds apart
from the short end. In fact, long-term investors are worried
about how events unfolding in the Persian Gulf will affect
inflation.
   Fears of spiraling prices came from two sources. One is a
big spike in oil prices triggered by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, which raises the specter of less-plentiful and
more-expensive oil supplies. The other is the six-cent rise
in hourly earnings in the July employment report, a figure
that analysts say makes the threat of inflation even greater.
   With the threat of inflation looming large, investors are
cooling toward long-term Treasury bonds. They are not
dumping, but simply aren't buying any new ones. And that's
depressing prices.
   Still, at a time when the stock market appears shaky, the
economy is on the verge of recession and numerous financial
uncertainties exist, some investors are sticking with
long-term Treasurys.
   "You can get 8.5% yield on 30-year Treasury bonds and that
looks pretty good to us," said Ian MacKinnon, head of
fixed-income investments at Vanguard Group. "If it turns out
that what Iraq has done is push inflation up, then I will
have to modify my outlook," he said.
   All of this is a mixed blessing for the Treasury, which is
scheduled to auction $32.25 billion of securities this week
in its quarterly refunding of the federal debt. The Treasury
will sell $11.5 billion of three-year notes tomorrow, $10.5
billion of ten-year notes Wednesday and $10.25 billion of
30-year bonds Thursday.
   "Considering the appetite for short-term securities, the
first auction should be the smoothest," said Ms. Ramirez. She
said, however, that the ten-year and 30-year bonds may
encounter more investor resistance.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Prices of long-term bonds continued to tumble in the
aftermath of Iraq's conquest of Kuwait.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell nearly 1 1/4
points, or $12.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, on
Thursday as news of turmoil in the Middle East sparked
speculation that oil supplies would become less plentiful and
more expensive, putting upward pressure in inflation.
   The bond rout continued Friday with prices of the
benchmark 30-year bond plunging an additional 1 1/8 point.
   Prices of short-term issues, however, rose as employment
data hinting of a recession seemed to indicate the Federal
Reserve might have to ease policy quickly to keep the
economic expansion alive.
   In the corporate-bond market, the payment-in-kind bonds of
RJR Nabisco Inc. settled sharply lower after investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. -- which controls RJR -- bought
back a hefty chunk of its exchangeable bonds Thursday.
Payment-in-kind bonds pay interest in the form of additional
securities.
   The bonds fell because investors assume that the
repurchase of RJR Nabisco's pay-in-kind bonds is nearly
complete.
   Officials at RJR Nabisco declined to comment on the
buy-backs, but traders estimate that RJR in the past three
weeks has bought back $1.5 billion of its 17% bonds of 2007.
Much of that buying was done last Thursday, traders said,
when Iraq's invasion of Kuwait spooked many participants in
the financial markets. People familiar with the open-market
repurchase program estimate that RJR did most of its
purchases at 90 cents to 94 cents on the dollar.
   On Thursday alone, KKR, working through Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co., bought between $800 million and $1 billion of the RJR
bonds, according to people familiar with the repurchase. At
least some of those purchases were below the bonds' New York
Stock Exchange closing price of 91 3/4 cents on the dollar,
traders said. KKR, Goldman and RJR all declined to discuss
their roles.
   Market sources speculated that some of the bonds may have
come from the accounts of takeover-stock speculators as well
as from Nebraska investor Warren Buffet. Mr. Buffet declined
to comment.
   RJR's 17% exchangeable payment-in-kind debentures ended 1
3/4 points lower to close at 90 on robust volume of nearly
$20 million on the New York Stock Exchange. RJR's 17 3/8%
convertible payment-in-kind debentures fell 2 1/8 points to
close at 111 1/2 on relatively heavy volume.
   In the broader high-yield market, junk bonds, or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, finished 1/2 to 3/4 point lower.
   Hard hit were the junk bonds of casinos operated by real
estate developer Donald Trump. Trump Plaza Funding Corp.'s 12
7/8% first-mortgage bonds ended down three points at 76,
while the Trump Taj Mahal Funding Corp.'s 14% bonds closed
down 1 1/2 points at 44 in over-the-counter trading.
   Some Trump bonds have been been falling due to news that
gaming revenues at the Trump casinos fell sharply during
July.

   The Mideast Conflict:
   Ban on Iraqi and Kuwaiti Oil
   Seen Sharply Boosting Price

   The spread of self-imposed bans on the purchase of oil
from Iraq and Kuwait by industrialized nations threatens to
push petroleum prices still higher unless other OPEC nations
increase production.
   Over the weekend, the 12 nations of the European Community
and Japan voted to embargo imports of oil from the two
countries. The U.S. announced similar action last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If all those countries in fact stand by their decisions,
experts said, the ensuing scramble to find replacement oil
elsewhere would test the world's production capacity and
could temporarily send prices soaring -- possibly as high as
$30 to $35 a barrel, or $5 to $10 a barrel above current
levels.
   Aware of that, some members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries that are well out of range of
Iraqi guns already are taking steps to raise output and fill
at least some of the needs of former Iraq customers. And some
oil ministers who have espoused moderate oil prices are
privately talking about possible emergency moves by OPEC
itself that might slow the price runup that began with Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait last week.
   "The market is hysterical," said a senior member of one
country's OPEC delegation. "A majority of the members don't
want to see prices get out of control."
   But it isn't known just how much these countries can or
will do. If the major oil-consuming nations fully boycott
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude -- or if pipelines and tankers
carrying oil out of those countries are blockaded --
production elsewhere would have to rise as much as 4.5
million barrels a day to fill the gap. That would take just
about all the spare production capacity available to world
oil producers.
   And it is uncertain whether it all would be available.
About two million barrels of it is in the hands of Saudi
Arabia, which during tense periods in the past has increased
production to stabilize oil markets. This time, the kingdom
may not open its oil spigots wider, because doing so might be
interpreted by Iraq as an act of war.
   "We are in a fix," conceded one OPEC official.
   Some people are skeptical that all the big oil-consuming
nations -- particularly France and Japan -- can or will stick
to their promises for long. "It's Don Quixote stuff unless we
get other countries to go along, especially the Japanese,"
said Edward Fried, senior fellow at Brookings Institution in
Washington.
   Also, a blockade of oil leaving Iraq and Kuwait so far
hasn't been imposed. Such an action presumably would involve
U.S. Navy ships stopping tankers leaving Iraqi and Kuwaiti
ports and a cut-off of pipelines that carry the bulk of Iraqi
oil exports across Turkey and Saudi Arabia to the
Mediterranean and Red Seas. It would be risky for Turkey and
Saudi Arabia, probably inviting Iraqi retaliation.
   Still, to the extent that efforts to impede Iraq's oil
sales work, oil supplies could tighten in coming months.
   "If the embargo were successful, it would leave the world
short of oil within three to six months," predicted Lawrence
Goldstein, the executive vice president of Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation. Adds Tom Burns, director of economics
for Chevron Corp.: "We're creating an oil shortage where one
didn't exist."
   Joseph Stanislaw, managing director/Europe for Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, also sees a "real price spike" if
the embargo holds, though he is convinced that others,
particularly Saudi Arabia, eventually would step in and pump
more oil to bring prices back down.
   And even if the embargo is ineffective, most oil analysts
expect prices, already up almost $3 a barrel since Wednesday,
to go higher on fear despite the fact that oil inventories
are at a 10-year high. Only a few weeks ago, West Texas
Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, had dropped to around
$16 a barrel. In futures trading, this quality crude closed
at $24.49 a barrel Friday, up $1.38 for the day.
   "We will definitely see another runup in crude prices,"
said Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   There are signs that some added supplies may already be
headed to the market. Venezuela can increase production as
much as 600,000 barrels a day and it is understood to have
already started.
   A few other OPEC producers -- chiefly Nigeria, Indonesia,
Libya and the Persian Gulf's United Arab Emirates, though
under threat from Iraq -- are capable of producing more oil.
Most producers outside OPEC are running flat out.
   Eventually, prices are expected to come down again,
perhaps to about $22 a barrel. But they aren't expected to
fall back to the old depressed levels because of the scare
thrown into oil markets. Oil markets have both a "mental
ceiling" and a "mental floor" for petroleum prices, said
Antonio M. Szabo, president of Bonner &amp; Moore Management
Science."The mental ceiling just went up," he said.
   As a result, the carefully crafted oil-production pact
struck by OPEC only 10 days ago that was designed to tighten
supplies and gradually raise prices has been rendered
meaningless. Some experts suggest the existence of OPEC
itself may been threatened.
   Even if OPEC survives, experts say it will never be the
same with two of its most powerful members, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, practically paralyzed by Iraqi military might. Such
an outcome would end an era of a strategy carefully plotted
over the years by the two OPEC heavyweights. They guided OPEC
on a path that assured consumers a moderately priced yet
secure source of oil.

   NEW YORK -- The dollar's new found strength is expected to
last until turmoil in the Middle East stops shielding it from
worries about the weak U.S. economy.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is yet another political
development that has helped the dollar defy predictions for a
steep decline, forecasts that have been prevalent for the
past two years.

   For much of 1989, the dollar was surprisingly strong
because of political setbacks in such nations as China, Japan
and Britain. As the world's most liquid currency, the dollar
is one of the "safe havens" that investors flock to when
major nations have severe political troubles.
   Because of this safe-haven status, the dollar didn't
plunge Friday even though talk about a U.S. recession flowed
freely on Wall Street after the release of very worrisome
July employment data.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
150.08 yen, up from 149.35 yen at the close Friday.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at 1.5885 marks.
   After days of heavy sales, the dollar traded as low as
1.5818 marks early Thursday and came close to testing its
post-World War II low of 1.5615 marks. But it made a quick
turnaround after tensions in the Middle East flared up.
   Once Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait, traders were no
longer shy about buying dollars, as they had been previously
because of the feeble U.S. economy and falling interest rates
that lessen the attractiveness of dollar-denominated
investments.
   Now many traders say forecasts for a new record low
against the mark are on hold. The dollar won't fall very far
"as long as the tension is in the air," says Thomas Benfer, a
foreign exchange marketing representative at the Bank of
Montreal.
   Mr. Benfer says "the whole gamut" of market participants
races to buy dollars whenever tensions rise in the Middle
East, including corporations and speculators.
   Friday's dealings were particularly rough going because of
nonstop headlines from every corner of the world, traders
say. They were glued to news screens all day, watching for
developments in the Mideast.
   For much of the session, the dollar was supported by fears
that tensions would escalate. Late in the day, however, the
U.S. currency slipped on reports that an Iraqi government
spokesman said Iraqi forces will begin withdrawing from
Kuwait on Sunday.
   But even so, it may take a while for the highly charged
atmosphere in the Persian Gulf to calm enough for the dollar
to resume its decline.
   The Middle East showdown overshadowed the weak July U.S.
employment data, which otherwise would likely have sparked a
plummet.
   The civilian jobless rate rose to 5.5% from 5.2% in June,
climbing to the highest level since August 1988. Expectations
had been for a 5.3% unemployment rate. Closely monitored
non-farm payrolls dropped 219,000 to 110.71 million, the
largest decline since striking American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. workers cut the number of jobs by 339,000 in August 1983.
   Those weak statistics follow news about the economy's 1.2%
annual rate of growth in the second quarter, merely a
fraction of the pace needed to help the U.S. keep up with
West Germany and Japan.
   The jobs data sent the stock market tumbling, as investors
worried that the economy may slip into recession. The economy
is "soft, soft, soft," says Roger Shields, chief
international economist at Chemical Bank. The weakness, he
adds, is "more pervasive" than it appeared to be only a few
months ago.
   Mr. Shields and other economists say the outlook is
particularly grim, as the Federal Reserve may be reluctant to
remedy the economy with an easier monetary policy because of
the inflationary implications of soaring oil prices.
   The Fed is generally expected to allow the important
federal funds rate to fall soon by a modest 1/4 percentage
point from the current average of 8%. Fed funds, the charge
on reserves traded among commercial banks overnight, was last
lowered July 13 when the Fed loosened credit because of
strains in the banking system.
   "The Fed is probably going to have to sit down and review
these developments very carefully. It's harder to read the
tea leaves than it's ever been," says Mr. Shields. Even if
U.S. exports perk up this quarter, the economy will probably
have little more than "slight growth," he says.
   But there are even gloomier forecasts.
   "The odds of a zero {growth} quarter are very high," says
Ram Bhagavatula, chief money market economist at Citibank.
Although the economy's growth is faint, there haven't yet
been two consecutive quarters of negative growth, the usual
sign of a recession.
   With the economy ailing and the Fed in an easing mode when
most other global central banks are maintaining tight
policies, dollar selling is seen resuming once the tensions
in the Middle East abate.
   Says Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.: "All in all, conditions argue for the fact
that the dollar is in trouble."
   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$379 an ounce.

   Market's Sell-Off Hammers the Bullish Case for Stocks

   NEW YORK -- Stocks took a hard fall Friday. But the Dow
Jones Industrial Average remains above 2800, and that's still
too high, many strategists say.
   Far more than a mere correction, Friday's spasmodic
sell-off in stocks was the first significant re-evaluation of
stock prices since October 1989. The ebullient assumptions of
a "soft landing" -- a slowly growing economy with moderating
inflation -- seemed dashed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now the interrogation begins: Investors will review every
stock in their portfolios and ask if it's worth the risk of
owning.
   "I am going to be rigorous," says James Craig, manager of
the $1.2 billion Janus Fund. "Whether it's Barbie Dolls with
Mattel or TV revenue at Capital Cities/ABC, we will
re-evaluate everything."
   Because of last week's events, he adds, "my complacency
with a rocking-along slow growth has been called into
question. And my complacency with low inflation has been
called into question."
   For three weeks, the caution flag has been waving over the
stock market. Dozens of companies delivered surprisingly soft
second-quarter earnings, and gave analysts no cheer about the
second half of the year. Recent economic reports, including
the one Friday showing unemployment rose in July, point to
weakening growth.
   But this message went unheeded by many stock investors.
After last year's 31.7% gain in Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index, most money managers were more inclined to take the
risk of racing with the market than to drop out and preserve
their capital. Investors gave into what Henry Van der Eb,
manager of the Mathers Fund, calls "seductive
rationalizations."
   But today the naysayers are standing on the high ground,
and they foresee even lower stock prices.
   "We've gone from, `Don't worry, be happy,' to a more
realistic interpretation" of stocks' worth, says Abby Joseph
Cohen, the chief strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The
first hammer blow of this shift in perception could hit the
market this week as investors re-evaluate both earnings
estimates and the multiple of per-share profits that stock
prices should properly command.
   The S&amp;P index closed Friday at a price 15.91 times the 500
companies' aggregate earnings over the past year. That
price/earnings ratio is still too high, says Carmine Grigoli,
chief strategist at First Boston. "Pricing the market at 16
times earnings is a ridiculous valuation" given the more
immediate risks of a recession now, he says. A more
reasonable valuation would be 13, in his opinion, and to get
there stocks would have to fall about 13% from current
levels.
   Ms. Cohen doesn't think investors are prepared for a
declining stock market. "People have got it into their heads
that bear markets are over very quickly," she says, like the
1987 crash. But back then the economy was strong, while now
it is limping at a near-recessionary pace and an inflation
shock is threatened by higher oil prices. "We are likely to
see a gradual erosion" in stock prices over several months,
she says.
   Most large institutional investors have to be at least
partially invested in stocks, in good times and bad. The
marginal buyers, who can have a big impact on stock prices,
tend to be the "asset allocators," who have the flexibility
to dart among stocks, bonds, and cash, and the millions of
small investors. One sure sign that a lengthy correction is
under way would be if either group bailed out of stocks to
any significant degree.
   So far there's no evidence of such moves, although as the
stock market fell on Friday mutual fund companies were
swamped with telephone calls. Early Friday afternoon,
Vanguard Group called up its "Swiss Army," a band of its
money market fund managers, company lawyers and accountants
who are drafted to help handle customers' calls during busy
periods.
   "Anybody who can answer the phone is doing so," reported a
spokesman for Twentieth Century Investors, where the call
volume on Friday was close to double its normal level.
"Whenever you have this sort of day, all kinds of {investors}
come out of the woodwork."
   At Baltimore's T. Rowe Price Associates, the call volume
was running over 25% above normal. Many investors switched
out of stock funds and into money market funds.
   But some investors took the Kuwait crisis as a buying
opportunity. The T. Rowe Price New Era Fund, a natural
resource stock fund heavy in precious metals and energy
shares, enjoyed strong sales on Friday.
   At Financial Programs in Denver, investors switched out of
the fund group's two money market funds and into Financial
Strategic Energy Portfolio. "That tells me that since 1987
people have become a lot shrewder and aren't so quick to
panic," says a spokesman for Financial Programs.
   As for asset allocators, these investors have generally
increased their stock investments through the summer, says
James Carmack, a consultant who tracks them. He says he
talked to one such investor Friday who decided to remain
fully invested in stocks.
   Such investors don't suddenly change their minds about
everything, which is why bear markets don't strike like
lightning. Prolonged declines in stock prices typically
consist of slow capitulation by one investor after another.
   Or it could be that small investors and asset allocators
are looking way beyond today's bad news. Jack McCarthy,
manager of the $3.6 billion Affiliated Fund says there is a
case to be made for higher stock prices. Certainly a
correction is taking place, he acknowledges, and he even
expects a six-month recession in this year's second half.
   But just as investors are giving up on stocks, it might be
time to buy. Mr. McCarthy says weak economic growth will
prompt the Federal Reserve to pump money into the economy,
"and the stock market will go up." Meanwhile, rising
unemployment should moderate inflation concerns.
   Therefore, he concludes, "We are not in a bear market."

   Friday Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices plunged in a torrent of selling sparked by
nervousness over Iraq's military actions and evidence that
the U.S. economy may be heading for a recession.
   But the market took comfort in a Soviet statement that
Iraq would soon withdraw from Kuwait, and prices finished
well above their session lows.
   After being down more than 120 points, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average finished with a loss of 54.95 at 2809.65.
That was the industrials' lowest close since May 11.
   Market players dumped stocks across the board, traders
said. Oil issues, which shot up on news of the Iraqi
invasion, ran into selling even though oil prices continued
climbing.
   Declining issues routed advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange by about 1,457 to 264. Big Board trading swelled to
292,360,000 million shares, the busiest since October's
"mini-crash."
   For the week, the Dow Jones industrials fell 88.86 points,
or 3.1%, the second largest weekly point loss this year.
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.4%, the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 2.3% and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index fell 2.6%.
   Concerns about recession surfaced in the market after the
July employment report proved considerably weaker than
anticipated. And reports that Iraq was amassing troops near
the Saudi Arabian border also sent shock waves through the
market, traders said.
   The Big Board's new restrictions on program trading, which
require index-arbitrage traders to wait for stock prices to
rise from previous trades before executing the stock side of
their transactions, went into effect for the first time at
9:53 a.m. EDT, after the industrials showed a loss of 50
points. This "circuit breaker" mechanism was approved last
month by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Although traders said index-arbitrage selling was a factor
in the market's downturn, the Big Board curbs "indicated that
the index arbs couldn't be selling aggressively," said
Christopher Pedersen, head of trading at Twenty-First
Securities.
   Another "circuit breaker" took effect in the afternoon
when September futures on the S&amp;P 500 index showed a loss of
12 points. Starting at 1:19 p.m. EDT, a special Big Board
computer file known as the "sidecar" handled program trading
orders in the underlying stocks for a five-minute period.
   The rally in oil stocks faltered. Exxon added 1/8 to 53
3/8 in volume of 3.3 million shares, while USX, which owns
Marathon Oil, closed up 1/4 at 34 7/8 and was the Big Board's
most active issue with 5.1 million shares changing hands.
   But Chevron skidded 1 5/8 to 78 3/4; Texaco fell 1 1/4 to
64 5/8; Mobil eased 3/8 to 66 7/8; Amoco dropped 3/4 to 57
1/2; and Unocal went down 7/8 to 32 3/8. Among oil services
issues, Baker Hughes slid 1 to 32 3/8; Schlumberger dropped 1
1/4 to 67 1/2; Halliburton eased 1 5/8 to 55 3/4; and
McDermott International lost 2 1/2 to 32.
   Raytheon soared 3 1/8 to 63 7/8. Analysts told The Wall
Street Journal that the company is either planning or
proceeding with sales of its Patriot defense missile system
to Saudi Arabia, Israel and Italy.
   General Dynamics, which is selling tanks to Saudi Arabia,
rose 3/4 to 29. Other defense stocks also bucked the market's
fall: Lockheed rose 3/8 to 28 3/8; McDonnell Douglas went up
1/2 to 44 1/2; Northrop climbed 1/2 to 15 1/8, and E-Systems
rose 5/8 to 27 1/2.
   Boise Cascade jumped 4 7/8 to 36 3/8 amid rumors that the
company may receive a takeover offer. Prices ranging from $50
to $70 a share were cited in the speculation, according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. The company and
International Paper, a rumored suitor, both declined comment;
International Paper advanced 1 5/8 to 58 3/8.
   Selected regional bank stocks also showed strength. Banc
One gained 1 to 27 3/4; Signet Banking rose 1 5/8 to 16 1/8
and Bank of Boston added 5/8 to 10 3/4.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 5.52
to 346.63, bringing its loss for the week to 2.5%. Volume
Friday totaled 26,650,000.
   Put warrants on the Nikkei average of 225 Japanese stocks
rose sharply, indicating that market players expect the Tokyo
stock market's plunge in the wake of the Iraq-Kuwait conflict
to continue.
   PaineWebber's warrants added 1/2 to 4 1/4 as more than 1.2
million were traded. Salomon's January 1993 warrants rose 3/8
to 10 7/8; Eksportfinans' warrants gained 3/8 to 4 1/8, and
Denmark's went up 3/8 to 11 7/8.

   EAST GERMAN ARMS

   East Germany's military has canceled arms contracts with
all 2,000 domestic suppliers, the government said.
   The announcement appeared to be another effort to rebut
West German accusations that East Germany was wasting money
on weapons and military expenses even though its army faced
dissolution after unity at the end of this year.
   Lt. Gen. Ehrenfried Ullmann, procurement chief for the
Disarmament and Defense Ministry, said the army voided 10,000
contracts with its 2,000 domestic suppliers, effective Aug.
1. About 100,000 jobs could be lost because of the canceled
contracts.
   The National People's Army has shriveled from 173,000
crack troops before East Germany's popular revolution against
Stalinist rule in 1989 to 98,000 today. Bonn says only a
minority can be absorbed in a future all-German military.
                                                                                                       

   COCAINE SHIPMENTS TO EUROPE
                                                                                                       

   Cocaine shipments to Europe are likely to double this
year, a U.S. official said. The official, a narcotics expert
who requested anonymity, told reporters in Bogota that he
believed cocaine shipments to Europe from Latin America would
reach 200 metric tons this year, up from 100 metric tons in
1989. He said traffickers were turning more to Europe because
profits were much higher than in the U.S. One kilogram (2.2
pounds) of cocaine could be worth between $35,000 and $55,000
on the streets of Europe compared with around $20,000 in
Miami.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR RATIONING IN BUCHAREST

   Sugar rationing resumes in Bucharest this week, with each
citizen of the Romanian capital being permitted to buy 1.5
kilograms (3.3 pounds) a month. Sugar had been rationed under
the Ceausescu regime. The government that took power after
December's revolution lifted rations; but once sugar sent as
aid from abroad ran out, the commodity became increasingly
scarce and in the past several weeks has been mostly
unavailable.
                                                                                                       

   BANK OF TOKYO IN TAIWAN
                                                                                                       

   Despite earlier protests from China, Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
has opened a representative office in Taipei, a step other
Japanese banks are likely to follow.
   Bank of Tokyo announced its intention to open the Taipei
office in May. However, a barrage of criticism from China
persuaded it to delay the opening. Analysts said the bank
finally was able to open the Taipei office on Friday because
China's need for foreign aid -- which it will be getting from
Japan -- has given it little room to complain about Japanese
banks entering Taiwan.
                                                                                                       

   A COMPLAINT IN BRITAIN
                                                                                                       

   American Airlines has filed a complaint with the U.S.
Department of Transportation against BAA PLC, a British
airports operator, because the airline is barred from
handling its own passenger check-in and ticketing at London's
Gatwick Airport. BAA owns and operates eight British
airports, including Gatwick. At Gatwick, four companies are
licensed by BAA to offer handling, including British Airways.
American, a unit of AMR Corp., says that by having to
contract out for these services, it suffers a competitive
disadvantage and can't control the quality of the personnel.
                                                                                                       

   DWINDLING COMMUNIST PARTY
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Communist Party has lost 765,000 members so far
this year, leaving it with about 18 million members, the
party's personnel chief, Boris Pugo, said. He said 370,000
members quit the party, about three times the number of
membership cards turned in during all of 1989. In addition,
125,000 members were expelled, 120,000 died and 150,000
stopped paying their membership dues or participating in
party activities, Mr. Pugo said, adding that 125,000 new
members signed up in the first six months of this year.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S DECLINING BIRTHRATE
                                                                                                       

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu warned that the
nation's declining birthrate would lead to inflation and
shortages of workers, a Japanese news agency reported, adding
that Mr. Kaifu pledged to put countermeasures in place within
a decade.
   The government is concerned that a shortage of young
people and a growing number of old people will overburden the
nation's welfare system. The average Japanese woman had 1.57
children as of 1989, down from the previous low of 1.58 in
1966. And on Saturday the government reported that Japan set
a world record for longevity last year, with the average life
expectancy reaching 81.77 years for women and 75.91 years for
men.
   The prime minister reportedly said that policies
restricting foreign workers should be examined.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The East Berlin building that once housed East Germany's
Communist State Security Ministry -- the infamous "Stasi" --
is to become a meeting place and research center dedicated to
the defunct ministry's victims. The Anti-Stalinist Action
Foundation said the building would house exhibitions and a
library. . . . The Vatican said callers to new Holy See
telephone numbers would, for a fee, hear excerpts from recent
speeches by Pope John Paul II in English, Spanish or Italian.
U.S. numbers are 1-900230-POPE for English, 1-900-230-PAPA
for Spanish and 1-900-230-7273 for Italian. U.S. calls will
cost $5 each.

   Government May Need Several Weeks
   To Resolve HEAF's Financial Problems

   WASHINGTON -- Efforts to find a solution to the financial
problems facing Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a
major student loan-guarantee agency, may take several more
weeks as the Bush administration looks for a wider range of
options.
   When HEAF's problems surfaced last month, administration
officials said they hoped to work out an orderly transfer of
HEAF's estimated $9 billion student-loan portfolio to another
guarantee agency within a week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But officials haven't embraced either of the major
proposals before them -- one from the Student Loan Marketing
Association, the other from United Student Aid Funds. Both
agencies have proposed taking over HEAF's best loans, while
asking the government to pay the full amount of loans on
which borrowers default.
   Under the federal loan program, students borrow from
banks, and one of the nation's 55 nonprofit guarantee
agencies, of which HEAF and USAF are the largest, insures the
loan. The Education Department then reinsures the loan.
   In most cases, the Education Department pays the guarantee
agency 100% of the balance on defaulted loans. But that rate
can drop as low as 80% if the guarantee agency's payments on
defaulted loans exceed 9% of the agency's insured loans.
HEAF's problem is that it guaranteed a large volume of loans
to students in proprietary schools. More than one-third of
the borrowers who attend proprietary schools, which train
beauticians, mechanics and other trades, default on their
loans. As a result, HEAF is receiving a government
reimbursement of 80% on defaulted loans on which it's paying
banks and other lenders 100%.
   At issue is how much the federal government is going to
reimburse guarantee agencies -- and perhaps the lenders as
well -- for the loans in default. At a hearing before the
education panel of the Senate Labor Committee Friday,
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos noted that the federal
government has no legal obligation to banks and other lenders
to make sure they are reimbursed 100% on defaulted loans. He
said, however, that he was "optimistic that we will have in
place a way to keep the guarantees sound" within the next few
weeks. He gave no details of the current negotiations.
   As an alternative to the proposals before the government,
some U.S. officials suggest that the Education Department
might take over the HEAF portfolio, as well as its modern
computer operations in St. Paul, Minn., in some sort of
undefined conservator capacity. It isn't clear, however,
whether this is a real possibility or just a negotiating ploy
to encourage USAF and Sallie Mae to consider making changes
in their proposals.
   So far, government and industry officials have assumed
that after an orderly transition, HEAF would cease to exist.
But at a news conference Friday, HEAF Chairman Richard Hawk,
who complained that he had been excluded from recent
negotiations, said he may make his own proposal for keeping
HEAF alive. He declined to give any details.

   RJR Nabisco Dives
   Into Bond Market
   With Big Buy-Back

   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc., which promised its
bondholders 100 cents on the dollar, has found plenty of
investors eager to bail out at 94 cents or less during recent
market turmoil.
   Traders estimated that RJR in the past three weeks has
bought back nearly $1.5 billion of its 17% bonds of 2007.
Much of that buying was done last Thursday, traders said,
when Iraq's invasion of Kuwait spooked many participants in
the financial markets. People familiar with the open-market
repurchase program estimate that RJR bought most bonds at 90
cents to 94 cents on the dollar.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For RJR, retiring those bonds is an important step toward
shoring up the financial position of the highly leveraged
tobacco and food company. The 17% bonds are among RJR's
highest-cost debt. As part of a vast refinancing package
announced last month, RJR is retiring $4.4 billion of its
high-yield junk bonds and replacing them with lower-cost bank
debt, new preferred stock and additional equity. Junk bonds
are speculative-grade issues with low ratings or no ratings
at all.
   The latest repurchases "are positive for the company,"
said Dirk van Doren, an analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp;
Maffei. "It's nice to see them spending some dough to put
their plan into effect. I'm surprised, though, that so many
people sold."
   Traders said RJR's bond buying was arranged by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., RJR's majority owner. For several
weeks, KKR told bondholders that it was willing to buy their
bonds back at a slight discount to market prices. During
mid-July and late July, most holders balked at that offer, as
the RJR bonds of 2007 climbed from depressed levels to as
high as 95 1/2 cents on the dollar.
   Then last week, sentiment abruptly shifted. First a New
Jersey court ruling on July 26 raised fresh concerns about
tobacco companies' product liability. Then further troubles
with the UAL Inc. attempted buy-out caused some takeover
stock speculators, who owned large amounts of the RJR bonds,
to look for ways to lighten up their portfolios. Then Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait early Thursday morning touched off a
general financial scare.
   "It's amazing how market psychology works," said one top
junk-bond trader. "It was all greed, greed, greed. Then a lot
of greed turned to fear."
   Thursday, as junk-bond prices weakened, word circulated
that KKR and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. together were carrying out
a massive one-day buy-back of the RJR bonds. One trader said
he heard rumors that sellers were so bountiful that RJR might
substantially complete its bond buying that day. With most
RJR bonds down about $10 for each $1,000 face amount, holders
figured that this was their best chance to sell.
   "People panicked," a former RJR holder said. "Between
Kuwait and the cigarette ruling, people couldn't stand the
pain."
   On Thursday alone, KKR and Goldman Sachs together bought
$800 million to $1 billion of the RJR bonds, according to
people familiar with the repurchase. At least some of those
purchases were below the bonds' New York Stock Exchange
closing price of 91 3/4 cents on the dollar, traders said.
KKR, Goldman and RJR all said they wouldn't comment about
their roles.
   If traders' estimates of RJR's purchase prices are right,
the company probably acquired the bonds at $150 million or
more below face value, adjusting for accrued interest on the
bonds.
   That's a nifty windfall for RJR. Last month, the company
reset the bonds' interest rates from their previous 14.07%,
as part of its obligation to make the bonds trade at full
face value on what legal documents called "a fully
distributed basis." RJR also had penciled in plans to pay as
much as full face value for any bonds it retired.
   As McCarthy Crisanti's Mr. van Doren observed: "It isn't
as if KKR and RJR didn't tell us what they were going to do"
with the bond repurchases. "What's interesting is that they
pulled it off so quickly. It's a smooth act."
   The next step in RJR's refinancing package will be a $2.4
billion exchange offer for its 17 3/8% bonds of 2009. RJR
will offer cash and new preferred shares to bondholders. That
exchange offer has been filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and is expected to begin in about six
weeks.
   RJR also is committed to buy sufficiently more of the 17%
bonds so that its purchases total $1.7 billion by next April.
In addition, RJR has promised to spend at least another $350
million to buy either the 17% or the 17 3/8% bonds in the
open market or via tender offers.

   European Transport Firms Hit the Road
   ---
   Firms Brace for Shakeout
   Ahead of Changes in '92

   VENLO, the Netherlands -- A century ago, farmers pushing
wheelbarrows of vegetables to market sometimes paused here at
a bar run by Frans Maas. One day, Mr. Maas hit on a business
idea: He offered to group his customers' vegetables into one
big load and ship them to Germany in a horse-drawn cart.
   Since then, Mr. Maas's company has gradually built up
expertise in organizing shipments throughout Europe, handling
customs procedures and working around the myriad restrictions
protecting local haulers in each country. The Maas family
expanded the business intuitively -- "by a feeling in your
fingers," says Hans van Oijen, the current chairman of Frans
Maas Beheer N.V. "Now," he adds wryly, "we call it a
strategy."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Over the next few years, Frans Maas Beheer and its rivals
will need all the intuition and strategy they can muster.
Faster than almost any other business, freight transport is
being revolutionized by the European Community's plan for a
unified market after 1992 and the opening of Eastern Europe
to freer trade. Both developments mean more goods will be
moving longer distances, creating a huge increase in demand
for transport services.
   At the same time, deregulation is gradually removing the
restrictions that have long shielded inefficient operators.
As a result, trucking companies' profit margins -- already
thin in recent years -- are likely to shrink further just as
the biggest players are investing heavily to build up
Europewide networks.
   "We're going to see a blood bath for some time," says Hans
Jansen, a corporate strategist for Kuhne &amp; Nagel Group, a
transport company based in Switzerland. "Profits will suffer
-- that's quite clear. We're preparing for it." Both Kuhne &amp;
Nagel and Frans Maas hope to be among the 10 or 15
pan-European companies expected to dominate the market once
the shakeout is over.
   The free-for-all on the freeways won't come overnight, for
restrictions are falling away only in stages. July 1 the EC
began providing a limited number of permits allowing trucking
concerns based in one country to carry goods within the
borders of another. That means fewer trucks will have to
return all the way home empty, and thus more capacity will be
available, pushing down prices. The number of such permits is
due to rise in each of the next two years. In October, EC
transport ministers are scheduled to make politically
sensitive decisions about how fast to proceed.
   For many of Europe's 300,000 trucking companies -- most of
them small, family outfits with one or two vehicles --
deregulation will be devastating. In West Germany, considered
the most protected market, the main asset of most small
trucking companies is a license to operate in that country.
Once any EC hauler has that right, the license will be
worthless.
   Other EC members accuse Bonn of dragging its feet on
transport deregulation in order to protect those small
haulers. At the same time, some transport specialists argue
that deregulation should be slowed until there is greater
harmony among EC members on taxes and road-user fees, making
competition fairer. Even if the process is delayed, however,
industry executives see the trend toward open roads as
unstoppable.
   "The forces behind deregulation are fierce," says Cees
Ruijgrok, a transport consultant in Delft. He says big
manufacturers, fed up with paying extra to protect marginal
haulers, will maintain the pressure for change.
   At A.T. Kearney Inc. in Brussels, consultants predict that
competition will intensify enough to push road-transport
prices down about 15% over the next five years.
   Many of the tiny haulers are likely to survive by keeping
costs low and acting as subcontractors to the pan-European
operators. Most vulnerable, analysts say, are midsize
trucking companies with high overheads and no specialized
skills to offer. Many of these operators are already selling
out to the giant companies.
   The giants fighting for dominance in Europe include three
Switzerland-based companies -- Kuhne &amp; Nagel, Panalpina World
Transport AG and Danzas AG -- as well as Nedlloyd Groep N.V.
of the Netherlands, LEP Group PLC of Britain, Schenker &amp; Co.
of Germany and Bilspedition AB of Sweden. Such companies act
as freight forwarders -- or organizers of traffic -- often
using small subcontractors to do the actual hauling.
   "We are not in the business of moving goods as such,"
explains Henk Rootliep, chairman of Nedlloyd, which over the
past two years has used acquisitions to triple its
road-transport revenue to 2 billion guilders ($1.08 billion)
annually. "We are in the business of controlling cargo
flows."
   For now, Nedlloyd is earning minimal profits from road
transport. But the company is gambling that it will be able
to integrate its acquisitions into a cohesive network and
emerge as one of the biggest survivors in a high-growth,
high-technology business.
   Growth is expected to kick into overdrive as a new Europe
takes shape. Over the next 15 years, Kearney projects,
international transport volumes will double in Europe. Part
of the reason for this is that manufacturers will be
centralizing production in huge factories serving all of
Europe rather than producing on a national level. The
centralized approach means that raw materials and finished
goods need to be shipped farther.
   That is where the high technology comes in. The biggest
transport companies tout their abilities to use Europe-wide
networks, linked up with computers, to find the cheapest ways
to move goods. They also offer to take on such tasks as
warehousing, inventory management, quality control, labeling,
packaging and even invoicing. For manufacturers trying to
concentrate on their core businesses, farming out such
logistical tasks can have strong appeal. In Switzerland, for
example, chocolate maker Jacob Suchard AG recently assigned
Danzas to build and operate an automated warehouse.
   At the same time, however, new competitors are challenging
the traditional road-transport companies. TNT Ltd. and
Federal Express Corp., both best known for their airborne
cargo services, are competing more and more with
road-transport companies in Europe, focusing on customers
willing to pay a premium for fast service.
   Japanese transport companies also are gaining a foothold
in Europe. Just last month, for instance, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
Ltd. bought a small Dutch trucking company to use as a base
for building up a European network.
   "Everybody is looking toward acquisitions," says Mathieu
Vanderbroeck, a transport consultant at Knight Wendling in
Brussels. That interest has pushed up prices to what some
people in the industry consider risky levels, and good
acquisitions are becoming hard to find -- particularly in
France, where numerous foreign companies are searching.
   For all the British government's hesitations over European
unity, U.K.-based transport companies are among the most
enthusiastic about Continental Europe.
   NFC PLC operates a distribution center for Marks &amp; Spencer
stores in France and provides similar services to Galerias
Preciados, a Spanish retailer. Christian Salvesen PLC hauls
Iglo frozen foods in Germany. LEP's road-transport arm
distributes spare parts for units of General Motors Corp. in
the Benelux countries.
   Meanwhile, the race is on to establish networks in Eastern
Europe. Danzas has set up a joint venture in Hungary. Kuhne &amp;
Nagel opened its first offices in East Germany last spring
and will soon open one in Poland; it has appointed a
representative in Prague and is negotiating a joint venture
in Yugoslavia.
   Frans Maas, with 1989 revenue of Fl 812 million, is still
in the second tier of Europe-wide transport companies but is
considered one of the best managed. Its share price has
nearly quadrupled in value since the company went public in
1987.
   In the simple brick headquarters that houses Frans Maas's
central staff of two dozen people, Mr. van Oijen says the
company's strategy calls for concentrating on what it knows
best: organizing shipments in Europe. To cover the rest of
the globe, Frans Maas relies on joint ventures, such as the
one it is setting up with Sea-Land Corp. of the U.S. It also
expects to collaborate with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which
owns 31% of Frans Maas.
   Like many others, Frans Maas wants to use its computer
expertise to manage its customers' logistical needs all the
way from raw materials to the store shelf. Its biggest such
contract is with Rank Xerox Manufacturing (Nederland) B.V.,
for which Frans Maas distributes copiers and related products
throughout Europe. Under that long-term contract, Frans Maas
and Rank Xerox are bound together by computer cables and an
intimate knowledge of each other's businesses. That makes it
harder for Rank Xerox to switch to another transport company
offering a slightly cheaper service.
   Such comprehensive "dedicated-logistics" arrangements
account for less than 10% of Frans Maas's revenue. Mr. van
Oijen says many factory managers are reluctant to become so
dependent on one transport company, but he predicts that more
of them will be converted. Toward that end, Frans Maas
promises to save companies large amounts by trimming their
inventories to the bone and taking on responsibility for such
projects as managing warehouses.
   "We have to offer the customer something special," Mr. van
Oijen says. "Driving from A to B -- anybody can do that."

   Leaving New York

   NEW YORK -- The Big Apple, long the heart of the
securities world, could lose a plum Wall Street tenant.
   Morgan Stanley Group Inc. is seriously weighing a move
from New York to Connecticut when its lease expires in 1997,
people familiar with the firm said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to cut costs, the big securities firm
recently has been looking at office space in Stamford and
Norwalk, among other cites, the people said.
   But some analysts say Morgan Stanley may be posturing.
They point to Dreyfus Corp., the mutual-fund group that last
year rattled the city's cage by threatening to leave New York
for New Jersey. Dreyfus finally won some last-minute tax
concessions and remained in New York.
   Morgan Stanley may end up moving some of its operations
outside the city, analysts say. But it would be impractical
for the firm to leave New York entirely.
   "Maybe they'll set up a nominal office . . . as a place to
stop on the way to the golf course," says John Keefe, a
securities-industry analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New
York. But leaving the city altogether would "be taking
themselves out of the flow" of client contacts and market
information, Mr. Keefe says.
   Morgan Stanley declined to comment on its plans.
   The firm currently has about 4,100 of its 6,800 employees
world-wide in six locations in New York, including an
operations office in Brooklyn. Some Morgan Stanley employees
privately say they aren't thrilled with the prospect of
leaving New York.
   But any move would be a blow to New York, which already is
reeling from sharp cutbacks in the securities and retailing
industries. Since the October 1987 stock-market crash, the
number of securities-industry employees in New York has
fallen 14% to 139,700, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
   Connecticut isn't Morgan Stanley's only target. The firm
will scour other cites outside New York, industry executives
said. But the firm's next step, they said, is to take an
option on some land in Connecticut to get a sense of the
fixed costs involved.

   CHICAGO -- Stotler Group Inc., the troubled futures
concern, was forced into bankruptcy late Friday by commodity
funds it managed that say Stotler owes them more than $5
million.
   Loans from these funds to cash-strapped Stotler Group were
the subject of fraud charges lodged against the company's
fund management division, Stotler Funds Inc., by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The CFTC charges were the first indication that customer
funds might have been lost as a result of Stotler Group's
worsening financial crisis over the past several weeks.
Although no individuals were named in the CFTC charges, the
ensuing uproar led Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann to resign last
week from the chairmanship of Stotler Group, and from the
prestigious chairmanship of the Chicago Board of Trade.
   More disciplinary actions against Stotler Group or its
units, and possibly its officers, are expected over the next
few months as details become known surrounding the decline
and fall of what had recently been one of the country's
biggest futures brokerage firms. Futures regulators have said
they may also refer certain aspects of Stotler Group's
collapse to the U.S. attorney for possible criminal
prosecution.
   Mr. Mahlmann has asserted that he knew nothing of the
loans made by the funds and hasn't been involved in the
day-to-day management of Stotler Group for two years.
   As the extent of Stotler Group's financial woes became
apparent in recent weeks, futures industry officials said
privately that it was highly unlikely the company could avoid
being forced into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which shields it
from creditors while giving it a chance to reorganize its
finances.
   The funds petitioning for bankruptcy were Advanced
Portfolio Management Partners Ltd. and Thomson McKinnon
Financial Futures Partners Inc. II. APM Partners holds an
unpaid $1 million demand note from Stotler Group. The Thomson
McKinnon fund owns shares in another fund, Compass Futures
Fund, that effectively lent Stotler Group more than $4
million via the purchase of commercial paper. An individual
who apparently is an investor in the Compass fund, David
Freund, was also included in the bankruptcy petition.
   On July 25 Stotler Group defaulted on $750,000 in
commercial paper payments, including $260,000 due the Compass
fund. At that time the company said it might not be able to
repay $7.6 million in debt payments due within 30 days. The
company's Stotler &amp; Co. futures brokerage unit was forced out
of business earlier last month after failing to meet industry
minimum capital requirements.
   Thomas Egan, Stotler Group president and chief executive
officer, said in a statement released Friday that the company
had talked with representatives of the funds to try and avert
an involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. "Our intention
and desire was to avert a filing in bankruptcy by developing
a workable plan to cooperate with and maximize the return to
creditors," he said.
   Now that the company has been pushed into bankruptcy, "it
appears unlikely that any return to shareholders of Stotler
Group will be possible," he said.

   Order Is Due to Baby Bell's
   Document Withholding
   In U.S. Contracts Probe

   WASHINGTON -- A federal judge lambasted U S West Inc. for
withholding documents from the Justice Department in a probe
of the company's sale of switching services to the federal
government.
   Judge Harold Greene said, "U S West has been engaged in a
systematic and calculated effort to frustrate the
department's legitimate demands for information, frequently
by patently frivolous and usually dilatory maneuvers." He
continued: "Indeed, in many respects, U S West's legal basis
for withholding documents or objecting to testimony was
entirely without legal foundation, factual basis, or both."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judge Greene, who oversees the consent decree that broke
up the Bell System in 1984, made the remarks in an order last
week setting up procedures for U S West to turn over certain
documents to Justice Department investigators.
   In January, the Justice Department whittled down its
request to 108 documents, and U S West decided that 23 could
be handed over, at least in part.
   A U S West spokesman said the Denver-based company has
turned over "at least 60,000 documents to the Justice
Department. The order covers 108, an infinitesimal number of
documents." U S West, he said, believes that most of those
documents are confidential.
   Judge Greene's decision in the documents dispute could be
appealed, but the company hasn't decided whether to take that
step, the spokesman said. He declined to discuss the overall
investigation or alleged improprieties in obtaining
government contracts for switching services.
   The scope of the investigation hasn't been disclosed, but
for the past three years, the agency, which has enforcement
authority for the Bell consent decree, has been looking into
alleged irregularities in switching service contracts between
U S West and the General Services Administration.
   At least part of the investigation involves switching
contracts awarded in 1987, a job that was a precursor to
construction of FTS-2000, the multibillion-dollar contract to
upgrade the federal government's long-distance
telecommunications system. That contract was split between
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and U S Sprint
Communications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.
Last year, a GSA engineer pleaded guilty to accepting meals
from BellSouth Corp. during the bidding process for the
switching contracts. BellSouth wasn't charged.
   In the U S West matter, Judge Greene said that two years
ago, the company "withheld hundreds of documents," claiming
they were confidential. For the past two years, he said, "U S
West has engaged in a calculated effort to delay compliance
with the department's request by a variety of tactics, in the
main related to claims of privilege." Later, when some
documents were delivered to the department, he said, "it
became apparent that there never had been a basis for the
claims of privilege."
   The judge also criticized U S West's assertion of
confidentiality when Justice Department lawyers began
deposing U S West employees. The company, he said,
"instructed witnesses not to answer even though the
information had already been disclosed in substantial part in
other documents or testimony."
   The court order said U S West already has disclosed
attorney-client communications on four topics, and thus has
waived its claim of privilege on those subjects. The topics
include a U S West decision that it didn't discriminate by
charging AT&amp;T and the GSA different rates for certain
services, and the application of special access surcharges to
private lines used in connection with switching services.
   For remaining documents, the judge ordered both sides to
work out an agreement, and he told U S West that "in view of
its past indefensible dilatory conduct," the company has the
burden of explaining in detail why disputed documents should
remain secret.
   The document squabble follows a Nynex Corp. indictment May
31 on one count of criminal contempt for violating the Bell
consent decree by providing information services through its
tiny Telco Research Corp. unit. The Justice Department
charged that Telco, a software company, provided MCI
Communications Corp. with computer services used to find the
cheapest way to configure telecommunications networks for big
corporate customers.
   Both matters are being handled by the department's special
task force to examine allegations of illegal activity by the
seven Baby Bells. At the time of the Nynex indictment,
Constance Robinson, who heads the task force, said the unit
was investigating other regional phone companies.

37 RB211 engines from Rolls-Royce PLC, a London-based maker
of aircraft engines, for $160 million to equip the Spanish
national carrier's recently expanded fleet of Boeing Co.
757-model planes.
   The deal includes two engines for each of Iberia's 16
Boeing 757s, which the airline bought last May when it
upgraded its fleet. The engines are to be delivered from 1993
to 1994. The transaction also includes five spare engines and
equipment. Iberia's board approved a 104 billion-peseta
($1.06 billion) purchase of Boeing 757 aircraft on May 25.

   Barclay's Profit
   For Six Months

   LONDON -- Barclays PLC posted sickly earnings Friday, a
day after Midland Bank PLC announced "unacceptable results"
and wholesale job cuts.
   While both banks were expected to show poor results, both
did worse than expected. The British economy -- sapped by
high inflation and sluggish growth -- is the main culprit.
Corporations here, particularly small and middle-sized ones,
are under financial stress. Both Midland and Barclays have
sharply increased their provisions for bad corporate debts.

   Barclays reported a half-year pretax profit of #602
million ($1.1 billion), up 2% from #590 million the year
before. But its return on average total assets slumped to
0.9% from 1.0% in 1989.
   Meanwhile, the bank said it plans to sell its mercantile
credit operation in the United Kingdom. Midland is also
selling a subsidiary, its finance house, Forward Trust Group
Ltd.
   Overall, Midland's picture is bleaker. Alan Broughton, an
analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., remarked, "Midland's
figures were disastrous; Barclays' figures were
disappointing."
   Midland, which posted an anemic half-year pretax profit of
#36 million, plans to cut about 4,000 employees by the end of
1991, a reflection of the strains.
   Midland is selling Forward Trust to bolster its capital
base, whereas Barclays is disposing of its mercantile credit
operation for strategic reasons: It duplicates services
offered by Barclays' retail banking unit. In addition to #234
million of bad-loan provisions for the U.K. portfolio,
Midland is saddled with an overhang of Third World debt and
big trading losses from 1989.
   More recently, though, it is Britain's economic woes that
are hammering away at the banking industry's profits. "In
every case the banks reported worse results than the analysts
were looking for," said Rodney Schwartz, banking analyst with
Lehman Brothers International Inc. in London. He reasons that
the British economy is worse than the analysts had assumed.
   Barclays' U.K. banking and treasury operations showed a
first-half profit of #275 million, down from #519 million in
1989. The bank took a #290 million charge for bad and
doubtful debts, an increase of #244 million from last year.
Analysts expect the banking industry's problems to persist.
"We're still in an environment of high interest rates and
high inflation," said Morgan Stanley's Mr. Broughton. "The
number of insolvencies is increasing."

   AMERIFIRST BANK (Miami) -- Laurence B. Brody, a Miami
dentist and director of this thrift, was named chairman. Dr.
Brody succeeds M. Lee Pearce, who resigned, he said, because
he felt he could make no "further contribution" to the
thrift's attempts to turn around. Since last spring when Dr.
Pearce became chairman, the bank said, AmeriFirst had adopted
several cost-cutting measures, which "were not enough to
rescue AmeriFirst from its disastrous venture into commercial
real estate."

   ROME -- Italy's foreign trade account swung to a surplus
of 1.25 trillion lire ($1.07 billion) in June from a deficit
of 728 billion lire a year earlier and from a 2.495
trillion-lira gap in May, Istat, the state statistical
office, said.
   Istat also said the trade balance in the first six months
of this year showed a deficit of 11.256 trillion lire,
compared with a 14.27 trillion-lira deficit a year earlier.
The trade statistics are provisional and aren't seasonally
adjusted.

   Judge Approves a County Redistricting
   In Los Angeles to Bolster Hispanic Vote

   LOS ANGELES -- Federal Judge David V. Kenyon approved a
new map of county supervisorial boundaries here with a
voting-rights order that could shift the balance of power in
one of the nation's most populous counties.
   Judge Kenyon's order creates a new district designed to
assure that a Hispanic is elected to the county's five-member
governing board, but also allows candidates who don't live in
the district to seek to represent the district on the board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judge Kenyon adopted the redistricting plan proposed by
the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Education Fund. An estimated 35% of the
county's 8.7 million residents are Hispanic, according to a
demographer who drew up the plan.
   The Los Angeles County plan affects more people than any
other local voting-rights case and may serve as a precedent
for other municipalities, said Chandler Davidson, a Rice
University sociology professor and author of a book about the
underrepresentation of minorities in state and local elective
offices.
   Noting that most of the voting-rights litigation has
occurred in the deep South and Texas, Mr. Davidson said
"California is ripe for this type of litigation," with large
Hispanic, black and Asian minorities. "There are a lot of
potential plaintiffs out there."
   Conservative county supervisors Michael Antonovich and
Deane Dana said they filed a motion Friday with the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to block the
judge's order. With the new district lines the pair face
losing their sway over the board.
   "It's a judge running wild -- making law instead of
interpreting law," Mr. Antonovich said. "It's disgusting to
see Judge Kenyon work with two special interest groups . . .
in pursuing their liberal ideological agenda."
   ACLU attorney Mark Rosenbaum disagreed saying, "The board
of supervisors is the most powerful local government in the
United States and some want it to remain an exclusive
all-white club . . . but {the judge's order} means for the
first time in 115 years the club is open to Hispanics."
   Under the plan adopted by Judge Kenyon, a supervisorial
district represented by a retiring conservative supervisor
was redrawn to give it a Hispanic majority. The other four
districts would undergo minor adjustments that will generally
preserve the voter bases of two liberal and two conservative
supervisors.
   Judge Kenyon's order could change 10 years of a
conservative majority on the board, possibly leading to
sweeping reversals on health care and social services
spending policies. The order was the judge's solution to
correct supervisorial boundaries that he earlier found
discriminatory.
   The decision also sets a special election for Nov. 6 for
the new Hispanic majority district and voids results of a
June primary election. The district had been represented by
conservative Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who is retiring.
   Judge Kenyon ruled June 4 that the board discriminated
against Hispanics when redrawing district boundaries after
the 1980 census. He found the supervisors violated the
federal Voting Rights Act and ordered the board to submit a
plan that would make it easier for a Hispanic win a seat.
Last week, he rejected the board's proposal as "nonsensical"
and "insensitive" to Hispanic and black residents.
   In setting the new election date, the judge waived a
residency requirement to permit the two top June election
finishers under the old boundaries to run as candidates in
the redrawn district. Ironically, the top vote getter was
Sarah Flores, an Hispanic woman who is also a conservative
Republican. If she were elected in November, she would become
the first Hispanic supervisor since 1875, but the board would
continue to be dominated by conservatives.
   Ms. Flores, a former assistant to Mr. Schabarum, blasted
the judge's order because it voided what she called the only
election in the last 30 years in which a Hispanic has a
chance of winning.

   Americans may have Saddam Hussein to thank for the
Recession of 1990.
   Friday's bleak report that the unemployment rate rose
sharply to 5.5% suggests that even before Iraq's invasion of
oil-rich Kuwait last week, America's wheezing economy had
ground to a virtual halt. Since the invasion, oil prices have
jumped about $5 a barrel, and many economists now see the
chances of a recession raised from a possibility to a
probability.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'm the gloomiest I've been since 1979," says Allen Sinai
of the Boston Co.
   After nearly eight years of a growing economy, the
confident consumers of the Reagan years have turned cautious
and are slowing their purchases. The credit boom of the 1980s
has given way to the credit squeeze of 1990. The auto and
housing industries have long been weak. In the past 12
months, the economy has grown barely 1%. Now, the surge in
unemployment has followed a recent string of bad numbers,
including a 1.5% drop in factory orders in June, and suggests
that growth may have stopped altogether.
   Add to that an increase in oil prices, and you have what
many economists consider a sure recipe for recession.
Moreover, a successful boycott of Iraqi oil would drive oil
prices into the stratosphere and practically guarantee a
recession in the U.S.
   The Bush administration tried to put the best face on the
unemployment numbers, brushing away talk of recession. But
privately, one administration economist acknowledged that the
White House, after stripping away special factors, judged
Friday's labor report the worst since the end of the 1982
recession. The administration's top economic policy makers --
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director Richard
Darman and Economist Michael Boskin -- were known to be
increasingly concerned. In private, they were described as
more and more frustrated with the Federal Reserve, which may
hold the best hope for keeping the economy afloat.
   Faced with a weakening economy, the central bank is likely
to move as early as this week to cut interest rates. Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan is worried by the employment numbers
and fears that the credit problems may be biting too deep.
   But any such move will probably be modest, perhaps cutting
the key federal funds interest rate by a quarter percentage
point -- much less, in any case, than the administration is
hoping for. The gap between what the White House wants and
what the Fed is willing to provide is wide -- and
administration officials say it grew even wider after the
Iraqi invasion.
   The oil-price rise that it unleashed is a double-edged
sword for the U.S. economy, simultaneously reducing growth
and raising inflation. So, for Mr. Greenspan, the invasion
poses a painful dilemma.
   If he tries to cushion the economy by flooding it with
money and lowering rates, he might avoid a recession for a
while. But that would risk aggravating inflation; that's what
happened in the oil-shocked 1970s, when the U.S. suffered
double-digit price increases. Mr. Greenspan was in government
at that time, serving as an economic adviser to President
Ford, and he is determined not to wade through that swamp
again.
   But if Mr. Greenspan tries to press the anti-inflation
fight as his No. 1 priority, he may have to tolerate a
recession. That's always an unappealing prospect, but
especially so right now. The Fed is clearly worried that a
recession, by dragging down additional thrift institutions,
could make the savings-and-loan crisis even more appalling
than it already is. Even worse, a recession might undermine
substantial numbers of weak banks. Moreover, Mr. Greenspan
would be taking a hard line in an election year, to the
predictable outrage of an administration clearly allergic to
tight credit.
   The Iraqi invasion also throws a huge new obstacle in the
budget talks currently under way between the administration
and Congress. Negotiators had privately been counting on a
new energy tax as a big money-raiser in the effort to bring
down the deficit. But with gasoline prices already projected
to increase at least 10 cents a gallon, the political
appetite for a tax that would push that further is certain to
fade.
   There is likely to be "less interest among summiteers in
energy taxes, gasoline taxes or, for that matter, excise
taxes, that would increase the rate of inflation," says
Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget
Office. To the contrary, Republican Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico says several of his Senate colleagues have even begun
to inquire about enacting costly new tax breaks to encourage
domestic oil production.
   Cutting defense spending also may be more difficult in the
wake of the Iraqi invasion, negotiators say. And talk of
recession is certain to raise fears that a budget pact will
make the nation's economic problems even worse in the short
term. "With the economy in a state of slow growth, people get
worried that any adjustment will tip us over," says Rep. Bill
Frenzel, a Minnesota Republican. "The momentum is in the
hands of the big spenders."
   Budget negotiators still hope they can cut a
deficit-reduction deal after returning from their August
vacations. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser of
Tennessee reasons that economic problems may even be a spur
to action.
   But if there is a deal, it now seems likely to be more
modest than that originally envisioned by the budget
summiteers. Administration officials have even discussed the
possibility of a package that makes only shallow cuts in the
deficit in the first year but promises bigger cuts later --
after the economy has recovered. "The real question," said
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta of California,
"is whether the agreement will be as bold as any of us would
like."
   Whether the economy will fall into recession is still far
from certain. Although the latest figures show widespread
weakness, a continued pickup in American exports,
particularly to Europe, promises some help to the economy.
And Mr. Boskin, the chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers, continues to predict that "the economy
will pick up in coming months."
   Others are less certain. "The chances of a recession have
risen," says Victor Zarnowitz, an economist at the University
of Chicago. "Maybe they aren't higher than 50%, but they are
very close to that."
   If the economy does turn down, most analysts expect the
recession to be relatively mild. Although the economy is
awash in excessive debt, it isn't suffering from the high
inflation rates and other excesses that made the slumps of
the 1970s and 1980s so painful. "If we have a recession, it
will probably feel like recessions of the 1950s and 1960s,"
says Harvard economist Lawrence Summers.
   Unemployment is also likely to remain well below its
double-digit rates of 1982. With fewer teen-agers and women
entering the work force these days, finding jobs for those
who want them is simpler.
   But even without 1982-style joblessness, the bite of a
recession would nevertheless be felt -- and indeed already is
being felt in some areas. Falling home prices in New England,
for instance, are making many people feel substantially less
prosperous. Bernice Cramer bought a home for $437,000 in
Newton, Mass., in June 1988 and has watched its value
nosedive. She figures it is now worth $50,000 to $75,000 less
than when she bought it.
   "I love my house, I'm glad I bought it, but I threw away a
lot of money," Ms. Cramer says. As a result, the business
consultant and her family are having to be more cautious in
their spending. "We get along with one car, instead of buying
a second one."
   Although New England may be the worst hit, other areas of
the country are experiencing a housing-led recession as well.
Robert Gordon, a professor of economics at Northwestern
University, says the prosperous North Shore of Chicago is
also seeing a dearth of real-estate sales. And declines in
housing prices are spilling over into other sectors of the
economy as house-poor consumers trim purchases.
   "Rising housing prices and rising housing equity give
people a kind of financial flexibility and an air of optimism
that has positive effects" throughout the economy, says
Thomas Juster, a consumer-behavior specialist at the
University of Michigan. "But in these weaker housing markets,
where the house is worth less than people paid for it," the
opposite is true, and spending declines. Mr. Juster adds that
a fall in real-estate values is far more damaging to consumer
spending than, say, a fall in stock prices because few
Americans own substantial amounts of stock.
   A recession would also be unusually mild for
manufacturers. In the past, goods producers have taken the
biggest hit when the economy turns down, while service firms
have been less badly battered. This time, however, many
manufacturers are getting a boost from healthy exports.
   Bankruptcies are likely to be common in a recession of
1990, if it occurs. The debt craze of the 1980s left many
companies with more debt than they can possibly service in a
sluggish economy. Some have already started to default;
others are sure to as the economy slows.
   But Harvard's Prof. Summers argues that debt-driven
bankruptcies may not hurt the economy as much as previous
business shake-ups. In 1982, he notes, companies were going
belly up because their products or services had suddenly
become uncompetitive in the world market. In 1990, however,
many of the debt-burdened companies would remain profitable
if it weren't for their debt. Those companies may simply be
sold off to new owners, causing losses for the banks and
junk-bond holders who lent them money but without causing big
layoffs.
   Even if the economy steers clear of a recession, the
immediate future is hardly bright, however. Economic growth
is likely to remain what it has been for the past year:
sluggish.
   "The long-term growth rate is very important," Mr.
Zarnowitz says. In the '50s and '60s, he notes, recessions
were frequent, but growth was stronger between recessions.
Now, the economy seems to have settled into a long,
slow-growth expansion, averaging only 1.2% growth over the
past year. "It's not clear to me this isn't worse," he says.

   Sudden Impact: Prices at U.S. Gas Pumps Soar

   Gasoline prices have shot up as much as 15 cents a gallon
in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and are likely to go
higher despite outcries from motorists, politicians and
consumer groups.
   Only hours after news of the hostilities broke, prices
were being raised all along America's gasoline supply chain,
from refineries to the corner service station. "I've never
seen it happen so quickly," said Bill Dodd, a harried staff
member at the Florida branch of the American Automobile
Association in Orlando. Pump prices in that state jumped two
to 15 cents on Friday and "indications are they are going up
higher," he said. "As we're speaking, the price is going up."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Michigan, one-third of all service stations had raised
pump prices five cents to 10 cents a gallon by Friday and
most others expected to have prices up by today, according to
a national AAA survey. Massachusetts motorists were already
paying six cents more Friday. In California, major refiners
such as Atlantic Richfield Co. and Chevron Corp. had boosted
prices they charge to dealers by four or five cents a gallon.
   Nationally, the AAA said, the average price of
self-service unleaded had zoomed up by four cents to $1.115 a
gallon by Friday morning. At some of the 1,400 stations
checked, the boost was as big as 15 cents. The AAA said the
price increases were just the beginning, too, because some
big wholesale price increases still remained to be passed on
to consumers. "We're calling for restraint," said a spokesman
for the national association.
   Others are screaming.
   "We can't win," said Edwin Rothschild, energy policy
director of the Washington consumer-advocate group Citizen
Action. "Falling crude led to higher gasoline prices earlier
this year. Now we have higher crude prices and gasoline
prices go up again."
   "I've been getting tons of phone calls from members who
believe the oil companies are profiteering and taking
advantage of a bad situation," said Mr. Dodd of the Florida
AAA.
   At least one politician, Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D.,
Conn.), demanded establishment of a government task force to
"monitor the oil industry" and look for "signs of panic or
profit taking that may be harming consumers." He echoed the
widespread consumer complaint that oil companies raise
gasoline prices quickly when crude prices go up but seem
forgetful when crude falls.
   The latest boosts are certainly pulling a lot of money
from the pockets of motorists, and quickly. A
five-cent-a-gallon increase translates into an extra $16.3
million a day nationally. If that increase lasts for a year,
it adds up to about $5.9 billion that consumers won't have
available to spend elsewhere.
   Public irritation over the speedy price increases could
cause unexpected results. Most troublesome is the possibility
that the fear and furor -- all by itself -- could fuel
further price increases and possibly even create lines at
service stations.
   Gasoline demand may jump sharply and stay unusually high
in coming weeks simply because motorists, trying to beat the
next price rise or worried about shortages, may insist on
filling up their tanks and keeping them full. Normally, they
might drive around on half a tank most of the time.
   "If you put another quarter of a tank {of gasoline} in
every car in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan, it makes a
huge difference," said Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. in New York. That sudden added demand was as
much a cause of service station lines during the Iranian
crisis in 1979 as was the actual cutoff of crude oil, he
maintained.
   In fact, with far fewer gas stations in the U.S. today, he
said the chance of gas lines are even greater now. "In the
old days, you had four or five stations in the neighborhood
and now you have two," Mr. Jacoboski said. Once started, "it
snowballs," he said. "The guy in the office says, `You should
have seen the line at the local Shell station,'" and everyone
rushes to fill up.
   Oil companies, smarting from public charges of price
gouging and profiteering once again, denied that was the
case. But when asked to explain the pricing process, some
declined. An Exxon Corp. spokesman said company officials
wouldn't comment. "The situation is moving so fast," he said,
adding: "They're observing the marketplace." Amoco Corp.
officials also declined to comment.
   "It's a public relations nightmare," said a marketing
executive for a major oil company, who sought anonymity. "The
oil industry has not had an outstanding reputation, and it's
the only business where you have to post your prices with
15-foot-high signs."
   Others, however, did try to explain the immediate rise in
gasoline prices. The reason, many said, is that gasoline --
like crude oil or gold or soybeans -- is a traded commodity
and acts like one, with prices moving in a free market,
sometimes exaggerated and hastened by commodity futures
trading. The production cost at the time the gasoline was
made doesn't control such trading.
   Right now, "there is fear and panic in the marketplace,"
said an Arco spokesman. "Because of that, you're seeing an
irrational response" through the entire distribution system
that includes the oil companies, middlemen known as jobbers
and the stations themselves.
   As the market price moved, sellers tried to stay in line.
Arco, the spokesman said, raised prices in a defensive
response to boosts by other oil companies. "If the difference
between our gasoline and our competitors' is five to 15
cents, we'd have a run on our supply" all the way from the
gasoline pumps to Arco's wholesale distribution network, he
said.
   That explanation is echoed by a spokesman for Coastal
Corp., a big refiner, wholesaler and retailer based in
Houston. "We didn't initiate any price increases. We follow
the market," he said, referring to the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Gasoline futures prices rose more than four cents a
gallon in trading on the Merc on Friday, settling at 72.18
cents. The price had ranged as high as 78.5 cents during the
day.
   The Coastal spokesman said the company raised prices to
protect its regular customers. "We had to go to the price
increases to allocate supply," he said. "If you become the
low-price supplier, nonregular customers start buying."
   Coastal raised wholesale prices to 6,000 regular customers
by seven to eight cents a gallon Thursday. It then bumped
prices up eight to nine cents more on Friday, but later that
same day it dropped back a nickel because it was out of line
with the market in the other direction, the spokesman said.
   The same forces that caused refiners and wholesalers to
raise prices applies at the corner station. Marty Bush, owner
of a Texaco station in Beaumont, Texas, and president of the
Lone Star Service Stations Association, says he believes
several nearby stations boosted their prices even though
their costs hadn't gone up. He disapproves and refused to do
so himself Friday. "People get upset with you," he said.
   Mike Grivon, owner of a Houston Shell station, said Friday
he hadn't raised prices either because he had received a
delivery just under the wire at old prices. "I got a load of
gas last night, {one hour} before midnight," when a boost
went into effect. "If I'd gotten it later I would have been
up three cents a gallon." With prices several cents lower
than nearby stations the next morning, Mr. Grivon said, cars
were stacked up four deep at his pumps.
   But Rita Johnson, manager of a Chevron station about a
mile away, didn't get that break. She raised prices a nickel
early Friday because the price she paid went up that much. "I
received a call late {Thursday} evening from California
stating that my cost for the gas I received this morning
would be five cents a gallon more," she said. She gets no
slack in paying. When 9,000 gallons is delivered, she said,
"I give the driver the check."
   So "the consumer bites the bullet," she conceded.
   The gasoline she received came from a Chevron terminal in
nearby Galena Park, said Bruce Frolich, Chevron vice
president of supply and distribution. It was probably made at
the company's Port Arthur refinery about 100 miles away, he
said, from crudes produced in Texas, West Africa, the North
Sea or Mexico. The trip from the refinery to Ms. Johnson's
pumps probably took at least 30 days.
   The decision to raise prices was made in company
headquarters, in San Francisco. "We just decided that the
market {was} a nickel above where we were," said James
Huccaby, manager of pricing and supply. "This thing really
took off."

   GATT Says Reform
   In New Zealand to Aid
   Its Economic Growth

   GENEVA -- New Zealand's economic reform program is likely
to promote its structural adjustment and economic growth,
according to a new study by the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, or GATT, the international body that governs most
world trade.
   The study, a mix of praise and criticism formulated by the
GATT secretariat, said the reforms will "strengthen the
country's links with the world economy and provide for trade
policies and practices which are more firmly based on GATT
rules and principles."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The report also said, "The potential gains from
international trade are particularly large for New Zealand."
   At the same time, however, the study hinged its judgment
on the proviso that the reforms are "consistently and fully
continued and implemented."
   The report said New Zealand's trade policies "have
generally become less distortive and more transparent over
the last 10 years."
   And it continued, "With the recent orientation of
trade-related policies, the country is already a more
attractive market for many trading partners through improved
market access and the prospects of accelerated medium-term
growth in a more efficient New Zealand economy."
   The report praised New Zealand's liberalization drive.
"The coverage of import licensing has been reduced, tariffs
have been cut through a general tariff reduction program,
most export incentive schemes and subsidies have been
eliminated, the role of the state in trade has been reduced,
foreign-exchange restrictions have been removed, and
financial controls and rules on foreign investments have been
relaxed," the report said.
   But it added that the country is "still a considerable
distance from being an open economy." GATT said that New
Zealand's tariff rates "don't yet appear particularly stable
or predictable," and that marketing boards still "enjoy
considerable monopoly powers in domestic and foreign trade in
agriculture."

   Matsushita Electric Moves to Re-Enter
   Computer Market It Left 25 Years Ago

<LP>
   TOKYO -- Twenty-five years after Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., the world's largest consumer electronics
maker, quit the computer market, the company is gearing up to
re-enter the fray.
   Consumer electronics makers must move aggressively into
the computer field, Matsushita's president, Akio Tanii, says
about the changing face of the industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With the line between consumer and industrial electronics
becoming blurred and with computer functions being
incorporated into household electronics products to control
them, Matsushita must evolve into a diversified electronics
maker, Mr. Tanii says.
   "Matsushita's emphasis on electronics for the home won't
change," Mr. Tanii asserts. "We have no intention of making
mainframes. We won't become an IBM."
   But as word processors, fascimile machines and personal
computers move from the workplace to the home, Matsushita
will adapt to supply the mass market, Mr. Tanii says.
   Matsushita, whose consolidated sales of National and
Panasonic brand name products were $37.8 billion in fiscal
1989, is stressing six growth sectors, including information
and communication equipment, factory automation and
semiconductors, on its road to diversification.
   "The audio-visual sector will continue to be what people
think of first when they think of Matsushita," Mr. Tanii
said. But with telecommunications equipment such as
computers, telephones, facsimiles and word processors
increasingly merging with audio-visual equipment, Matsushita
must stress those fields as well, he says.
   Electronics industry analysts say the move into industrial
electronics is a good one, as expectations of 10% growth for
that sector in fiscal 1990 and 1991 are far higher than the
zero to 3% growth forecast for the consumer electronics
sector.
   Matsushita's results for the latest fiscal year point to
the company's change in direction. While sales of video
equipment, one of the company's traditional areas of
emphasis, grew just 2% in the latest fiscal year,
communication and industrial equipment sales of products such
as personal computers, word processors, printers and factory
automation equipment rose 24%.
   "We're aiming to maintain that level of growth," says
Hiroyuki Mizuno, executive vice president in charge of
Research and Development.
   Matsushita's chief spokesman, Akira Nagano, said the
company's shift into new sectors has lowered the proportion
of traditional consumer electronics sales to 45% of the total
in 1989 from 58% in 1985.
   Despite the changes to date, Matsushita's efforts so far
have left many industry analysts unconvinced the company is
successfully adapting to changes in the industry.
   Some assert that the giant electronics maker is too big
and bureaucratic to keep pace with changing trends. Many say
Matsushita's strategy of using superior mass production
capabilities and an extensive sales network to dominate
markets pioneered by smaller, more innovative companies may
no longer work in today's market.
   "With the consumer electronics market flattening out,
they've got to become more innovative," said one analyst.
   Analysts' coolness is partly a reflection on Matsushita's
ability to buy its way into growth sectors. With $21.4
billion in cash and short-term securities on hand, analysts
see great potential for the company to acquire established
companies in its chosen growth sectors.
   But the company's stance concerning acquisitions remains
cautious. "If a good opportunity materializes, we will study
the possibility" but Matsushita has no concrete plans about
further acquisitions at present, Mr. Tanii said.
   He says acquisitions will be considered only if they can
help the company achieve its goals more efficiently than can
be done through internal development.
   That caution has prompted industry watchers to urge
Matsushita to take greater risks and move more decisively to
ensure future growth.
   But Matsushita's top management says its restructuring is
already well under way, positioning the company to remain a
leader in the next generation of home electronics.
"Matsushita has already changed a great deal," says Mr.
Mizuno, noting that communication and industrial equipment
will soon account for 25% of Matsushita's total sales, up
from 17% in 1985. And the company has the potential for
further dramatic change, he said.
   "It's far too early to write off Matsushita as a stodgy
old company that can't change," says Martin Berrisford,
electronics sector analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities in
Tokyo.
   The company's push into the semiconductor and electronics
components sector has been well received by industry
watchers. Sales grew 8% in the latest fiscal year to 781.2
billion yen (US$5.23 billion) and Matsushita officials said
the dawn of the semiconductor-intensive high-definition
television, HDTV, era could boost the company from sixth
place in memory production to first.
   But while the company's semiconductor outlook appears
strong, many analysts doubt that Matsushita can wrest a
substantial enough chunk of the computer market from the
industry front-runners to boost the company's growth.
   Mr. Mizuno, the head of Matsushita's research and
development efforts, says such views ignore the changes
sweeping the computer industry. "Up till now, computer makers
have concentrated on closed architecture with proprietary
operating systems, forcing customers to rely on a limited
number of makers to build their information networks," Mr.
Mizuno says.
   "But that day is ending," Mr. Mizuno says, and the
companies that dominated the old era won't necessarily
dominate the coming era.
   The rise of open architecture, with computer makers
adapting their machines to a common operating system, will
pave the way for greater standardization, allowing computers
to become a mass market product, the Matsushita executive
says.
   Currently, Matsushita's computer operations have just
begun, officials say. "We are still just beginning to study"
the options, according to Mr. Tanii, the company's president.
By one estimate, sales of computers and work stations
accounted for just 10% of Matsushita's sales of
communications and industrial products during the latest
fiscal year, or just under 2.5% of the company's total sales.
   But "when computers become a {standardized} home
electronics product, Matsushita will be the number one
computer maker, Mr. Mizuno predicts confidently.
   Matsushita's first giant step into the computer field will
be HDTV, company officials said.

10.2% in July 1989, the Ministry of Employment said.
   The number of people out of work in Belgium totaled
352,255 in July, the ministry said. Unemployment historically
tends to surge in July because of the number of people
leaving school and entering the job market. In 1989, the July
rate rose to 10.2% from 9.1% in June.

   See It Again: Murrow TV Documentary

   When reporters sit down over a beer and talk about a
broadcast journalists' Hall of Fame, the name that always
comes up first is Edward R. Murrow. The gritty voice, the
dangling cigarette, the steely lyricism of his words, the
unflinching intensity of his convictions -- Murrow has long
been the standard for the TV newsman's trade. "We all wanted
to be like him," recalls CBS's Charles Kuralt.
   So it's not surprising that Susan Steinberg's two-part
biography on the American Masters series, "Edward R. Murrow:
This Reporter" (PBS, tonight, 9 p.m. EDT; check local
listings), lively as it is, is something of a sanctification.
If there is such a thing as a patron saint of broadcast
journalism, it's Ed Murrow. But the great irony of his career
is that while everyone reveres him now, back in the late
1950s, even his own company, CBS, couldn't wait to be rid of
him. And frankly, despite all the lip service, if Murrow came
back today, he'd have problems getting two minutes of air
time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The marriage of Murrow and television was always a prickly
one. He was not a natural TV presence. You could tell by the
awkward way he held his cigarette, the stiff, off-center pose
that he adopted as he peered up into the camera. And he
wasn't only uncomfortable with appearing on TV, he was
uncomfortable with the very idea of TV. While fascinated with
the technology, Murrow looked down on the medium. He looked
down on TV newsmen, especially the first anchors like Douglas
Edwards, as "performers." Today's anchors may claim him as
some sort of progenitor, but Ed Murrow was never a news
anchor, and he was a reluctant TV reporter.
   First and foremost, Murrow was a radio man. Overseeing
CBS's radio coverage in Europe during the late 1930s, he was
unable to find enough reporters to cover all the stories
around the time of Hitler's rise, and so he ended up on the
air himself, as a stopgap measure. Of course, Murrow would
eventually gather a team of journalists, great journalists
who would become known as Murrow's Boys -- among them Eric
Sevareid, Howard K. Smith, Richard C. Hottelet, who were all
interviewed for this documentary. And of course, Murrow would
become the greatest on-air radio commentator of them all.
   "This . . ." and half a heartbeat later ". . . is London."
Murrow's broadcasts brought World War II home to America. His
fiercely evocative word portraits told of blitzkriegs and
bombings and air-raid shelters.
   After the war came television, and with it, Murrow's two
series, "See It Now" and "Person to Person," which was a
fairly lighthearted peek into the linen closets of the rich
and famous, from Brando to Bogart, from Castro to Dick Clark.
"See It Now" was the eight-yearlong docu-series that
solidified Murrow's fame and established him as the
"conscience of CBS" (in CBS Chairman William Paley's words).
   The high point of "See It Now" -- some say the most
courageous use of television ever -- was the show that took
on Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1954 (this week's installment
tells how the decision to do it was made). According to one
story told in Ms. Steinberg's film, Murrow gathered all his
CBS staff together before the program aired and asked if they
had any secrets that might damage the show's integrity. One
admitted to a former wife who had been a member of the Young
Communists. A silence fell over the group, and then Murrow
said, "The terror is right here, in this room. We go tomorrow
night."
   But after this high point came a gradual falling off, when
the senior management decided it was a little fed up with all
the controversy generated by this "conscience of CBS." TV was
going in one direction, Murrow another. Evidence of the break
was an industry speech in 1958 in which Murrow condemned
"evidence of decadence, escapism and insulation from the
world in which we live" on TV.
   The basic conflict had been there since the beginning.
Murrow was always a word and idea man in a medium governed by
the logic of pictures. If his prose occasionally veered
toward the overstated, the overblown, even the pompous, there
was still no question that this was a writer. Unlike most
correspondents today, he was never afraid to use a metaphor.
Once on a bombing raid, he looked down on a series of
incendiary explosions in nighttime Berlin and called them "a
fistful of white rice on black velvet."
   His type of skill is not in style anymore. Today, writing
counts for less and less on TV -- something Ms. Steinberg's
own documentary inadvertently proves. "Edward R. Murrow: This
Reporter" is certainly an engaging look at an important
career, with all sorts of recognizable faces (Dan Rather, Ted
Koppel, Diane Sawyer, Walter Cronkite) chiming in. That makes
it fun.
   But in keeping with the current vogue in
documentary-making, this one has no narration (with the
exception of one or two voice-overs from Mr. Kuralt), no
through line, and for this kind of film, that's a real
shortcoming. A sense of structure is missing. Told as an oral
history, the program is a compilation of quotes touching end
to end like dominoes, but like a game of dominoes, it
meanders all over the place.
   The program also suffers from something that Murrow would
never have countenanced: a shortage of facts. When was he
born? When did he die? The documentary rarely answers the
most basic questions -- who, what, when, where and why.
   Worst of all, the show dribbles off to a soggy finish,
showing kids in high school today viewing one of Murrow's
last pieces (the powerful "Harvest of Shame") and explaining
why it's relevant to them.
   To be fair, "Edward R. Murrow: This Reporter" is an
enjoyable collection of anecdotes, but what it lacks is a
strong guiding intelligence. In fact, like too much of
today's TV, it lacks exactly what Murrow could have given it.

   Environmental Stock Sinks as Firm
   Faces Regulatory Snags Over Slag

   One of those hot new "environmental" stocks is taking a
pounding as investors begin to wonder if the company may be
-- gasp -- a polluter itself.
   The infant stock is Horsehead Resources Development, a
zinc recycler that soared and then sank after it sold a 10%
stake to the public last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Horsehead's fate illuminates the fragility of the
small-stock market, which plunged 2.67% Friday based on the
11.43-point drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index. It also shows
that even this year's wildly popular environmental-cleanup
stocks are highly vulnerable to the shifting tides of federal
regulation.
   A darling of the initial-offering crowd little more than a
month ago, Horsehead gave up 1 1/8 in Friday's big market
sell-off to finish at 15 1/2, not far above its $14.50
offering price and down from a recent high above 22.
   Based in the heart of Pennsylvania's steel-making country,
Horsehead sells its recycling service to "mini-mills" that
recover steel from scrap metal. Using intense heat, Horsehead
recovers zinc from a dust created in steelmaking that also
contains dangerous levels of lead and cadmium.
   Horsehead not only resells the recycled zinc, but also
recovers the lead and cadmium in a concentrate and ships it
off for further recycling. All that recycling leaves some
slag, which Horsehead sells to such customers as the
Pennsylvania transportation department, which plans to spread
it on icy winter roads.
   That slag could become a snag, however, at least according
to analyst Debra G. Coy of Washington Analysis Corp., a
subsidiary of County NatWest Securities. In two reports last
month, Ms. Coy cautioned investors that recent court rulings
might result in costly new regulation of the slag.
   Currently, the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't
regulate such slag, making zinc recovery and other recycling
businesses much cheaper than the regulated landfill and
waste-treatment sector. In fact, the advantage made the waste
treatment companies so mad they became the unlikely
bedfellows of environmentalists in a court challenge to EPA's
rules.
   "What the hell good does it do to reclaim zinc if in
exchange for that you take the lead, cadmium and chromium and
throw them onto the ground as slag?" demands Richard Fortuna,
executive director of a group of recycling competitors known
as the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council.
   In two court challenges to the EPA, a federal district
appeals court in Washington ruled this summer that the agency
has the authority to regulate the slag and suggested that it
figure out how to do so. It would be "totally irresponsible"
of the EPA to fail to regulate it by year end, Mr. Fortuna
contends.
   With environmentalists and competing companies pressing
for controls on recyclers, Ms. Coy says she thinks the
regulatory risk to Horsehead is "significant." On the other
hand, any increased controls could benefit such commercial
waste treatment companies as Envirosafe and the
exchange-listed Chemical Waste Management, Rollins
Environmental and Environmental Systems, she adds.
   Horsehead is so confident of the safety of its recycling
method that it didn't even mention the court case in its
preliminary offering document. "We didn't believe it to be of
material significance," says chief financial officer Robert
L. Hoguet III. The ruling occurred after the document was
issued, whereupon the company did mention it in the final
offering document, saying that the ruling wouldn't have a
meaningful impact.
   Mr. Hoguet notes that the EPA has accepted the company's
recovery method as the industry standard. For more than two
years, he adds, tests of the iron-rich slag left over from
the recyling have produced "a fraction" of the level of
contaminants considered dangerous by the EPA. "We think {any
new} regulations would have to be based on our technology,"
he says. In a seven-page, single-spaced response to Ms. Coy,
Horsehead noted that it is working on a process in which the
iron-rich slag is further used to recover heavy metals from
waste water.
   The uncertain regulatory outlook, and volatile zinc
prices, scared off one portfolio manager from the initial
offering. Zinc prices have yanked around the stock as much as
Ms. Coy's report. The shares peaked at 22 1/4 in mid-July as
zinc prices climbed amid the prospect of a labor strike.
After a settlement, Horsehead eased in tandem with falling
zinc prices and hovered around 17 and 18 until last week's
market fall.
   Such unpredictability doesn't faze two other mutual fund
managers, Larry Greenberg of the Fidelity Select
Environmental Services Fund and David Beckwith of the Freedom
Environmental Fund. Both participated in the initial
offering, although Mr. Beckwith says he didn't make "a big
bet" with 20,000 shares.
   Mr. Greenberg thinks Horsehead's recycling prowess will
overcome any regulatory obstacles. He estimates the company
will earn 65 cents a share this year and 90 cents a share in
1991. He expects the market will be willing to pay 20 to 25
times next year's earnings for the stock. But he warns
investors to approach all environmental services stocks "with
their eyes open," vigilant for any signs of tighter
regulation.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Following the direction of larger stocks, over-the-counter
shares recovered from a steep plunge early Friday afternoon
but still ended the session with one of the year's largest
losses.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index, which plummeted more than 20
points early Friday afternoon, dropped 11.43 to 417.46, or
2.67%. Volume jumped to 203.2 million shares from 146.5
million shares Thursday as declining stocks overwhelmed
advancers, 1,818 to 484.
   The cascade of orders swamped some understaffed trading
desks and left some phones unanswered at the height of the
sell-off, according to some traders. Phil Allen, OTC trader
at Howe Barnes in Chicago, said his company was unable to get
through to other brokerage firms on a couple of occasions.
But Mr. Allen added that the OTC market acted admirably,
given the magnitude of the trading.
   The market surveillance section of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates and
regulates the OTC market, said it didn't receive any
complaints about firms not answering phones, according to
NASD spokesman Enno Hobbing. NASD examiners monitored market
makers by telephone early Friday, then moved to the trading
rooms of 19 firms before 2 p.m. EDT to observe trading
activity firsthand, he explained.
   The examiners have been used infrequently in the past, Mr.
Hobbing said, adding that he believes the last time they were
dispatched was after the Oct. 13, 1989, market plunge.
   Intel, the day's most active stock, fell 1 to 39 1/4 on
more than 5.4 million shares. Other active stocks included
some of the OTC market's largest capitalized namesmost of
which are in the technology and telecommunications sectors.
   MCI Communications fell 2 1/4 to 34 1/2 and Apple Computer
tumbled 3 1/4 to 40 1/4 after bucking the trend Thursday with
a 1 1/8-point gain.
   Two market leaders fared better. Sun Microsystems rose 1/4
to 30 3/4 and TeleCommunications was unchanged at 13 1/8.
   Intergraph added 1 to 15 3/4 after the Huntsville, Ala.,
maker of computer graphics systems announced late Thursday
that it plans to buy back five million common shares.
   At Software Toolworks Inc., even positive earnings
couldn't stave off a decline. The company reported operating
earnings for the first quarter ended June 30 jumped to 18
cents a share from six cents a share a year earlier. However,
its stock dropped 1 1/2 to 12 1/8 on 1.9 million shares.

   The U.S. is lucky in having two friendly, oil-producing
neighbors. Too bad neither can come close to cranking out
enough to make up for lost Mideast oil.
   With its abundant crude reserves and close ties to the
Bush administration, Mexico at first glance seems like the
ace in the hole for the U.S. during the Iraq crisis. But look
closer, oil analysts say, and doubts emerge about Mexico's
ability to step up oil production enough to help fill the
void left by Kuwait's fall to the Iraqis.

<TEXT>
   Likewise, after spending billions of dollars on subsidized
oil exploration, Canadians are no longer promoting their
country as a counterweight to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. Exploration has slumped and major oil
development projects have been shelved or canceled as a
result of the fall in oil prices and smaller-than-expected
oil finds. Canadian oil analysts see no sign of an early
turnaround even if the current Mideast crisis pushes up oil
prices.
   "Canada doesn't look as promising as in the 1970s, when we
were wining and dining people from around the world with
regard to Dome Petroleum Ltd. and the Beaufort Sea," says Ian
Doig, editor of Doig's Digest, an oil publication. Dome
Petroleum ran up huge debts in Arctic exploration before it
was acquired by a Canadian unit of Amoco Corp. in 1988.
   Venezuela may turn out to be the best hope. Analysts say
Venezuela could relatively quickly supply an extra 700,000
barrels a day -- replacing nearly half of Kuwait's daily
output of 1.6 million barrels. However, Venezuela hasn't yet
said whether it plans to increase production. And there's
still the question of filling the gap of Iraq's 2.8 million
barrels a day of output.
   To be sure, continued high prices for oil could spur U.S.
oil companies to resume full-scale drilling activity in
Texas. Even so, the dependence on imported oil isn't likely
to go away.
   Mexico has abundant natural resources. The government
estimates its reserves at 45 billion barrels of oil, with an
additional 21 billion barrels of condensate and dry gas.
Bernardo Grossling, a petroleum geologist at the U.S.
Geological Survey, says there's a good probability that
Mexico's reserves are as much as 260 billion barrels. "I
would put Mexico's potential higher than Saudi Arabia's," he
says.
   It's extracting those reserves that's a problem. Petroleos
Mexicanos S.A., the Mexican state oil monopoly, is the
world's fifth-largest oil company and supplies about 11% of
U.S. crude. About 55% of the 1.2 million barrels it exports
each day go to the U.S. But Pemex is widely considered the
most inefficient operator.
   "My best guess is that Pemex cannot increase production
too much, and wouldn't be able to sustain any increase it
does make for very long," says Benito Solis, a Mexican
economist and business consultant. Analysts say it would take
profound and politically delicate changes in Mexico's
nationalistic oil policy, hundreds of millions of dollars in
investment and lots of time for the country to achieve a
sustained increase in output.
   Since the debt crisis of 1982, Mexico's capital investment
in Pemex has shrunk by 75%, as the government has milked the
state company's coffers to meet interest payments. Mechanical
problems stemming from neglected maintenance continually
plague drilling rigs in the Bay of Campeche. The company's
mammoth Morelos Petrochemical Complex is years behind
schedule and still $1.5 billion short of being finished.
Cutbacks in exploration have been so severe that Pemex last
year drilled only about half the exploratory wells it did in
1987.
   Pinching Pemex from the other side is domestic demand that
is burgeoning by 7% a year, spurred by a growing population
and more vibrant economy. Consumption of gasoline has been so
great that the government had to import 10,000 barrels of
gasoline a day in the first five months of this year.
   Meanwhile, Mexico's proven reserves have declined 8% since
1984 and a Pemex study says Mexico mightn't have sufficient
crude to export by 1997 if it doesn't significantly increase
productivity.
   Making Pemex more efficient would require a massive
restructuring. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari laid the
groundwork for such an overhaul last year when he arrested
the powerful and corrupt head of the oil workers' union. The
government followed up by cutting some union privileges,
expanding private-sector participation in petrochemicals, and
establishing a new marketing affiliate to push Pemex into the
spot market.
   But investors say the government must find some
legislative formula for bringing private capital into
exploration and production. Pemex's poor reputation for
efficiency makes it hard for the company to find partners.
   Some say the sudden increase in oil prices will postpone
needed reforms in Pemex. For each $1-a-barrel increase in the
price of oil, Mexico's revenues jump $450 million or $500
million. "Increased oil revenues reduce the pressure for
change," says Mr. Solis. "In the short term, it's great for
the budget."
   Canada has a different set of difficulties tapping into
its large reserves, which aren't easily accessible. Industry
executives say crude prices would have to rise sharply to
warrant development of its costly far north reserves and its
big western Canadian deposits of tar sands, a tarlike mixture
of sand, clay, water and bitumen. In the meantime, Canada's
reserves are expected to continue declining. Since 1985,
production has exceeded annual additions to the reserves.
   Canada's reserves of "conventional" crude oil are
estimated at 4.2 billion barrels. Conventional crude doesn't
include resources in the frontier areas and the tar sands
reserves that are produced by high-cost mining operations.
   If a new oil supply crisis were to occur, Canada couldn't
immediately boost its production, because it doesn't have the
available capacity, said Hans Maciej, vice president of the
Canadian Petroleum Association, an industry group. Canada
exports about 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day, most of it
to the U.S. Midwest. It imports about 500,000 barrels a day
for its eastern Canadian refineries, leaving net exports of
about 200,000 barrels a day.
   Three oil fields are due to be developed off the Canadian
east coast, but their production is expected to no more than
offset the expected decline in output from western Canadian
fields. The three fields include the Hibernia oil field off
the Newfoundland coast. Hibernia was discovered 11 years ago,
but its development has been delayed by jurisdictional
disputes and financial problems. If a final agreement on
Hibernia's development is reached later this month as
expected, the field would produce about 110,000 barrels of
oil a day, starting in 1996.
   Bernard Picchi, oil analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said
the Canadian government can no longer afford its heavy
subsidies for oil exploration and development because of its
budget deficit, expected to total 28.5 billion Canadian
dollars (US$24.8 billion) this year. As a cost-saving
measure, the government recently terminated its exploration
incentives program for conventional oil drilling.
   After two decades of subsidized exploration in the
Canadian sector of the Beaufort Sea, drilling in the region
has come to a halt this year for lack of interest among oil
companies.
   The prospects also don't look bright for further
development of synthetic oil from the western Canadian heavy
oil and tar sands deposits. Synthetic crude oil production
plants are "extremely expensive refineries" and their
construction could never have been undertaken without
subsidies, says Mr. Picchi of Salomon Brothers.

   '94 Goodwill Games,
   Despite Current Loss

   SEATTLE -- Despite big losses and lower-than-anticipated
TV ratings at the Goodwill Games, Ted Turner said he is
committed to sponsoring the games in 1994 in Leningrad.
   But Mr. Turner, chairman and chief executive officer of
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., acknowledged that the
company's board might veto the idea.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Speaking on the final weekend of the self-styled Olympiad,
Mr. Turner said the 17-day event had scored a rating of about
3.2, meaning the games were watched by 3.2% of the
40-million-or-so households that could receive the
broadcasts.
   That's roughly 60% of the viewership that Atlanta-based
Turner Broadcasting had promised to advertisers. This lack of
viewers means the company will have to provide free air time
-- perhaps as much as $18 million worth, according to
executives close to the company -- to make up the difference.
   Such "make goods," as the free time is called, could push
Turner Broadcasting's loss on the Seattle games to as much as
$40 million. But Mr. Turner tried to sound upbeat in
assessing the event. "In my view, these games were more
successful" than the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, he said,
citing improved TV viewership and a fivefold increase in
advertising sales.
   Looking to 1994, Mr. Turner said he would like to support
a third Goodwill Games in Leningrad. But on the question of
whether Turner Broadcasting's board might have other
thoughts, Mr. Turner said: "It's a possibility. Anything is a
possibility."
   Indeed, the games might be able to survive the company's
departure. Nikolai Rusak of the Soviet Union's Goskomsport
athletic authority insisted the games would go on in
Leningrad in 1994, with or without Turner Broadcasting.

   LOS ANGELES -- The South Coast Air Quality Management
District approved the proposed merger between Southern
California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.,
thereby removing a major obstacle to the combination of the
two utilities.
   Southern California Edison is a unit of SCEcorp. Rosemead,
Calif. The merger was approved by SCEcorp. and San Diego Gas
&amp; Electric shareholders in April 1989. The $2.56 billion
transaction is still awaiting approvals by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the California Public Utilities
Commission. In June, the Justice Department said it wouldn't
oppose the proposed merger.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists have opposed the merger, charging that
it would worsen air pollution in the Southern California
area. The South Coast Air Quality Management District is the
air pollution control regulation agency for Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. The district,
which has the worst air quality of any metropolitan region in
the U.S., has begun a plan to clean up the air to comply with
federal clean-air standards.
   The Air Quality Management District's approval of the
merger requires Southern California Edison to more than
offset pollution increases in the South Coast Air Basin. To
accomplish this, the utility would underwrite the costs for
other polluters to switch from internal combustion engines to
electrical motors to run their equipment.
   As part of the proposed merger, Southern California Edison
would shift generation of electricity from older San Diego
power plants to more efficient Edison plants in the South
Coast Air Basin. Environmentalists and others had charged
that this shift would interfere with plans to clean up the
South Coast Air Basin's polluted air.

CONGRESS (CNG)

<LP>
   Now that the Savings and Loan crisis has reached the
political boiling point with the American people, Members of
Congress are desperately trying to shift the blame away from
themselves and onto someone else. Often the same Members who
are screaming for the Bush administration to "jail the S&amp;L
crooks" were at the center of the disastrous policies of the
past decade.
   The latest pass-the-buck exercise begins today when Ohio
Senator Howard Metzenbaum convenes a hearing on the 1988
purchase of some Texas S&amp;Ls by insurance executive James M.
Fail. Mr. Fail and Robert Thompson, a lobbyist he retained,
are accused of receiving sweetheart treatment from former
thrift regulator Danny Wall. "It's the most abominable
rip-off of the American taxpayer that I've ever experienced,"
thunders Mr. Metzenbaum. Last week, he issued subpoenas
directing Messrs. Thompson and Fail to appear today. Mr.
Thompson points out the Senator's subcommittee on antitrust
policy has zero jurisdiction over S&amp;Ls. He may contest the
subpoena in court and not appear.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There are legitimate questions raised by the Fail deal,
but we suspect they aren't the ones Senator Metzenbaum wants
answered. There are, however, real questions about the
apparently endless spectacle of sanctimonious Members of this
Congress handing down judgments of other people's behavior
while expecting no criticism of their own.
   In probing Mr. Fail, for instance, Senator Metzenbaum can
bring to bear his own knowledge of how to make big money
without investing anything. In 1983, he collected a $250,000
"finder's fee" for making two phone calls to find a buyer for
a Washington hotel. The seller was a contributor to the
Senator's campaigns. After he was accused of using his office
to reap a windfall profit, he returned the money. At the
time, he expressed outrage at calls he be investigated by the
Ethics Committee.
   Moreover, Charles Keating, of Keating Five fame, told a
meeting of Journal editors recently that Mr. Metzenbaum came
to his Arizona office to ask for a political contribution.
"He had been told by Senator Cranston that I was a soft touch
for money," Mr. Keating recalls. Senator Alan Cranston, one
of the Keating Five now under investigation by the Senate
Ethics Committee, was given nearly $1 million by Mr. Keating
for voter-registration programs. Mr. Metzenbaum was
interested in setting up similar programs in Ohio before his
1988 re-election race. Employees of Senator Cranston's groups
have since revealed that they were routinely pressured to
register only Democrats.
   Mr. Keating said, "I told Metzenbaum we had nothing in
common, but he kept calling me asking for money." Mr. Keating
finally told Mr. Metzenbaum he should ask for money from
Senator Cranston's registration programs, and their talks
ended. Mr. Metzenbaum's press secretary says the Senator has
"no recollection" of meeting Mr. Keating, though she said
"it's possible."
   The tactics employed by Senator Metzenbaum's committee
gumshoes also deserve attention. The Washington Post reports
that CNN reporter Brooks Jackson was told by Senator
Metzenbaum's staff that they had made an exclusive deal to
share confidential investigative data with the New York Times
in exchange for an agreement that the story would be held
until the day before a hearing. Brian McTigue, the Metzenbaum
staffer who gave the data to the Times, was fired last year
from Rep. John Dingell's Energy and Commerce Committee for
illegally taping a conversation with a witness.
   We'll take Senator Metzenbaum's camera-mugging hearings
more seriously when he matches his zealous pursuit of S&amp;L
"rip-offs" with his own hard-hitting probe into Congress's
financial relationships with Charles Keating and other
benefactors of Capitol Hill.

   WISBOROUGH GREEN, England -- It's a balmy Saturday, the
grass needs cutting, and -- like suburbanites everywhere --
Dan Steward is having trouble starting his lawn mower. Again
and again, he yanks on the rope. Finally, the riding
machine's engine sputters to life. Mr. Steward leaps aboard,
adjusts his crash helmet, checks his headlights and roars
off, waving to the cheering crowd.
   Crash helmet? Headlights? Cheering crowd?

<TEXT>
   Welcome to the annual 12-Hour Endurance Classic of the
British Lawn Mower Racing Association.
   If hell has a suburb, it looks like this. Thick billows of
smoke and dust roll across a 20-acre pasture as nearly 60
lawn mowers, souped-up and de-mufflered, scream around at
speeds approaching 50 miles an hour. Drivers take corners on
two wheels, sometimes leaving the ground altogether as they
bounce over ruts and potholes.
   The din is brain-rattling, more like chain saws than lawn
mowers, with backfires that sound like cannon. From 9 p.m.
Saturday to 9 a.m. Sunday, the mowers race through gloom and
early morning mist, with only brief pit stops for fuel and
repairs. Most diabolical of all, not a blade of grass gets
cut: The mower blades have been removed for safety reasons.
   Recognized by Britain's Royal Automobile Club as the
governing body for lawnmower racing, the BLMRA has been
staging such events for some 18 years. Nearly every summer
weekend finds the 200-member group zooming around some
farmer's field in England or Wales. Ordinarily the weekend
meets consist of 10-minute speed sprints along a "track"
marked with bales of straw. High point of the season is the
grueling 12-hour event, raced relay-style by teams of three
drivers.
   This, a BBC commentator observed during the one and only
telecast of a race, "is a classic British sport: played by
fanatics, under absurd rules, generally in the rain."
   If not absurd, the rules are certainly elaborate. Three
pages of fine-print dictate everything from the height of
front-mounted grass catchers to the shape of the seat. Most
importantly, the mowers must have been manufactured and sold
to mow home lawns (". . . not golf courses, public parks or
the rolling prairies of the American Midwest," the
regulations caution) and the engines must be identical to
those originally sold with the machine. Among the few
modifications allowed are changes in the driving gears or
pulleys to send more power to the wheels. In addition to
wearing crash helmets, contestants must attach ignition
cut-off switches to their bodies so that if they are thrown
off, the mower stops.
   Lawn-mower races have the festive air of a county fair.
Tents and caravans line the track, families lounge in beach
chairs and tend barbecues while children and dogs run about.
At the 12-hour race, elaborate, flood-lighted pits line the
track, each with stocks of spare parts and even arc-welders
for repairs. That race draws hundreds of paying spectators.
The proceeds go to charity, and commercial sponsorship of
individual mowers is prohibited.
   Off the track, mower racers are a friendly, easy-going
bunch, as befits an organization that had its start in a West
Sussex pub. Jim Gavin, general secretary of the BLMRA,
recalls that over numerous beers in 1972, he and several
other motorsports fans were trying to come up with something
different to race.
   "All we could think of was combine harvesters, but there
were only three or four in the county," says Mr. Gavin, 52, a
travel consultant. "Then we realized that, after all, this is
England -- everybody has a lawn and something to cut it
with." Thus was born "the noble sport," as adherents call it.
And it soon acquired a proper Latin motto: "Per Herbam ad
Astra" -- "Through the Grass to the Stars."
   The motivation? "It's the cheap man's motor sport, an easy
way to get into something very competitive," says Howard
Annett, a 40-year-old engineering-firm executive, as he
tinkers with his Atco mower. "I'd always been interested in
motor racing but never had the money or the courage to do
it." Though most of the racers are male, at least four women
drive their own mowers and others take part in teams.
   The lure of the lawn occasionally draws big names, like
former Formula One champion Stirling Moss and sports-car
racer Derek Bell, five-time winner of the Le Mans 24-hour
endurance race. Teammates Moss and Bell have won the BLMRA's
12-hour race twice.
   "It's a great feeling on a fast lawn with the wind at your
backs," Mr. Moss says, fondly recalling his team's first win
a few years ago. Mr. Bell has some painful memories.
"Absolute agony is what it is, bouncing around some great
bumpy field in clouds of dust]" he says. "It's like being
beaten about by a prizefighter for 12 hours."
   It is indeed rough going. Many of the racers wear
eight-inch-wide body-builder's belts to keep their innards in
place. Minor injuries abound. This year's 12-hour racers
suffered several sprained ankles, a dislocated shoulder and
numerous bruises and burns. Even the scorer, with a laptop
computer, was injured. He had dashed onto the track to pull a
driver from under an overturned mower and had grabbed a hot
exhaust pipe. He was rushed to a hospital with burns on both
hands.
   Mower racing shows signs of spreading to the Continent.
Last fall, at the invitation of the mayor of Limoges, France,
30 BLMRA drivers hauled their machines across the Channel to
race a newly formed group of French mower enthusiasts. What
they encountered was a shock, a classic confrontation of the
precise English with the free-form French.
   Among the machines trotted out by the French: a racer
powered by a motorcycle engine, another invention constructed
from parts of a Land Rover, and a "mower" built from the
bodies of two Citroen 2CVs with a grass catcher bolted to the
front. One other French machine had a beach umbrella welded
to the back, along with a vase filled with flowers.
   "Our first reaction was, `Hold on, chaps, these things
aren't built to our rules and regulations,'" recalls English
racer Mr. Annett. More worrisome, the English thought the
monster French machines might topple over on them during the
race. "We were terrified they would flatten us," says the
BLMRA's Mr. Gavin.
   Anglo-French diplomacy produced a compromise: The larger
French machines would race separately in a newly created
class called "super prototypes." The "entente cordial"
resumed, and a good time was had by all.
   "The French are all daft as brushes," says Pete Hammerton,
another English racer. "But they were great to us, and the
food was terrific." The second annual international race is
set for Limoges, Sept. 29-30.
   In the most recent 12-hour race here, the first-place team
racked up 277 miles, more or less without mishap. The Ant
Hill Mob team, headed by Dan Steward, the racer who had
trouble starting his engine, finished fifth in its class. At
the end, however, the engine died again -- after 213 miles --
and the mower had to be pushed across the line.
   The big news of the day was a new world's record set by
the Flying Doctors team of Group 1. This special class, which
races only once a year in a track adjacent to the riding
mowers', is for self-propelled "walk-behind" machines, though
"run-behind" would be more apt. A British sportswriter
described a Group 1 racer as "a demon nanny being towed by a
runaway, supercharged pram."
   The 15 members of the Flying Doctors team, aged 12 to 45,
managed 105.1 miles during 12 hours, including pit stops for
rewelding of chassis and handlebars. This supplant's the
team's previous record, listed in the Guinness Book of
Records, of 101.1 miles, set in 1984.

   July Unemployment Figure
   Hit a Two-Year High;

   WASHINGTON -- The sharp rise in the unemployment rate and
the slump in hiring in July confirm that the U.S. economy is
slowing substantially.
   The civilian jobless rate, which has barely moved one way
or the other for nearly two years, jumped 0.3 percentage
point to 5.5% in July, the highest rate in two years, the
Labor Department said. It hadn't risen that much in one month
since February 1986.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Payrolls, dragged down by the dismissal of 160,000
temporary census workers, fell 219,000 in July. The number of
jobs in private industry dropped 45,000 as construction
employment declined sharply, factory payrolls continued to
shrink and the growth in private service industries came to
an abrupt halt.
   In the past six months, private industry has added workers
at a rate of only 66,000 a month, the slowest rate since the
recession of the early 1980s. "The services industry has been
the major engine of job growth during the current economic
expansion," said Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor
statistics. "But that engine seems to have sputtered in
July."
   Although the U.S. economy has been exhibiting signs of
sluggishness for months, the latest employment figures were
bleaker than most economists and investors had anticipated.
"The economy is deteriorating faster than expected," said
economist Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp.
   The new data dispel any lingering hope that the U.S.
economy is bouncing back from the lethargic growth of the
first few months of the year -- and indicates it is now
growing even more slowly than the Federal Reserve had
intended when it braked the economy in an effort to restrain
inflation.
   The Fed, which last month pushed interest rates down a bit
for the first time in more than six months, is now likely to
ease more aggressively to try to head off a recession -- or
curtail one, if it has already begun.
   A disproportionate share of the increase in unemployment
in July was among teen-agers, the Labor Department said. The
jobless rate among teen-agers rose 2.2 percentage points to
16.3%, about a percentage point higher than it has averaged
in the past two years.
   "While we cannot say for certain why teen-agers had more
difficulty in the labor market this summer," Mrs. Norwood
said, "we do know that job growth in the retail trade and
services industries, which employ many teen-agers, has slowed
considerably."
   The Labor Department figures highlighted the divergent
economic conditions among regions of the country. In
Massachusetts, the most populous state in recessionary New
England, the jobless rate hit 6.1% in July, up from 4.3% a
year earlier. In New York, it rose to 5.3%, up from 4.8% a
year earlier. But in California, the unemployment rate was
5.1%, up only slightly from June and down from 5.2% in July
1989.
   The jobless rate rose in July even though the labor force
-- all those working or looking for work -- shrank a bit. The
surprisingly slow growth of the labor force in the past
several months has helped keep the unemployment rate steady
at the lowest levels in 15 years as the economy's growth rate
slowed.
   In the past 12 months, the labor force has grown by only
660,000, the Labor Department said. In the past five years,
the labor force has grown by an average of two million from
one July to the next. Although the shrinking number of young
people entering the labor force is a major factor, economists
say it doesn't fully explain the slow labor force growth.
   A measure of the national employment rate that includes
the armed forces rose to 5.4% in July from 5.1% in June.
   The Labor Department's survey of employers, closely
watched by economists as among the most reliable guides to
the economy, showed hardly any bright spots.
   Construction employment dropped 50,000 in July and has
declined more than 100,000 since last fall. Manufacturing
employment was down another 7,000, a smaller drop than in
recent months. Factories employed 325,000 fewer workers in
July than at the recent peak in March 1989. The
health-services industry, which has added an average of
50,000 jobs a month in the first half of the year, added only
half that many in July.
   All the figures are adjusted for usual seasonal
fluctuations.

   Autos:
   Rivalry Accelerates for Sports Trucks,
   Dubbed the `Family Sedans' of the '90s

   DETROIT -- The Jeep Cherokee is king of the hill. At least
that's what Chrysler Corp. says in its TV commercials that
show Cherokee standing alone at the top.
   Cherokee sales soared 43% between 1987 and 1989, when
"sport-utility" vehicles were becoming suburban
yuppie-mobiles. As virtually the only such vehicle with four
doors, Cherokee was uniquely suited to family use -- and had
one of the market's hottest niches almost to itself.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But that was then. Now Cherokee is being challenged by a
host of four-door upstarts. Its sales (along with those of
its more upscale sister model, Wagoneer Limited) plunged 31%
in the second quarter to 30,247 vehicles. And its share of
the sport-utility market nosedived to 14% in the quarter from
21% a year earlier.
   "The four-door sport-utility vehicle is the family sedan
of the '90s," says Christopher Cedergren, director of
competitive assessments at J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a market
research firm. "And the market is getting pretty crowded."
   Leading the competition is Ford Motor Co.'s new Explorer,
which hit the market with a bang in March. In April, General
Motors Corp. launched four-door versions of its Chevrolet
S-10 Blazer and the GMC S-15 Jimmy; it will introduce the
upscale Oldsmobile Bravada this fall. Also, Nissan Motor
Co.'s four-door Pathfinder and Toyota Motor Corp.'s 4Runner
got off to brisk starts.
   And more rivals are coming. Later this year, Isuzu Motors
Ltd. and Suzuki Motor Co., will introduce four-door compact
models with base prices under $15,000, well below most of the
competition.
   All this activity could push sales of sport-utility
vehicles in the U.S. above one million a year by the
mid-1990s, some analysts expect, up from 844,449 last year.
Many buyers will never test their vehicles' off-road
capabilities, but they will revel in the "outdoorsy" image
that anything resembling a Jeep confers on its driver.
   As for Chrysler, the wave of competing products "just
means they have to fight a little harder," says Mr. Cedergren
of Agoura Hills, Calif.-based J.D. Power.
   "There are new entries in the market, and consumers are
looking at more than just the Jeep," acknowledges Lawrence W.
Baker, general manager of Chrysler's Jeep-Eagle division. He
expects a 10% drop in Cherokee sales in 1990, the largest
decline in six years; Chrysler sold 156,118 Cherokees in
1989. Jeep is preparing a counterattack. This fall it will
introduce the upscale Cherokee Briarwood, to replace the
Wagoneer Limited, and a four-door Cherokee Sport, an
"entry-level" version that's now available with only two
doors. Also this fall, Cherokee's standard four-liter,
six-cylinder engine will be boosted to 190 horsepower from
177, allowing Chrysler to tout the vehicle as the most
powerful in its class.
   "We created this segment and we have done very well," says
Mr. Baker. "We aren't standing still on this."
   But Jeep has some heavy hauling ahead, partly of its own
making. When Jeep had the four-door market mostly to itself
(the aging Isuzu Trooper and Mitsubishi Montero were only
token competition), it raised prices aggressively. Cherokee's
starting base price at entry level surged 24% between 1988
and 1990, to $14,595. But that's a bare-bones vehicle; it's
difficult to buy a Cherokee for much less than $20,000, and
it can cost as much as $27,000 to get the equipment most
buyers want.
   Many buyers, being well-heeled sorts, don't mind much.
"Price is as unimportant an issue for people buying
sport-utility vehicles as it is for people who buy luxury
sedans," says John Schnapp, who studied the issue for Temple,
Barker &amp; Sloane Inc. in Lexington, Mass., where he heads
automotive consulting. "They don't seem to be as price
sensitive."
   Nonetheless, Cherokee's price increases spelled
opportunity for competitors. Ford's top-of-the-line Explorer,
the Eddie Bauer 4X4 version, carries a base price of $21,433,
$4,792 lower than the comparable Cherokee Limited's base
price of $26,225. What's more, the Explorer is the longest
vehicle in the four-door market.
   The result: "The Explorer has exceeded even our
expectations," says Richard D. Anderson, marketing plans
manager for Ford trucks. "It's the hottest vehicle in the
truck market." In its first three months on the market,
Explorer outsold the vehicle it replaced, the two-door Bronco
II, by nearly 78%. In the second quarter, combined sales of
the Explorer and the discontinued Bronco II were about 46,000
-- 52% more than Cherokee -- up from nearly 26,000 a year
earlier.
   GM's Blazer and Jimmy haven't matched Explorer's success.
They have drawn unfavorable reviews from automotive
publications, and GM recently slapped rebates -- first $750
and now $1,000 -- on the models in an effort to jump-start
sales. But sales of the Nissan Pathfinder and Toyota 4Runner
both more than doubled in the second quarter compared with a
year earlier, thanks to the addition of four-door versions.
Toyota and Nissan, in contrast to Ford and GM, kept their
four-door vehicles the same length as their two-door models.
The companies say they figured their two-door models were
already long enough.
   A quirk in U.S.-Japan trade regulations makes the
four-door market especially attractive to Toyota, Nissan and
other Japanese auto makers. Two-door sport-utility vehicles
are considered trucks, and thus carry a 25% tariff. Four-door
models, however, are classified as cars and thus pay a far
smaller tariff -- so they're actually priced less than the
two-door versions.
   Isuzu's entrance into the competitive fray will be with
its Rodeo, making its debut in August with a starting base
price of around $13,000, the company says. It won't even be
offered in a two-door. In 1992, Isuzu is expected to go
upscale with its existing four-door Trooper model to compete
with the super-luxury Range Rover from England, which has a
starting base price of $39,025. Jack Reilly, chairman of
American Isuzu Motors Inc., says the new Trooper will offer
the same things as the Range Rover but at a lower price of
"conceivably $25,000 to $30,000."
   In the fall, Suzuki will launch a four-door Sidekick, base
priced at $13,599. Standard features on the Sidekick,
currently sold as a two-door, will include power steering,
AM-FM stereo radio and cassette and rear anti-lock brakes.
   The Rodeo and Sidekick may greatly expand overall
sport-utility sales. The reason: While people who now buy
such vehicles are willing to pay a hefty price, says Mr.
Schnapp, those who shop but don't buy give price as the
biggest reason. "There is a price barrier that is keeping a
lot of people out of the market," he says.

   Diasonics Inc. said it settled a dispute with a Toshiba
Corp. unit over the final sale price to Toshiba of Diasonic's
ultrasound business.
   Under the agreement, the Toshiba unit will pay Diasonics
an additional $13.5 million, Diasonics said in Milipitas,
Calif.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Diasonics completed the sale of its MRI division to
Toshiba America Medical Systems Inc. last November for $167.5
million plus the assumption of certain debt. But in February
Diasonics asked Toshiba for an additional $23 million to
reflect certain equity changes in the division prior to the
sale's closing date. The Toshiba unit balked, instead
demanding a $19 million refund from Diasonics.
   The accord resolves the disputes outstanding with Toshiba,
a Diasonics official said. Diasonics' stock closed at
$3.3125, down 18.75 cents, on the American Stock Exchange.
The company disclosed the accord after the close of trading
yesterday.
