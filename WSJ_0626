   It's tough being an expectant yuppie.
   You've already chosen the kid's nanny, and all her schools
from nursery to prep. And no 20th-century ills such as toy
guns and movie violence will intrude on your progeny's peace
of mind.

   But wait: What about the single most traumatic event of
childhood, one known to cause months of sleepless nights,
crankiness, crying jags, and gastrointestinal problems? Must
even the yuppiest of babies endure -- shudder -- birth?
   Not anymore. A California doctor says he has invented a
computer-controlled bassinet that simulates the environment
of the womb, allowing parents to transform their child's
birth from a "sudden and traumatic" event to a much gentler
16-week transition period.
   "I've been playing with this concept for about 10 years
now," says James Gatts, an aerospace medicine specialist.
"For a long time, I had an awful time getting people
interested in it." (Small wonder: His prototype was made with
skateboard wheels, screen door hinges and a car radio.)
   In Dr. Gatts's device, to be marketed as "Nature's Cradle"
this August, newborns are strapped between two bolsters,
intended to recreate the pressure of the uterine walls, and
rocked in a motion that mimics the movement of the womb while
the mother is walking. A recording of a heartbeat is piped
in.
   Over a 16-week period, the heartbeat and rocking motion
gradually diminish to zero, the bolsters are loosened, and
the child has adjusted to the outside world. Dr. Gatts says
the end result is a trauma-free baby that cries less, sleeps
better, and is never colicky.
   "It's a fascinating idea," says Dr. Terri Ederscheim of
Cornell Medical Center in New York. "It could be useful. But
we aren't going to fool a baby into thinking it's "in utero".
It sounds like this thing basically mechanizes swaddling and
rocking, which parents have known about for centuries."
   The cradle, which comes with a 12-page operator's manual,
will go for about $1,200. Dr. Gatts hopes to bring the price
down to about $400.
   Future versions, he adds, will offer options like an
"infant-operated system." How could a one-week-old baby turn
anything on and off? "Well, a number of ways -- sucking on a
switch, for example."
   OK. But won't he still have trouble with the manual?

   FDA Grants Du Pont
   Approval to Sell Drug
   To Treat Arrhythmia

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said it got approval from
the Food and Drug Administration to sell Ethmozine, a drug to
treat life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms.
   The diversified chemicals company has been developing
Ethmozine since the mid-1970s, when it licensed the drug from
a medical licensing agency of the Soviet Union. Du Pont
expects the drug to be commercially available in the U.S. in
September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ethmozine, generically called moricizine, was approved for
use in patients with ventricular arrhythmias, a condition in
which the abnormal rhythm occurs in the main pumping sections
of the heart. An estimated 300,000 deaths in the U.S. are
caused by such arrhythmias every year.
   John O'Rourke, the product manager, said that although
Ethmozine has been shown to reduce the incidence of these
arrhythmias, studies are still being done to determine
whether that reduction is directly related to longer
survival. Other factors, such as the pumping capacity of the
heart, make it difficult to trace this cause-and-effect
relationship, he said.
   Some doctors who have worked with Ethmozine say it appears
safer than some other anti-arrhythmia drugs, which themselves
can induce heart problems in certain patients. Last year, for
example, U.S. health officials cautioned doctors against
using two other drugs for mild arrhythmias after more
patients taking them in a government-sponsored study died of
heart attacks than did patients taking a placebo. The
officials said the drugs -- Enkaid, made by Bristol-Myers
Co., and Tambocor, made by the Riker Laboratories Inc. unit
of Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. -- should be reserved
for patients suffering from life-threatening arrhythmias.
   Mr. O'Rourke estimated U.S. sales of drugs in Ethmozine's
category at $280 million a year.

   Heard on the Street:
   Tonka Can Only Rebound, Bargain Hunters
   Say, but Some Investors Insist the Fun Is Over

   NEW YORK -- Tonka stock looks as though it has been run
over by a truck -- and not a toy truck.
   The toy maker's shares sell for less than one-third of
their 1989 high, which was 22 7/8. Yesterday, the stock
declined 1/4 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading to
close at 6 1/4, a new six-year low.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tonka has said that it might have a loss this year -- it
would be the company's third deficit in five years -- and
that it may be in default of a cash-flow provision in its
loan agreement with banks. It labors under a $482 million
debt load (68% of capital), and it hasn't come up with a hot
item to replace the fading Ghostbusters line and the
successful Pound Puppies of a few years ago.
   Amid these troubles, most pension funds and mutual funds
won't touch Tonka's stock. But given the sudden shifts of
fortune that often happen in the toy industry, a few risk
takers believe this is a time to hunt for a bargain. They
can't imagine that the maker of Nerf balls and Monopoly games
will go under, and they figure that if it doesn't, the stock
can't go too much lower.
   "We are long-term investors," says John F. Nelson, a money
manager with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which
bought 400,000 Tonka shares on the recent weakness, adding to
its million-share holding. "Obviously, the toy business is
cyclical, but Tonka is well positioned," he says. "They have
a stable base in the games area," with Parker Brothers, which
makes old favorites such as Monopoly and Clue.
   Mr. Nelson also likes Tonka's international presence,
particularly in Spain and other parts of Europe. There, he
says, is "where the surprise growth" is likely to come from.
   The Minnetonka, Minn., toy maker is paying now for a
gamble it took in 1987, when it acquired its larger rival,
Kenner Parker Toys Inc., for about $600 million. That saddled
Tonka with a big debt, which it has been gradually reducing,
and raised its stake in the volatile field of "promotional"
toys that often tie in with movies or television series.
   Paul Valentine, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's, says
the financial markets are valuing Tonka at about $530 million
-- the market value of all its stock, plus the face value of
its debt. This is less than Tonka paid to buy Kenner Parker
three years ago, he notes.
   Mr. Valentine calls Tonka a "strong buy." He points out
that the company is being valued at only 60% of sales,
whereas 100% of sales is typical in toy-industry takeovers.
   Other money managers say that buying Tonka stock now is
like trying to catch a falling knife. "They're in a fight for
survival," Michael A. Connor, senior vice president at the
Connor Ballan unit of Fahnestock &amp; Co., says. "Equity is a
minus figure if you eliminate good will," he says. "I don't
see {a bankruptcy-law filing} as a certainty, but there is a
possibility."
   "I severely question the viability of the company,"
Stanley K. Jasek, a Grand Haven, Mich., toy consultant and
product developer, says. "I think Tonka will be in Chapter 11
by Christmas," a reference to the section of the federal
Bankruptcy Code that protects a company from creditors.
   In response to these comments, a Tonka spokeswoman refers
to a previous statement by the chief executive officer,
Stephen G. Shank, that a default on the bank-loan covenant
"would not signal an interest or principal payment default,"
but merely failure to maintain cash flow equal to 1.8 times
interest expense.
   Hans Sohlen, Tonka assistant treasurer, says, "We have
sufficient liquidity and capital resources available to
comfortably take us through 1990." Several Wall Street
analysts say a bankruptcy-law filing is unlikely, though some
fear Tonka may have to sell Parker Brothers.
   Technical analysts, who generally believe a declining
stock must level off and form a base before it can begin to
rise again, aren't keen on Tonka. "There's no sign of a base;
I hate it," says Stan Weinstein, editor of the Professional
Tape Reader.
   "They need a hit," Carol Palmer, an analyst with Duff &amp;
Phelps, says. "They have some warm toys now, but they need
something that will be hot." One hope is Tonka's new line of
Batman toys. But the next Batman movie isn't expected until
next year at the earliest. A lot depends on how long video
games and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle toys continue to hog
the limelight among boys aged 7 to 12, Tonka's main market.
   "For a near-term investor, {Tonka} is probably dead
money," Robin Young, an analyst with John G. Kinnard &amp; Co. in
Minneapolis, says. But "Long-term, there's a heck of a lot of
value there."

   Private-School Vouchers -- Look Again
</HL>
<DATE>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A19
</SO>
<LP>
   On June 14, you published an editorial on the Milwaukee
Parental Choice Program, entitled "The Polly Williams
Backlash," about an "experimental plan to let 1,000
low-income Milwaukee children use vouchers to attend a
private school of their choice." In that editorial you
responded to my June 7 letter. I would like your readers to
know what my letter said.
   I commented on the failure in your June 6 editorial to
state the constitutional challenge properly. The challenge
made is that the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program violates
the Wisconsin Constitution because there are no standards
imposed upon the private schools. For example, a private,
nonsectarian school must meet only one of four criteria. One
of these is that at least 70% of the families of pupils in
the program meet parental-involvement criteria established by
the private school itself. In other words, the private
schools determine their own eligibility to receive public
funds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Your June 14 editorial corrected the record with respect
to the constitutional claims. However, you then wrote that
you called John E. Chubb for a response to the accountability
issue. According to the news report in your editorial, Mr.
Chubb laughed at this position, stating that the private
schools issue diplomas that are recognized by state
universities. The only thing laughable is Mr. Chubb's
uninformed response. None of the private schools in Milwaukee
that have requested to participate in the program provide
high-school diplomas. Most of the schools end their curricula
at eighth grade. Some end their program at first grade.
Obviously, elementary- and middle-school education have
virtually nothing to do with college-admission requirements.
   A principal assertion I made in my letter concerning your
position being at odds with the Chubb article was the fact
that Mr. Chubb suggests there are graduation requirements and
teacher-certification requirements. These requirements do not
appear in the Milwaukee Choice Program. In addition, I
pointed out that the Chubb article discusses at length the
methods to meet the needs of disabled children, children at
risk and children with learning disabilities. The Milwaukee
Choice Program did not make any provisions for such students.
   Your June 14 editorial accepts uncritically the claims
made by the Harambee Community School and the Urban Day
School that a high percentage of their students graduate from
high school and go on to college. Both these schools end
instruction at eighth grade.
   The most recent public data concerning Harambee show it
had 168 full-time students. Only nine were in the eighth
grade; 56 students were either in pre-kindergarten or
kindergarten; 40 students were in first and second grade; 30
in third and fourth grade; 24 in fifth and sixth grade; and
nine in seventh grade. It is inconceivable that anyone has
any reliable statistics to demonstrate that 98% of the 168
students go on to college. There is a substantial drop-off in
enrollment between pre-kindergarten/kindergarten and eighth
grade. If the claim of success is being made only with
respect to nine eighth-grade students, the statistic is
meaningless.
   The same phenomena can be seen with the Urban Day School.
Out of the 373 students reportedly enrolled in fall 1989,
only 18 were in the eighth grade; 202 were in
pre-kindergarten and kindergarten; 62 were in first and
second grade; 43 were in third and fourth grade; 29 were in
fifth and sixth grade; and 19 were in seventh grade. Again,
there is a significant drop-off in enrollment.
   The Milwaukee Parental Choice Program should be evaluated
as it is written. The private schools should be evaluated "as
is." By embracing the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, you
are endorsing the uncontrolled and unregulated giveaway of
public money and also endorsing discriminatory education
opportunities of handicapped children, children with learning
disabilities and children at risk.

   Public Benches Depart
   From Traditional Design

   NEW SEATS are showing up in public places -- handsome,
strong and often vagrant proof.
   Rodney Kinsman, a London designer, has produced a
futuristic bench that resembles an airplane wing. Seat and
back panels of aluminum, steel or upholstered plywood form a
skin over exposed aluminum brackets, which are mounted on a
steel beam.
   Mr. Kinsman's "Trax" seating is in British and European
train stations and is under consideration for airports.
Gullans International of Bridgeport, Conn., plans to import
it.
   Intentionally not comfortable, another entry, the
"flip/seat" is more of a perch where people can rest briefly.
It has a rectangular plastic seat that automatically flips
down, out of the way, when not in use. Jack Carter, a New
York City Transit Authority maintenance official, says this
keeps rain and snow from accumulating on the seats. And the
wobbliness makes nap-taking impossible.
   The "flip/seat" was designed by David Goodwin of Britain
and is manufactured by Fixtures Furniture of Kansas City, Mo.
   More graceful is the "Plexus" seating of LFI/Landscape
Forms of Kalamazoo, Mich. Inspired by a German product, LFI
got Nicola Balderi, an American, to design a contoured seat
that's made of metal grid.
   More cities are requesting arms between seats to prevent
vagrants from sleeping. But William H. Whyte of New York, who
writes on cities, says that "for fear of winos, they're
making these public places unpleasant to ordinary people."
                                                                                                       

   Videos in 3-D Build The
   Clients' Confidence
                                                                                                       

   CARTOONS HELP architects and builders save time and money,
and make sales.
   As computer hardware costs come down and software quality
goes up, 3-D animated videos are allowing home buyers and
business people to "walk through," "drive by" or "fly over"
their new home or office, before a single shovel of dirt is
turned.
   "Clients hate surprises," says Michael Mason, president of
Larsen &amp; Ludwig, Pittsburgh architects. "Video animation
means fewer surprises." Mr. Mason's firm uses software made
by Cubicomp Corp. of Hayward, Calif., which can provide 16
million colors and details like the reflection of clouds in
windows.
   Jendoco Construction Co. says a Larsen &amp; Ludwig video
helped it win the contract to build a new computer center for
Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania.
   Instead of buying their own systems, some architects
employ consultants such as New York's Corrigan LoVerde Group,
which uses software by Wavefront Technologies of Santa
Barbara, Calif.
   Byrne Murphy, vice president of Kaempfer Co., a real
estate developer, says a 60-second Corrigan LoVerde film has
been "extremely useful" in lining up tenants for the
redeveloped Warner Building in Washington. "Unlike a model,
you can ship the video all over the place," he says.

   TOY or professional musical instrument? Makers of
electronic saxophones, clarinets and flutes grope for a
market.
   Electronic winds look and feel like regular acoustic
instruments. But connected to computers, the air blown in can
generate a built-in accompaniment, or a whole orchestra.
   Yamaha has just introduced a wind instrument for the
student and semi-pro markets. Jazz flutist Jim Walker says
that a high school musician could pick up the "WindJamm'r,"
which resembles a clarinet, and "in an afternoon start making
some fun music." Listed at $650, the instrument is a
scaled-down version of Yamaha's WX11, in turn scaled down
from the discontinued WX7, which won design prizes but sold
poorly.
   Meanwhile, disappointed by poor sales, Akai is redesigning
its electronic wind instrument to make it look and act more
like a real woodwind. The new model will list for about
$1,400. And at the lower end, Casio is having trouble selling
its saxophone -- like "digital horn," even for the discounted
price of $69.
   Experts suggest a number of reasons for this poor showing.
There are relatively few wind players and their market, at
least for now, may have become saturated. Unlike piano
players, wind players don't have to lug around heavy
instruments and thus have less incentive to go electronic.
   Finally, says Richard Ash of Sam Ash Music in New York, a
large retailer of musical instruments, "wind players are much
more conservative."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   SOME 47% of large consumer goods companies say they have
changed some of their packaging to be more environmentally
friendly, says a Gallup poll commissioned by Teague
Associates. . . . U.S. and Soviet designers simultaneously
published a 16-page newsletter -- one in English, one in
Russian -- in New York and Moscow. They used the satellite
communications system and printshops of AlphaGraphics.

   LONDON -- One of the advertising industry's best-known
spats, between Chairman David Ogilvy and Chief Executive
Martin Sorrell of Britain's WPP Group PLC, was publicly
patched up.
   At a meeting of WPP shareholders here -- the first such
session at which the two warring executives have shared the
podium -- all was amity. The two men, who had clashed last
year when Mr. Sorrell's WPP took over New York-based Ogilvy
Group, sat side by side in a hotel reception room, warmly
greeting WPP shareholders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When asked, Mr. Ogilvy said of his colleague: "I am very
fond of him -- but I don't want him to know." For his part,
Mr. Sorrell said their relations have "never been better."
   The conflict, triggered by WPP's unwelcome bid for Ogilvy,
was noteworthy in the ad industry for its public namecalling.
The 79-year-old Mr. Ogilvy was quoted as calling Mr. Sorrell
an "odious little jerk." A truce was struck in May 1989 when
Ogilvy accepted a sweetened WPP offer of at least $793.8
million, and Mr. Ogilvy was named WPP chairman.
   At the meeting, Mr. Ogilvy told shareholders that the
company's profits so far in 1990 "are in line with
expectations both inside and outside the company." In London,
financial analysts forecast WPP pretax profit of between #110
million ($190.4 million) and #115 million, up 46% to 53% from
#75 million in 1989.

   U.S. Looks Into Global Radio Network Using Satellites

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is quietly pursuing a plan to
create a global radio network that would be run jointly by
the government and private industry.
   The network would use a $1 billion satellite system that
would begin broadcasts of music, information and advertising
around the year 2000. It would require a new generation of
radios that can receive satellite broadcasts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposal generally envisions private ownership of
satellites and radio stations in the U.S. market and
government ownership of satellites in foreign markets,
according to people who heard a briefing on the plan.
   The proposal is backed principally by the Commerce
Department, the U.S. Information Agency and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. But already the plan is
running into opposition from U.S. broadcasters, who fear that
the proposed system would gobble up scarce broadcast
frequencies and increase competition among radio stations. It
also may kick up a storm within the Bush administration,
where senior officials have fiercely opposed government
direction of new commercial technologies.
   Even so, the system has two big advantages. It would offer
broadcasters and advertisers a way to reach a national and
international market. And it would offer listeners
crystalline sound quality by using digital technology to
transmit signals.
   The Commerce Department's Office of Space Commerce has
invited a group of government and industry officials to a
breakfast today for their second, closed-door discussion of
satellite radio. Two satellite entrepreneurs -- Martin
Rothblatt, president of a consulting group here called Marcor
Inc., and Gary Noreen, president of Radio Satellite Corp.,
Pasadena, Calif.are scheduled to address the group.
   "Let's get started first in the U.S.," says Mr. Noreen,
who proposes a system that would broadcast 10 stations
nationally in 1993. "Then we can turn our system into a
world-wide system." A report of the federal effort first
appeared in Space Business News, an Arlington, Va.,
newsletter.
   At the first Commerce Department meeting, on April 17, H.
Don Messer, USIA's satellite broadcast program manager,
sketched his agency's plans for the system. According to a
memo passed around at the meeting, the system would include
as many as 100 radio stations that could broadcast anywhere
in the world with a sound quality comparable to compact
disks. Mr. Messer's memo called the plan "a fundamentally
different, new radio broadcasting service from satellites."
   For global reach, the USIA envisions four satellites in
orbit, at a total cost of $700 million. A one-satellite
system, costing $200 million, could cover the Americas,
Europe and Africa, the memo said. The USIA is pushing the
plan to increase its reach geographically, to cut its costs
by sharing the satellite system with commercial broadcasters
and to improve its quality, said participants in the Commerce
Department meetings. The Voice of America, for instance,
broadcasts on scratchy, shortwave frequencies and wants to
augment its service with a better-resolution system.
   The agency has enlisted NASA in support of its proposal.
The two agencies will spend $3 million over three years
studying the engineering requirements of a satellite system.
They also plan to seek broadcast frequencies for the system
at an international meeting in 1992 called the World
Administrative Radio Conference. Any communications system
that transmits abroad needs international approval for use of
foreign frequencies.
   The proposal faces formidable political and technical
obstacles. Most importantly, current radios can't receive
satellite signals, so the agencies must persuade
manufacturers to develop a new generation of receivers. It
also will require the Federal Communications Commission to
allocate a huge number of unused or currently used broadcast
frequencies, which U.S. broadcasters will surely oppose. The
National Association of Broadcasters, for instance, last week
tried to head off the satellite system by proposing a digital
transmission system using conventional, land-based radio
towers.
   The two satellite entrepreneurs so far have made proposals
to the FCC that closely mirror aspects of the federal
proposal, but that would provide service by 1994. The systems
would be privately owned.
   Mr. Rothblatt, the Marcor executive, asked the FCC to
approve a $330 million plan that he calls Satellite CD Radio
Inc. His system would use two satellites to provide 100
channels of compact-disk quality music in the U.S. starting
in 1994. In an attempt to blunt opposition from broadcasters,
Satellite CD reserves one-third of the channels for local
broadcasters. Listeners would use radio sets with antennas
that look like cellular-phone antennas to pick up the
satellite signals, he says.
   "NASA and Commerce being behind this concept gives people
more technical confidence that it will work," Mr. Rothblatt
says. The two agencies declined to comment on the system.
   Mr. Noreen proposes something more modest. He asked the
FCC to approve construction of a $1 million earth station in
Pasadena to transmit 10 channels of music, as well as paging
data and telephone calls to a satellite that the FCC has
already approved for launch in 1993. Mr. Noreen is a partner
in that satellite venture, called American Mobile Satellite
Corp.
   The California entrepreneur says his system at first
wouldn't offer compact-disk quality sound, but rather would
offer a package of services. He envisions a car radio that
could pick up FM-quality satellite radio stations and also
act as a pager and a mobile phone. He says the receiver could
be on sale by Christmas of 1993 and cost about $200 more than
top-of-the line conventional radios.
   The two entrepreneurs already are taking potshots at each
other. Mr. Noreen calls the Satellite CD proposal "silly" and
grandiose. Mr. Rothblatt counters that Mr. Noreen's idea is
too limited. "It's geared to truckers -- people who like
radio and a pager rolled into one," he says.
   For its part, the FCC has asked for comment on the
Satellite CD proposal. "It's getting a lot of discussion in
and out of the agency," says Ray Laforge, an FCC engineer who
is attending the Commerce Department meetings.

   As Good as Greene

<LP>
   Much of the best British fiction since the war has been
written by people from the margins of the old empire --
Trinidad, India or Africa -- but over the past 15 years there
have emerged some native English novelists who have attracted
much deserved attention. Though different from each other in
important ways, Bruce Chatwin, Martin Amis, Julian Barnes and
Ian McEwan share an unmistakable doomsday glow. They all emit
a whiff of the grave and meditate upon Last Things.
   In this, their godfathers are Evelyn Waugh, the master of
malice, and Graham Greene, the master of seediness -- Roman
Catholic novelists and travel writers whose exceptionally
clear colloquial prose conveyed their fascination with
failure, innocence and betrayal, socialites, criminals and
scruffy saints. But these four younger writers all are
stylistically more complex than Waugh or Greene and none of
them appears to share his ancestors' religious faith. There
is damnation, but no redeemer. No Christ, no Marx, no Freud.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bruce Chatwin began as a travel writer with the remarkable
"In Patagonia" (1977), and then turned to narratives often
marked by an opposition between exotic innocence and modern
civilization. Martin Amis began as a fairly conventional
social satirist, but soon created the frenzied, dark
millennial vision seen most recently in "London Fields."
Julian Barnes also began as satirist but has developed into a
great original: His masterpiece, "Flaubert's Parrot" (1984),
was followed by two equally inventive fictional experiments
upon "memento mori". Ian McEwan, whose eighth book, "The
Innocent" (Doubleday, 271 pages, $18.95), has just been
published, began as a specialist in adolescent torment and
perversion, but has become a considerably more complex
figure.
   The opening story in Mr. McEwan's first book, "First Love,
Last Rites," which won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976 and
established its 28-year-old author as a dour "enfant
terrible", was narrated by a 14-year-old who seemed an
English cousin of Holden Caulfield's: "This may have been one
of the most desolate couplings known to copulating mankind,
involving lies, deceit, humiliation, incest, my partner
falling asleep, my gnat's orgasm and the sobbing which now
filled the bedroom, but I was pleased with it. . . . I had
made it into the adult world finally. . . ."
   The nasty precision of the prose and equally nasty
obsessive undertow proved to be characteristic of much of Mr.
McEwan's work -- two volumes of stories, four novels, a
collection of television plays and an oratorio. His fiction
is filled with adolescent incest and violent regression, a
taste for sordid acts described in a cool, disquieting manner
that is never merely precious or snobbish. His short stories
often run to clinical monologues or confessions, but his
novels are more varied and relaxed and show notable
development.
   His first novel, "The Cement Garden" (1978), depicted the
macabre incestuous regression of four working-class London
orphans left to themselves in the course of a summer. His
second, "The Comfort of Strangers" (1981), smoothly recounted
the destruction of an English couple on a Venetian holiday at
the hands of a sado-masochistic husband and wife.
   His third novel, "The Child in Time" (1987), was a great
surprise. Its account of a London children's-book writer who
has lost his three-year-old daughter and struggles to regain
his own lost childhood and family -- to recapture time, to
reenter the continuity of generations -- was thematically
richer and technically more impressive than Mr. McEwan's
earlier work. Its large psychological themes were combined
with perfectly pitched social satire and lush physical
descriptions. His familiar theme of regression was developed
in a grander, more emotionally and intellectually ambitious
context than before. "The Child in Time" was touching in
unexpected ways, and it remains impressive.
   Mr. McEwan's new novel, "The Innocent," marks a
deliberately popular turn in his work. It uses the action and
setting of a spy novel -- espionage in Berlin in the midst of
the Cold War -- to explore the perils of English postwar
innocence abroad and to celebrate education (personal,
sexual, political) as a fortunate, if grisly fall.
   But "The Innocent" is never less than a wholly
entertaining spy novel. In Berlin in 1955 the mutually
suspicious British and American intelligence forces
constructed a tunnel into the Russian sector in order to tap
Soviet phone lines. This is all true and meticulously
described in the best techno-thriller way -- we learn about
circuit diagrams, nitrogen-filled cables and 150
signal-activated Ampex tape recorders monitoring 172
circuits. The hero of the novel is a naive, awkward
25-year-old telephone technician who works in a minor way on
this complex project. He is "handed over" to the Americans
because of our "special relationship" and is repelled,
embarrassed and attracted by the freedom of American
feelings, manners and popular culture: rock 'n' roll "at the
outer limit of effort and joy," the "jubilant uncoiling
power" of Americans playing catch.
   At the same time, his sexual initiation and difficulties
with an older German woman are carefully interwoven with
these transatlantic matters -- as are the themes of secrecy,
intimacy and betrayal, vulnerability and power, war and rape.
The last third of the novel turns into an expertly
constructed, bloody horror show as the tunnel, the hero's own
buried violence, his girlfriend's loving body, and the corpse
of her drunken former husband are brought together with the
suspense and precision of a strong Hitchcock film, or a novel
by Graham Greene.

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- General Electric Capital Corp. said it
plans to join the parade of securities firms, banks and law
firms in the burgeoning field of offering financing to overly
indebted companies.
   The financing from GE Capital, a unit of General Electric
Co., would allow distressed companies to reduce their debt
before or after seeking bankruptcy-law protection from
creditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jeffrey H. Coats, head of GE Capital's new restructuring
group, said the company can move faster than banks in such
situations because it can offer equity financing, as well as
debt financing, and doesn't necessarily need to redistribute
the debt. He said GE Capital plans to expand the number of
people devoted to restructuring from 12 to 20 by the end of
the year.
   Recently, he said, GE Capital provided $50 million in
credit to L.J. Hooker Corp. for use prior to the liquidation
of its Bonwit-Teller and B. Altman retail units. GE also
financed a $75 million management buy-out of Hooker's
Merksamer Jewelers unit.

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission Monday said
it would review "with interest" the $3.8 billion takeover of
Swiss chocolate and coffee concern Jacobs Suchard by Philip
Morris Cos. of the U.S.
   The move will substantially enlarge the European position
of Kraft General Foods, Philip Morris's food-processing arm,
and could therefore affect competition within the EC.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for the Commission said, however, that it
was "very early days yet." She said that "nothing happens in
the world these days without the EC being involved in some
way or another."
   Through the move Philip Morris will acquire such brand
names as Tobler, Toblerone, Milka and Cote d'Or on the
chocolate side and Night and Day, Jacques Vabre and Carte
Noire in coffee.

   Several German intellectuals and politicians have had hard
words for their fellow citizens who flung themselves on the
West German shops as soon as they could. . . . These could
only be the words of people who have forgotten, or never
knew, the personal humiliation inflicted by the permanent
lack of the most elementary consumer goods: the humiliation
of silent and hostile lines, the humiliation inflicted on you
by salespeople who seem angry to see you standing there, the
humiliation of always having to buy what there is, not what
you need. The systematic penury of material goods strikes a
blow at the moral dignity of the individual.

   DUBLIN -- European Community leaders agreed on a timetable
for writing separate treaties on political union and economic
and monetary integration, but discussions here made it clear
the drafting process could be a tug-of-war.
   At the first day of a two-day summit, the 12 EC leaders
set the opening of the political union conference for Dec. 14
in Rome, followed the next day by the opening of the economic
and monetary union conference. The two conferences will
decide on amendments to the EC's founding Treaty of Rome,
giving EC institutions vast new powers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the leaders made little progress reconciling
conflicting visions over exactly where the treaty amendments
should lead. French President Francois Mitterrand said he
would ultimately like to see the EC states bound together in
some kind of federation. But other leaders want a much looser
arrangement.
   The leaders adopted a broad text that leaves almost all
options open, and detailed discussions will come up only once
the conference gets under way.
   On the complex question of integrating EC monetary
policies and creating a single currency, there is even more
disagreement. The leaders made little progress deciding how
long it should take before they cede national control of
economic and monetary policy.

   A senior Bush administration official yesterday praised
the Japanese government for making progress on all the major
issues in talks to cut the bilateral-trade imbalance but
stressed that none of the matters had been resolved.
   The official's remarks, delivered after the first day of
the final round of the so-called Structural Impediments
Initiative, contrasted with the harsh rhetoric coming out of
Washington in the weeks leading up to the meetings. Last
week, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said, "Japan's
foot-dragging . . . must end."
   The most contentious issue is whether Japan will commit to
big increases in public spending over the next decade, an act
the U.S. argues will shift more resources to Japan's domestic
market. A member of the U.S. delegation said the two sides
were still "apart" on the issue but "I would not say we are
far apart."
   A Japanese government official said his delegation didn't
increase its proposal from the 415 trillion yen ($2.679
trillion) level given to the U.S. last week. The U.S. has
asked Japan to spend 500 trillion yen over the next 10 years
on public works.
                                                                                                       

   GLOBAL JET DEMAND
                                                                                                       

   Global demand for commercial jets will total about 12,220
planes for the period from 1990 through 2008, according to a
new forecast published by Airbus Industrie. The European
consortium said that about 5,500 aircraft of the estimated
total would be needed to replace aging jets now in service.
The rest would be needed to satisfy traffic growth estimated
at an annual average of 5.5% for the period. Airbus estimated
firm orders had already been placed for some 3,200 jets by
the start of 1990.
                                                                                                       

   AMERICAN EXPRESS IN LONDON
                                                                                                       

   American Express Co. will lease space for a European
headquarters from Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. in the
Canary Wharf office complex in East London. The U.S. travel
and financial-services concern said it will take 300,000
square feet of 20 Cabot Square, a 10-story building, in
spring 1992. The new building will be the first European
headquarters for American Express International, bringing
about 1,500 employees under one roof, American Express said.
Olympia &amp; York said it now has leasing commitments for more
than half the space under construction at Canary Wharf.
                                                                                                       

   BRAZILIAN KIDNAPPINGS
                                                                                                       

   The Brazilian government has proposed drastic measures to
put an end to a wave of kidnappings. Kidnappers have seized
25 people in Rio de Janeiro alone this year. "The government
must take vigorous and drastic measures to cut off this evil
at the root," said President Fernando Collor de Mello in a
memorandum to Justice Minister Bernardo Cabral. Measures
proposed to the legislature include freezing the assets of
victims to stop them from paying ransom and increasing the
maximum prison sentence for kidnappers to 30 years from
eight.
                                                                                                       

   AIRPORT SECURITY
                                                                                                       

   Japan plans to tighten luggage security checks at its six
international airports beginning in October, a Transport
Ministry spokesman said. The ministry is negotiating to split
costs with a number of airlines that don't X-ray luggage on
flights to and from Japan, the spokesman said. Elsewhere, the
Geneva-based International Air Travel Association said it
opposed a West German plan to levy a $2 security charge on
embarking airline passengers. "We firmly believe that the
cost of maintaining security at airports . . . should be
borne by the state in question," said an IATA official.
                                                                                                       

   JOINT VENTURES IN EASTERN EUROPE
                                                                                                       

   A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development shows that there are more than 5,400 joint
ventures with foreign companies in Eastern Europe. But a
large number of these, especially in the Soviet Union, are
"just on paper and inactive"; and, in general, the joint
ventures are noticeably absent from the service sector, an
OECD official said. He added that "while many joint projects
have had a useful demonstration effect, some countries have
to rebuild their legal and economic infrastructure" before
many ventures can bear fruit.
                                                                                                       

   KEEPING JAPAN'S WORKERS HAPPY
                                                                                                       

   Many Japanese companies have been cutting working hours in
an attempt to hold on to employees in a tightening labor
market, the Labor Ministry said.
   Ministry officials said a quarterly survey conducted in
May showed that 60% of manufacturers have reduced work hours,
while 64% of wholesalers and retailers took the same step.
The survey, which involved 2,172 companies, also found that
44% of the manufacturers have raised wages and 30% have
improved company welfare facilities to hold workers.
   The smaller the companies, the more trouble they have
trying to find workers or keeping them, the officials said.
   According to the survey, 47% of the companies with more
than 1,000 people on the payroll have reduced work hours,
while 71% of those with between 100 and 299 people reported
the same action.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Norway and Hungary are abolishing visa requirements for
one another's citizens as of July 15. . . . Melina Mercouri,
Greece's film actress turned socialist politician, will seek
to become mayor of Athens in municipal elections in October.

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. newsprint consumption last month rose
3.2% to 1.070 million metric tons from 1.037 million metric
tons in May 1989, according to preliminary estimates by the
American Newspaper Publishers Association.
   The industry group said U.S. daily newspapers used 793,154
metric tons of newsprint in May, up 1.7% from 780,228 metric
tons a year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.

   Estimated newsprint consumption by all U.S. users in the
first five months of 1990 was up 0.8% to 5.060 million metric
tons from 5.020 million in the same period a year earlier.
Consumption by daily newspapers for the first five months of
1990 was up 0.7% to 3.790 million metric tons from 3.764
million metric tons.
   The publishers association said that newsprint inventories
of newspapers in its statistical sample averaged a 40-day
supply in May, compared with a 41-day supply in May 1989. It
said stocks at North American mills decreased about 19.4%
from a year earlier.
   The association said U.S. newsprint mills operated at 95%
of capacity in May and 97% during the first five months.
Canadian mills operated at 97% of capacity in May and at 94%
during the first five months of the year.

   An investment partnership that Michael R. Milken has
admitted defrauding sued the former Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. junk bond chief seeking more than $6 million in damages.
   The suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan by
Finsbury Group Ltd., is the first to result directly from Mr.
Milken's guilty plea. The investors in Finsbury, a
Drexel-organized partnership that invests in high-yield
securities, allege that they were defrauded by Mr. Milken
"through a series of artificially rigged securities
transactions."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to six felony counts in April
and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and restitution. Mr.
Milken admitted in one of those counts that he, along with
former fund manager David Solomon, repeatedly overcharged
Finsbury for millions of dollars of junk bonds sold to
Finsbury by Drexel between 1984 and 1986.
   Mr. Milken admitted to overcharging Finsbury to recoup
certain expenses incurred by his Beverly Hills, Calif., junk
bond department in connection with the sale of Finsbury
shares. Mr. Milken also admitted concealing the illegal price
adjustments.
   Finsbury claims that the fraudulent activities to which
Mr. Milken pleaded guilty cost the partners more than $2
million. Those damages, Finsbury said, include the payment of
unjustified fees of more than $1.5 million, direct losses of
more than "several hundred thousand dollars" and attorneys'
fees. Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law, known as RICO, Finsbury is seeking triple
damages.
   Besides Mr. Milken, the suit also names as defendants Mr.
Solomon and Solomon Asset Management Inc. Mr. Solomon became
a witness against Mr. Milken last year in exchange for a
grant of immunity from prosecution, and resigned from the
company he founded.
   Mr. Solomon was once one of Mr. Milken's largest customers
and managed a high-yield portfolio for the Finsbury fund. Mr.
Solomon, who is believed to have provided the government with
information about Finsbury, had not been sued before for his
activities with Mr. Milken and Drexel.
   Finsbury alleges in its suit that Mr. Milken conspired to
induce Mr. Solomon to cheat Finsbury by "promising and
providing Mr. Solomon and his company with other lucrative
deals, fraudulent tax losses and other illegal benefits in
the nature of money, kickbacks and gratuities." Mr. Milken
also has pleaded guilty to helping Mr. Solomon create
fraudulent tax losses.
   Although Finsbury alleges that Drexel was "a knowing and
active participant in the criminal fraud scheme," Drexel
isn't being charged because it is currently operating under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code and is protected
from claims by creditors.
   Andrew Levander, a New York attorney who is representing
Finsbury, wasn't available to comment yesterday. A spokesman
for Mr. Milken declined to comment on the suit.
   Martin Auerbach, the New York attorney who is representing
Mr. Solomon, said: "We do not believe that Finsbury's
complaint accurately reflects events as they occurred.
However, we also do not believe that newspapers are the right
place to set the record straight."

   SOUTHWESTERN BELL loses $15 million antitrust case
involving phone books.
   A federal court jury in Amarillo, Texas, found that
Southwestern Bell Corp. illegally tried to monopolize
telephone directory advertising in parts of Texas and
Oklahoma.
   Upholding claims that the St. Louis company violated
federal antitrust laws, the jury awarded the damages to two
independent telephone directory publishers, Great Western
Directories Inc., of Amarillo, and Canyon Directories Inc. in
nearby Canyon, Texas.
   The ruling is a major boost for independent publishers,
who are engaged in an increasingly fierce battle with local
telephone companies for lucrative yellow-page advertising.
Independent telephone directory publishers proliferated after
the 1984 court decree breaking up the Bell system. But in
order to compete, they have to buy copyrighted white-page
telephone listings from local phone companies. Such listings
are needed because they are the most current, and because
they provide leads for selling ads in their own yellow pages.
   "Independent publishers from across the country have
supported this case because their survival depends on their
ability to get directory listings at reasonable prices," says
Nancy Stone, an attorney in Amarillo for Garner, Stone &amp;
Lovell, counsel for the plaintiffs.
   Great Western and Canyon contended that Southwestern
violated the law by unreasonably raising the price it charged
for the listings, which include the names, addresses and
phone numbers of subscribers. In 1988, Canyon paid $300.70
for the right to copy 6,200 listings, the suit alleged, but
since then it has had to pay $5,000 annually. Great Western's
price per listing went from 30 cents to $1, the suit said.
   In upholding the allegations, the jury awarded $5 million
to Great Western, which serves several cities in Texas and
Oklahoma, and $9,400 to Canyon, which serves its local
market. Under federal antitrust laws, the damages are
tripled.
   Ms. Stone said the verdict "will cause a lot of other
telephone companies across the country to take a look at what
they're doing."
   But a spokesman for Southwestern Bell sharply disagreed.
"We believe the jury's decision is absurd and we're confident
the decision will be overturned on appeal," said Gray
Kerrick, senior vice president, corporate communications.

   NEW ALLEGATIONS are made in pollution suit against
Ashland.
   As expected, lawyers representing plaintiffs in an
environmental suit against Ashland Oil Inc. amended their
complaint, alleging fraud and attempts to obstruct justice.
   The complaint alleges that a 1988 letter from Ashland
Chairman John R. Hall assuring residents that emissions from
a refinery in Catlettsburg, Ky., were harmless was false. The
complaint says Art Smith, an air pollution expert employed by
West Virginia, testified that if a person were to eat toxic
emissions from the plant, as the letter suggested they could
do safely, "they would need a stomach and esophagus
transplant."
   Mr. Smith testified at a trial in May in which a $10.3
million verdict was rendered in favor of four people against
Ashland. The plaintiffs are part of 1,200 residents who have
other claims pending and are seeking more than $2 billion in
damages.
   The amended complaint, filed in Kanawha County Circuit
Court, claims Ashland tried to obstruct justice by
distributing things of value in the county. For example, the
complaint alleges that Ashland gave "thousands of dollars in
cash awards" to teachers, gave cash to a festival commission
and a war memorial and maintained a booth to pass out
promotional items. The plaintiffs also claim that Ashland
formed, or caused to be formed, a group to launch an
offensive against the litigants. After the trial, some of
plaintiffs were threatened and harrassed, the complaint says.
   Ashland officials couldn't immediately be reached. Earlier
the company asked the court to overturn the $10.3 million
verdict or to grant the company a new trial, alleging that
297 errors occurred during the trial.

   ILLINOIS can't give up its lake bed, judge rules.
   A federal judge blocked Loyola University from filling in
18.5 acres of Lake Michigan along the shoreline on Chicago's
North Side. U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen, citing an
1892 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court, said the state
couldn't give up its public trust over the lake bed of Lake
Michigan.
   Upholding the claim of an environmental group, Judge Aspen
said the state's sale of 20 acres of lake bottom to Loyola
for $10,000 was "a transparent giveaway of public property to
a private entity."
   The university began driving steel pilings at the site
last week and had already sunk $2 million on planning,
lobbying and construction commitments for its projected $6
million campus expansion. Jeffrey P. Smith, of Chicago's
Gottlieb &amp; Schwartz, represented the Lake Michigan Federation
on a no-fee basis.
   A Loyola spokesman said the university was "surprised and
dismayed" by the ruling but hadn't decided whether to appeal
the permanent injunction.

   DALLAS -- Elcor Corp., citing the adverse effects of
unusually heavy rains in the Southwest, said it expects to
report a loss of about $700,000 for the fourth quarter,
ending Saturday.
   The maker of roofing and industrial products, which
reported a $6 million loss in the year-ago fourth quarter,
said the rains temporarily reduced roofing installations in
the area, which resulted in lower-than-expected shipments of
the company's laminated glass fiber asphalt shingles.

   DALLAS -- Recognition Equipment Inc. said it settled a
lawsuit filed by James V. Jellison, a former senior assistant
postmaster general, charging that the company, two former
executives and others tried to remove him from his position
with the Postal Service.
   Under terms of the out-of-court settlement, the
manufacturer of document processing equipment said it paid an
undisclosed amount in return for the release of all claims
against the company and the former executives, William G.
Moore Jr., a former chief executive officer, and Robert W.
Reedy, a former vice president.

   The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, was based
on an indictment against Recognition and the two officers,
alleging that they tried to manipulate the award of $400
million in Postal Service contracts. A federal judge
subsequently acquitted all the defendants in the case.

   Siebe Bids $656.4 Million for Foxboro;
   Analysts Question Price as Stock Soars

   Siebe PLC, a British engineering concern, won an auction
to buy Foxboro Co. for $656.4 million, but financial analysts
in London questioned whether the loss-ridden U.S. company is
worth the price.
   The Foxboro, Mass., manufacturer of valves and other
automatic process-control devices used in factories posted a
1989 net loss of $4.6 million. For Siebe, based in Windsor,
England, the acquisition would expand its U.S. operations and
fill in holes in its product lines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   News of the $52-a-share offer sent Foxboro's stock
soaring. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, the company's shares jumped 34%, rising $12.875 to
close at $51.
   But the offer left London financial analysts and stock
traders scratching their heads. The bid represents a 75%
premium over Foxboro's share price on June 11, when the
company announced it was seeking a buyer. "It looks a wee bit
expensive," said analyst Andrew Chambers of Nomura Research
Institute. By industry yardsticks, he said, a $656.4 million
takeover price would normally be considered reasonable for a
company making about $50 million a year in pretax profits,
rather than one posting a net loss.
   In London Stock Exchange trading, Siebe shares fell 25
pence to 505 pence ($8.75), a 4.7% drop.
   E. Barrie Stephens, Siebe's chief executive and vice
chairman, called the stock market's sour response "a
traditional knee-jerk reaction" and defended the offer price.
"We offered what we felt the business was worth to us. I
haven't bought profits for my shareholders, I've bought
opportunity."
   Mr. Stephens said Foxboro has important control technology
that Siebe lacks. Siebe's controls business, comprising 56%
of its #1.22 billion ($2.11 billion) revenue in the year
ended April 30, 1989, consists of devices for the automotive,
aerospace and construction industries, among others. In
contrast, many of Foxboro's products are specialized for the
chemical, paper, food and power-generation industries. Mr.
Stephens added that about $350 million of Foxboro's $598
million revenue in 1989 came from the U.S., meaning the
acquisition would greatly expand Siebe's U.S. operations.
   Mr. Stephens said Foxboro's losses stemmed partly from
soluble problems with a new product range, and he predicted
that "we'll turn it around with (Foxboro managers') help very
quickly." Contrary to some London analysts' expectations, he
said he expects Foxboro to start contributing to Siebe's
profits this year. Siebe also will get some slight benefit
from Foxboro's U.S. tax credits, stemming from past losses,
that Siebe can spread out over several years to reduce its
own U.S. taxation.
   Foxboro advisers conceded that by conventional financial
measures the price might appear high. "If you looked at what
(Foxboro) did in the past you wouldn't have paid this price,"
said William H. Strong, an official at New York investment
bank Salomon Brothers Inc., which advised Foxboro on the
auction. But he said that Siebe and competing bidders for
Foxboro were concentrating on the value of the company's
highly regarded technology. He said Foxboro's board
considered at least three firm bids for the company at a
meeting Friday, and Siebe's offer won only by an "extremely
small" margin. He declined to name the other bidders.
   In the past few years, Siebe has grown to become one of
Britain's biggest engineering companies. Throughout the
1980s, a string of acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe helped
it post rapid earnings and revenue growth. Its biggest prior
U.S. acquisitions were of Robertshaw Controls Co. and Ranco
Inc. Many London analysts thought the prices Siebe paid were
too high, but their criticisms have turned to praise for the
improvements Siebe has made in those businesses.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Records:
   Russians and Opera: Igor, Boris and Dmitri

   With not much to send around except its spot-headed
president, maybe the Soviet Union could think about exporting
Russian operas. All we ever seem to see are mustily draped
"Sleeping Beauties" from the Bolshoi Ballet and never-ending
shipments of paintings from the Hermitage. Why don't they
send over a production of "Prince Igor" instead with a full
contingent of Polovtsian maidens?
   Here is an undeservedly unfamiliar opera of epic splendor
as worthy of the stage as "Boris Godunov," "Eugene Onegin" or
"Pique Dame," the only Russian operas in regular repertoire.
"Igor's" power comes across even in the new Sony release
recorded in the National Palace of Culture in Sofia featuring
mostly home-grown talent, including Nicolai Ghiaurov, whose
bass voice is as empty by now as the Central Asian steppes
where the Polovtsians pitch their tents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The opera opens with Igor, a faintly historical figure
plucked from Russia's dark ages, leaving his wife and the
comforts of Putivl to subjugate heathen tribes raiding
southern towns. Not much better at this than spothead, Igor
immediately is captured by the leader of the Polovtsians, an
uncommonly courtly fellow who entertains him lavishly with a
full dance rendition of "Stranger in Paradise." The best
tunes from "Kismet" were stolen from "Prince Igor," whose
compositional history is somewhat complicated.
   Alexander Borodin could never finish it. A chemistry
professor, he wasn't particularly well-trained in music and
spent much of his life poring over test tubes studying the
properties of nitrogen in a disheveled apartment famous in
Moscow for a large colony of cats who ate his dinner and
attacked his guests. Two friends, Rimsky-Korsakov and
Glazunov, finally completed "Igor" after Borodin's death,
often filling in blanks by pulling from their memories the
melodies Borodin had played for them on the piano -- or just
making things up as they went along. A lot of Borodin seems
to have fallen off the table in the process: The essay
included in the Sony set suggests Rimsky and Glazunov may
have dropped as many as 5,867 bars of music. Borodin only
wrote 6,880]
   For all that, and passing on the question of just who
exactly composed this opera -- something Ms. Dorothea
Redepenning of the Sony text doesn't really rassle with --
"Igor" is a surprisingly coherent work, a tad weak on
character development, to be sure, but rich in majestic
tableaux that make a great effect even when compressed down
to CD size. Emil Tchakarov conducts with spirit and breadth;
the singing is variable. Boris Martinovich sings Igor with a
steady, resonant bass long gone from Mr. Ghiaurov, who is
cast as Konchak Khan, the Polovtsian. The prince's wife is
piercingly sung by Stefka Evstatieva. The best performances
come from mezzo Alexandrina Milcheva, who brings a lovely
tone to the Khan's daughter, and the Sofia National Opera
Chorus.
   Rimsky always was helping his dead friends. Hardly had
Mussorgsky slushed down his last bottle of booze than Rimsky
sat down with "Boris Godunov," reharmonizing, editing,
reorchestrating. The result was a gussied-up "Boris," slick
and splashy (the Coronation Scene really got Rimsky excited,
adding bells left and right). In fact, as the new Erato set
reminds us, Mussorgsky's own second version is preferable. It
may be more primitive in its wistful, often unconventional
harmonies, but the subject of the opera is no "fin-de-siecle"
sophisticate.
   The album was taped three years ago in Washington, D.C.,
with Mstislav Rostropovitch conducting the National Symphony
Orchestra and, less happily (at least for us), his wife,
Galina Vishnevskaya. She came out of retirement to sing what
sounds like a private arrangement of Marina's music.
Punishment of a sort followed. The set was used as the
soundtrack for a weird movie of "Boris" that premiered this
spring. The last time I was in Paris, Ms. V was trying to get
some sort of injunction against the film because it featured
a couple copulating while she was singing offscreen. She
thought it was undignified. I'd worry more about this record.
   The rest of the cast is quite fine. Ruggero Raimondi is
very impressive, an unusually velvety Boris, compelling in
his mad scene. Vyacheslav Polosov is labored, but manly still
as the false Dimitri, and there is a memorable vignette from
a Dimitri of the past: Nicolai Gedda, who closes the opera as
the simpleton, weeping quietly over a Russia doomed to
sadness.
   Except that somewhere in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk,
luck and genes combined to produce Dmitri Hvorostovsky. He is
a young baritone born in 1962 who won the Cardiff competition
last summer and just a few months later was signing major
recording deals while being heavily photographed on a sunny
terrace in Monte Carlo. Baritones usually don't take off like
that, but Mr. Hvorostovsky is very special indeed to judge by
his first Philips album.
   Sturdily accompanied by Valery Gergiev leading the
Rotterdam Philharmonic, Mr. Hvorostovsky sings Tchaikovsky
and Verdi arias, all of them very familiar pieces (well,
maybe not Tchaikovsky's "The Sorceress"), but then, he will
be singing this repertoire soon enough in the major opera
houses, and we might as well get a foretaste. Easily,
smoothly his voice pours out, incredibly controlled and even,
yet also expressive and beautifully timbred. Only the covered
and constricted top strikes me as oddly problematic in such
an otherwise nearly perfect instrument. Well, there's plenty
to distract from this shortcoming, including the baritone
himself, an unusually good-looking, pouty young man.

   The dividend is payable July 25 to stock of record July 3.

   At the annual meeting, Community National shareholders
also approved a proposal to reduce authorized shares to 15
million from 50 million. The move will reduce the franchise
tax the bank pays in Delaware, where it is incorporated; the
tax is partly based on the number of shares a company is
authorized to issue. The cut in authorized shares doesn't
affect shares outstanding. Community National has around
three million shares outstanding.
   The bank reiterated that second-quarter earnings will drop
from the year-ago period but that it is hoping for an upturn
in the second half.
   In the first quarter, net income fell 73% to $211,000, or
seven cents a share, from $793,000, or 30 cents a share, a
year earlier. The bank's provision for possible losses on bad
loans grew to $1.3 million from $200,000. Assets climbed 32%
to $408 million.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Community National shares rose 25 cents to $6.75.

   Tougher Rules
   Urged on Smoking
   In the Workplace

   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency, in a
draft report likely to spur wider bans on smoking in the
workplace, proposed that second-hand smoke be declared a
known human carcinogen.
   The agency also issued a draft guide to workplace smoking
policies that recommends that passive smoking be eliminated
wherever possible and measures the effectiveness of various
methods of reducing worker exposure to smoking. Among its
findings, the guide, which includes case studies of companies
that have reduced worker exposure, says that cutting passive
smoking can cut costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposal, which was expected, would put second-hand
smoke in a class with such pollutants as asbestos. The agency
estimates that passive smoke causes 3,800 additional lung
cancer deaths annually. These include 2,500 adults who never
smoked and 1,300 former smokers.
   The report didn't break new scientific ground and didn't
chronicle the effect of second-hand smoke on other ailments
such as heart disease and other forms of cancer, although
several reports recently have linked it to these illnesses.
The report did say that absorption of tobacco smoke can be
particularly harmful for children.
   The EPA itself can't regulate smoking, but the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to
use the report as a means of raising the issue of workplace
exposure. While anti-smoking groups expect the report to
bolster their efforts to ban smoking from the workplace, the
tobacco industry is also hard at work to thwart such moves.
Philip Morris Cos., for example, has been touting studies
that find exposure to second-hand smoke far less harmful than
the EPA report states.
   In a statement yesterday, the Tobacco Institute said the
EPA "has contributed to the speculative process of ascribing
risk where a sound scientific basis is lacking" and predicted
that the risk assessment would result in "fear and
confusion."
   The draft workplace guide states that prohibiting smoking
indoors is the best way to reduce exposure but notes that
this is inconvenient for smokers. To be effective, designated
smoking areas must have a separate ventilation system so that
air from the room isn't circulated throughout the building,
and provide far greater amounts of outdoor air for each
smoker than offices typically supply.
   Two common strategies, separating smokers from nonsmokers
with a wall or within the same room, won't eliminate
tobacco-smoke pollution although they can cut exposure,
according to the guidebook. The document also says various
devices used to clean air, including filters and ion
generators, may effectively remove particles found in tobacco
smoke but don't effectively reduce gaseous pollutants.
   One strategy that doesn't work particularly well is
allowing smokers and nonsmokers to use the same space at
different times. The guidelines state that people entering
room hours after smoking occurred will still be exposed to
the harmful particles and gases found in tobacco smoke.
   The guidebook says company smoking policies need the
support of management and should be developed with employee
and labor union participation. Smoking-cessation programs
also should be made available to smokers who want to quit.
   The guidebook, prepared for the EPA by the nonprofit
Smoking Policy Institute in Seattle, and the risk-assessment
report are being released for public comment on their
technical and policy contents.

   One Hospital Tells the Cost of Regulation

   The groans you hear coming from your local hospital are
not all emanating from patients. They're the protests of
nurses, hospital personnel and physicians who are forced to
live with a hodgepodge of expensive, contradictory and
confusing bureaucratic regulations.
   The federal government must be held responsible for many
of the basic costs that now confound the health-care
industry. Legislators, official commissions and bureaucrats
in Washington document deficiencies in our health-care
system, point out the need for corrective action, and then
invoke all sorts of rules, regulations and paper work.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What are the total national costs attributable to
regulating the hospital industry? Nobody knows for sure. But
the experience at Sequoia Hospital, a 430-bed not-for-profit,
general hospital in the San Francisco Bay area, may provide
some insights. The price tag for dealing with various
regulatory bodies and government mandated paper work at my
institution is approximately $7.8 million annually.
   The change in the U.S. government's attitude -- and the
resultant burden on hospitals -- is reflected in changes at
Sequoia. The average number of inpatients today is the same
as it was in 1966. The staff is about 175% the size it was
then. Some of the rise is because the number of outpatients
has grown. Some of it is because patients need more intense
care than they did then -- the hospitalized are sicker
because government regulations prohibit admitting many
patients at the point they used to enter the hospital. Much
of it, though, is due to new requirements of government.
   To comply with the string of regulations and government
directives requires a staff of 140 full-time employees. Not
included in this count is the vast number of hours physicians
devote helping the institution comply with mandated
government audits and utilization review programs.
   The federal government insists that medical care be
continually assessed and audited for quality and
appropriateness. At Sequoia, four full-time employees and one
part-timer spend all their time reviewing patient records.
Nine or 10 employees appraise the appropriateness of
hospitalization.
   The Federal Peer Review Act mandates that all hospital
work paid for by the government be reviewed by an independent
agency under contract to the Health Care Finance
Administration. Providing duplicate hospital records, lab
reports, X-ray data and billing information to outside "peer
review agencies" is an enormous task requiring 20 additional
staffers. As for Medicare funds, to get those the hospital
must undergo a third audit, by the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
   Each auditing agency issues directives, generating
multiple forms that must be filled out by nurses, hospital
pharmacists, record-room personnel and doctors. To lighten
the paperwork load for practicing physicians, the hospital
has added four people to its medical staff office. The
government forms require formatting by three data processors.
Paper work also eats away at nurses' time.
   If Sequoia's experience is typical -- and there's no
reason to suspect it is not -- health-care regulatory costs
nationwide measure in the billions of dollars.
   When allocations are scarce, available resources should be
spent in wisdom, not in folly. Excessive regulatory activity
has not only failed to produce a health-care system to carry
us into the next century; it has weakened what we already
have. In the exhilaration of forging a new health-care
system, the government has put providers into a regulatory
straitjacket. Only a radical restructuring of all these rules
and regulations will bring order out of the present chaos.
   The best way to start solving the health-care cost crisis
is to suggest that many of the government's regulators resign
en masse, and then accept these resignations so fast they
don't even have time to hit the table. The patients would not
lose much of value. And I would surmise that people would be
much happier knowing their taxes were being spent on older
peoples' medical needs rather than on a massive government
bureaucracy.
   Am I suggesting that Uncle Sam relinquish all oversight
activities? Not at all. Oversight is not a dirty word, and
every effort should be made to conduct a review of medical
practice on a rational basis. The question is not whether
Medicare needs oversight, but the kind of oversight that is
appropriate. Uncle Sam has not been the solution to soaring
medical costs; he has been part of the problem.

   Note: Sequoia serves roughly the same number of inpatients
it did in 1966. It serves more outpatients now. But more
nurses are needed in general because patients these days are
sicker and government paperwork takes nurses' time. Sequoia
estimates that Medicare and other government programs mean it
has to hire 35 more nurses than it would otherwise need.

effect of storms in early and mid-June. The insurer had a
year-earlier loss of $1.4 million.
   The company said that despite a favorable trend in private

   Mutual Funds:
   Pioneer's Gold Mine in Ghana
   Could Give It the Midas Touch

   Back in the mid-1980s, Pioneer Group Inc. was looking to
diversify away from its core business of managing mutual
funds. So what did this staid, old-line company decide to do?
Prospect for gold in Ghana.
   "I know it's a little unusual to have a mutual fund
company in the gold-mining business," concedes William
Keough, Pioneer's chief financial officer. "We view it as
some sort of earnings protection in the event the stock
market does have a prolonged slump."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The combination of mutual funds and gold mining isn't
exactly winning rave reviews on Wall Street. Compared with
other mutual fund companies that are publicly traded, Pioneer
is a stock-market laggard. While Franklin Resources' stock
trades at 14 times earnings and T. Rowe Price at 13 times
earnings, Pioneer -- which closed yesterday in
over-the-counter trading at $24.75 a share -- trades at less
than ten times its trailing 12-month earnings of $2.52 a
share.
   Nonetheless, Pioneer has attracted an impressive array of
shareholders, including such top money managers as the
Templeton funds, Tweedy, Browne Co. and Southeastern Asset
Management. A close look at Pioneer helps explain why.
Pioneer is trading for less than the value of its mutual fund
business, alone, say analysts. And some think Pioneer's foray
into gold mining could produce handsome gains.
   John Keefe, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
figures a top fund company generally has a value of three
times revenue, or alternatively a little more than 2% of
assets under management. That means Pioneer's fund business,
with annual revenue of $62 million and assets under
management of $7.4 billion, may be have a value of $28 a
share, analysts say.
   Pioneer also has $6 a share in cash and investments, net
of all debt. Add that to the value of the fund business, and
Pioneer -- ignoring the gold-mining operation -- is trading
at a 27% discount to its indicated true value.
   William Miller, who has bought Pioneer stock for the
mutual fund he manages, Legg Mason Special Investment Trust,
reckons Pioneer's fund business has a value closer to $30 a
share. "The Pioneer funds are well-established funds with
good records," he says. "It's difficult to quantify, but that
would clearly qualify it for some sort of premium (price)."
   Pioneer has $7.4 billion under management, $7 billion in
nine broker-sold mutual funds and the balance in private
accounts. Pioneer's largest fund by far is the $4.5 billion
Pioneer II, which has returned an average 18% a year during
the past ten years, versus 17.7% for the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 stock market index and 16% for the average stock fund
tracked by Lipper Analytical Services.
   While investment results have generally been good at
Pioneer's funds, critics argue that the fund group has been a
poor marketer. Pioneer seems to have taken the criticism to
heart. It has launched five funds in the past four years, and
three more are planned.
   But the biggest potential boost to Pioneer's earnings
could come from the gold mine, which is 90%-owned by Pioneer
and the rest by Ghana's government. Starting up the mine,
located 160 miles west of Accra, Ghana's capital, hasn't been
easy.
   "It's not New York," says Mr. Keough, Pioneer's financial
chief. "The concession is part of a gold-ore-bearing reef, so
there are gold-mining operations nearby. We're not out in the
jungle all by ourselves."
   Pioneer has sunk more money into the project than it
originally intended. Not only was Pioneer forced to buy out
the 27% stake of its partner, Glencar Explorations PLC, but
the company also has ended up overseeing all the mining
operations after losing an outside contractor.
   "I'm not going to pretend that everything has run as
planned," says Mr. Keough. "When you do a project of this
size, obviously there are surprises."
   Legg Mason's Mr. Miller reckons the gold mine is probably
worth what the company has sunk into it, $33.6 million, or
about $5.50 a share. But others are more optimistic. "The
real question is whether they get lucky with the gold
business," says one money manager.
   The optimists note that proven gold reserves are estimated
at 1.6 million ounces, and probable reserves of an additional
700,000 ounces. Pioneer expects to be producing gold by the
end of this summer, though the mine won't be at full
production until the second half of 1991. By then, the mine
should be producing gold at a rate of 100,000 ounces
annually, Pioneer says.
   How much would 100,000 ounces a year be worth? That
depends not only on the price of gold but also on Pioneer's
production costs. For its part, Pioneer is keeping mum on the
production costs. Mr. Keough will say only that, with gold at
$350 an ounce, "we would expect that operations will provide
meaningful contributions to net income" when the mine is in
full production.
   Once the gold mine is in full operation, Pioneer will get
an annual 20 cents-a-share boost to its net income if there
is a $25-an-ounce gap between production costs and the price
of gold. If that gap doubles, so will the boost to net.
   So how big will the gap be? Nobody knows for sure, not
even Pioneer. But for those given to speculation, think about
this: Pioneer's mine is using a gold-extraction technique
known as heap leaching, which -- depending on the richness of
the ore body -- generally involves production costs of about
$250 an ounce.

   Business World:
   Motorola Aims High, So Motorolans Won't Be Getting High

   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. -- Unusually tight security, even for a
high-tech company with military contracts, is your first clue
that "anything goes" isn't the motto at Motorola Inc.'s
headquarters in this Chicago suburb. And its employees soon
will have more than their briefcases checked.
   Motorola last month said it would become the biggest
corporation in America to screen employees for traces of
illegal drugs, beginning Jan. 1. Other Fortune 500 firms may
follow. Texas Instruments Inc., a year ahead in its testing
program, is the only other sizable company with a universal
urine-sample requirement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The programs are similar. They start first with top
management and then on a random, unscheduled basis test the
entire U.S. payroll over a few years. Those who refuse face
dismissal. Those who test positive are referred to a company
rehabilitation program and fired if they don't pass follow-up
inspections.
   Both companies emphasize that the tests complement
"education and awareness" programs aimed at grooming more
productive workers. Motorola has had one since 1979. Although
surveys suggest drug use is declining in America, the company
says the additional step is called for.
   "We have over the last several years experienced problems
with the workplace, some of it related to concern about
impairment, concern about theft, concern about gang activity,
which continues to go on," says Gary Howard, the
employee-relations director overseeing the program.
   Motorola has been testing for drugs before hiring since
1987. Word is out not to apply after toking up, however, so
now less than 2% fail. "It's probably more of an intelligence
test today than a drug test," says Mr. Howard. Likewise,
"for-cause" testing for ongoing employees is "virtually not
used," he says. Companies find supervisors unable to spot
sure signs of drug use or unwilling to risk mistakenly
singling out workers.
   "The question became, if those aren't working, should we
do more?" says Mr. Howard. In extensive small-group sessions,
he relates, 80% of surveyed Motorola workers wanted universal
testing. (Chuck Nielson, personnel vice president at Texas
Instruments, reports a similar consensus among its
employees.)
   Mr. Howard doesn't cite a specific safety incident
traceable to drugs but says one man from a wafer-fabrication
facility for semiconductor chips approached him after a focus
group to say that 25% to 30% of his co-workers would test
positive that day. "Those areas are highly influenced by
chemicals," says Mr. Howard. "Impairment in an area like that
can be a big problem."
   Why not test for dexterity and acuity, then, instead of
evidence of past indulgence? Even though devices to do that
are beginning to be sold, Mr. Howard says that wasn't
considered, "because there's nothing on the market today that
we're aware of that would do an effective job."
   Besides, he acknowledges, in some cases a drug user
arguably isn't impaired. "We're not particularly as concerned
about impairment, although we're concerned about it, as we
are about having a work force that doesn't use drugs. The
argument comes up, what business is it of Motorola if an
employee uses marijuana on the weekend. . . . Our stated
objective . . . {is} to become the finest company in the
world. You can't be the finest company in the world if you
don't have the best people in the world, what we refer to as
the `best in class' in Motorola. Best-in-class people to us
don't use drugs."
   They don't abuse alcohol, either, he adds. Relative
acceptance of drinking vs. illegal drugs was questioned by
employees, and Mr. Howard says the company is looking into
better technology for conducting for-cause tests of
insobriety, whose symptoms are thought easier to spot.
   Mr. Howard rejects the notion that the policy will trip up
some "casual users" of recreational drugs who pose no
problem. He argues thus: "A casual user by definition is
somebody who can quit anytime they want to. If somebody
continues to use marijuana in the face of a policy that says,
if it's in your system you jeopardize your employment status,
they're not a casual user anymore. By that definition, they
have a problem."
   Although it wants employees with such a problem to enroll
voluntarily in its treatment program, Motorola expects to
find at least 3,000 of its 60,000 U.S. labor force out of
compliance. (Texas Instruments, with 52,000 workers, won't
release its results thus far.) The effort is to cost $1.5
million the first year and $1 million annually thereafter,
Mr. Howard estimates. That doesn't include the tab for
in-house "rehab," which is running $4,000 to $10,000 for each
of the 100 to 125 self-referrals a month under the existing
program.
   By ridding itself of druggies, the $10 billion corporation
"conservatively" hopes to save $190 million a year. That
figure stems from economywide calculations of lost
productivity and absenteeism that some have charged are
hyped.
   Although recent anti-drug guidelines from the U.S.
Departments of Defense and Transportation give impetus to the
private sector, they emphasize the testing of workers in
sensitive positions, such as those directly bearing on public
safety. Motorola, as well as Texas Instruments, chose a more
expansive approach after employees rejected the idea of
selectivity. The ethos of "good for one, good for all,
including the boss" appears widespread.
   Both Motorola and Texas Instruments are non-union. Mr.
Howard, who previously did personnel work at Baxter
International and Weyerhaeuser, says this makes it easier to
implement testing. Unions have fought it.
   Like Texas Instruments, Motorola won't be testing in
states that bar employers from doing so. The biggest of these
is California, as a result of a state Supreme Court
interpretation last month of the privacy clause in the state
constitution. With its major outlying facilities in Arizona,
Florida and Texas, Motorola has a mostly free hand.
   Mr. Howard says the testing isn't "an invasion into
people's private lives. We have a serious problem in the
United States that is affecting you and me and everybody else
that depends on companies like this to keep our economy
strong. We in industry have been in a raging battle on a
multinational basis with very tough competitors . . . at a
time when we are not getting quality product out of the
school systems." Motorola sees the drug campaign as one piece
of its extraordinary effort at remediation of the labor pool.
   As its watchful eyes suggest, the sprawling Motorola
campus here can be deceiving. The outside world's ills
intrude. A private entity rightfully has leeway to deal with
personnel matters, and to the degree that drug use is a proxy
for gang activity or dereliction, it shouldn't be ignored. In
undertaking what Mr. Howard calls as "far-reaching" a mission
as any in his management experience, however, business must
beware being diverted to faddish crusades. The marketplace,
most of all in electronics, is a race to achieve. Social
work, by contrast, has no end.

   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Tandy Corp. said its board approved
amendments to the company's shareholder rights plan that
would allow individual holders to purchase additional shares
at a reduced price if an individual investor accumulates 15%
of the company's stock.
   Previously, the plan could be triggered if an investor
acquired a 25% or greater stake without board approval. The
electronics retailer and manufacturer said the changes
weren't adopted in response to any specific effort to acquire
control of the company.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index sank heavily in drab trading to close
at the intraday low, pressured by index-linked trading and by
widespread unenthusiasm about the near-term outlook for
stocks.
   Meanwhile, London shares rose on a late afternoon surge,
as investors were cheered by a positive start on Wall Street.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues plunged 570.38 points
to 31124.19. The index lost 392.70 points Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index
rebounded 136.50 points to 31260.69.
   Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 300
million shares, off from 350.7 million shares Friday. Losers
widely outnumbered advancers 904 to 120, while 100 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section tumbled 40.04 points, or 1.71%, to 2301.02.
   The second section index fell 47.16 points, or 1.14%, to
4088.26. Volume in the section was estimated at 12.4 million
shares, down from 19.7 million shares Friday.
   Insufficient volume has been one of the most detrimental
factors in the market lately, traders said.
   Japanese securities firms' research groups have estimated
that Wall Street needs about 170 million shares a day in
order to be profitable, whereas Tokyo needs at least 700
million to 800 million, noted Stephen Leist, manager of
Japanese equity sales at S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc.
   "There's just not enough liquidity," one trader at a U.K.
securities firm said. "Fund managers have no confidence in
this market."
   Even if institutional investors had wanted to participate
and take advantage of lower prices yesterday, there wouldn't
have been enough activity to complete the transactions, the
trader noted.
   Moreover, although the Big Four securities firms, which
usually try to add volume and initiate buying sentiment, were
quiet as the weak yen would have made such efforts pointless,
traders said.
   Institutional money is increasingly flowing out of stocks
and into money market instruments, or toward hedges against
futures, traders said.
   The bearishness is underlined by concerns about global
interest rates, partly stemming from uncertainty about German
monetary union, observers noted.
   "People are afraid that West Germany might increase
interest rates, which, if that's the case, will of course not
be good for the market. As a result, the market's just going
to stay at this level," the U.K. firm's trader said.
   At the same time, he noted, baseless chatter on the
possibility of another Bank of Japan official discount rate
increase and other negative sentiments keep surfacing as
participants become more disenchanted with the market.
   "With no stories to watch out for, there's really nothing
else they can do other than talk," he said.
   Electricals were mostly lower. But Hirose Electric rose
160 yen to 7150 yen ($1.03 to $46.16), Kyocera rose 70 yen to
8170 yen, and TDK gained 20 yen to 6800 yen.
   Sony fell 120 yen to 8450 yen, Matsushita Electric
Industrial fell 30 yen to 2060 yen, and Pioneer fell 30 yen
to 6070 yen.
   Domestic-demand related issues suffered from the weaker
yen. Steel, construction, mining and retail shares fell.
   In London, nervousness in the early going on the back of
Wall Street's slump Friday had trimmed prices to the day's
minimums. But once the New York market opened steadily,
London investors breathed a sigh of relief and propelled the
U.K. market higher.
   In addition, dealers suggested that institutions are still
cash-rich and hesitant to sell any stocks. Indeed, as the
market slipped to lower levels, traders said fund managers
and institutional investors were net buyers of British
equities.
   "There's a marked reluctance to sell," said one trader.
"The perception is growing that the U.K. is still one of the
cheapest and best-performing markets on a global basis."
   But dealers were quick to warn that participation remained
sketchy on the first full day of the new two-week trading
account. Moreover, some suggested that a cautious tone would
prevail until the end of the week when stock-index futures
and options expire.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
20 points to 2398.5, the day's best level and well above the
early morning 2361.2 minimum. Some dealers suggested that the
index looks set to pierce 2400 today.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index gained 16.4 points to
1929.4. Volume was a calm 379.1 million shares, compared with
the 497.8 million issues Friday.
   Interest rate sensitive stocks were better on weekend
media reports that suggested that U.K. interest rates could
be down to 12% by year end from the current 15%. Although
some market professionals suggested that this was too
optimistic a scenario in the near term, several sectors
dependent on interest rates were bolstered.
   Among these, builder Tarmac added 11 pence to 284 pence
(19 cents to $4.91), cement and building products group RMC
gained 12 pence to 689 pence, retailers Burton Group grew 11
pence to 169 pence, Kingfisher rose 7 pence to 372 pence,
while Marks &amp; Spencer rose 5 pence to 245 pence.
   Dealers said takeover speculation continued to bubble in
the composite insurance sector. Commercial Union Assurance
added 4 pence to 523 pence, General Accident advanced 11
pence to #11.19, Guardian Royal Exchange rose 5 pence to 246
pence, while Sun Alliance gained 3 pence to 332 pence.
   Tobacco and luxury products group Rothmans International,
set to disclose year-end results tomorrow, fell 14 pence to
760 pence after strong rises late this past week.
   Elsewhere, U.K. controls group Siebe fell 25 pence to 505
pence after saying it was to pay $656.4 million for Foxboro
Co., a U.S. supplier of process automation and control
equipment.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Brussels and Madrid; lower in Zurich; mixed in Stockholm and
Amsterdam; and unchanged in Milan. South African gold stocks
closed higher.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Seoul, Wellington, Manila and
Singapore, higher in Hong Kong and Taipei, and little changed
in Sydney.

   Turner Broadcasting's Goodwill Games
   Facing Olympian Obstacles to Success

   SEATTLE -- A fistfight between organizers. A litigious
Hungarian. Angry fishermen. Too little hype, too few
reservations and too many unsold tickets.
   The Goodwill Games -- Ted Turner and the cable industry's
answer to the Olympics -- appear headed for trouble three
weeks before they begin.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of course, that's what people once said about Cable News
Network.
   On July 20, many of the world's best athletes will convene
here for the second quadrennial Goodwill Games, Mr. Turner's
brainchild meant to foster superpower harmony while creating
17 days of high-profile programming exclusively for cable.
   So far, however, it's the games' problems that stand out
in bold relief. Hundreds of hotel reservations have been
canceled, ticket and advertising sales are cool, and both
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and the games' Seattle
Organizing Committee are expecting big losses. Though Mr.
Turner has never viewed the games as a short-term moneymaker,
a repeat of the 1986 fiasco in Moscow -- a $26 million loss
for Turner Broadcasting -- could doom the games with the
bottom-line-oriented cable operators who now control his
board.
   But one lesson learned from years of Ted Turner watching:
Never underestimate the man. His Cable News Network and
Turner Network Television channels were widely ridiculed
during their formative stages, but both blossomed into
thriving networks. No other live, international events are
scheduled during the Goodwill Games, so a few world records
and East-West grudge matches could draw a big global
following.
   And if things do work out, as Mr. Turner likes to say,
"How would you like to own the Olympics?"
   Turner Broadcasting executives aren't panicking. Mr.
Turner, the company's chairman, declined to be interviewed
for this article, but Paul Beckham, president of the Goodwill
Games and Turner Broadcasting's senior vice president of
finance and administration, says, "If we show progress both
financially and in the quality of the event, then I think the
board will go forward" with future games.
   Just what constitutes "progress" may be hard to figure. No
company has ever created a sporting event anywhere near as
grand as the Goodwill Games, so the benchmarks for success
aren't clear. Turner Broadcasting executives and board
members mention such intangible goals as the "excitement" and
"credibility" that the games can bring cable TV; they relish
the prospect of international media coverage and world
records. But audience ratings and ad revenue matter, too, and
U.S. viewers have never shown wide interest in such sports as
gymnastics, swimming and track outside of the Olympics.
   "The measurement for success is certainly, `Will people
tune in?' But it's also, `Will it be treated as a serious
sports event?'" says Brian Roberts, a Turner Broadcasting
director and president of Comcast Corp., the nation's
third-largest cable operator. "At a time when nobody is
saying too many nice things about the cable industry, it's
nice to do these things."
   At the moment, few people in Seattle are saying too many
nice things about the Goodwill Games. The event's
city-supported local organizing committee is running several
million dollars in the red, in part because of limits on the
advertising it can sell due to conflicts with national
sponsors lined up by Turner. Seattle officials are
threatening to withhold permits for the games unless
organizers come up with $310,000 for extra fire protection;
the games committee wants to pay $17,000.
   Moreover, local fishermen are fuming about having to miss
several days of prime salmon fishing in Shilshole Bay while
the Goodwill Games yacht races are held there. Hoteliers are
mad about Turner's recent cancellation of some 700 room
reservations, and they and other travel industry executives
criticize what they say have been lackluster efforts to
promote the games on the West Coast.
   "All of us overestimated the notoriety of the games
outside this market," says David Palmer, assistant vice
president of marketing for Alaska Airlines, which has booked
only half the tour packages for the games that it had
expected to sell. Sheila Hyman, a travel agent in suburban
San Francisco, adds, "People are confused as to what the
games even are."
   Some incidents have led locals to dub the event "the
Badwill Games." At an early planning session for the games, a
senior Turner Broadcasting executive decked a top official of
the Seattle Organizing Committee for badmouthing the Turner
organization. More recently, Ladislao Jajczay, a Hungarian
English student in Seattle, sued the games' organizers for
using a promotional photograph of himself dressed as a Soviet
basketball player. Mr. Jajczay, who says he didn't understand
what the photographer said when he posed for the picture,
says he hates the Soviet Union.
   Within Turner Broadcasting, the games have been beset by
management changes and some belt-tightening. Last summer,
Robert Wussler, Mr. Turner's right-hand man since 1980 and
the creator of the first Goodwill Games, resigned to become
chief executive officer of Communications Satellite Corp.'s
Video Enterprises unit. With Mr. Wussler gone and Mr. Turner
spending less time at the Atlanta headquarters, senior
management has focused more on stemming losses and less on
producing a show for the ages, executives say.
   "A little bit of the pizazz of the event left with Bob,"
says Rex Lardner, former director of programming for NBC
Sports and general manager of the Goodwill Games. "He was so
much of the heart and soul of the event."
   Budgets were cut, particularly for promotional efforts. As
recently as March, Turner's research showed that just one in
four male heads of households in the U.S. even knew what the
games were. Even so, Turner executives gutted plans to
advertise the event on non-company-owned networks and in
newspapers. Other public-relations campaigns were curtailed
as well, including a contest in schools and a multicity tour
by athletes.
   Had he remained with Turner, Mr. Wussler says, he wouldn't
have been so thrifty. "Whatever the losses are from the first
two sets of games, if the Seattle games are successful in
terms of media response, Ted Turner has another big hit on
his hands."
   Mr. Lardner says the promotional efforts are on track.
"Our big thrust will be on-air promos on our own four
networks," he says, adding that Turner's networks are now
airing one 30-second spot an hour on the games. "This is a
cable exclusive; we want to hit as many cable households as
possible."
   Another difficulty has been selling the games to
advertisers. Though several sponsors have signed up,
including PepsiCo Inc., Turner Broadcasting hasn't found one
willing to serve as the sponsor of the games as a whole, for
the big fee that could make the event profitable.
   "A number of sponsors are skeptical now," says Mr.
Lardner. "They want to wait and see" how the 1990 games fare.
   The company has had better luck with cable systems. To
show the games, the operators must pay a $1-per-subscriber
surcharge to Turner Broadcasting. So far, operators
controlling 80% of the 50 million or so cable viewers who
normally receive Turner's WTBS superstation have agreed to
air the games. It helps, of course, that Turner Broadcasting
is part-owned by cable operators that account for more than
25% of those subscribers.
   Nevertheless, Turner Broadcasting's expected loss from the
games continues to swell. The company originally said it
expected a loss of about $10 million on the 1990 games, but
it has already taken $13 million in charges to cover losses.
"Hopefully, it won't be too much worse than that," Mr.
Beckham says. "It could be."
   Other executives close to the company say the loss will
probably be closer to $25 million, not including so-called
make-goods, the commercial time that Turner Broadcasting must
give advertisers to compensate for any shortfall in promised
audience ratings. The company has guaranteed ratings of at
least 5% of U.S. households watching television during the
games -- though some Turner executives say they'll be content
if they can deliver 3%.

   Schools Sow Environmental Seeds Early

   Who says kids don't apply what they learn in school?
   Shortly after studying the merits of recycling in class
this spring, sixth-graders at Bel Air Elementary School in
New Brighton, Minn., demanded that the school cafeteria
switch from using plastic-foam lunch trays to washable ones.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the school board balked, the children staged a
cafeteria sit-in -- where a number of students were suspended
for refusing to return to class. Undeterred, the
sixth-graders appeared at the next school board meeting with
a presentation that persuaded the board to implement the plan
districtwide when school begins again in the fall, at a cost
of $145,000 for new dishwashers.
   It's the greening of America, 1990s style. A growing
number of schools, prompted in part by the 20th anniversary
of Earth Day in April, began teaching children to become
environmentally conscious -- as early as the first grade, in
some cases. "Things are swinging back from the attitude, `We
don't care' to `We have to care,'" says Pattye Hitchins, an
Earth science teacher at Glens Falls (N.Y.) High School.
   As the New Brighton school officials learned, it could
result in the next generation of consumers being much more
environmentally conscious than today's -- and force marketers
to modify their products accordingly.
   "Every week, it seems my daughter comes home with new
information," says Richard Seltzer, a lawyer in Montclair,
N.J., of his eight-year-old daughter, Joanna, who just
finished second grade. "`Daddy, I don't want you to put on
the air conditioner this year because it hurts the ozone
layer. . . . I don't want us to cut down trees because it
hurts the ozone layer.' She already knows about things I
never knew about until a few years ago, and I'm 40 years
old."
   Adds Kim Seltzer, an amateur cellist and Joanna's mother:
"She doesn't want us to use plastic bags for garbage. So we
use brown paper bags. When I made her lunch, I used to slice
an apple and put it in a plastic bag. Now we use aluminum
foil."
   No figures are available, but thousands of schools across
the country have worked environmentalism into the classroom,
usually in science courses but also in social studies,
English and other subjects.
   Florida, Maryland and Iowa are among states interested in
a five-year-old law in Wisconsin that requires public
schools, from kindergarten to 12th grade, to integrate
ecology into the curriculum. Wisconsin just established a
board that will distribute $200,000 annually to develop
environmental-education projects. On a national level,
Congress is considering a bill that would fashion and make
available an environmental-studies program for schools around
the country.
   The market for environmental-education materials is
growing, educators say.
   Delta Education Inc., a maker of science kits for
elementary school class experiments, began selling a kit
concerning environmental pollution and erosion 16 months ago.
The company says schools ordered 110 kits in the past few
months -- compared with just 65 in 1989. "For a topic that
we've never heard of before {for kits}, we're happy with the
sales," says Tom Richardson, the company's president.
   Some schools, of course, have taught children about the
environment for years. Since 1976, for example, third-graders
in the Jefferson County Public School System, in Lakewood,
Colo., have learned about the environment as part of their
45-minute daily science class.
   Still, contend educators, in the past three years the
subject has been approached much more seriously. "In the
mid-'70s, we did a lot of expedition stuff. We got kids
outdoors on trips. {Now} you don't see as much rafting or
other experimental education," says Harold Pratt, executive
director for science and technology curricula for Jefferson
County schools.
   In Wisconsin, considered a leader in environmental studies
because of its 1985 law, suggested topics include everything
from farmland preservation in social studies to endangered
species in science to noise pollution in physics. Each school
district is left to develop its own curricula. For
kindergarteners, that might mean a walk through the snow
looking for deer tracks; for eighth-graders, it might mean
writing to the Legislature to promote a recycling law as an
English assignment.
   At elementary schools in Dutchess County, N.Y., fifth- and
sixth-graders learn about ecology for one class period a day
for 10 weeks. Students study the ecology of their school
grounds, from types of leaves and insects present to habitats
of organisms in the soil to nonorganic factors influencing
the playgrounds. At Belmont (Mass.) Day School,
second-graders study whales and other endangered species.
Students learn about the whaling industry, why whales are now
endangered and why it's important to try to protect them.
   And at Glens Falls High School, a full-year course in
environmental studies will be offered next year as an
alternative to chemistry for some students. Ms. Hitchins, the
Earth science teacher there, describes her course's
three-week study of environmental concerns as "the most
important three weeks of the year." For part of their grade,
students are asked to "go and change the world" by
volunteering for an environmental project.
   But some educators argue that too much time spent studying
how to recycle aluminum cans or save electricity takes away
from critical subjects like English and history. "Some people
say, `This won't get my kids in Harvard,'" concedes Rustum
Roy, director of the Science Technology and Society program
at Pennsylvania State University and an advocate of
environmental education for grade schoolers.
   Furthermore, some parents argue that the approach taken by
many schools is too simplistic. Younger students aren't shown
the drawbacks of strict environmental laws, such as the
effect on products' costs or resulting job losses, and are
led to become self-righteous advocates of causes they don't
fully understand, one parent says. "I've talked to a lot of
other parents {who agree that some children are} being such
little prigs about smoking . . . and using air conditioners,"
says Liza Lunt, a lawyer in Arlington, Mass.
   Her eight-year-old daughter, Kate Doniger, and a friend
have decided to operate a lemonade stand this summer and to
send their earnings to Greenpeace, an environmental
organization. "I get concerned that children think that by
doing all these nice things right, they will be making a big
impact, when in fact corporate polluters are doing most of
the damage," says Ms. Lunt. She says children should be
taught that "radical changes are going to have to be made if
we are really going to have an impact on saving the
environment."
   Other parents contend that since their children's
generation will bear the brunt of most of the Earth's current
problems, it's never too early to begin preparing them for
it. With that in mind, preschoolers in Troy, Ohio, are
learning about recycling and the interdependence of living
things at the Brukner Nature Center, a nonprofit organization
that promotes environmental awareness.

   BERISSO, Argentina -- Daniel James picked up the phone to
call a friend in Buenos Aires, about 43 miles away. After
dialing and redialing for almost an hour, Mr. James, a Yale
University professor who is writing a social history of this
working-class town, did what many Argentines frequently do:
He got angry. "What's wrong with the phone?" he screamed.
   Summoning years of experience, his landlady peered out the
window and said: "It's strange. It's not windy today."

   If all goes as planned, a new wind will soon be blowing
for the Argentine phone system. And the government hopes that
instead of knocking the phones out, as wind often does now, a
fresh breeze of private enterprise will finally make them
work.
   Yesterday, the government of President Carlos Menem kicked
off its drive to sell off Argentina's loss-ridden
public-sector companies by receiving the final bids for
Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones, or Entel.
   Under the privatization plan, Entel is to be broken into
two companies, one covering the northern half of Argentina
and one the southern half, with each company getting half of
Buenos Aires, where almost two-thirds of the country's 3.2
million lines are installed. The government is selling 60% of
each company, with the remainder to be divided this way: 25%
to the public in stock offerings, 10% to Entel employees, and
5% to local telephone cooperatives. The bidding plan requires
paying a total of $214 million for the two companies,
assuming $380 million in debt, and buying back Argentine
foreign debt with a face value of at least $3.5 billion. The
winner of each company will be the one that delivers the most
debt paper above that minimum. With Argentine debt trading at
12 to 13 cents on the dollar, the minimum represents a
disbursement of between $420 million and $455 million.
   Telefonica S.A. of Spain offered $2.83 billion for the
southern zone of Entel and $2.41 billion for the northern
zone. Bell Atlantic Corp. of Philadelphia offered $2.33
billion for the northern zone; it didn't bid on the southern
zone. And STET of Italy offered $2.44 billion for the
southern zone and $2.2 billion for the northern zone. In all
cases, the offers include cash payments of $100 million for
the northern zone and $114 million for the southern zone,
with the rest in the form of assumption of debt and interest
payments.
   The bids far exceeded the government's floor prices for
both zones, blunting previous criticism that the setting of a
debt floor would drive bidders away, though other people had
alleged that Entel is being sold too cheaply.
   The government will announce the winners Thursday. It has
stipulated that no single company can acquire both the
northern and southern zones.
   Telefonica's partners in its bid are Techint of Argentina
and Citicorp, a New York-based bank holding company. Bell
Atlantic's partners include several small Argentine companies
and Manufacturers Hanover Corp., a New York-based banking
concern. Stet's partners include Perez Companc of Argentina,
Cable &amp; Radio of France and J.P. Morgan of New York, a
banking company.
   By July, the government also hopes to have sold Aerolineas
Argentinas and to have started the process to sell several
oil fields run by Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, parts of
the state railway system, road networks and energy plants. By
cutting its links to the inefficient, heavily subsidized,
public-sector industries, the government hopes to get rid of
an annual $5.5 billion drain on its finances, cut its $64
billion foreign debt by encouraging debt-for-equity swaps,
and show foreign investors it means business.
   For a Peronist government, such a U-turn from the statist
dogma of Juan Domingo Peron is revolutionary, says Jorge
Bustamante, a banker. But President Menem's clearance sale is
dictated more by necessity than conviction.
   With the country in the midst of a deep recession, the
near-bankrupt government has no alternative but to sell
assets if it wants to put its house in order. "There's
nowhere to get money," a foreign banker involved in the
privatization process says. "They can't finance themselves
from foreign creditors, there's nothing much left to
confiscate domestically, and they can't finance themselves
with inflation, because they would go straight to
hyperinflation. They need to do so much so quickly to really
restore confidence."
   The process is moving so quickly that, as is typical in
Argentina, it is confusing and messy. Bidders bow out. Rules
change in mid-process. Officials resign. Unions and
politicians obfuscate. As sale day approaches for Aerolineas
Argentinas, nobody knows how many bidders there will be -- or
even if there will be any. Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines has bowed out, and other bidders --
including Alitalia Airlines, Varig Brazilian Airlines, KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines and Iberia Air Lines of Spain -- have
requested more time.
   What's more, those who are bidding aren't quite sure what
they will get. "The idea is to privatize as quickly as
possible, rather than the best they can," says Roberto Ruiz,
international director of Banco Rio de La Plata and chairman
of Argentina Development Trust Co., a $1.3 billion debt fund
set up by 21 international banks to invest in the
privatization program.
   But Mr. Menem, wary of the credibility problem that would
arise from another delay, vows to stick to the schedule.
"We're doing this privatization under the worst possible
conditions," Economic Planning Secretary Moises Ikonicoff
acknowledges. "People mistrust the country, unions are
applying enormous pressure, and so are our foreign creditors.
This is the worst privatization in the world -- short of not
doing it at all."
   By beginning with Entel, Mr. Menem has picked a powerful
emblem of Argentine state enterprise -- and a symbol of its
woes. The telecommunications company has become the country's
second-largest concern after Yacimientos Petroliferos
Fiscales, with more than $1 billion in sales and 46,000
employees. Entel has also become a model of inefficiency, red
ink and red tape. It hasn't published a balance sheet since
1987, and estimates of its 1989 operating loss vary from
about $100 million to more than $250 million. "It's in a
state of collapse," says Maria Julia Alsogaray, the
government-appointed trustee who is running Entel until it is
taken private.
   Just how bad is the Argentine phone system? "Bad enough
that executives have cellular phones on their desk," says
Roberto Labarthe, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank in
Buenos Aires.
   Luis Cordoba, a Buenos Aires psychiatrist, waited 18 years
to get his phone installed and ended up paying $2,500 "to a
tailor who had a network" of friends at Entel who installed
the phone on the sly. "Otherwise, I'd probably still be
waiting," he says. Now, Mr. Cordoba's phone has been out of
order for almost a month, and he has little hope of someone
showing up to fix it soon.
   For a price, it is possible to get around this problem and
get a clandestine phone line or a "point to point" line -- a
connection to indispensable numbers, usually installed by
Entel employees on the side. "People come by and say, `Who do
you need to talk to?'" says Carlos Newbery, a businessman.
"And bang] A line goes out to four companies." These
clandestine lines are often stolen from someone else. "One
day, our fax machine went dead," Mr. Newbery recalls. "The
next day, we started getting someone else's faxes. What
happened is they'd sold our line to someone else and
reconnected us to someone else's line."
   Only about 10% of Argentina's population has phone
service. Though it has been estimated that Entel will need
about $5 billion in investment over the next 10 years, and
though the winner in the Entel privatization plan must agree
to increase the number of lines while progressively reducing
rates that are already lower than those in other nations for
local calls, the attraction is that so much needs to be done,
the opportunities for profits are big.
   Just by bringing in efficient accounting methods and
procurement procedures and combating fraud, "You have an
extraordinary windfall without doing anything," Mr. Ruiz, the
bank official, says.

   MILAN, Italy -- Italy's consumer prices in June are likely
to have risen about 5.6% from a year earlier, down slightly
from the 5.7% year-to-year increase in May, according to
provisional cost-of-living statistics from six major cities,
which usually reflect a nationwide trend.
   Local inflation indexes in June rose between 0.2% and 0.9%
from May and were up between 5.3% and 6.4% from a year
earlier. These figures followed monthly increases between
0.3% and 0.5% in May, when the year-to-year increases varied
from 5.2% to 6.5%. If the data are confirmed by the state,
inflation would be at its lowest level since December 1988,
when the consumer price index rose 5.5% from a year earlier.

   Who's News:
   Daiwa Securities Co. Names Yoneyama
   As the Chairman of Its U.S. Subsidiary

   NEW YORK -- Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. named Koji
Yoneyama as chairman of its U.S. subsidiary, and selected
Nobuo Yonetani to succeed Mr. Yoneyama as president of the
unit.
   Both men are considered internationalists. In addition,
Mr. Yonetani has a strong background in corporate finance, an
area that Daiwa plans to emphasize in the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Daiwa also has established a Delaware-registered holding
company for its U.S. operations, something that could allow
the Japanese securities firm to reduce the capital needed to
support mainline broker-dealer operations.
   The chairman's post has been vacant since January, when
Takuro Isoda returned to Tokyo to run a venture capital
company controlled by Daiwa. At the time, Mr. Yoneyama
assumed the chief executive's title and responsibilities,
which he is retaining. He came to the U.S. three years ago as
president and chief operating officer of the U.S. subsidiary.
   Daiwa executives said that Mr. Yoneyama has been
considered a rising star in the company ever since the early
part of the 1980s when he was appointed assistant to Daiwa's
executive board.
   The 51-year-old executive joined Daiwa out of college and
initially was a stock salesman in Sapporo, his home town. Mr.
Yoneyama's first overseas assignment came in 1971, when he
was transferred to New York for nearly 10 years. After that
he worked at the parent company's headquarters in the
international finance and investment departments, and in 1984
was sent to Zurich to head the firm's Swiss subsidiary.
   Mr. Yonetani, 50, is coming from London where he is deputy
head of Daiwa's European operations. He has been posted to
London twice and once to Australia.
   Noting that Mr. Yonetani has spent more than 10 years in
London where he "has been doing a lot of corporate finance
and investment banking business," Nobuaki Ohmura, an
executive vice president at Daiwa's U.S. unit in New York,
said: "He has a very strong background in this area" and
"right now, we are expanding our capital markets area. He has
good contacts with European and Australian borrowers and
Japanese institutions, too."
   Messrs. Yoneyama and Yonetani are both close to Masahiro
Dozen, who was named president of Daiwa's parent company in
October and who has voiced a strong interest in beefing up
the firm's overseas operations.
   A few weeks ago, Tokyo transferred $100 million to the
U.S. subsidiary, raising its capital to roughly $300 million.
The parent company has the equivalent of $6.2 billion in
shareholder equity, making it one of the most heavily
capitalized securities firms in the world.
   Mr. Yoneyama is enough at ease with Mr. Dozen to describe
his superior as someone who plays golf like a farmer, saying
that Mr. Dozen always digs up dirt when he hits the ball.
   Unlike several of its big Japanese competitors, Daiwa --
Japan's second-biggest securities firm behind Nomura
Securities Co. -- has shied away from making large
investments in U.S. specialty firms, such as those dealing
with money management, mergers and acquisitions, and real
estate. Instead, Daiwa has preferred to build from within,
but with mixed success.
   During the past few years, the firm became a primary
dealer in U.S. government securities and expanded its options
and futures businesses. But along with other big Japanese
brokers, Daiwa's U.S. operations have, at best, been only
marginally profitable. Specifically, the company had
difficulty expanding mortgage-backed securities and corporate
bond operations. And in 1987 and 1988, rising costs plus low
profits led to layoffs, which at one point cut the U.S. staff
to 330 from a peak of 430.
   Daiwa currently has about 370 U.S. employees and plans to
add 30 to 50 people -- mostly professionals -- over the next
year in the areas of mergers, real estate, foreign exchange,
mortgage-backed securities and capital markets. Two weeks
ago, the firm set up a capital markets operation, co-headed
by Stephen Bradley, a former Merrill Lynch managing director.

   Conde Nast Buys
   Cook's Magazine
   And Will Fold It

   Conde Nast Publications Inc. said it acquired Cook's
magazine with the intent of folding the publication and
adding its subscriber base to its own upscale food monthly,
Gourmet.
   Cook's joins the growing list of magazines that are either
closing down or being folded into other magazines in an
increasingly difficult advertising climate. Cook's is
published by Pennington Publishing Inc., a unit of the
Stockholm-based Bonnier Group, one of the largest media
companies in Scandinavia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Financial terms weren't disclosed.
   Cook's guaranteed to advertisers a circulation of about
225,000, but in the past year had failed in several issues to
meet that guarantee. At Cook's, close to 30 editorial and
sales staffers are expected to lose their jobs.
   A glossy, sleekly designed magazine started in 1979,
Cook's targeted well-heeled readers who liked to cook their
own gourmet meals and entertain stylishly. However, Cook's
has been unable to compete effectively in a crowded field
that includes such upscale epicurean magazines as Gourmet,
Knapp Communication Corp.'s Bon Appetit, American Express
Publishing Corp.'s Food &amp; Wine, and Telemedia Inc.'s Eating
Well.
   The factors leading to Cook's demise, however, aren't
exclusive to the food magazine category. Cook's Publisher Bob
Young said that like other consumer magazines, Cook's profits
were squeezed by aggressive rate negotiating on the part of
advertising agencies and their clients during a general
advertising slump.
   "Unlike past recessions in the magazine industry,
magazines are cutting whatever deal they can with
advertisers. Because of it, the revenues per page are
plummeting," said Mr. Young. "Even those magazines that are
on the crest are being pressured to offer deals."
   Small to midsized national magazines have been hardest hit
by rate negotiation coupled with slashed advertisers' ad
budgets. Last week, after losing as much as $10 million,
Metrocorp closed down Manhattan, inc. and combined its staff
with Fairchild Publications' M magazine. Other recently
folded magazines include Stern Publications' 7 Days, Time
Warner Inc.'s Southpoint, and CMP Publications' Long Island
Monthly. Several publications, such as Family Media Inc.'s
Taxi and Model, and New American Magazine Co.'s Psychology
Today, have suspended publication for now with promises to
readers and advertisers of being relaunched.
   "Our closing just reflects the tenor of the times," said
Cook's Mr. Young.

   CONDE NAST PUBLICATIONS Inc. acquired the subscription
list of Cook's magazine, and not the magazine as reported in
yesterday's edition. Cook's publisher, Pennington Publishing
Inc., had previously decided to close the magazine after
efforts to find a buyer failed.

   A Backward Glance From the Animal-Rights Future
   ----
   By Henry Grunwald
</HL>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A18
</SO>
<LP>
   In these opening decades of the 21st century, we all
remember the initial victories of the Animal Rights
Revolution over fur coats, those despicable symbols of
cruelty and wealth. This was relatively easy because the
wealthy are much given to guilt feelings. Somewhat more
difficult was the triumph over wool, leather and all other
materials and food derived from animals. Despite resistance
from sybarites and carnivores, human dress and diet gradually
came to be based on synthetics and plants. The movement
easily defeated a brief, left-radical assault by advocates of
Plants' Rights.
   Of course, we are still thrilled to recall the difficult
but successful campaign against allegedly "scientific"
experimentation on animals. Protests that many cures for
disease would be lost, and the potential human life span
shortened, were eventually drowned out. Moreover, who says --
apart from some misguided religious teachers and so-called
moral philosophers -- that a human life is more important
than an animal life?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The real breakthrough came in the late 1990s with the
realization that human language, too, was a gross violation
of Animal Rights. After all, what was language other than a
conspiracy to build a world in which animals could not take
part because they did not command the human tongue? No, it
was quite clear that human language had to be eliminated to
assure full animal rights.
   Journalists, other scribblers and academics resisted
furiously. Politicians, after a period of indecision, came
around, as they found that they could do quite well by
waving, shouting, grunting and making faces -- besides saving
a lot of money on speechwriters. Businessmen at first liked
the prospect of abolishing language (in a sense, they had
already done so by inventing the corporate memo). But they
soon discovered that numbers were part of language, and that
there could be no bottom line without it.
   The movement received decisive help from the young, who
enthusiastically favored raw emotion and instinctive action
without the stultifying interference of words and grammar.
   Today we have not yet stamped out language. But it is
confined to a small minority, including this writer, who use
it to chronicle the past. Most Animal Revolutionists believe
this is a futile and probably nefarious activity that will
cease before long.
   Meanwhile the supreme battle has begun -- the battle
against "civilization." Surely there can be no doubt that
civilization is merely a gigantic human plot to rob animals
of their birthright, of their natural habitat -- earth --
which they ruled as sole masters during the millennia before
that aberration called the human race made its appearance.
Cities, abominable engines for the exclusion and destruction
of animals, are shrinking. So is industry. Its decline, of
course, interferes with the production of synthetics,
pointing to nudity as the true way.
   We have ended the proliferation of technology, that
arch-enemy of animals who, in their blessed state, do not
understand it or create it. The automobile is a scarcely
remembered contrivance; fortunately it has not been replaced,
as some reactionaries hoped, by those ancient carriages that
outrageously exploit horses. If moving on foot is good enough
for animals, it is surely good enough for humans.
   Nature has reclaimed vast urban areas and, gradually,
animals are taking over the land that belongs to them. The
long-range solution surely is the disappearance of the human
species itself, leaving the earth to its rightful masters.
   It is amazing to think that, in the days of their modest
beginnings, Animal Rights Activists were considered by many
to be harmless cranks, at worst distracting attention from
urgent social and political problems. In fact, as we now
know, they embodied a revolutionary principle aimed at
nothing less than the overthrow of mankind, and of that most
horrible of its instruments, human intelligence.

food fear is largely a phenomenon among the upper middle

   AMSTERDAM -- Dutch retail sales in April increased a
provisional 6% from the year before, the Dutch Central Bureau
of Statistics reported.
   The 6% gain doesn't take into account increases caused by
inflation, which pushed prices 2.2% higher in April, compared
with April 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The strong rise in retail sales occurred despite the fact
that the long Easter weekend fell in April this year and in
March last year, the government said.
   Department store sales, however, fell 4.1%.
   The strongest growth came in the food sector, where sales
rose 7.7% from a year earlier. Sales in the non-food sector
advanced just 5.5%, but sales of household articles jumped
18.5%. Sales of flowers and plants rose 12.7% and drugstore
sales increased 10.7%.
   In the food sector, sales of meat were up 5.1%, sales of
groceries added 5.8% and sales of milk and dairy products
climbed 5.3%, the statistics bureau reported.

   For the Next 3 to 4 Years

   PARIS -- Groupe Michelin, whose $1.5 billion bid to
acquire Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. was approved by the U.S.
government in April, warned of possible renewed losses and
announced job cuts at its main central-France plants. The
news stunned analysts and sent the huge French tire maker's
stock plunging.
   Francois Michelin, the company's chairman, told a
shareholders meeting Friday that the company is in for three
or four difficult years because of a tight tire market and
heavy investment spending. He said he couldn't rule out
losses -- apparently as early as this year -- although he
said the investments would generate profit in the longer
term.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This comes as quite a shock to me," said Stephen Reitman,
an analyst specializing in the auto business at London
brokerage firm UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew. Because secretive
Michelin didn't announce the profit warning, news trickled
out through secondhand reports.
   "Obviously the acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.
is costing them, in this high-interest-rate environment," Mr.
Reitman said. "They are giving the first indications of how
bad the competitive pressure is in the tire business."
   Michelin union leaders said they had been informed that
the tire maker will eliminate 2,260 more jobs at five plants
near its central-France headquarters and at distribution
centers across France. These represent Michelin's fourth
round of job cuts since serious losses almost killed the
French company a decade ago. Michelin said it hopes to avoid
layoffs by encouraging workers to take early retirement, work
part time or, in the case of foreign workers, return home.
   Michelin's share price plunged nine francs a share, or
8.3%, closing in Paris at 99.2 francs ($17.68) in heavy
trading. Since the start of the year, Michelin's share value
has fallen more than 40%, as analysts warn investors that the
company's well-known preoccupation with the long term could
hold down profit and dividends for some time to come.
   UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew, for example, has been advising
investors since December to sell Michelin shares, Mr. Reitman
says. That advice, however, was based on an estimate that
Michelin would post a 1.5 billion franc profit this year,
down from about 2.45 billion francs in 1989. Mr. Reitman said
the warning of possible losses will accelerate share sales,
as shareholders realize that it is almost impossible to tell
how soon they will get a return on their investments.
   News of the chairman's profit warning was slow to trickle
out because the annual meeting was closed to the press. Some
French reporters attended as shareholders, however. Michelin
officials confirmed the general thrust of their reports, as
well as a union announcement of the job cuts. Michelin said a
text of the chairman's remarks on profits would be made
available later this week, and that until then details
wouldn't be available.
   French stock market regulations require listed companies
such as Michelin to issue a statement announcing any
development that could affect share price, but the
regulations don't currently permit any penalty if the company
fails to do so.
   The profit forecast reflects Michelin's tough policy of
pursuing long-term advantage, even at the cost of short-term
pain to shareholders. Because the Michelin family and its
allies control the company, they can afford to ignore
protests. The Michelins and many analysts believe the
company's long-term orientation helps explain its survival in
a market where more and more tire makers are failing or being
acquired by competitors.
   Although the company now is sharply limiting discretionary
spending, it is maintaining major projects that other
companies might have tried to cancel. Most prominent is the
more than $1.5 billion Uniroyal Goodrich acquisition, which
has just been approved by U.S. antitrust authorities. That
pushes Michelin sales clearly beyond those of both Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber Co. of the U.S. and Bridgestone Corp. of Japan,
making the French company the world's leading tire producer.
   But a Michelin official said that is only the start of the
planned investments. He said other expansion and upgrading
projects in the U.S., Asia and Brazil could actually cost
more than the Uniroyal Goodrich acquisition over the next few
years.

   PARIS -- The average unemployment rate for 16 of the
world's most industrialized countries rose to 6% of the work
force in April from 5.9% in March, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said.
   The latest result represents only the second time the
OECD's standard unemployment rate has risen since a general
downward trend emerged in 1986 to bring the rate down 1.8
percentage points over three years. But the organization said
the rate has been steady at 6% since last December, except
for the March decline to 5.9%.

   MAYNARD, Minn. -- At the Lutheran Church here, some
families refuse to worship in the same pew. Elderly farm
women no longer get together once a week for coffee. Boyhood
friends shun each other.
   Resentments are eroding even the most enduring rite of
rural life, the wave hello. Farmers sometimes pass on
Chippewa County 17 without even a nod of acknowledgement.

   What caused this rupture? Sugar.
   Residents of this heartland hamlet (population 428) are
embroiled in a modern-day range war, this one pitting the
"beeters" -- the sugar beet growers -- against their
grain-farming neighbors. Many farmers fume that the rich
beeters are getting richer at their expense -- thanks to
preferential treatment by the federal government.
   Across a broad swath of southern Minnesota and elsewhere,
beeters, flush with sugar profits, are outbidding other
farmers whenever land is rented or a farm is sold. They are
driving up land prices and rents, and crowding less fortunate
farmers off the land. "We've lost a whole generation of young
farmers," asserts Owen Gustafson, a Maynard grain grower and
a leader of Fair Farm Policy, a group protesting "inequities"
of sugar subsidies.
   The protests extend to international trade negotiations
and Congress, where the sugar program is under sharp attack
as lawmakers debate the 1990 farm bill. Arguably, it's the
sweetest deal in American agriculture: The government props
up domestic sugar prices by curtailing imports of lower-cost
sugar. Producers are guaranteed a "market stabilization
price" of 22 cents a pound, about nine cents higher than the
current world market price.
   The result: Although some other crops are also subsidized,
sugar beets often bring growers four times more per acre than
wheat and corn. Large beeters here reap $100,000 to $200,000
each in annual sugar benefits. That's not money from the
government, but from consumers in the form of higher prices.
Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana claims this "hidden
tax" costs consumers $2.4 billion a year -- although sugar
growers contend the figure is far-fetched.
   "That's super-welfare -- that isn't a safety net," says
Thomas Hammer, chief lobbyist for major sweetener users,
which are allied with Fair Farm Policy in seeking cutbacks in
sugar price supports.
   Counters Irvin Zitterkopf, president of Southern Minnesota
Beet Sugar Cooperative: "We aren't making as much as some of
the people using our products, like candy makers and cereal
people."
   For the farmers in this area, the debate taking place in
Washington couldn't hit closer to home. "What we're trying to
do is save our hides," says 51-year-old David Hovda, a
Renville County cattle feeder. "They {the beeters} have
really been endowed by the government. . . . They're going to
drive us all out."
   In Maynard and nearby Clara City and other small towns,
widespread fear for the future, edged by envy of wealthy
neighbors, is turning farmer against farmer, family against
family -- even dividing families.
   Marvin Freiborg, a member of a large family of beet
growers who himself worked with hogs, assailed the sugar
program two months ago in a letter to the editor of the Clara
City Herald. "I've kept quiet longer than I should have," he
wrote. "I'm tired of watching the majority of beet growers
outbid neighbors on land, expand their operations year after
year, drive nice pickups, buy new equipment. . . ."
   "My mom was just disgusted with me," says Mr. Freiborg,
who had to give up his land last fall when his landlord
raised the rent. "But I told the truth about what's
happening. I had an awful lot of people call me, thanking me.
They're just too timid to speak out."
   The range war has been building for several years. It
broke out into the open here when Mr. Gustafson, 39 years
old, went to Washington early last year to protest the sugar
program. He and his brother, Philip, have lost three pieces
of rented land totaling 488 acres to higher-bidding beeters
since 1985.
   Driving home one night, Mr. Gustafson passes a gently
swelling field, 160 acres of soft black earth under a canopy
of stars. He and his brother had rented it for $63 an acre
per year. It was sold last year, and the new owner rented it
to a big beet grower from the town of Sacred Heart for more
than $100 an acre. "There's no way we can pay that," he says.
What's more, the Gustafsons aren't members of the local
cooperative, so they can't profitably switch to growing sugar
beets.
   Accompanying Mr. Gustafson to Washington was an equally
feisty neighbor, Ronald Carpenter, 43, who says that when he
showed up at a land-rent auction here at LaRae's Cafe, alone
among 20 beeters, "They laughed at me. They knew I couldn't
afford the cash rent. I bid just to run up the price."
   Soon after the men returned from Washington, vandals broke
into Mr. Carpenter's machine shed while he and his family
slept. They dumped sugar into the gas tank of a tractor and
spray-painted farm equipment with graffiti like this, still
emblazoned on the side of his old pickup: "We Love Sugar."
   On Maynard's main street, business at the Hair Affair, the
beauty salon run by Mr. Carpenter's wife, Mary Ann, has
fallen 50% from last year because of a boycott by some wives
and daughters of beeters.
   Her mother-in-law's coffee klatch has broken up. "She used
to have coffee once a week with neighbor ladies," says Mrs.
Carpenter. "They had been friends for 40 years. They just
stopped calling."
   The dispute is two-sided. "One farmer purposely sprayed
herbicide so that the wind would drift it into the end rows
of a beet field and kill the beets," says the Rev. Martin
Scott Lucin, co-pastor of Immanuel Lutheran Church in Clara
City.
   Nobody is more troubled about the schism than the
small-town ministers, who have been trying to help the
antagonists better understand each other. In a sermon last
year, the Rev. Ronald Duty, pastor of the Maynard Lutheran
Church, admonished his parishioners: "When we are jealous of
another's prosperity or greedy for their land, instead of
helping them to preserve their economic livelihoods . . . we
do damage to the human community."
   But for now, neither side is in the mood for
reconciliation. Mr. Lucin recounts a farmhouse visit last
year to a man dying of cancer: "He looked out the window and
he vowed, `The sugar beet guys aren't coming over here even
after I'm gone.'"
   Wayne Schwitters, a Clara City beet grower, telling of a
lost friendship with a local farmer, chokes up and looks
away: "Him and I can't talk in church."
   The rancor saddens Mr. Schwitters, one of the biggest beet
growers in an area homesteaded a century ago by immigrant
sodbusters, mostly from Scandinavia and Germany. "I feel
sorry for those people raising corn and soybeans," says the
48-year-old farmer. "I think in reality corn and beans are
way too cheap, and they are having a tough time."
   Sugar also is making things tense in the Red River Valley
along the Minnesota-North Dakota border. "Wheat farmers are
starting to hate sugar beet growers," says Jacob Bakke, an
elevator manager in Prosper, N.D. "It's unfair that they are
just breaking even and the beet growers are making big
bucks."
   And in southern Louisiana, the expansion of sugar-cane
planters is raising tempers in Cajun country. "These guys net
more than I can gross per acre," complains Bill Burley, a
soybean grower in Youngsville, La.
   Economic dislocations from the sugar program extend far
beyond the Farm Belt. To guarantee U.S. sugar cane and beet
growers the market-stabilization price, the government
slashed imports of raw sugar to 1.25 million tons last year
from four million a decade ago. Critics of the sugar program
say this has deprived numerous sugar-producing nations in the
Caribbean, Latin America and Far East of export earnings,
harmed their economies and caused political instability,
while increasing Third World demand for U.S. foreign aid.
   At home, the sugar program has helped make possible the
spectacular rise of the high-fructose corn syrup industry --
to the point that Americans now consume more corn sweetener
than refined sugar. The syrup industry itself is not covered
by the U.S. program. But by pegging their prices just below
the sugar support price, corn-sweetener producers captured
not only market share but huge profits.
   Sugar producers contend that the program protects U.S.
consumers from wild swings in world sugar prices while
shielding the producers from the sugar-dumping practices of
exporters, particularly the European Community, which heavily
subsidizes production.
   Minnesota and North Dakota beet growers say they wouldn't
mind fending for themselves in a free market, but only if all
sugar producers were put on equal competitive footing around
the world.
   The sugar program is under broad attack. At the urging of
Australia, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has
decreed U.S. sugar-import quotas illegal. The Bush
administration appears ready to phase out the sugar program
and other forms of protectionism in its quest for a
breakthrough GATT agreement to end trade-distorting farm
subsidies.
   In Congress, strong bipartisan support is building for an
overhaul of the sugar program, beginning with a 10% cut in
sugar price supports.
   Opposing change is Big Sugar's lobby and its phalanx of
political-action committees, long fabled on Capitol Hill for
their generosity. From 1983 through mid-1989, sugar and
corn-sweetener lobbyists supported their pitches to members
of Congress with $3.3 million in campaign contributions,
according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission
records by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a
Washington-based consumer group.
   That's a lot of money from about 10,000 beet growers in
the Midwest and the West; 1,000 cane producers, dominated by
a few big sugar planters and corporations in Florida,
Louisiana and Hawaii; plus a handful of sugar processors and
corn refiners. But they can afford it.
   Two of the biggest beneficiaries of the sugar program are
the U.S. Sugar Corp. and the Cuban-born Fanjul family of Palm
Beach, Fla., led by Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, who contributed
$100,000 toward Republican campaigns in 1988 alone, and his
brother Alfonso, who is similarly generous toward Democratic
Party endeavors. Between them, U.S. Sugar, based in the sugar
mill town of Clewiston, Fla., and the Fanjul corporate empire
control more than 60% of Florida's cane acreage and produce
more than 25% of the nation's cane sugar. Together they
collected what the sweetener-users group calls a "windfall"
of $180 million in sugar benefits last year.
   Here in southern Minnesota, beet growers such as Mr.
Schwitters say that other farmers could be growing beets if
they hadn't passed up chances to buy shares in the Southern
Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative in 1974, when it was
organized, and four years later, when it was rescued from
ruin by a government-guaranteed $11.5 million bailout.
   To grow sugar beets, farmers must join the cooperative,
which is the only processor in the area. But for most
farmers, the cost of joining -- currently at $900 per share
-- is prohibitive, and the number of shares available is
limited. (Typically, one share entitles a farmer to plant one
acre of beets.) Many of the transactions occur between
members of beet-growing families. With the future of the
sugar program in doubt, other farmers would have trouble
getting financing for a new co-op.
   Mr. Schwitters's rewards for taking the initial risk? A
diamond-studded stickpin in his tie. A 3,800-acre farming
operation, including 1,700 acres of beets. Seven hired hands
and seven families of migrant farm workers. A big house with
two-story cathedral ceilings and a veranda where, his wife
Jan says, "it's fun to sit and see the crops coming up and
the migrants working out there."
   Similarly rewarded are 330 other co-op shareholders. Last
year, they reaped an estimated $35 million in sugar
price-support benefits.
   Wheat, corn and some other crops are subsidized, but they
aren't protected by federal import controls as sugar is. A
Fair Farm Policy study of Minnesota farm data calculates that
the beet growers made an average profit of $206.40 an acre
from 1984 through 1988 -- about eight times what corn and
soybeans brought in at $25.53 and $25.94, respectively.
   The beet growers say that profit figure is greatly
exaggerated, although Mr. Schwitters concedes that beeters
earn more per acre than other farmers. "By golly, if I
didn't, I'd quit," he says. "It's a lot more work. It's a
specialized crop."
   The beet growers also maintain that local land prices and
rents haven't gone up nearly as much as the opposition says.
"Yes, there are rents in excess of $100" an acre, says
William Rudeen, a beet grower near Bird Island, Minn., and
current cooperative chairman. "But we're too small to have
the impact they say we have."
   Their neighbors also are irritated that the beeters, in
addition to sugar benefits, also collect wheat and feed-grain
subsidies for the part of their land devoted to those crops.
   But while the government limits subsidized grain acreage
each year to try to prevent surpluses, beeters can plant as
many beets as the cooperative's plant in Renville can
process. The result: Sheltered from foreign competition to a
great extent, they have expanded their beet acreage over 50%
since the cooperative started.
   The disparity deepens the local rifts, and merchants are
under pressure to take sides. "It's a tough fence to sit,"
acknowledges one farmer, Rolan Ammermann. His father-in-law,
a Clara City insurance agent, was aghast to hear from a beet
grower that Mr. Ammermann was baling oat straw for the
beeters' arch-foe, Ron Carpenter. Alarmed about appearances,
his father-in-law called him up. "It's got real tense for a
while," says Mr. Ammermann. "I just told him it's a business
deal."
   Also caught in the middle are landlords, including retired
farmers and widows. One young farmer, Randy Berends, has been
all but dispossessed because he can't afford to rent his
retiring father's 320 acres at $105 an acre. All he figures
he can afford is $70.
   "You can't blame the landlords for taking top dollar," he
says. "It would have been crazy for Dad to rent to me."

   Your May 16 page-one article on the return of the Cornish
language says, "Only one other lost tongue has been
successfully revived to everyday use -- Hebrew -- and it had
the full weight of the state of Israel behind it."
   Hebrew was never a lost language in the sense that Cornish
was. While Hebrew fell from conversational use for more than
a thousand years, throughout that time it continued to be the
language of religion, study and intellectual dialogue, much
as Latin had been in Western civilization up to the 16th
century. All educated Jews could read and speak at least
enough Hebrew to get by in synagogue. It did not require "the
full weight of the state of Israel" to bring it back to
colloquial use, but, like the Cornish, only the will of the
people who lived there.

   MACON, Ga. -- Charter Medical Corp., the giant psychiatric
and acute-care hospital chain that was once the picture of
corporate health, is beset by serious ailments.
   Consider:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- Federal health-care investigators are examining the
company for possible Medicare and Medicaid fraud. James
Cottos, regional inspector general for investigations for the
Health Care Financing Administration in Atlanta, said the
probe, which was initiated about 45 days ago, is focusing on
whether the company inflated its Medicare and Medicaid bills
for in-patient psychiatric hospital care.
   -- The company is reeling from the recent announcement of
a $35 million special charge, the result of a pervasive
accounting sleight of hand by employees, whom the company
says were apparently trying to make the bottom line look
rosier. In the midst of a special audit of the matter by the
company's outside auditors and attorneys, William A.
Fickling, chairman and president, fired, among others, James
D. Daher, executive vice president, hospital operations. Mr.
Daher, who reported directly to Mr. Fickling, says he was
unfairly blamed for the problems, though no reason was given
for his dismissal.
   -- Employee morale is slumping, particularly since the
abrupt dismissal earlier this month of 600 workers, 3% of the
work force, in an effort to cut soaring expenses. Some people
were informed of their dismissal by telephone, though Charter
insists it was only a few.
   -- Charter's basic business, psychiatric care, has taken a
turn for the worse. Expenses are up. Hospital occupancy rates
have fallen. And insurance companies and employers have
targeted psychiatric hospital care as a top priority for
reducing the ever-growing cost of employee benefits.
   Any downturn in business is particularly ominous for
Charter, which is shouldering a heavy load of $1.6 billion in
debt incurred in a 1988 leveraged buy-out by Mr. Fickling and
senior management.
   Charter's junk bonds have taken a beating recently as a
result of the special charge and concerns about prospects for
Charter's basic operating business. Several high-yield bond
analysts believe the company is headed toward a restructuring
of its debt.
   Yesterday, prices of the company's junk bonds fell sharply
on news of the Medicare-Medicaid investigation. Bids dried up
in the morning. Late yesterday Charter's 14.25% subordinated
debentures due in 2002, were being offered at 21, down three
points, or a loss of $30 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The 14% senior subordinated debentures were offered
at 38, down six points.
   Charter has found itself under fire in the past, but
primarily for its unabashed bottom-line orientation and
highly aggressive marketing, particularly for adolescent
psychiatric patients. "This is the first time these guys have
had to deal with roadblocks or even substantial obstacles to
making money," says George Pillari of Health Care Investment
Analysts Inc., Baltimore.
   Details of the Medicare and Medicaid fraud investigation
remain sketchy. However the inspector general's office said
yesterday that it initiated the investigation after someone
made allegations of fraud related to reimbursement for
psychiatric hospital care under Medicare and Medicaid. The
probe is apparently focusing on whether the company
improperly billed the programs for its home office expenses.
"At this point, it's just an allegation that has to be
resolved," said Mr. Cottos, of the inspector general's
office. He said the scope of the alleged impropriety had yet
to be determined.
   For fiscal 1989, Charter said it received 15% of its
psychiatric hospital care revenue from Medicare, the federal
health care insurance program for the elderly and disabled,
and Medicaid, the federal-state program for the needy, aged,
blind and disabled and low-income families with children. The
company said it is cooperating with the authorities.
   The Medicare-Medicaid probe comes as Charter is struggling
to recover from the revelations this spring about its
accounting irregularities. Charter said a large number of its
hospitals (it won't say how many) were reporting monthly
financial results in a way that significantly underestimated
their bad debts, or uncollectible receivables, and failed to
properly take into account contractual allowances that reduce
revenue. It says, in addition, expenses were improperly
deferred, for example, by capitalizing advertising costs
rather than listing them as expenses.
   It isn't clear how long the ruse went on. Charter, which
booked the $35 million charge in its second quarter, says
much of the problem occurred in the first six months of this
fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Robert F. McCullough,
managing partner of the Atlanta office of Arthur Andersen &amp;
Co., Charter's outside auditor, says some of the inaccuracies
were traced to 1989 and that, indeed, warning signs of a
problem of inadequate reserves turned up during the year-end
audit last fall.
   However, some evidence suggests the problem may have
started long before then. Three managers, a hospital
administrator in Texas and two controllers, who were
dismissed from Charter in 1987 say they were pressured by
corporate-level colleagues to understate bad-debt reserves.
The administrator complained to the Securities and Exchange
Commission in October 1987.
   "At the hospitals, we called it `Dialing for Dollars,'"
says the administrator. Adds Rick Miller, who says he was
fired as a controller at Charter's Cleveland, Texas,
hospital, "What they were telling us to do was to falsify the
bottom line."
   Charter acknowledges that the SEC made an informal
investigation of the company's records in 1987. But Robert
Miller, an outside attorney for Charter, says by late 1987 or
early 1988, "The company received information from the SEC
that it was not going to take any action."
   Now, however, the SEC's interest seems again to be piqued.
While it doesn't appear that a formal investigation is under
way, an SEC official last week called the former Texas
hospital administrator with more questions, in an apparent
effort to re-examine the issue, he says. Charter officials
say they have no knowledge of an SEC probe. The SEC declined
to comment.
   In an interview, Mr. Daher says he "did not condone" the
accounting irregularities and was "devastated and humiliated"
when told of them. He speculates that extreme pressures on
hospitals to meet targets, particularly during difficult
times, may have spawned the problem. "Charter hires
overachievers, people who want to excel and do well," he
says. "Perhaps the environment got too tough, and rather than
not keep up, perhaps they hedged a little bit."
   Indeed, Charter recently revamped its bonus-incentive
program that rewards workers who meet targets so it is based
in part on cash brought into a hospital instead of net
income. The idea is to quell the temptation to fudge results
and to improve the collection of receivables, says J. Rodney
Laughlin, executive vice president, human resources and
development.
   Beyond the accounting woes, Wall Street analysts say,
Charter may have difficulty servicing its debt in the face of
insurers' efforts to reduce the length and cost of
psychiatric care. For instance, while hospital admissions
rose 20% in the latest quarter, patient days rose only 8% and
expenses soared 26%. Most significantly to a company with
heavy debt, Charter's operating cash flow in the second
quarter, even adjusting for the special charge, was $53
million, far short of the $78 million in the year-earlier
period.
   That figure is "well below what they need and what anybody
expected," says Amil Schiaffino, an analyst with Wertheim
Schroder &amp; Co.
   C. Michael Ford, chief financial officer, says Charter
stands by its statement in its quarterly report saying it can
meet its debt payments. But he wouldn't elaborate or provide
the company's basis for its belief. Restructuring its debt
would be "very painful" and "something that would have to be
given serious thought" before being acted upon, says Mr.
Ford, adding that such a move isn't imminent.
   As a result of the tough times, Charter is slashing costs.
In addition to the layoffs, the company has revised downward
its capital expenditures budget for this fiscal year by 30%
to $140 million from $200 million.
   Both moves, however, could end up hurting the company in
the long run, analysts say. The layoffs, for instance,
included most of the corporate marketing department, an
office that Charter has long depended on to help fill
hospital beds. And the lowered capital expenditures, while
still allowing Charter to complete construction of 10
hospitals this year, may curtail future expansion.

   Gold Prices Rise
   On South Africa
   Bank Disclosure

   Gold prices rose after South African Reserve Bank Governor
Chris L. Stals disclosed that the bank has actively supported
the market in recent weeks.
   That disclosure, along with another that Brazil has been
selling a lot of gold this year, briefly illuminated some of
the behind-the-scenes machinations in the global gold market.
But though traders found the information interesting, many
didn't think such intervention efforts would affect long-term
price trends.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday in London, gold rose $3 an ounce to $351.40 in
the morning fixing and then $2 more to $353.40 in the
afternoon fixing. On New York's Commodity Exchange, futures
contracts rose $3.40 an ounce, with the June delivery
finishing at $353.80.
   South Africa's Reserve Bank entered the market following
large-scale sales by a Middle Eastern bank earlier this month
that pushed prices as low as $340 an ounce, Mr. Stals said in
an interview with Dow Jones International News Service at a
gold conference in Venice.
   Gold tumbled June 14 when the National Commercial Bank of
Jeddah dumped several tons on the London market. But the
price partially recovered later that day after buying by
central banks, according to London dealers.
   Mr. Stals said South Africa's central bank would continue
to support gold if further big sales threaten to push prices
sharply lower. But, he acknowledged, "We cannot do too much
because we do not have the foreign-exchange reserves at our
disposal."
   Besides direct purchases by South Africa, the Bank of
England also could have bought gold on behalf of the Soviet
Union, said Edwin Arnold, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch
Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith in London. As the largest gold
producers, South Africa and the Soviet Union have a vested
interest in stopping prices from falling, he said. Moreover
large quantities of their gold are deposited as collateral
with Western banks, he said, and lenders don't want the
security for loans to collapse.
   Meanwhile, at the same Venice conference, it was learned
that Brazil's central bank has sold about 100 metric tons of
gold for dollars on the world market so far this year. Emilio
Garofalo Filho, director of the central bank's department for
international reserves operations, said the sales were part
of a gold-for-dollars arbitrage program implemented by the
Brazilian government in February. The aim, he said, was to
reduce gold smuggling operations, which accounts for more
than 50% of the country's gold output.
   Brazil is attempting to stop smugglers from illegally
taking gold out of the country, selling it for hard currency
and then leaving the proceeds deposited abroad. To remove the
incentive for smuggling bullion out of the country, Brazil
has been buying gold domestically -- in local currency,
cruzeiros -- at above-market prices. The central bank then
unloads the bullion on world markets.
   However, international bankers said that Brazil's central
bank at times also intervened in global bullion markets to
support the price of gold. Brazil's major motive, said the
bankers, is to buoy gold prices just long enough to allow the
central bank to take advantage of gold's firmness and dispose
of some of its excess holdings at higher prices.
   Betty Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, said Mr.
Stals's disclosure should come as no surprise. "When we had
the last big sell-off, there were rumors at that time that
central banks were prepared to intervene in the market at
some price level," she said.
   Ms. Raptopoulos also noted that the announcement last week
of a $3 billion loan from West Germany to the Soviet Union
could be positive for the market. "This loan could reduce the
Soviet need to sell gold in order to pay Western creditors,"
she said.
   August Arace, co-manager of the Freedom Gold &amp; Government
Trust, an open-ended mutual fund that specializes in
government debt instruments, bullion and gold mining shares,
said he has long assumed that central banks in South Africa,
the Soviet Union and, on occasion, the United Kingdom, enter
the gold market from time to time to make purchases to
support prices. But he added, "Make no mistake about these
moves. They are short-term, and there is no evidence that
they have ever been able to change the direction of a trend."
Mr. Arace added that in a rising market, these banks may also
sell to capitalize on such a move. "In such cases they sell
to gain foreign exchange."
   Although central banks hold about 29,000 tons of gold,
they don't take concerted action to support the price,
bullion dealers said. Some trade gold, however, and depending
on the price, buy or sell marginal quantities.
   To be sure, central banks sold an estimated 280 tons last
year, said Samuel Montagu &amp; Co., a London bullion bank. South
Africa was among the sellers, disposing of 12 tons, the bank
said. Belgium sold 127 tons, Mexico 47 tons and Canada 32
tons.
   The South African Reserve Bank became more active in the
bullion market during the past few years, a London bullion
manager said. It makes use of the options and futures market
and sometimes withholds supplies or purchases a few tons of
gold to stabilize the market, the bullion manager said.
   But because it isn't in a position to buy significant
quantities, he said, it pays for the bank to publicize
possible purchase intentions to ward off potential sellers.
   Mr. Arace of the Freedom Gold fund said gold prices have
been in a downward price trend for the past 10 years. "I
think the outlook for gold is negative," he said. "There is a
real question in my mind when the bull trend will resume."
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures for July
delivery rose sharply in active trading on fears that a heat
wave spreading across the Midwest this week may damage the
recently planted soybean crop and reduce yields at harvest
time. July soybean futures jumped 13.25 cents a bushel to
close at $6.1275 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. July
corn futures prices also climbed in step with the rising
thermometer, adding five cents a bushel to close at $2.87 a
bushel. Late plantings for both crops in many areas because
of above-average rainfall this spring resulted in shallow
root systems that could be damaged by the early summer heat
wave, said Richard Loewy, president of AgResource Co. in
Chicago. Temperatures will shoot into the 90s this week
across Iowa and other Midwestern growing regions as a high
pressure ridge spreads into the area from the Southwest, said
Harvey Freese, co-founder of FreeseNotis Weather Inc. in Des
Moines, Iowa. But Mr. Freese said his company predicts that
cooler, wetter weather will return to much of the Midwest as
early as next week. The soybean rally appeared to be based on
traders "jumping to the conclusion" that this year's wet and
cool spring will be followed by a long, hot summer, which
happened most recently in 1983, Mr. Freese said. Next week's
forecast ought to cloud such predictions, he indicated.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices at the New York
Mercantile Exchange declined despite a rally during the final
half-hour of trading. Volume was exceptionally light. High
inventory levels have damped buying enthusiasm in recent
days. Only technical factors have kept prices from descending
lower. Even reports that oil workers might strike Sunday and
shut down Norway's operations in the North Sea did little to
prompt buying. In the gasoline and heating oil pits, however,
prices advanced slightly over Friday's levels.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices declined in reaction to slowing
auto sales and an expected sluggish summer economy, some
analysts said. According to Prudential-Bache's Ms.
Raptopoulos, the market has been swept with rumors concerning
the London Metals Exchange inventory figure, which will be
released this morning. Initially, it was projected that
stocks would begin a sharp rise with today's numbers, but
later traders were expecting stocks to be unchanged. The
market should have been buoyed by stories that the labor
negotiations between Asarco and its union aren't going well,
said Ms. Raptopoulos. The contract expires at the end of the
month. And a senior vice president at a major wire producer
said his industry is experiencing a serious contraction. "It
started in mid-May, and now it is hitting us right square
between the eyes," he said. He said distributors to whom his
company sells wires tell him that their customers are being
squeezed by a credit crunch. He also pointed out that major
U.S. copper producers who had been buying copper from others
to fill customers' orders are no longer doing so. "I expect
some of this copper to wind up in {New York's Commodity
Exchange} warehouses." That means producers would be
delivering copper against contracts they had sold on the
Comex rather than buying the contracts back to nullify them,
which would buoy prices. Short sellers can deliver a physical
commodity to fulfill a contract sold short.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Prices continued the rally they started on Friday.
Because yesterday was the first day holders of short
positions in the July contract could give notice that they
intend to make delivery, the contract traded without the
usual two-cents a pound daily limit. The July contract gained
2.27 cents a pound to finish at 84.77 cents. The October
contract, which bridges the end of one cotton season and the
beginning of another, and the December contract, which
reflects new-season cotton, both rose by less than one cent a
pound. Thomas Mueller, senior cotton analyst at Merrill Lynch
Futures in New York, said the July contract is being driven
by a lack of availability of certificated stocks of cotton
for delivery. "However," he noted, "the October and December
contracts are clearly responding to heat and moisture
problems in west and south Texas." He said these problems
could reduce non-irrigated cotton plantings by as much as
450,000 acres. He said he expects the rally in December
cotton to run out of steam at about the 76-cent level because
"at that price demand for cotton from abroad will diminish
significantly." Mr. Mueller added that domestic and
international mills are suffering from declining margins as
the price of yarn has failed to keep up with the rising price
of raw cotton. "U.S. mills lost $47 million after taxes in
the first quarter. They will do worse in the second." Mr.
Mueller said.

   Yen Weakens as Asian Investors Aquire
   More Currencies With High Interest Rates

   NEW YORK -- The yen weakened as Asian investors,
discouraged by yet another decline in the Tokyo stock market,
added to their stockpiles of currencies buttressed by high
interest rates.
   The retreat of the Japanese unit pushed the dollar higher
against most other major currencies as well. Comments by U.S.
Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger near the end of
the trading session caused the dollar to lose some of its
earlier gains, traders said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Seger told the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in
Washington that she favors "some easing" of U.S. monetary
policy in part to bring down the price of the dollar.
   Yesterday's clear winner, however, was the Canadian
dollar. The first world trading session since the collapse of
the Meech Lake constitutional accord should have been the
currency's worst hours. Instead, the much-maligned Canadian
currency bounced back from some early selling and actually
ended higher against the U.S. dollar.
   Based on yesterday's performance of the Canadian dollar,
commented Valerie Walker, corporate foreign exchange manager
for Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in New York, the government
of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney deserves "kudos" for its
efforts to reassure financial markets on the crisis.
   The yen, meanwhile, is being hurt by a diverse, seemingly
unconnected, set of circumstances.
   Weakness on the Tokyo stock exchange has helped sour
investors on the yen. The Nikkei stock average fell 570.38
points Monday, or 1.74%, following a 392.70-point drop
Friday. But traders noted that the dollar rose past the
psychologically important 155-yen level during Australian
trading, before Japanese stock trading began in earnest.
   If the Nikkei is the excuse to sell the yen, low Japanese
interest rates are the prod. The Japanese currency has been
the prime victim of a market whose recent directionlessness
has led Asian investors to seek their profits from
interest-rate differentials rather than currency
appreciation.
   "Investors are seeing not too much happening with the
dollar, so they are going for the yield," said Dan Brooks,
chief dealer for Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York. And as for
who is scuttling the yen, Mr. Brooks said, "I think it's
mostly the Japanese doing it to themselves."
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6770 marks, up from 1.6745 marks late Friday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 155.35 yen, up
from 154.85 yen in New York late Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 155.25 yen; it closed Monday in Tokyo at 155.62 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6820
marks, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.6790 marks.
   Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager for Kansallis Osake
Pankki in New York, noted that the U.S. dollar has been
reaping gains from the troubles in Canada that might
otherwise have been expected to go to the yen. Japanese
investors, who had been heavily involved in Canada, have
withdrawn some of their assets, he said.
   But rather than bringing money home in the form of
repurchased yen, Mr. Soria said, the investors are seeking
out both interest rates higher than Japan's and a safe haven.
The U.S. fits the bill, according to dealers.
   Ms. Walker of Harris Trust said the market will now watch
whether yesterday has established a new trading range for
dollar-yen. "The question is: Are we about to form a new
basis of support for the dollar at 155 yen or is this going
to be a one-day aberration."
   On the one hand, Ms. Walker said, the New York market
didn't try to take the dollar any higher against the yen than
it traded in Tokyo and never tested buying interest at 156.10
yen, the next important point on technicians' charts.
   On the other hand, Ms. Walker said, when dealers tried to
swing the dollar back below 155 yen, the support level of
155.15 yen held fast.
   The yen was also buffeted by non-dollar cross trading,
especially against the mark and Swiss franc. The West German
currency rose as high as 92.95 yen before profittakers moved
in, traders said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $353.80 an ounce, up $3.40. This was the
highest close in almost two weeks. Estimated volume was a
light 1.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $352.75 an ounce.

   If the quote from Rep. Patricia Schroeder in your May 16
Notable &amp; Quotable is accurate, then Rep. Schroeder is
woefully ignorant of the historical role of business in a
capitalist society if she believes the role of corporate
America is to act as a public service rather than to buy and
sell its businesses. In fact, the role of corporate America
is to do business profitably and legally by acting in its own
best interest, which may or may not involve buying and
selling its businesses. This proper corporate behavior has,
for the most part, proved mutually beneficial to the public
and the corporations, and has provided the greatest good for
the greatest number of people.
   Rep. Schroeder must be talking about the role of business
in the Soviet Union, where, philosophically, business acts as
a public service and has helped produce the standard of
living the Soviet people enjoy today.

reassuringly from the lips of a parade of successive senior

   If Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. ever decides to stick with any
strategy long enough to see it work, the power of that
venerable merchandising organization will be awesome. But in
fact, Sears has tinkered with so many, often-conflicting,
strategies since the early 1970s (and earlier) that it should
come as no surprise that it is struggling in today's hostile
competitive environment.

   Edwin Wilson is, of course, correct in noting that the
production each year of 200 new plays at theaters all across
the U.S. makes the task of Pulitzer Prize drama jurors a
difficult one ("Good Regional Play Points Up Bad Pulitzer
Problem," Leisure &amp; Arts, June 14). Like Mr. Wilson, the
Pulitzer Prize Board is keenly aware of this situation and
continually seeks ways to ensure that regional theater is
covered as thoroughly as possible. For some years now it has
encouraged its drama jurors to travel at board expense to
regional theaters that appear to have particularly promising
offerings. And this year, in keeping with a decision taken
last November, it has increased the number of drama jurors
from three to five in order to make possible a broader
geographic representation.
   Between these measures and the fact that as professional
critics our drama jurors can reasonably be presumed to be
aware of what is going on at theaters in their various
regions of the country, I would submit that the Pulitzer
selection system is a good deal more equitable and
comprehensive than Mr. Wilson recognizes.

   TORONTO -- Canadian financial markets recovered from an
initial sell-off yesterday following the demise of the Meech
Lake constitutional accord.
   Analysts said a rebound in the Canadian dollar triggered a
positive response in the bond and equity markets. They
predicted that Canada's relatively attractive interest-rate
yields will continue to support the Canadian dollar in coming
weeks, overriding lingering anxieties about the future of the
Canadian union.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The wide interest-rate spreads {between Canada and the
U.S.} look ever more attractive now that the Canadian debate
about the Meech Lake accord has gone out of the air," said
Edward Carmichael, an economist at Burns Fry Ltd. in Toronto.
   The Meech Lake accord, aimed at meeting demands of mostly
French-speaking Quebec and defusing independence forces in
the province, failed over the weekend after two provincial
legislatures adjourned without ratifying the proposed
constitutional amendment.
   Yesterday, Montreal was a sea of blue-and-white Quebec
flags as a good-natured crowd of about 200,000 watched a
parade marking St. Jean Baptiste Day, the French-speaking
province's "national" holiday. Lined up 10 deep in places
along the three-mile route, Montrealers smiled and waved and
at times chanted, "We want a country. We want a country."
   Canadian market sentiment was boosted by a report that
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. affirmed its Triple-A rating on
Canadian government debt and Double-A-minus rating on
Quebec's debt. Moody's Investors Service Inc. also said it
would maintain its Double-A-3 rating on Quebec debt.
   But Standard &amp; Poor's said it changed its outlook for
Quebec's long-term debt to "developing" from "positive"
because of political uncertainty. "While S&amp;P expects no
change in the relationship between Quebec and Canada in the
near term, ongoing discussions of constitutional reform could
become increasingly divisive," the rating agency said.
   The Canadian dollar began the trading day in Asia, falling
swiftly to 84.20 cents from 84.85 cents late Friday in
Toronto. But it ended higher at 84.95 cents.
   The Canadian 20-year bellwether bond ended down 1/2 point,
or 50 Canadian dollars lower for every C$1,000 face amount,
to 10.62%. But with U.S. bonds also falling, the Canadian
issue improved against its American counterpart, narrowing
its premium over the U.S. 30-year bellwether bond to 206
basis points from 209 basis points on Friday. A basis point
is a hundredth of a percentage point.
   Canadian equities also declined but by little more than
the U.S. stocks measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-composite index lost 16.56
points to 3474.16 points. Volume was light at 15.5 million
shares.

   NEW YORK -- Bond investors drove prices lower as they
worried about too many bonds coming to market. The stock
market tagged along, with an additional negative nudge from
some bad earnings news.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell nearly a full
point, or $10 for each $1,000 of face amount, in light
trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 12.13
points to close at 2845.05, also on thin trading. The dollar
rose against the West German mark and the Japanese yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Roberta D. Olson, fixed-income portfolio manager at Banc
One Asset Management Corp., said bond prices were poised for
a decline anyway, because they had risen to the point where
buyers were starting to show resistance to further gains.
"We're in a technical range, and we got something fundamental
to make it move down in that range," she said.
   In addition to the heavy Treasury auction schedule, the
"something" included a jump in commodities prices, mainly
grains and gold, which often are interpreted as signaling
stepped-up inflation that erodes the value of fixed-income
securities. Also, the prospect of huge government-note
auctions later this week kept many buyers on the sidelines.
   Stock prices attempted an early rally following Friday's
sharp decline, with investors looking for bargains among
battered blue chips. But the rise in bond yields that
accompanies lower bond prices, and which lessens stocks'
appeal to investors, cut the gains short.
   Adding to stock investors' anxiety were negative earnings
surprises. Caterpillar announced "substantially lower" 1990
profit expectations, largely because of a sharp decline in
results for its Brazilian unit. Also, a Shearson Lehman
Hutton analyst lowered his second-quarter earnings projection
for Quantum Chemical, citing weaker-than-expected sales of
polyethylene.
   In currency trading, the dollar gained against the mark,
primarily because traders were dumping marks to buy Swiss
francs, attracted by higher Swiss interest rates, said Eric
Lehtis, senior dealer at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank. The dollar
fell against the franc.
   Against the yen, the dollar rose because Japanese
investors are worried about signs of rising inflation in
Japan, not because they want to own dollars long-term, Mr.
Lehtis said. Buying dollars is an easy way to get out of the
yen on the way to other currencies.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell in light trading, with 133.1 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Declining issues far outnumbered advancers, 1,049 to 496.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.56%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6770 marks and 155.35 yen, compared with
1.6745 marks and 154.85 yen Friday.

   CHELM, Poland -- "I'm going to ask an indiscreet
question," Jan Pietrzak says into the microphone at center
stage. "Who saw me in the 1970s?" He barks: "Hands up]"
   Out on the peeling wooden benches of Chelm's amphitheater,
50 cheerless miles from the Soviet border, the audience
titters. "I mean, please raise your hands," Mr. Pietrzak
says, now patronizing instead of terrorizing. A few hands go
up. "I'm not surprised. I was rationed then. Is there a
combatant who saw me in the '60s?"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Not a hand rises this time.
   "Ah, the most frightened generation. Won't admit to
anything. Believe me, you are free to laugh." A hand finally
waves in an upper tier. "There's one] Thanks to you, you who
came to see me, I survived until today -- without subsidies,
without a telephone] You'll never get rid of me now]"
   The audience breaks into applause.
   It has been 16 years since Jan Pietrzak's troupe last
played Chelm, during a brief lapse of Communist vigilance. In
those days, he was lucky to get the show out of a private
apartment and into a basement coffeehouse. No wonder he needs
moral support from his fans today. Poland gave communism the
boot a year ago, but the spectacle of a political revue in
the Chelm amphitheater on a hot Saturday afternoon still is
too bizarre for Mr. Pietrzak to believe.
   Poland's famously censored satirist looks out at a crowd
of small-town Poles -- 2,500 of them -- who have come in
their finery, with bags of strawberries and scads of kids,
for two hours of songs, skits and stand-up comedy. Behind
him, across the backdrop, the Communists have left a memento
of their deadpan reign. "Motherland is Our Cause," reads a
slogan in giant red letters. As Mr. Pietrzak's joke goes, it
doesn't specify which motherland.
   "After so many years -- in Chelm again," he exults,
striding on stage, past the piano and drums, for his opening
monologue. "The last time I came to Chelm it was in the
Polish Peoples' Republic. This time it's in the Republic of
Poland. The people have been in power for so long, they've
disappeared]"
   In blazer and tie, with gray hair and trimmed moustache,
Mr. Pietrzak, at 53, looks a lot less somber than his old
fall guy, the general in dark glasses, but not nearly so
chipper as his hero, the union leader from Gdansk. If
politicians have it tough in Poland's new republic, political
comedians have it tougher. With the Communists out, Mr.
Pietrzak has lost his shtick.
   Just getting to see his act used to be an achievement.
Today, a state entertainment agency produces it. And the
people of Chelm may be hicks, but they're no fools. They
expect new material.
   The Poles had an analogy for communism's phony freedom:
Democracy is to socialist democracy as a chair is to an
electric chair. Now, Mr. Pietrzak has an update for last
year's dissidents: It's easy to sit down, but a lot harder to
get up.
   The old system was a comic's playground, a gag that had
already been running a decade when Mr. Pietrzak began working
the student clubs in 1957. He didn't exactly opt for
political satire. In the ubiquitous state he couldn't avoid
it. As he likes to say, "You'd sing a song about parsley, and
they'd think it was about them."
   Unamused, the Communists kicked him out of the clubs in
the mid-1960s and confined him to a coffee shop that seated
only 50. In the mid-1970s, they banned him altogether. He
passed the hat on the apartment circuit until Solidarity
bloomed in 1980 and he became its jester. He got on
television, entertained the strikers with classic one-liners:
"In the Sahara, socialism would run out of sand." And he
wrote Solidarity's anthem, "Let Poland Be Poland." An
American TV special picked it up; Ronald Reagan wrote a nice
letter.
   Martial law landed him back underground, then into the
coffee shops again, with a table booked for the censors at
every show.
   But now what? The revolution has taken away the fun of
telling anti-Communist jokes that Communists don't get.
   Somehow, as he lays into old enemies at the amphitheater
in Chelm, Mr. Pietrzak's lines seem shaded by rancor and
pity. When he sings "Let Poland Be Poland," it sounds more
sentimental than defiant. Beside the stage, his underground
tapes and videos are on sale, repackaged as his "archives."
Is Jan Pietrzak's cabaret in danger of becoming a nostalgia
act?
   Not if his first post-Communist troupe can help it. "I
welcome all generations," Mr. Pietrzak announces, bringing on
stage a young comic, Marek Majewski, who lets the audience in
on the cabaret's troubles with a song that goes: "You have to
hit them] Ridicule them] Flog them]"
   "Right," Mr. Pietrzak interrupts. "It's easy to say. But
who do you hit?"
   "It used to be simple," sings Mr. Majewski. "It was
obvious who made it hard on us. But now it's not them who
have the power. It's -- "
   "Us]" Mr. Pietrzak shouts.
   That calls for an adjustment. In a democracy, political
satire can't just flog the losers. Accustomed to siding with
the good guys, Mr. Pietrzak has to force himself to pick up
the whip.
   Solidarity does have its easy marks. Even Lech Walesa
himself commands an uncommon talent for triple-talk. As Mr.
Pietrzak cracks, "One day Lech thinks the government is good.
The next day he thinks the government is bad. And on the
third day, he denounces what he said on the previous two
days."
   The audience breaks up, but this approaches hallowed
ground. A few things are still sacred in Poland. Mikhail
Gorbachev, for one, is too dangerously lame to be an object
of fun. The Poles have another raw nerve right now, but is
there a comedian in the world who can swear off jokes about
the cost of living?
   Every comic on Mr. Pietrzak's card takes a potshot at
Poland's crash into capitalism.
   Marek Majewski: "Soon Poland will be a country of rich
people, because the poor will die of hunger."
   Krzysztof Jaroszynski: "I saw some people walk out of a
grocery with their mouths wide open, like fish in an
aquarium. This is what I call price shock."
   Pawel Dluzewski: "They say everybody should set up a
business. A lot of people believe it -- so they open shops,
they open post offices. They do it at night. They aren't
afraid of risk]"
   "So many funny things," Mr. Pietrzak tells the audience.
"The price of tickets -- isn't that funny?" At $1.50 apiece,
the people of Chelm aren't laughing. "I'm very amused. Two
tickets for half a liter of vodka. That's what I'm reduced
to. Such an artist]"
   His circumstances, kidding aside, are even slimmer. Mr.
Pietrzak has never dwelled on money; he's been pleased to
perform. A master at talking his way out of police stations,
he is less able at negotiating a contract. For this day's
work, he and his cast will share a fee of $300. The state,
producer of the show, still gets the last laugh.
   After the finale -- a rousing song that boosts cabaret as
the one true guide to Polish politics -- Mr. Pietrzak can
hardly bear to let his paying customers go.
   "Was it worth it?" he calls after them as they depart.
"Will you come next time? It's important]" They applaud in
the affirmative, and he tosses out his closing line, yet
unchanged for the new Poland: "See you in better times]"

   Southern Co. Says
   Dispute Settled
   For $300 Million

   ATLANTA -- Southern Co. said its subsidiaries will receive
about $300 million, before taxes, in a settlement with Gulf
States Utilities Co. over disputed power sales contracts.
   Southern Co., the giant utility holding company, said the
proposed settlement will be made in the form of a financial
package, including cash, common stock and deferred payments.
The company said it couldn't estimate the effect on earnings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gulf States, based in Beaumont, Texas, said the settlement
was in the best interests of its shareholders. The
four-year-old dispute "was like a dark cloud hanging over us,
preventing us from looking into the future," a spokeswoman
said.
   Gulf States said its cash outlay would total $167 million.
Of the remaining $133 million, $68 million is in an escrow
account, and the balance will be paid in the form of six
million new shares of Gulf States common stock.
   The spokeswoman for Gulf States said the company expects
to take an after-tax charge to net income of between $110
million and $115 million in 1990. In 1989, Gulf States posted
a loss of $45.5 million, or $1 a share, on revenue of $1.6
billion.
   The dispute began in July 1986. Gulf States, which had
contracted to buy approximately $1 billion in electricity
from Southern Co. over a 10-year period beginning in 1982,
asked Southern Co. to consider renegotiating the contracts
because energy demands had fallen below predicted levels.
When Southern Co. declined, Gulf States filed suit in U.S.
District Court in Beaumont. Southern Co. countersued in
December 1988.
   No hearings had been scheduled for the suits. Both cases
were still in discovery.
   Southern Co.'s president, Edward L. Addison, said in a
statement, "We're pleased that we've been able to resolve
this contract dispute in out-of-court negotiations and come
to terms that protect the long-term interests of our
companies."
   As collateral for future payments, Gulf States said it
will pledge the Lewis Creek Generating Plant, a 520-megawatt
gas-fired facility near Willis, Texas. Gulf States will also
provide Southern Co. with transmission access to the plant at
a rate approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
   The settlement is subject to several contingencies,
including approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Southern Co. said the settlement will terminate the contracts
and end litigation between the parties.

   We hope someone in the Bush White House is supposed to
keep an eye on budget politics beyond the Beltway. While Mr.
Bush's no-new-taxes pledge still stands as a robust political
strategy, some big-state electorates -- California, New York,
New Jersey -- are encountering the kinds of solutions that
politicians devise to address the universal phenomenon of a
bloated public sector: Increase the tax burden. If the White
House miscalculates the terms of a budget deal with Congress,
it may antagonize voters already steamed up at the economic
policies of their own states.
   In California, a July 1 budget deadline is causing a
meltdown over deficits. The Republican Governor is a lame
duck, and a Democratic legislature must lead in choosing
between taxes and spending.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A conference committee in Sacramento has begun searching
for a way to make the revenue-growth line as steep as the
expenditure track, which right now has been spotted a $2.9
billion lead for next fiscal year. The Democratic leadership
insists that categories such as welfare have to keep rolling
along at double-digit yearly rates of increase.
   Two leading Democrats in the legislature have boldly
spelled out plans for a $2.3 billion tax hike. Half the
revenues would come from increasing the top personal income
tax rate back to 11%, where it was before the state conformed
to federal tax revision and eliminated many deductions in
return for a 9.3% ceiling on rates. This higher bracket would
cover income from all sources that exceeds $100,000 for an
individual, $200,000 for a joint return.
   Meanwhile, in New Jersey, Democratic Governor Jim Florio
has steamrollered his own tax increase through the
legislature. Under newspaper headlines this past weekend
proclaiming "State's biggest tax hike," stories described a
$2.8 billion tax package. Taxes will go up on individuals
with incomes above $35,000 and couples above $70,000. The
highest tax bracket will be doubled to 7%. A higher sales tax
of 7% will now extend to a wide range of previously untaxed
items and services. (Part of the proposal includes plans to
offer property-tax relief to some people.)
   During the Reagan years, one of the rationales for cutting
taxes and tax rates was to create economic incentives for
individuals to work harder or more innovatively; in return,
government wouldn't claim such a large share of the new,
additional dollars. It is intriguing to compare this
philosophy with what is driving these state efforts.
   In California, Johan Klehs, who heads the Assembly's tax
committee and is one of the sponsors of the new tax plan,
happens to have supported the 1987 rate reductions in
California. He and other Democrats liked the primary effect
of those changes: to cut the tax burden for low-income
residents. Moreover, they were projected to increase the
taxes paid by the rich. And indeed, they apparently did just
that. Mr. Klehs admits, "Actually, personal income tax
revenues have done quite well."
   Now, having defoliated many of the tax havens, Mr. Klehs &amp;
Co. want to expose the high-income-earners to the old steeper
rate. History suggests they won't get as much revenue as they
think from this ploy, as creative tax attorneys find new
loopholes. But this kind of bait-and-switch politics may also
poison future attempts to broaden tax bases and reduce rates,
a trend that economists across the political spectrum have
encouraged because it reduces the distortions of the tax
code. California's tax boosters also have in mind a rise in
business taxes to 9.6%, where the rate was before the 1987
changes. The state's Democrats point to unpopular spending
cuts as the alternative.
   In New Jersey, much of the money collected annually from
the higher income taxes will be redistributed through a
complex formula among city school systems that the Governor
believes operate at a financial disadvantage to suburban
schools. So far the new taxes and school-spending scheme have
produced an outpouring of bitterness and resentment among
voters who believe they are the plan's losers. In any event,
the Florio philosophy, rooted in sharp class distinctions,
marks a break with the incentive-based economic policies of
the recent past.
   Meanwhile, of course, both New York City and New York
State are well along the path to raising taxes significantly
to pay for their public-sector commitments. Coincidentally,
the New York Times last week carried an article about young
Long Island couples who are increasingly thinking of moving
to Florida, partly to escape their high taxes.
   So far, a string of presidential vetoes by Mr. Bush
suggests he is sensitive to the dangers of loading the
economy at the federal level with more costs. However, the
revenue side of the Washington fiscal equation remains open
for negotiation. If Washington now adds to a tax burden
already building again in economic bellwether states such as
New York, New Jersey and California, voters in elections from
now through 1992 may go looking for politicians and parties
to tag with the blame.

   Hitachi Ltd. and Motorola Inc., under pressure from a
court deadline this week in their patent squabbles, have
decided to try to work them out on their own.
   The two companies said they have agreed in principle to
discussions aimed at ending a dispute involving the Hitachi
H8/532 microprocessor and the Motorola MC 68030
microprocessor.

   "This is not a final agreement," a Hitachi spokesman said,
and it isn't expected to bring about a swift resolution of
the 18-month-old litigation. "Hitachi would like to see an
agreement in two to three months," he said.
   Nor would it resolve any of the other intellectual
property and technology disputes in which the two electronic
giants have long been embroiled, the spokesman added.
   A spokeswoman for Motorola, Schaumburg, Ill., said she
couldn't discuss any details of the negotiations.
   "As to what's on the table right now, we can't talk about
any of it," she said.
   The microprocessors at stake in the suit are lucrative
sources of revenue for the combatants.
   Hitachi doesn't sell the H8/532 yet in the U.S. However,
it represents about 1% of Hitachi's world-wide semiconductor
revenues, or $30 million. And Hitachi had counted on
extending its marketing of the H8/532 to the U.S. in the near
future, the spokesman said.
   Motorola's market-leading MC 68030 microprocessor is used
in powerful machines made by Apple Computer Inc. and
Hewlett-Packard Co.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Hitachi
closed at $95 a share, down $1.75 from Friday's close.
Motorola closed at $84.125 a share, down $1.875.
   On March 29, a federal court judge ruled that neither
company could manufacture or distribute the disputed products
in the U.S. because each side is infringing, the Hitachi
spokesman said.
   Motorola, for its part, obtained a temporary stay of the
injunction against product sales. Last week, however, a judge
vacated that stay in a setback to Motorola, which promptly
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
   That stay of judgment is due to expire Friday, increasing
the pressure on both companies to reach a settlement out of
court.

   There is some comfort to the news that China has allowed
the flight into exile of two of its leading dissidents,
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian. Both have
been brave and patriotic advocates of democracy in China.
When the Chinese regime trampled the Tiananmen uprising last
June, Mr. Fang and his wife were forced to take refuge in the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where they have lived the past year
under siege. It's likely they'll find life easier in England,
where they reportedly have been granted asylum.
   This silver lining hardly seems reason for the U.S. to
have hailed Mr. Fang's departure as "a humanitarian action"
by China's Communist regime. His release takes place under a
thundercloud of repression that continues to cast its shadow
across the 1.1 billion people of China.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Why must Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian flee China at all?
Their only "crime" was that their calls for democracy drew a
huge following among China's people. Such bravery remains a
counterrevolutionary crime in China. Indeed, the special
exemption from China's "laws" just granted to the Fangs helps
to underline the arbitrary nature of government in China,
where there is no law other than what suits the Communist
Party's convenience.
   China's regime congratulated itself yesterday via the
official state newswire, Xinhua, for giving "lenient
treatment" to Mr. Fang and his wife. There is no leniency,
however, for champions of Chinese democracy who are less
famous in the West. One of Mr. Fang's precursors, Wei
Jingsheng, remains in prison, serving the 15-year sentence
imposed in 1979 after he published his eloquent essay, "The
Fifth Modernization -- Democracy." Many who took part in last
year's protests also remain in prison, such as student
leaders Wang Dan, if he is still alive, and Liu Xiaobo.
   China's official explanation for Mr. Fang's release
included a reference to Mr. Fang having been allowed to go
abroad for "medical treatment." It's too early to confirm
this explanation. But we do know that what's truly ailing in
China is the centrally planned economy. The Party has chosen
to sacrifice economic growth in favor of tighter state
control over people's daily lives. It hopes to alleviate some
of the pain with foreign money. The decision to let Mr. Fang
leave for "medical treatment" seems well-timed to influence
the imminent annual meeting of the world's seven leading
industrial nations whose agenda will include government loans
to China.
   If the G-7 ministers or President Bush want to create
genuine standards for reform in China, they will have to look
beyond the release of political hostages such as Fang Lizhi.
Real political reform would mean that people such as Messrs.
Fang, Wei, Wang and Liu could live freely in China and
present their democratic arguments to the Chinese people. It
would mean that dissidents could form political parties to
compete with the Communists without fear of being jailed or
shot.
   The sad truth is that even if China were to expel every
dissident the West has ever heard of, such actions would not
necessarily reflect a basic change in the country's
totalitarian system. Mr. Fang's fate this past year became
one of the symbols of repression in China. Freeing only the
symbol tells us mainly that China has so stifled dissent at
home that it can now devote some energy to buffing its public
relations abroad.

   U.K.'s BET Believes Buying Small U.S. Firms Pays Off
   ---
   Its Numerous Acquisitions Here Show
   Reasons for Strong Foreign Interest

   Although many foreign companies have bought U.S. concerns
in recent years, few have snapped up so many small,
entrepreneurial firms as London's BET PLC.
   Since 1982, BET has laid out some #225 million ($389
million) for 30 small- and medium-sized private American
companies, all in BET's basic business of supplying support
services to industrial, commercial and public-sector
companies. Among other things, BET companies erect
scaffolding, pick up garbage and clean hospital laundry; they
even do windows.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A look at BET shows why big foreign companies are rushing
to buy small U.S. ones. But it also shows that not every U.S.
company can hope to enjoy a windfall by becoming a foreign
company's target.
   "We buy a small fraction of what we look at," says
Michelle A. Prouix, vice president for corporate development
at BET Services Inc., the company's principal American unit.
"We take every target through such a rigorous process that a
lot of them fail on a number of points."
   Like many foreign companies buying in the U.S., BET aims
to build an international reputation in businesses in which
it is established elsewhere. To do this, BET and others
believe it's essential to establish operations in the U.S.
Though highly competitive in most industries, the U.S. is
large enough and rich enough to justify the risks of entry,
foreign executives say.
   Moreover, many European executives especially like the
U.S. entrepreneurial management style, which they see as
"bottom-line oriented, aggressive and lean-and-mean," says
Martin Sikora, editor of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions newsletter in
Philadelphia.
   In some industries, such as drugs, computers and
automobiles, globalization is necessary for survival, Mr.
Sikora says. But companies outside these groups are
increasingly interested in foreign operations, too. "National
borders have become less and less relevant to many companies,
even when there's no pressing need to go global," Mr. Sikora
says.
   BET, for one, has expanded in several European, Asian and
African countries as well as the U.S. and Canada. ("We're the
largest unknown company in the world," quips Clyde E. Walton,
BET Services' managing director.)
   And BET has found no better way to grow than buying small
enterprises. After all, competition in most of BET's chosen
fields is extremely fragmented. The top five companies in a
given region and field commonly have only 20% of the market
among them. Often, the other 80% of the market will be
divided among dozens, or even hundreds, of tiny firms, BET
says.
   As for the companies acquired by BET, they lose their
independence but often can grow faster because of the
availability of financing from their new parent. Consider
what happened after BET acquired Saf-TGreen of California
Inc., a scaffolding company in City of Industry, Calif., for
about $24 million. Mr. Walton says Saf-TGreen then went on a
$110 million spending spree of its own, buying out some
rivals.
   Besides buying U.S. companies directly, BET picked up some
U.S. operations along with European acquisitions, and it has
started up some new U.S. units. Now BET has 60 "strategic
business units" in this country. "We've reached critical mass
in our chosen business lines," which are maintenance, waste
services, scaffolding and distribution, says Mr. Walton.
   Like many acquirers, BET seeks strong companies with a
record of generating earnings. "We've never been turnaround
specialists," Mr. Walton says. "We've always specialized in
buying good companies."
   BET, along with many other foreign acquirers, places a
strong emphasis on maintaining management continuity in a new
and often unfamiliar market. "If the management doesn't want
to stay, in most cases we aren't interested," Mr. Walton
says. "And if it's truly a one-man show, we're not
interested." (In exceptional cases, he concedes, it may be
advantageous to buy a small company anyway, rather than let
it go to a competitor.)
   What BET says it is not looking for is risk, and the
potential liabilities are what stop some deals from going
through. Ms. Prouix says BET walked away from one transaction
"at a late stage" when the target -- a laundry company --
couldn't prove it hadn't been pouring toxic chemicals down
its drain.
   In addition, BET says it won't buy any company at a price
that would dilute the parent company's share earnings,
however slightly, for even one year.
   In most of its markets, BET is in a position to be choosy:
There are plenty of potential targets. If one deal falls
through, another will always be possible. But competition has
been so fierce in some fields that even BET has been daunted.
In the waste-management field in this country, for instance,
Waste Management Inc. and Browning-Ferris Industries Inc.
"took out anything that moved," leaving few targets for BET,
Mr. Walton says. "We looked very carefully, and we decided
that the entry costs were too high," he adds.
   Even when it has a wide range of targets, of course, BET
doesn't always hit the mark. In two cases, it had to change
the management of acquired units. "In one case, there was a
problem of keeping a former owner motivated when we had just
turned him into a multimillionaire," Mr. Walton says.
Although he had cleared all the acquisition hurdles, this
manager proved to be a poor performer for BET.
   And in a few cases, BET has divested itself of assets.
Some textile-rental businesses failed to meet performance
targets, for example, and BET had second thoughts about the
business niche. "That was a product-mix issue," Mr. Walton
says.
   Having attained the "critical mass" it was seeking, BET
says its acquisition pace is greatly slowing down. But Mr.
Walton says the buying will never entirely stop. "Family
businesses have kept our entrepreneurial approach alive," he
says. "That's an invaluable contribution."

   Newly Named Top Chase Bank Officials
   Plan to Trim Operating Expenses by 8%
   ----

   NEW YORK -- Faced with falling earnings, Chase Manhattan
Corp.'s newly named top managers said they plan to slash
operating expenses by at least $300 million, or about 8%,
over the next six to 12 months. The move could lead to as
many as 3,000 layoffs, according to some Chase executives.
   In a memo distributed yesterday to all officers, Thomas G.
Labrecque, Chase's chairman-designate, and Arthur F. Ryan,
president-designate, said the $300 million in cutbacks are
prompted by a financial climate that is "as difficult as any
in the history of the global financial-services industry."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The nation's second-largest banking company hasn't
determined how many jobs will be eliminated out of its global
work force of 41,600 employees.
   The cutbacks are expected to fall across all departments,
though European corporate finance has been identified in
particular as one vulnerable area because of weak profits.
One high Chase officer said, "Nothing will escape the knife."
   The last time Chase made a concerted effort to trim its
payroll was in 1987, when 1,280 employees took early
retirement.
   The memo follows last week's announcement that Willard C.
Butcher, Chase's chairman and chief executive officer, will
retire in September, several months earlier than expected, in
order to give Messrs. Labrecque and Ryan a quicker start on
slimming down Chase.
   In yesterday's memo, which details the first in a series
of expected cost-cutting steps, Chase said that it is wiping
out its three-pronged organizational structure and instead
will have ten business heads reporting directly to Mr. Ryan,
formerly head of consumer banking.
   In effect, the reorganization demotes Vice Chairman Robert
R. Douglass, who moves from head of institutional banking to
a new post as senior customer-planning and development
officer. In addition, Vice Chairman Richard J. Boyle will no
longer oversee global commercial and investment banking, but
instead will be senior credit officer. His responsibilities
will include commercial real estate lending, a troubled area
for Chase and other banks.
   Mr. Douglass, a patrician banker with close ties to the
Rockefeller family, whose members once ran Chase, will serve
in a largely ambassador-at-large role, Chase executives say.
Mr. Douglass was responsible for Chase's acquisition of an
Arizona bank which last year had a $79 million write-off for
bad real estate loans. Mr. Douglass will report to Mr.
Labrecque.
   As head of credit and real estate, Mr. Boyle is being
placed in a sensitive position that he is very familiar with.
During the 1970s, Mr. Boyle was instrumental in Chase's
work-out of troubled real estate loans, which once again are
rising. In addition, Chase executives credit him with
dissuading Mr. Butcher from bidding for Texas Commerce
Bancshares Inc., a troubled bank that was eventually acquired
by Chemical Banking Corp. Mr. Boyle will report to Mr. Ryan.
   A number of other Chase executives gain new
responsibilities in the restructuring. Michael F. Dacey, head
of North American corporate finance, now has securities
underwriting, public finance, leasing and domestic
institutions businesses reporting to him. Timothy McGiniss,
head of corporate finance in Japan, picks up responsibility
for the rest of Asia. Robert Murphy, head of Latin American
corporate finance, is being given responsibility for
developing-country debt.
   Donald Boudreau, head of the New York City branch system,
added Chase's banks in upstate New York, Ohio, Maryland and
elsewhere in the U.S. to his responsibilities. Robert D.
Hunter, head of national financial services, will now have
the residential mortgage business reporting to him.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chase
shares closed yesterday at $24.125 apiece, up 50 cents.

   Saatchi Unloads Peterson Consulting Unit

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., determined to rid itself of its
consulting businesses at any cost, dumped its Peterson
Consulting unit -- for which it paid $116 million -- for less
than $20 million.
   Saatchi said it agreed to sell Chicago-based Peterson to
the consulting firm's management for an initial payment of
just $2 million, with additional payments over the next 10
years of at least $20 million. Saatchi will also take on
Peterson liabilities with a net total of $5 million --
meaning that initially, at least, it will in effect be paying
Peterson to buy itself back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They're giving Peterson $3 million {upfront} to take it.
I don't understand the logic," says Richard Sanderson, an
analyst with Panmure Gordon in London. "They're actually
giving it away."
   A Saatchi spokesman readily conceded that the agency won't
come close to realizing its investment in Peterson, and that
the agency is basically just cutting its losses. Peterson "is
a poor, underperforming, loss-making business, and all we're
interested in is getting out at whatever cost it takes -- and
that is plus or minus zero," he said. Peterson was profitable
for the year ended Sept. 30, 1989, but for the six months
ended March 31, 1990, it had a loss of #4 million ($6.92
million).
   Saatchi stock barely reacted to the news, with the
company's American depositary receipts closing off 12.5 cents
to close at $4.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday. Saatchi shares have already been
hammered, reflecting analysts' low expectations; ADRs now
trade at less than a quarter of their 52-week high of $17.25.
   The paltry take for Peterson, bought in 1987, "wasn't a
surprise," says Laurie Goldberger, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton. The price doesn't matter that much because
"you don't quite care how {the consulting business} goes
away; they've achieved the benefit of getting rid of the
downside."
   The sale of Peterson, along with that of Saatchi's other
consulting firms, has been complicated by the fact that the
firms' major assets are their executives. Saatchi has been
negotiating management buy-outs with the consulting
executives, who hold all the cards because they know their
businesses have no value without them.
   "The problem is that these are boutique businesses. If
Peterson's principals leave, then what are you left with? Air
-- and some liabilities," says Greg Ostroff, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs. "I was under the impression Saatchi was just
looking to get out without any more liabilities."
   Peterson executives were obviously well aware of their
clout. In a statement, Saatchi said it agreed to the
unfavorable deal because it couldn't find an outside buyer
and because Peterson senior management's contracts expire at
the end of this year. If Saatchi didn't sell to management,
Saatchi "might well find that the business ceased to be
viable" at year end, the company said. Shutdown costs would
be "substantial," it added. Peterson executives declined
comment.
   The Peterson agreement, which requires shareholder
approval, comes just a few weeks after Saatchi finally agreed
to sell its biggest consulting firm, Hay Group, back to
management. A deal to sell its largest remaining consulting
firm, Gartner Group, is expected to be set in the next few
weeks. Saatchi also owns three other, small consulting
businesses, but two of them -- an employment agency in the
U.K. and a real estate consulting firm in the U.S. -- are
facing economic downturns in their industries. The Saatchi
spokesman said sales of both of those are "on a back burner."
   Saatchi has said recently that it expects proceeds of all
its consulting firms to total #80 million for the year ending
Sept. 30. The Hay sale amounts to #45 million to #50 million.
But Mr. Ostroff says the total figure may be elusive,
considering the prices Saatchi is eking out in its consulting
firesale, and that Saatchi "will probably come up short."
   Still, analysts depict the sale as a mark in favor of
Saatchi's new chief executive officer, Robert Louis-Dreyfus.
When he joined in January, the French executive vowed to get
out of the consulting business as quickly as possible -- a
feat Saatchi had been unable to accomplish since putting the
consulting business up for sale last year.
   "It's a business they shouldn't have been in, and now
they're out," says Alan Gottesman, an analyst with
PaineWebber. "It's quite an accomplishment to be done with
the deal."

   Babbit &amp; Reiman Gets `Us'
                                                                                                       

   Straight Arrow Publishers awarded its $1 million Us
Magazine account to Babbit &amp; Reiman, Atlanta.
   Babbit &amp; Reiman replaces Minneapolis agency Fallon
McElligott, which continues to handle Straight Arrow's
Rolling Stone magazine. Us decided to look elsewhere about a
month ago, "when we couldn't seem to agree on a creative
approach," said Leslie H. Zeifman, group publisher.
   "We had given Babbit &amp; Reiman a two-week window of
opportunity to prove that they would deliver a tremendous
campaign, and they did," Mr. Zeifman said.
   Fallon McElligott had created the magazine's "Definitely
Not Us" ads, which sought to peg Us somewhere between People
and Vanity Fair, even as critics claimed Us's readership was
getting more downscale.
   The account is another in a string of wins for
four-year-old Babbit &amp; Reiman. The agency won the $1.5
million USA Today account in January, and has also garnered
Financial News Network and RJR Nabisco's corporate account.

   NEW YORK -- Rising interest rates and worries about
second-quarter profits bumped stock prices lower yesterday.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 12.13 to 2845.05,
a decline of 0.42%. Broader averages took a steeper fall:
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.12 to 352.31, or
0.88%, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost
1.64 to 192.60, a loss of 0.84.%
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Volume was light, with 133,100,000 shares changing hands
on the New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues
outnumbered advancers, 1,049 to 496.
   Several of the year's most popular stocks were knocked
down yesterday by fears of weaker earnings. Caterpillar's
announcement that profit for the second quarter would be less
than half the $99 million, or 97 cents a share, reported for
the first quarter started the round of earnings scrutiny.
Caterpillar fell 5 to 58 1/2 on 1.9 million shares. In the
year-ago second quarter, Caterpillar posted net income of
$141 million, or $1.39 a share. Also, the company said its
profit for the year would be "substantially lower" than in
the previous year.
   The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 16.42 to
1147.81, primarily due to weakness in airline stocks. AMR,
parent of American Airlines, fell 1 to 63 3/8; Delta Air
Lines slipped 1/4 to 73 3/4. Both airlines have had their
second-quarter earnings forecasts revised downward in recent
weeks, according to Zacks Investment Research. The
second-quarter consensus for AMR fell to $1.90 a share from
$2.06 about a month ago. Delta expectations now center around
$2.21 a share for the quarter compared with expectations of
$2.56 a month ago.
   UAL, parent of United Airlines, fell 3 3/8 to 152 in light
volume.
   "Everybody is focusing on the (fear) that second-quarter
earnings are not going to be there," said Edward Shopkorn,
director of equity trading at Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. "People are
getting cautious."
   Shearson Lehman Hutton lowered its earnings forecasts on
39 companies last week and boosted projections on only 10,
said Peter Da Puzzo, the firm's co-director of world-wide
equities. With profit expectations coming down and rates
going up, "who's to say that this (sell-off) can't continue?"
Mr. Da Puzzo said.
   The actively traded 30-year Treasury bond fell nearly one
full point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount, taking the
yield up to 8.56%. T-bill rates moved higher as the market
absorbed a record $17.2 billion weekly sale of three- and
six-month Treasury bills. Another $29.5 billion in bills and
notes is scheduled for auction later this week.
   Tenneco, whose Case IH unit competes with Caterpillar in
the heavy-equipment market, fell 1 1/2 to 65 5/8. Analyst
Robert Christensen of Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report the stock's drop appeared to be
a "misplaced reaction" to the projection from Caterpillar, as
Case "doesn't have the same kind of equipment" or as much
exposure in Brazil. Caterpillar said more than half of its
expected second-quarter earnings shortfall was tied to the
performance of its Brazilian unit.
   Earnings-related selling also hurt Armco, which skidded 1
1/8 to 7 3/8 after the company projected a loss for the
quarter. Armco said its forecast reflects plans to take about
$70 million in second-quarter charges; also, the company said
it may not be able to continue paying common stock dividends
because of provisions in certain debt agreements.
   Philip Morris, which bucked the market's sell-off Friday
amid news of its agreement to acquire 80% of Swiss coffee and
chocolate maker Jacobs Suchard for $3.8 billion, gained 1 7/8
to 46 5/8 and topped the Big Board's list of most active
issues. About 3.2 million shares were traded.
   Other blue chips to cushion the fall in the industrial
average included International Business Machines, which went
up 3/8 to 116 5/8; Merck, up 1/2 to 82 1/4; International
Paper, up 3/8 to 51 1/4, and Union Carbide, up 1/4 to 19 3/8.
   Foxboro soared 12 7/8 to 51 on 1.2 million shares. Siebe
PLC, a British security systems concern, agreed to buy the
company for $52 a share.
   Chase Manhattan, which said it expects to save $300
million a year through a restructuring that may include jobs
cuts and asset sales, rose 1/2 to 24 1/8 on 1.2 million
shares. Also, the company eliminated a layer of top
management by dropping the posts of group heads for global,
institutional and individual banking.
   Dividend-related trading swelled volume in three issues:
Southeast Banking, which declined 3/4 to 9 3/8 on 2.6 million
shares; Commonwealth Edison, which added 1/4 to 32 1/2 on 1.8
million shares, and Repsol, which rose 1/8 to 23 5/8 on 1.9
million shares. Separately, Duff &amp; Phelps lowered its debt
ratings on Southeast Banking; the agency linked the
downgrading to "severe deterioration" in Southeast's loan
portfolio.
   J.C. Penney dropped 2 7/8 to 59 7/8 after Kidder Peabody
downgraded the stock's investment rating and cut its earnings
estimates for fiscal 1991 and 1992, citing indications that
its sales so far this month remain sluggish. The company said
it expects June sales for stores open at least a year to show
a gain in the mid-single digits from last year's level.
   Wellman skidded 3 1/4 to 28 1/4. Du Pont, a competitor in
the polyester-fiber business, cut the price of its Dacron
fiber products by 6% to 8%; the company said it will review
the action and "react accordingly" to remain competitive.
   Quantum Chemical dropped 7/8 to 17 7/8. Citing
polyethylene sales that hadn't met its expectations, Shearson
Lehman Hutton lowered its projection of second-quarter
earnings.
   Honeywell went up 1 3/4 to 98 1/4. The company said a
federal district court selected a special master to handle
its patent-infringement case against Minolta of Japan, which
has been in the courts for more than three years.
   Motel 6 rose 1 5/8 to 17 3/4. A published report cited
renewed speculation that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is seeking
to sell its 51% interest in the partnership.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.89
to 357.39. Volume was 12,350,000 shares.
   Nikkei "put" warrants are active again, following a
decline in Tokyo stocks Monday. Yesterday, the Denmark and
Salomon Brothers issues made the most-active list at the
American Stock Exchange. The Denmark issue gained 5/8 to 10
1/4; an issue from Salomon gained 3/8 to 9 1/8.
   Material Sciences rallied 3 3/8 to 13 3/4 following news
that it authorized William Blair &amp; Co., a Chicago-based
investment banking firm, to explore the possible sale of the
company.

   The Coming Collapse of North Korea

   PYONGYANG, North Korea -- Forty years to the week after
the outbreak of the Korean War, the Cold War continues on the
Korean peninsula. More than a million and a half Korean
troops confront each other across the 130-mile "demilitarized
zone." Communication between the two sides is all but
nonexistent. In the north, Stalinism with Korean
characteristics has not only been established, but perfected
by Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung. In the south, more than
40,000 American troops and an undisclosed number of nuclear
weapons remain today to deter North Korea from launching
another surprise attack.
   If East-West relations are markedly less tense today than
in the recent past, precisely the opposite is true in Korea.
In April, for example, it was reported that the Pentagon had
revised its estimate of warning time in the event of another
Korean war downward to only 24 hours.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In spite of such unpromising fundamentals, the forced
division of Korea is becoming increasingly unsustainable.
   It would, of course, be unwise to draw too many parallels
between the German and Korean situations. Nonetheless,
Germany has already demonstrated just how suddenly a long
contest between rival states in a divided nation can come to
an end. In Korea too, the race between north and south is now
drawing to a close.
   There was a time -- 30 years ago -- when the command
planning system of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
seemed to be evincing better material results than the
Republic of Korea's mismanaged, aid-fed and inward-looking
economy. That, however, is ancient history. True, Pyongyang,
the North Korean capital, is a clean city of tall buildings
and cheerful colors that, despite a somewhat surreal,
movie-set quality, compares favorably in a number of ways
with Moscow and Beijing. At the same time, however, no one
who has been to both cities could honestly say that living
standards in Pyongyang even approach those in Seoul, the
capital of South Korea. The contrast is reflected even in the
faces of children. In Pyongyang, the most common skin
irritation visible among schoolchildren is ringworm -- an
infection typically associated with poor hygiene or lack of
soap. In Seoul, the corresponding affliction is acne --
typically associated with a diet too rich in fats and oils.
   In the countryside, the disparities between the two
societies are even greater. The hillsides of North Korea have
a brownish hue. The vegetation and underbrush have been
stripped for firewood, forage perhaps even food. Even in the
poorest regions of rural South Korea, hillsides are generally
green; peasants no longer need to pillage the landscape for
their sustenance.
   North Korea's economy is animated by political enthusiasm;
South Korea's, by personal incentives. The difference shows,
and the gap can be expected to widen in the future.
   As one might expect of a society based upon and driven by
political fervor, North Korea, now in its fifth decade, is
approaching exhaustion. Uniformed military personnel are
everywhere to be seen, engaged not in traditional defense
activities, but rather in ordinary construction and factory
work. Such militarization, of course, can be read in many
ways, but one interpretation is that special, conscripted
units are now needed to do jobs previously entrusted to the
regular civilian workforce.
   North Korea has been built under, and around, a single
ruler. Whatever one may think of him, Kim Il Sung has been an
extraordinary force -- a force, moreover, that has been
consistently underestimated in the West. But this force is
now 78 years old. Once a powerful orator, he now slurs and
stumbles his way through pretaped television speeches.
"Spontaneous" demonstrations of support for the Great Leader
broadcast over North Korean TV today seem to lack their once
characteristic hysteria.
   Prospects for his son and heir-designate, Beloved Leader
Comrade Kim Jongil, are at best uncertain. Voluntary transfer
of supreme power is consistent neither with the communist
experience nor with the dynastic tradition of East Asia. The
longer the transfer of supreme power from the regime's
founding presence is deferred, the more fragile the inherited
polity is likely to be.
   In the diplomatic arena, the contest between the two
Koreas for international recognition and legitimacy was, for
a time, quite evenly matched. But by 1988, when Seoul served
as host for the Summer Olympic Games, South Korea had clearly
pulled ahead. With this month's meeting between Mikhail
Gorbachev and South Korea's President Roh Tae Woo, the
contest has moved to the end-game.
   For more than 40 years, North Korea has been able to count
on support from its two communist neighbors, China and the
Soviet Union. Now both China and the Soviet Union have
developed strong trade links with South Korea -- links they
dearly wish to make even stronger. With the recent
improvement in Sino-Soviet relations, moreover, North Korea's
utility to Moscow and Beijing has diminished substantially.
The Soviet Union reportedly continues to supply North Korea
with arms, and to transfer some technology. Yet for all
intents and purposes, the Gorbachev Politburo seems to have
written off North Korea several years ago. Though
symbolically important, the "surprise" meeting between Mr.
Gorbachev and Mr. Roh was not so much a breakthrough as a
public announcement of a pre-existing fact.
   Western commentators described the meeting as a deft
Soviet move. Examined more closely, Mr. Gorbachev's "coup"
has many markings characteristic of a diplomatic blunder.
Soviet officials, it now transpires, did not inform North
Korea during the many months of preparation for the meeting
that it was in the works. Soviet spokesmen went out of their
way to make insulting comments about North Korea to the media
before the meeting. Even by the most charitable reading, such
behavior was ill-advised. The Soviet Union's allure to South
Korea lies not in its commercial markets, but in its
potential influence over the north -- an influence Soviet
actions have been busily and deliberately dissipating. Mr.
Gorbachev may well have altered the "correlation of forces"
in Korea, albeit inadvertently. The over all fact of Soviet
decline, and the graceless first steps of the Soviet Union's
new Korea policy, would seem to leave the U.S. with greater
influence in the Korean peninsula as whole than it has
enjoyed in decades.
   How can the U.S. use this influence to encourage a free
and peaceful reunification of Korea? First and foremost, it
must retain its security commitment to Seoul. American power
has helped maintain the peace in the Korean peninsula for 37
years. It would be the utmost in folly to shun America's
allies in the south at this point, when prospects for
upheaval and instability in the north are rising actuarially.
   Second, the U.S. can take steps to lessen needless
misunderstandings -- as opposed to fundamental disagreements
-- with North Korea. Scholarly contact and increased travel
between the U.S. and the north are two possible avenues for
nurturing the "human element" that has always figured so
prominently in Korea's relations with the outside world.
   Third, the U.S. can encourage its friends in Seoul to
amend certain policies toward North Korea that are driven by
emotion, and are manifestly self-defeating. It can no longer
serve any good purpose, for example, to jam broadcasts from
the north. North Korean propaganda is utterly unlikely to
turn students in the south against their own government. A
policy based on strength and reason would be to declare South
Korea unilaterally open to broadcasts, mail and visits from
the north -- and to invite North Korea to reciprocate.
   Fourth, the U.S. must start to think about encouraging
South Korea to embrace fully the rule of law. Despite its
open and competitive mass elections, the South Korean
political system still lacks many essentials of the Western
liberal order. Impartiality before the law, for example,
cannot be taken for granted, and personalized, even
vindictive, exercise of official power frequently occurs.
Such qualities are troublesome and unpleasant today, but they
will become incalculably more costly if South Korea should be
in a position to set the basic terms of reunification in the
not-too-distant future. In living memory, the north has known
only harsh Japanese colonial rule and communist dictatorship.
Bitterness runs deep in Korea, and regional animosities
predate by centuries the surprise attack of 1950. Under the
best of circumstances, Korea will take a long time to heal.
Capricious, arbitrary or predatory abuse of authority will
only postpone that healing process.
   From 1945 to the present, American policy in Korea can be
read as a history of being taken unawares by events that were
largely predictable. (This is but one of many differences
between the Korean and the German situations.) The coming
reunification on the Korean peninsula is a predictable event.
The human cost -- both in Korea and beyond -- of the
transition might be mercifully reduced if American
policymakers began to think about it in advance.

   Armco Inc. to Post
   2nd-Period Loss,
   May Omit Dividend

   Armco Inc. said it will post a second-quarter loss and may
omit its quarterly dividend, reflecting persistent problems
in its reinsurance business.
   The Parsippany, N.J., steelmaker didn't disclose the size
of the expected second-quarter and first-half losses, but
said they could violate certain debt convenants and prevent
continued payment of the 10 cent-a-share dividend. Armco said
its board will examine options, which the company wouldn't
identify, to continue payment of the dividend and noted that
cumulative preferred stock dividends won't be affected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Armco
common fell $1.125, to $7.375. Still, analysts noted that the
company had $640 million in cash at the end of the first
quarter and that the dividend announcement, while
disappointing, doesn't indicate a liquidity problem.
   Armco said it will take a $70 million after-tax charge in
the second quarter, including $30 million related to the
Armco Financial Services Group companies, which are being
liquidated. The bulk of the remaining charges, which were
previously announced, reflect a $20 million jury award
against Armco in a 1986 breach of agreement suit and a $15
million federal tax assessment.
   In this year's first quarter, Armco had net income of
$12.9 million, or 12 cents a share. A year ago, Armco had net
income of $75.6 million, or 84 cents a share, including a $45
million loss from discontinued operations.
   Armco ventured into the reinsurance and financial services
business in the 1970s and early 1980s to reduce dependence on
the cyclical steel market. But the operations have been
plagued by huge claims. In 1984, the company stopped writing
new business and began liquidating the bulk of its insurance
companies.
   The company has taken several insurance-related write-offs
since then. However, with this latest charge, the company
said it "is confident that the major problems {in its finance
and insurance companies} are behind it."
   Charles Bradford, an independent steel analyst, said he
was encouraged by the company's optimistic outlook. "For the
first time, the company is able to say it is confident now
that the problems are behind it," he said.
   Should Armco be forced to suspend its dividend, it would
mark the second time in seven years. In 1984, the company
omitted its then 40-cent a share dividend to save cash in the
face of major steel and insurance related write-offs. The
10-cent-a-share dividend was reinstated this past year.

   Caterpillar Shares Tumble as Firm Says
   Profit Will Drop `Substantially' in 1990

   Caterpillar Inc. shares tumbled after the company
disclosed that it expects current-year earnings will be
"substantially lower" than those of an earlier year, on flat
sales.
   The Peoria, Ill., maker of heavy equipment said it expects
significant "negative short-term effects on profit" from
deterioration in the economy of Brazil -- where it operates a
unit -- as well as from delays in completing a costly
plant-modernization effort, and the effects of a corporate
reorganization.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Caterpillar shares dived $5 to close at $58.50 on heavy
volume of almost 1.9 million shares.
   In 1989, Caterpillar had net income of $497 million, or
$4.90 a share, on sales of $10.88 billion. The company had
described its 1990 earnings picture in milder terms, saying
only that net would be "under considerable pressure" and
projecting a slight sales increase. But its first-quarter net
of $99 million, or 97 cents a share, was off 30% from a year
earlier, despite a 9% rise in sales to $2.87 billion.
   Caterpillar said it expects second-quarter net will be
"less than half" the first-quarter earnings.
   "Generally speaking," said Wertheim Schroeder &amp; Co.
analyst Mitchell I. Quain, the problems Caterpillar cited
"appear to be temporary. . . . Most of this is nonrecurring"
and doesn't appear to significantly take away from what he
continues to see as strengthening "earnings power in the
years ahead" for the company.
   Still, he noted, Wertheim had been projecting per-share
earnings of about $4 to $4.25 for this year, but "now I think
you'll see everyone go down to about $3 for 1990."
   Caterpillar said the largest reason for the projected
downturn this year is what it called a "dramatic decline" in
results at its Caterpillar Brasil unit. The unit was
profitable through 1989 and the first quarter of this year,
but Caterpillar now expects the unit to incur an operating
loss for the year. Caterpillar said sales have softened in
Brazil since a new government economic program went into
effect in March; the government move, by weakening Brazil's
currency, also means that the sales which do occur translate
into fewer dollars for the parent.
   Caterpillar also noted, as it has previously, that the
dollar's recent strength vs. the yen makes U.S. exports more
expensive, and makes Japanese goods cheaper to U.S. buyers.
The company's biggest world-wide competitor is Komatsu Ltd.
of Tokyo.
   Caterpillar said manufacturing costs will be higher than
anticipated through 1990, because of "slippage" in
implementing its extensive modernization program. While cost
reductions anticipated from the ongoing program will "still
be achieved," the point where such benefits exceed outlays
for the plan now won't come in the fourth quarter, as the
company had expected.
   Caterpillar additionally said that it's experiencing
"short-lived" inefficiencies associated with a corporate
revamping announced in January. That plan, designed to make
the company more flexible, established a number of "profit
centers" in place of the vertical structure the company had
employed. But the company said adjusting to the new plan has
produced temporary "disruptive effects."
   Caterpillar said all the programs under way, despite the
setbacks some have encountered, will "greatly enhance" its
long-term competitive posture, and added it will continue to
aggressively pursue their implementation.

   Mandela Asks Bush for Financial Aid
   For the ANC, but Request Is Rejected

   WASHINGTON -- South African activist Nelson Mandela, in a
meeting with President Bush, asked the U.S. to provide
financial support to the anti-apartheid African National
Congress, but the administration said it rejected the
request.
   Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, said the president told Mr. Mandela, the ANC's
deputy president, that the U.S. wouldn't directly provide
funds to any political parties in South Africa.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On other topics, Mr. Cohen said the president welcomed a
statement by Mr. Mandela that the ANC would call for a
cessation of hostilities when it begins negotiations with the
South African government. Mr. Bush had wanted the ANC leader
to go further and renounce all violence.
   Mr. Mandela said the ANC decided in 1986 to scale down its
armed "struggle" and pursue negotiations. He said the call to
stop hostilities could come "as soon as the (South African)
government removes all obstacles to negotiations." The
conditions he listed are: the return of 20,000 political
exiles, the release of 1,000 political prisoners, the repeal
of oppressive legislation, the ending of political trials and
the full lifting of the state of emergency.
   The anti-apartheid leader, who is on an eight-city tour of
the U.S., also met yesterday with Secretary of State James
Baker. Today, he is scheduled to address a joint session of
Congress, where he may draw criticism for his indications of
support for Cuban leader Fidel Castro, Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat and Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, whom he called "brother leader."
   In a news briefing, Mr. Cohen said Mr. Mandela didn't ask
President Bush yesterday to intensify U.S. sanctions against
the South African government. During a brief airport session
with reporters after his plane landed in Washington on
Sunday, Mr. Mandela had indicated he would make such a
request.
   U.S. sanctions will remain in place until conditions that
are specified in U.S. law -- a full lifting of the South
African state of emergency and the release of political
prisoners -- are met, according to Mr. Cohen.
   At a news conference about two hours after his meeting and
luncheon with the president, Mr. Mandela said the ANC would
use the unspecified amount of funds he requested from Mr.
Bush for "the task of mobilizing the entire country around
the peace process which we, the African National Congress,
have launched." Despite Mr. Cohen's comments, he said "Our
impression is the president was sympathetic to our appeal for
resources."
   Mr. Cohen later indicated that the U.S. this fiscal year
is spending a total of $42 million to aid the people of South
Africa, $32 million for scholarships and $10 million for a
variety of projects. But he added: "There will be no money .
. . directly to the ANC from the United States government."
   Both Mr. Mandela and Mr. Cohen said the two sides narrowed
their differences and reached better understandings on issues
concerning South Africa and the U.S. The president and Mr.
Mandela did "agree to disagree," Mr. Cohen said, on issues
that are peripheral to the task of ending apartheid and
developing South African democracy.
   One such issue is the Bush administration's military
assistance for rebel groups fighting the government of
Angola. Shortly after arriving in Washington, Mr. Mandela
said ANC officials "strongly condemn" that aid.

   Your Money Matters:
   The Bond Man May Not Even Ring Once

BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)
MORTGAGES, MORTGAGE BANKERS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MOR)
</IN>
<LP>
   Bond investors, beware: Many of those high-yielding,
long-term bonds you bought in the early 1980s aren't going to
last nearly as long as you had hoped.
   Buried in the fine print of most corporate and municipal
bonds is language entitling the issuer to "call," or redeem,
the bonds well before the scheduled maturity date. And that's
exactly what many companies and municipalities are planning
to do over the next few years, as their bonds become eligible
for redemption, because interest rates today are much lower
than when they issued the bonds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bond calls usually are bad news for investors, but not
knowing about them can be even worse. Just ask investors
holding "bearer" bonds, where the owner's name isn't on
record anywhere. They typically don't discover their bonds
have been called until they try to cash their interest-rate
coupons at their bank, months after the bond was called. Then
they wind up losing many months of interest payments.
   Starting today, The Wall Street Journal begins a weekly
feature designed to help investors spot bond calls more
easily. Entitled "Redemption Notices," it is a listing of
municipal and corporate bonds called for partial or complete
redemption during the week. Compiled initially from
advertisements in this newspaper, it will also include
preferred stock and other securities being redeemed, as well
as sinking-fund redemptions. The list will appear each
Tuesday in the Money &amp; Investing section.
   The idea came from readers who wrote or called this
newspaper. "This would be a big help because this is a very
big problem for me and many of my friends," says Henry W.
Tavs, an investor living in Miami. "We have suffered
substantial losses because we haven't found out our bonds
were recalled until many months later."
   However, this weekly listing won't include all bond calls,
because there is no requirement that every issuer notify a
single central source. Many state and local government
issuers, for example, advertise their call notices only in
trade publications and local publications.
   The Bond Buyer, a trade publication, carries a daily
listing of municipal bonds that are being called, as well as
a longer list each Wednesday. Its list is based largely on
advertisements in its own pages and "any other information we
can find," including clipping services from local papers
across the country, says John H. Allan, editor. But a
subscription costs $1,575 a year. Several other
organizations, including Kenny Information Systems Inc.,
Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
also compile bond-call lists.
   Finding out about a bond call shouldn't be a problem for
investors whose bonds are in "registered" form, which means
the issuer has the investors' names and addresses. Then it's
the issuer's responsibility to notify investors of its
decision to retire the bonds early.
   But many bonds issued prior to the early 1980s came in
bearer form. Of the $784 billion of municipal bonds now
outstanding, about 20% are in bearer form, estimates the
Public Securities Association, a trade group. Eventually, the
problem will disappear because bearer bonds aren't being
issued in the U.S. anymore, due to tax-law changes. But the
problem will become much more extensive over the next few
years, when a torrent of bond calls is expected as
municipalities and companies refinance older debt.
   Because of this trend, some investment advisers urge
investors worried about the problem to try converting their
bearer bonds into registered form. In some cases, issuers
will convert the bonds into registered form for free. But in
other cases, the bonds were issued only in bearer form and
can't be converted. Also, many investors refuse to part with
their bearer bonds, because they like the anonymity such
bonds give them.
   Government officials complain that bearer-bond lovers
often are tax cheats or people trying to hide income from a
spouse. But some investors reply that they prefer bearer
bonds because they don't trust issuers to send their interest
payments on time, or because they feel safer holding onto
their certificates than relying on a registered issue's
computer entry someplace.
   Another alternative for investors worried about missing
bond calls is to buy U.S. Treasury securities. Most of these
can't be called prior to their final maturity date. Or
investors can buy shares of bond mutual funds and let the
fund's managers worry about calls. Or they can leave their
bonds in safekeeping with their brokers or investment
advisers.
   Figuring out whether your bond is likely to be called can
be very tricky. Bonds can be called for many reasons,
although it's safe to assume that bonds paying double-digit
rates will be called at the first chance issuers get. Thus,
investors who buy bonds today should insist that their
brokers provide them with details. Also be sure to ask for
the bond's yield to the first available call date, not just
the yield to maturity. The difference can be very
significant.
   Even veteran bond traders often are stunned to discover a
bond they thought couldn't be called for years suddenly has
been called. "It's hard even for the pros to keep up with all
these calls," says D. Christopher Taylor, president of
Greenwich Money Management Inc. in Greenwich, Conn. "For the
nonprofessional, it's `buyer beware.'"
   Among the organizations investigating the problem is the
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the Washington, D.C.,
organization that regulates all securities firms and dealer
banks in municipal securities. "We are aware of the need for
a central source for information" on municipal bonds in
general, including bond calls, says Christopher A. Taylor,
executive director. "But we're not equipped to take all that
in right now and make it available to everyone."
   The following is a listing of securities called for
partial or complete redemption during the week ended June 22,
1990. The notices are taken from advertisements appearing in
editions of The Wall Street Journal, and are not meant to be
definitive. Inquiries regarding specific issues should be
directed to the paying agent or, if none is listed, the
issuer.

   American International Group Inc. said it agreed to
acquire aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp. in
a cash-and-stock transaction valued at about $1.3 billion.
   International Lease Finance, based in Beverly Hills,
Calif., is one of the fastest-growing companies in the
jetliner remarketing business. But, by nature, it has a heavy
debt structure and is eager to tap into the giant pool of
cash that American International, one of the world's largest
insurance and financial-services firms, is able to provide.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "With the tremendous appetite for capital that we have,
this is a very appropriate merger," said Steven Udvar-Hazy,
International Lease Finance's president. In fact, as part of
the transaction, American International plans to provide its
new subsidiary up to $125 million in financing.
   Maurice Greenberg, chairman of New York-based American
International, said the acquisition is part of the insurer's
strategy to expand its financial-services group, which was
formed in 1987. American International is already in the
interest-rate and currency swap business, as well as in
specialty financing and office equipment leasing. It also
recently formed a commodity trading operation, known as AIG
Trading, with three former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
officials.
   Mr. Greenberg said International Lease Finance "provides a
diversified, rapidly growing source of earnings to AIG,"
adding that he believes the International Lease Finance
purchase and the formation of AIG Trading will help the
financial-services group double its operating profit next
year.
   Dan Hersh, who tracks International Lease Finance for the
Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc.,
said he thinks that having American International as a parent
will give International Lease Finance more flexibility in the
way it peddles its portfolio of aircraft, which now consists
of 98 airplanes with an asset value exceeding $3 billion.
   "They can take bigger risks with credit now that they're
out of the public market," he explained, adding that being a
"quasi-private" subsidiary will make them more akin to their
chief rival, GPA Group Ltd., of Shannon, Ireland.
   Mr. Udvar-Hazy said that International Lease Finance had
been looking for a "strategic combination" since late last
year and was first introduced to American International in
March. Becoming a part of such a cash-rich concern, he
asserted, should "lower the company's funding costs and, in
turn, allow us to lower our leasing rates to our clients."
   International Lease Finance has been highly profitable,
riding a world-wide wave in air travel and airplane sales.
Just yesterday, the company reported that second-quarter
earnings soared 57% to $24.7 million, or 64 cents a share,
from a year-earlier $15.7 million, or 41 cents a share.
Revenue for the period ended May 31 jumped 28% to a record
$111.7 million from $87.1 million.
   In 1989, International Lease Finance earned $61.2 million.
American International's financial-services group posted
operating net of $149.8 million last year.
   American International said it will use internal sources
to fund the cash portion of the acquisition, and Mr.
Greenberg added that the buy-out would cause "virtually no
dilution" of American International's earnings this year.
   Terms of the agreement call for International Lease
Finance holders to receive either $32.50 in cash or 50 cents
in cash plus 0.3 American International common share for each
International Lease Finance share outstanding, subject to a
maximum number of shares and certain other adjustments.
   According to the deal between the two companies, if the
market price of American International's stock exceeds $104 a
share during a specified period prior to the merger, the
exchange rate will be adjusted so that the value of the
American International common stock portion will equal $31.20
per International Lease Finance share. Similarly, if American
International's stock price is below $86 at the time of the
closing, the value of the American International stock
portion will be adjusted to equal $25.80 per International
Lease Finance share.
   The acquisition is still subject to International Lease
Finance shareholder approval, the delivery of various
opinions on the tax consequences of the move and other
conditions. Certain terms also might have to be adjusted to
reflect American International's previously announced 5-for-4
stock split, to be paid as a 25% stock dividend on July 23.
The merger is nonetheless expected to close in the fourth
quarter.
   The financial markets closed yesterday before the
acquisition was announced and before International Lease
Finance disclosed its second-quarter results. American
International shares closed at $96.625 down $2.375 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. International Lease
Finance shares fell 50 cents to $27.125 in national
over-the-counter trading. Some short-sellers have been
playing the company's stock of late, expecting the aircraft
buying boom to slow and International Lease Finance's bubble
to burst.
   The aircraft-leasing company will operate as a wholly
owned unit of American International, though it will remain
an indpendent debt issuer. International Lease Finance
currently has on the market about $1.5 billion in commercial
paper and medium-term notes.
   Mr. Udvar-Hazy will remain president of the unit, which
will maintain its headquarters in Beverly Hills. Louis Gonda
will remain executive vice president. And Leslie Gonda will
keep his post as International Lease Finance chairman, while
also becoming an American International board member. All
three men, who together founded International Lease Finance
in 1973 and collectively control more than 50% of the
company's 36 million shares outstanding, said they have opted
to take stakes in American International.

   Beijing Permits Fang Lizhi to Leave
   U.S. Embassy and Travel to Britain

   BEIJING -- Chinese authorities allowed dissident Fang
Lizhi to leave his yearlong refuge in the U.S. Embassy and
travel overseas, removing a major irritant in U.S.-China
relations.
   The astrophysicist and outspoken human-rights advocate
left Beijing yesterday with his wife, Li Shuxian, aboard a
U.S. military plane. The couple, who took sanctuary in the
embassy after the brutal suppression of last June's
pro-democracy movement, will resettle in Britain, diplomats
said. He has accepted a post at Cambridge University.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   China's official Xinhua news agency said the pair were
given "lenient treatment" so they could seek medical care
abroad. Chinese and diplomatic sources said Mr. Fang has a
heart ailment.
   The freeing of the couple, accused by Chinese authorities
of "instigating" last spring's demonstrations, may prompt
calls in Washington for improved U.S.-China ties. The Bush
administration has argued that allowing the pair to leave was
a prerequisite for better relations.
   The White House immediately declared, "This humanitarian
action is a far-sighted, significant step that will improve
the atmosphere for progress in our bilateral relations."
Noting that Dr. Fang's second son, who plans to study in the
U.S., is still in China, State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said, "We have no reason to believe that
the son will have any difficulty obtaining permission to
study abroad."
   The decision to allow the pair to leave doesn't markedly
alter the political situation in China. Hundreds of persons
arrested after the Tiananmen incident have been released from
prison, but hundreds more prisoners of conscience remain,
often without being charged. But the release of Mr. Fang is
sure to bolster President Bush's argument that his China
policy has achieved tangible benefits.
   U.S.-China ties have been icy since June 4, 1989, when
Chinese troops killed hundreds of demonstrators in Beijing.
President Bush curtailed most high-level visits and suspended
military aid and some economic assistance. Washington also
blocked the resumption of normal lending to China from
multilateral agencies.
   The Fang release may have been timed by Beijing to ward
off further sanctions. Congress is preparing to vote --
almost certainly favorably -- on Mr. Bush's recommendation to
retain beneficial trade terms for China. But some lawmakers
have threatened an attempt to make future trade ties with
China dependent on Beijing's human rights record.
   State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler denied
"categorically" that the U.S. and China cut any deals trading
the Fang release for a lifting of U.S. sanctions against
China. Indeed, she said China would have to free other
prisoners and stop jamming the Voice of America if it wants
"a more normal relationship."
   China for months has indicated a willingness to allow the
pair to leave, but only under certain conditions, including
an admission of guilt as well as a guarantee that they
wouldn't engage in anti-China activities overseas. The Xinhua
report hinted at a face-saving compromise: It said the two
dissidents admitted they had opposed the Communist Party's
monopoly on power and ideology, which amounts to a technical
violation of China's constitution.
   Such a statement enables Beijing to maintain that the pair
had repented. At the same time, the pair apparently never
admitted any responsibility for last year's demonstrations,
the core allegation against them. Xinhua also indicated that
the couple agreed that "they will not engage in activities
directed against China after they leave the country."

   Over-the-counter stocks tumbled in the wake of Friday's
sell-off of larger, exchange listed shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.69 to 455.64, a 0.80%
slide, as volume dropped sharply to 113.5 million shares from
167.5 million Friday. Declining shares outpaced advancing
stocks by a wide margin, 1,136 to 765.

   "It was a very sleepy day, almost like a holiday," said
E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld, a
major dealer in OTC stocks for other market professionals. "I
suspect it will be this way until after the Fourth of July,"
he added.
   Hank Striefler, OTC trading manager for Shearson Lehman
Hutton, said smaller stocks were hit hard yesterday as the
sell programs that tackled exchange-listed shares Friday
spilled over into the OTC market. However, Mr. Striefler
remained optimistic about the longer-term picture. "I think
we're near a bottom," he said, suggesting that later in the
week portfolio managers may buy smaller stocks to "window
dress" their portfolios.
   Mr. Striefler agreed with Mr. Geduld that selling was
orderly and across all OTC industry groups. He also predicted
that this week will be quiet. "The closer we get to July 4,
{trading} is going to come to a halt," he said.
   Duty Free International plunged 4 1/4 to 24 3/4. Officials
of the Ridgefield, Conn., operator of duty-free stores told
analysts that second-quarter sales at some of its stores
aren't likely to be as strong as expected, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. Chief financial officer
Gerald F. Egan also said that sales last weekend at some of
its Canadian border stores were lower than expected,
following the collapse of the Meech Lake plan giving Quebec
special status.
   Price Co. jumped 2 to 38 3/4. The San Diego wholesale
cash-and-carry merchandising company reported net income for
the third quarter ended June 10 of 47 cents a share, fully
diluted, up from restated income of 42 cents a share a year
earlier.
   Sun Microsystems added 5/8 to 32 and was one of the few
technology stocks that closed higher. The Mountain View,
Calif., maker of computer workstations said that a unit of
the company renewed a one-year "master purchase agreement"
with Unisys Corp. under which Unisys will resell, and
purchase for internal development, Sun's Sparc-based
workstations and servers.
   Among other technology shares, Intel fell 1/2 to 45 1/2;
Apple Computer lost 1/4 to 41 1/4, and Microsoft slid 1 1/4
to 74 1/2. Microsoft said it's increasing its support staff
by 60 people over the next 12 weeks and inaugurating a
24-hour telephone hotline and other services to assist the
growing number of users of the 3.0 version of its Windows
software. The Redmond, Wash., software maker said sales of
the product outpaced its "most aggressive" sales predictions.
   Henley Group rose 1/4 to 31 1/4 after the La Jolla,
Calif., industrial company said it may sell as much as its
entire 38.5% stake in Itel Corp.
   California Microwave advanced 1/4 to 8 1/4. A favorable
profile of the Sunnyvale, Calif., electronics communications
company appeared in the current issue of Barron's.
   American Medical Electronics jumped 1 1/4 to 12 1/4 after
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes analyst Craig B. Dickson made bullish
comments about the Dallas maker of medical devices for the
third consecutive day, DJPIR reported. Mr. Dickson is
optimistic about the prospects for the company's device to
assist healing after spinal surgery.
   Tele-Communications stumbled 5/8 to 14 after this
newspaper reported that National Broadcasting Co. executives
privately gave little chance of success to a proposal by the
Denver cable company to use its cable systems as NBC
affiliates in rural areas not already served by the network's
affiliates.
   Software Toolworks continued to slide on heavy volume.
After the market closed, investor John R. Purcell of

Oaks, Calif. software publisher to 4.3% of its outstanding
common shares.Software Toolworks fell 1/4 to 15 on 1.25
million shares.
   Biogen fell 1 to 21 1/2. Chicago-based analyst Peter F.
Drake of Vector Securities International tied the drop to
profit-taking after last week's AIDS conference in San
Francisco, according to DJPIR. Mr. Drake explained that some
investors had been expecting wider press coverage of data
presented Thursday about the Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology
company's alpha interferon product, which is used in
combination with Burroughs-Wellcome's AZT drug to treat
people who test positive for the AIDS virus but who don't yet
have symptoms. Biogen climbed as high as 23 in advance of the
conference.
   Tyson Foods dropped 1 1/4 to 31 1/2. This newspaper's
"Heard on the Street" column questioned not only why the
poultry producer recently changed its depreciation schedule,

digest the $1.3 billion of long-term debt it absorbed in the
acquisition of Holly Farms.
   Liz Claiborne slipped 1 3/4 to 30 1/4. The North Bergen,

   Treasurys Fall as Worries About New Supply
   Of Notes and Bonds Push Investors to Shun Bonds

   NEW YORK -- Investors shunned the bond market yesterday,
forcing dealers to knock down prices in an attempt to attract
buyers.
   The biggest losses occurred on the longer end of the yield
curve. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly one
point , or $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its
price, jumped to 8.56%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Short-term securities ended with losses between 1/4 and
1/2 point.
   Traders and analysts said institutional investors were
noticeably absent from the market yesterday, due in part to
concern about the market's ability to absorb a huge amount of
new notes and bonds to be sold over the next several weeks.
   The Treasury sold $17.2 billion of short-term Treasury
bills yesterday and is scheduled to auction $11.25 billion of
two-year notes today and $8.25 billion of four-year notes
tomorrow.
   "The auctions are coming up and there's not much buying,"
said Charles Lieberman, managing director of financial
markets research at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
"The net result is prices go lower."
   William Sullivan, money-market economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said that investors are staying away from the
market for fear that prices will fall further in the weeks
ahead as the Treasury saturates the market with supply.
   That could be bad news not only for investors, but also
for dealers. Traders' inventories already are bloated and the
additional inventory is likely to keep prices lower.
   Mr. Sullivan of Dean Witter said that evidence that
dealers already hold ample supply of securities is reflected
in the firmness of the overnight repurchase-agreement rate
compared with the federal funds rate. In a repurchase
agreement, a securities firm borrows to finance its
inventory, using the securities as collateral. The "repo"
rate is generally lower than rates on other collaterized
loans made by New York banks. The federal funds rates is the
rate banks charge each other on overnight loans.
   The repo rate has been close to the federal funds rate for
about two weeks, reflecting an abundance of collateral to be
financed. An overnight repurchase-agreement rate
substantially below the federal funds rate reflects a
scarcity of collateral.
   Yesterday afternoon the overnight rate stood at about
8.20%, compared with a federal funds rate that fluctuated
between 8.1875% and 8.3125%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Charter Medical Corp. fell sharply on
reports that federal regulators are investigating the company
for possible Medicare and Medicaid-related fraud.
   As reported, officials from the Department of Health and
Human Services have been questioning former Charter employees
involved in the Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement process
for several months.
   Bids for the hospital and psychiatric-care company's
high-yield debt dried up yesterday. Charter Medical's 14.25%
subordinated debentures, due in 2002, were offered at 21,
down three points.
   The Macon, Ga.-based firm's 14% senior subordinated
debentures, which were trading at 101 1/2 at the beginning of
the year, were offered at 38, down six points from Friday's
closing level.
   In recent months, Charter Medical's credit has suffered
from a series of confidence blows. The firm posted a $67
million loss during the second quarter after a pretax charge
of $35 million for questionable accounting practices.
   In the overall junk-bond market, prices slipped modestly
in extremely thin trading.
   Some traders said a decline in equity prices helped
depress junk bond prices which ended between 1/4 to 1/2 point
lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 12 points
yesterday after falling nearly 79 points last week.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
101 29/32, down nearly one point from 102 27/32 on Friday.
   The current two-year notes were quoted late at 100 1/32 to
yield 8.44%, compared with 100 7/32 to yield 8.35% on Friday.
In when-issued trading, the new two-year notes to be
auctioned today were quoted at a yield of 8.43%, up 0.09
percentage point from late Friday. The when-issued four-year
notes were quoted at 8.54%, up 0.10 percentage point from
Friday.
   Short-term rates were higher yesterday at the government's
regular weekly Treasury bill auction. The average discount
rate on three-month bills was 7.78% and was 7.67% on
six-month bills. Those rates were up from last week's
auction, when they were 7.74% and 7.64%, respectively.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated June 28. The 13-week bills mature
Sept. 27, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Dec. 27, 1990.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Declines in Treasury bond prices pulled down mortgage
securities as much as 3/8 point.
   Lesser losses on mortgage securities translated to a slim
narrowing in yield spreads, but market participants stress
that the spread tightening has done little to break the
recent trend of marginal spread changes.
   Spread volatility has been virtually nonexistent in recent
weeks. Since the start of the month, the late-day spread
between Government National Mortgage Association 9.5%
securities and 10-year Treasury notes has been locked in a
maximum range of 0.05 percentage point. The same is true for
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities and Federal
National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities.
   Late yesterday, the spread for Ginnie Mae 9.5% securities
stood at 1.27 percentage points, 0.02 percentage point
narrower than late Friday, with Ginnie Mae 9.5% securities
yielding 9.85% and 10-year Treasury notes yielding 8.58%.
   Among other actively traded secondary mortgage issues,
Freddie Mac 9.5% securities were 11/32 lower at 97 31/32 and
Fannie Mae 9.5% issues were off 11/32 at 98 15/32.
   Ginnie Mae 9.5% securities for July delivery were off 3/8
at 98 18/32.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended narrowly mixed, with most issues
steady to 1/8 point lower in ambivalent dealings.
   Issues are expected to show only minor price fluctuations
as participants await the outcome of this week's Treasury
auctions.
   In secondary activity, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2020 closed up 1/8 at 97 7/8 to yield
7.37.
   Today a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. group is expected to price
$780 million New York State Dormitory Authority consolidated
second resolution revenue bonds.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Canadian bond market was surprisingly subdued
yesterday following the weekend demise of the Meech Lake
constitutional accord.
   In recent months, Canadian bond prices have gyrated wildly
due to uncertainty about how such an accord would affect the
Canadian economy. The Meech Lake accord was designed to meet
Quebec's demand that it be considered a "distinct society"
and to defuse independence forces within the province. But
the accord died after two provinces failed to ratify it by a
Saturday deadline.
   Although some investors were bracing for a potential
sell-off, the reaction was muted. "The world did not come to
an end," said Jim Beqaj, director of global fixed-income at
Wood Gundy Ltd., Toronto. "It was actually quite
anticlimactic," he said.
   The news prompted some selling of Canadian government
bonds during overnight trading in Japan. But the bonds
recovered somewhat during Canadian trading and ended between
1/8 and 1/4 point lower.
   Wood Gundy's Mr. Beqaj said the overnight dip in prices
sparked some bargain hunting during North American trading as
investors began to focus again on the economic fundamentals,
which look encouraging for Canadian bonds.
   Michael Gregory, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada,
agrees. He said that Canadian bonds are attractive because of
the relatively high yields when compared to U.S. government
bonds. Mr. Gregory expects the Bank of Canada to loosen
interest rates near the end of the summer in response to
slowing economic growth and an easing of inflationary
pressures.

   RJR's $250 Million in Fees Whets Wall Street's Appetite

   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. has budgeted $250 million in
fees for banks, Wall Street firms and other advisers in its
giant debt refinancing, suggesting that patching up leveraged
companies may be the financial community's next big
moneymaker.
   "It's kind of amazing that people can make money on this,"
said one commercial banker who has seen details of the new
RJR refinancing package and expects to participate. He
observed that RJR's refinancing will come just 18 months
after the food and tobacco company was taken private in a
leveraged buy-out led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. That
original 1989 buy-out generated more than $1 billion in fees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As reported, RJR Nabisco this summer plans to retire more
than $4 billion of high-yield junk bonds that could present a
financial crisis for RJR when their interest rates must be
reset next year. Those bonds are to be replaced with bank
debt, equity and new preferred stock. The $5.3 billion
refinancing package, which also includes the retirement of $1
billion in increasing rate notes, has been designed by KKR,
RJR's biggest shareholder.
   In general, Wall Street securities firms and commercial
banks have been scrambling this year to turn troubled-company
restructuring into a profit center, particularly because of
the sharp falloff in their once lucrative takeover business.
   Firms such as Rothschild Inc., J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. all have expanded their
restructuring departments in recent months. In many cases,
they are working with companies that took on too much debt at
Wall Street's urging just a few years ago.
   Only KKR is missing out on the fee windfall this time; it
confirmed that it won't charge RJR for its work on the
refinancing. That's an unusual switch for KKR, which charged
some of the biggest fees on Wall Street throughout the 1980s,
culminating in a $75 million fee for putting the RJR buy-out
together.
   Lately, however, Wall Street fees have come under much
tougher public and Congressional scrutiny. A big KKR fee on
the refinancing transaction likely would have caused protests
from RJR bondholders and from legislators.
   So the biggest chunk of the $250 million in fees is likely
to go to commercial banks. People who have seen RJR's
proposed terms say that banks that lend $200 million or more
will collect fees equal to 3.5% to 4% of their loans. Banks
lending less than $200 million will collect fees equal to
2.75%.
   Such fees will be among the most lucrative ever offered to
commercial banks for a major leveraged-company loan. "It's
very attractive," said one Japanese banker. By comparison,
banks earned fees of just 1% in the 1986 buy-out of Beatrice
Cos., and about 3% on the original RJR buy-out.
   Total bank fees for the refinancing could reach $120
million or more, according to people familiar with RJR's
finances. Of that amount, as much as $80 million would
represent fees on the $2.25 billion in new money that RJR
wants to borrow from banks. Another $20 million is likely to
go for a "consent fee" that would allow RJR to borrow more
money under its existing loan agreements. And if RJR draws
down a further $1.1 billion in unused bank loans under an
existing revolving credit agreement, it could pay banks $20
million or more in additional fees.
   That still leaves as much as $130 million to be divided
among Wall Street securities firms, lawyers and other
advisers. It's understood that RJR hopes its fee budget is
overly large and it won't have to pay the full $250 million.
Historically, though, Wall Street fees have tended to
escalate beyond companies' initial projections.
   On Wall Street, RJR is being advised by two investment
banks, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. RJR also
has made extensive use of one of KKR's major law firms,
Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett. The company's eventual printing
bill for its bond-exchange offer is likely to be sizable,
too. Even proxy-solicitation firms hope to get in the act by
managing the paperwork associated with RJR's exchange offer.
   Bankers said they don't know how the fees would be
divided. Officials at Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and
Simpson Thacher either didn't return phone calls or declined
comment. RJR and KKR also declined comment.
   As for the refinancing package itself, bankers said it
appears to be coming together quickly. Fuji Bank of Japan has
joined four U.S. banks, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chase
Manhattan Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Citicorp,
as agents for the loan. Each has agreed to provide $350
million. Commitments on the bank loan are due by July 6, and
one banker estimated that the loan will be 50% to 100%
oversubscribed.

   Bush Trying to Get
   Talks on Budget
   Back on Track

   WASHINGTON -- Democratic negotiators at the budget talks
struggled to overcome their differences as President Bush
sought to break an apparent stalemate in the negotiations by
inviting top congressional leaders to breakfast at the White
House this morning.
   Negotiators from both sides have been saying they need to
make significant progress this week if they are to reach a
deficit-reduction compromise before September. But chances
for that are fading. A negotiating session planned for
yesterday afternoon was canceled; Republicans blamed the
Democrats and Democrats blamed the administration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Democrats uniformly want to avoid blame for the tax
increase they -- and many Republicans -- expect to be part of
any deficit-reduction compromise. But they differ
substantially on tactics. Some want to demand that President
Bush put a new offer on the table before proceeding, even if
that risks breaking up the talks; others are now ready to
quietly pursue a compromise with administration negotiators.
   The differences among Democrats reflect both the
institutional characteristics of the House and Senate and
variations in style among the players. Several senators argue
for a more confrontational stance. Some House members side
with them, but others are more conciliatory.
   Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said
yesterday that Congress simply should proceed with its budget
resolution and appropriations bills so that the
administration "will understand that this {the budget summit}
is not going anyplace until the president gives us a more
substantive offer."
   Mr. Bush invited to breakfast this morning the top
Democrat and Republican in each chamber -- the same quartet
he invited last month to kick off the budget summit -- as
well as House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who
chairs the talks. The invitations followed attempts by Budget
Director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
to convince distrustful Democrats that the administration
sincerely seeks a deficit-reduction compromise rather than
partisan advantage.
   Meanwhile, Republican congressional negotiators sought to
raise pressure on the Democrats. "We're waiting for the
Democrats. . . . " said Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), after
meeting with Mr. Bush yesterday. "They are not ready to
discuss serious resolution to issues."
   Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) added: "We know what we want
to do. We want a deal. . . . We know we want one. They're not
sure they do."
   Mr. Darman, responding to the Democrats' demand for a new
offer, last week essentially repeated Mr. Bush's January
budget request and proposed another $11.7 billion in new
spending cuts. But that apparently did little to advance the
negotiations, instead offering Democrats a new target to
shoot at.
   Democrats promptly reminded administration negotiators
that no Republican in the House or the Senate was willing to
put the president's original budget proposal to a vote.

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that states may
require clear proof that a patient in a vegetative state
wishes to die before allowing food and water tubes to be
disconnected.
   By a 5-4 vote, the high court ruled that, in the absence
of strong evidence of the intent of a patient who is
incompetent, states aren't required to honor the wishes of a
patient's family to stop artificial feeding and water and to
allow the patient to die.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decision, written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
is the Supreme Court's first foray into the legally and
ethically complex and highly emotional issue of the right to
die. The ruling leaves the states substantial leeway to adopt
their own approaches, outlining some significant parameters
for legislatures to follow.
   Most significantly, by emphasizing the need for clear
evidence of a patient's wishes, the ruling is likely to
encourage greater use of so-called living wills that allow
individuals to spell out in writing in advance their wishes
about being kept alive through tube feeding or other means.
   Living-will laws vary widely, however, in the roughly 40
states that have passed them. While most allow the
termination of artificial-breathing equipment and other
life-support efforts, many don't specifically allow a person
to authorize in advance the removal of feeding and water
tubes. So, there is likely to be new pressure on state
legislatures to modify some living-will laws or to adopt new
ones.
   Appeals courts or supreme courts in at least nine states
have found either a state or federal constitutional right to
privacy that limits a state's ability to refuse to stop
artificial feeding of patients in vegetative states. The
ruling yesterday may affect those decisions if state
officials try to impose new limits.
   "The ruling means that if you write down your wishes in
advance about tubefeeding, they will have to be taken
seriously," said Fenella Rouse, a lawyer with the Society for
the Right to Die.
   Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe agreed that
the ruling "will encourage more precise expressions" of an
individual's wishes, but warned that "living wills are not
foolproof" as they may be challenged as insufficient evidence
of one's intent.
   The emphasis on evidence of one's wishes was disturbing to
the American Medical Association. Nancy Dickey, an AMA
trustee, said, "Written decisions made ahead of time are not
the best way to make choices about health care which is
changing all the time." The ruling, she said, "is a voice
against the right of the doctor and patient to make decisions
at the bedside."
   The court ruling left unresolved a major question related
to the use of living wills. The court's majority said states
don't have to honor the wishes of a patient's family; but the
justices didn't decide what approach states should take when
a patient has designated a surrogate to make health-care
decisions, either through a living will or through a
power-of-attorney appointment. In a separate opinion, Justice
Sandra O'Connor, who joined the majority, said states may be
constitutionally required to recognize the authority of
surrogate decisionmakers.
   The justices recognized for the first time that the
Constitution protects the decision of a person who is
competent to make such judgments to refuse artificial feeding
and water. "That will help fortify the rights of patients,"
said Dr. Dickey.
   The high court ruling came in the case of Nancy Cruzan, 32
years old, who has been unconscious since January 1983, when
her brain was severely damaged by a lack of oxygen after a
car accident in southwestern Missouri. Doctors say she won't
recover but that she could live for 30 years receiving food
and water through a tube. Her condition is described as a
"persistent vegetative state" -- more alert than a coma, but
still unconscious. Her parents want to stop providing food
and water to her, saying that she expressed a desire in the
past not to live after a serious injury if she couldn't
function normally.
   The Missouri Supreme Court refused to cut off her food and
water, finding her intent unclear. The Supreme Court upheld
that decision, saying a state may require a high standard of
proof of a patient's wishes.
   Justice William Brennan dissented, joined by Justices
Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun, saying she has a
fundamental right "to choose to die with dignity." Justice
John Stevens also dissented. (Cruzan vs. Director, Missouri
Department of Health)

   The high court refused to hear Communications Satellite
Corp.'s appeal of a Federal Communications Commission order
requiring the company to refund $38.8 million to
long-distance telephone companies.
   A federal appeals court in the District of Columbia
affirmed the FCC's order in a brief decision in November.
   The FCC said that between Aug. 1, 1984, and Dec. 31, 1986,
Comsat, which provides phone links, earned more than its
authorized 12.48% return on investment. Comsat challenged the
FCC's authority to order refunds and other retroactive
relief.
   In its December 1987 order, the FCC said that Comsat must
deposit the refund in an escrow account, while the FCC
decided how to disburse the money. Nearly all of it would go
to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and other long-distance
carriers, the FCC said, and the agency would order the
carriers to refund it to ratepayers. (Communications

   Trump's Bankers Scramble in Bid to Set
   $65 Million Bailout by Today's Deadline

   NEW YORK -- Donald Trump's bankers raced to try to
complete a $65 million bailout in time to meet a deadline
today, as Mr. Trump personally lobbied recalcitrant bankers
last night.
   Meanwhile, the banks are expected to make available $20
million in interim financing to enable Mr. Trump to make
necessary bond payments today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The banks must let Mr. Trump know whether they have a deal
by 10 a.m. today, participants in the negotiations said. At
that point, he must begin the daylong process of making
interest and principal payments on Trump's Castle bonds.
   Last night, people close to the negotiations grew
optimistic as Mr. Trump apparently persuaded some holdout
banks to go along with the deal. These banks, which weren't
identified, have bought pieces of larger loans issued by
Citicorp and were said to have been persuaded by Mr. Trump's
grasp of his financial situation and his confidence in
turning it around.
   Also last night, Societe General, a French bank that had
purchased a piece of a larger loan issued by Chase Manhattan
Bank, officially agreed to the bailout proposal, leaving West
Germany's Dresdner Bank as the sole holdout among the Chase
syndicate.
   Attorneys for Mr. Trump's major creditors huddled all
yesterday in the law offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp;
Katz, which represents Bankers Trust Corp. Under the
interim-financing proposal, in return for the $20 million Mr.
Trump is expected to give the banks a second lien on
practically every asset that isn't already encumbered,
including Trump Tower and his 50% share of the Grand Hyatt in
Manhattan.
   Mr. Trump needs the money by tonight to cure a default on
a $43 million payment of principal and interest on Trump's
Castle bonds. If the payment is not made by then, bondholders
could foreclose on the property, which could trigger defaults
on other parts of Mr. Trump's vast empire.
   Robert Douglass, Chase Manhattan Corp. vice chairman and
Lawrence Small, Citicorp vice chairman, are said to have
communicated with officials of Dresdner Bank, to try to
persuade the West German institution to agree to the deal.
Dresdner is one of four foreign banks that purchased a
portion of Chase's $75 million first mortgage on Trump Tower
in Manhattan. People close to the deal said the calls didn't
persuade Dresdner officials, though they were hopeful they
could convince the bank by early this morning.
   Both Citibank and Chase are believed to have used the
threat of a loss of future business with the recalcitrant
banks in a bid to induce them to go along with the deal.
   The $20 million interim funding proposal poses something
of a risk for Mr. Trump, people close to the negotiations
said. Mr. Trump is said to be willing to exchange collateral
for the $65 million, because the overall proposal is a
five-year plan that gives him some breathing room. But if Mr.
Trump accepts the $20 million without an iron-clad assurance
that all 70-odd of his lenders have agreed to the proposal,
he risks giving up collateral without buying the necessary
time to work out his problems.
   Mr. Trump could not be reached for comment. The banks
officially declined to comment, as well.
   Bankers involved in the negotiations said it was fairly
common for such workout talks to last until the final
seconds, because all parties are always trying to cut the
best possible deal for themselves. In this case, Dresdner and
Societe General are said to have submitted counterproposals
that would alter the basic structure of Mr. Trump's bailout.
But Mr. Trump's major banks have so far declined to change
the proposal.
   At the heart of the bailout is a restructuring of the way
Mr. Trump does business, and the way he lives his life. One
banker who has examined Mr. Trump's finances said the
developer's annual personal expenses are currently about $10
million.
   Bankers confirmed reports that, as part of the deal, Mr.
Trump would be put on a budget of approximately $450,000 a
month this year, $375,000 a month next year and $300,000 a
month in 1992. Much of that money would be debt service for
Mr. Trump's personal residences, airplanes and boats, bankers
said. Also, Mr. Trump may have to sell the Plaza Hotel in
Manhattan because that would raise the most cash, and the
West Side rail yards because they are considered to be a cash
drain.
   If the final package is approved, Mr. Trump is expected to
shift his focus to Atlantic City, N.J., where he has the
greatest potential for growth. Mr. Trump has agreed to
appoint a chief financial officer for the Trump Organization.
At least two banks have said they also want a chief executive
officer appointed, but Mr. Trump appears to have successfully
thwarted that move.

   High Court Says Minors Can Be Required
   To Tell a Parent Before Getting Abortion

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that states can
require most minors to notify at least one parent before
obtaining an abortion.
   Two court decisions, hailed by abortion opponents, will
stoke abortion controversies in this fall's elections and
could prompt state legislative actions next year to restrict
the right to abortion for minors. The decisions also permit a
half-dozen states to begin enforcing abortion restrictions on
minors that have been blocked by court orders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By a 5-4 margin, the high court ruled it is
unconstitutional for a state to require that a minor notify
both her parents without exceptions. By a different 5-4
margin, the justices said Minnesota had corrected this
constitutional flaw in its state law by allowing minors to
obtain a judge's permission to have an abortion without
notifying her parents.
   In a separate 6-3 decision, the court upheld an Ohio law
that requires notification of one parent or a court
procedure. The court procedure requires a minor to specify
whether she is seeking a judge's approval because she
believes she is mature enough to make her own decisions or
because notifying a parent wouldn't be in her best interest.
The court stopped short of deciding whether such a bypass is
necessary when states impose a one-parent notification
requirement.
   Abortion-rights activists say such parental-involvement
laws are an artifice for curbing abortions rather than a tool
for promoting family discussions. They argue, moreover, that
forcing some young people to consult with their parents on
such a highly emotional subject can cause irreparable
psychological damage in a family or even prompt physical
harm. They also say provisions forcing teens to discuss the
issue with a judge are intimidating and discomfitting.
   "Minors were today's victims," says Roger Evans of Planned
Parenthood Federation of America.
   Abortion opponents said the court ruling would spur
legislative action to curb teen abortions. "Given the great
public popularity of laws that give parents some say when
their young daughters are facing the trauma of a difficult
pregnancy, these decisions will encourage state legislators
to pass additional laws," said Burke Balch, state legislative
director of the National Right to Life Committee.
   Lawmakers and activists in Idaho and Montana already were
moving to place their state laws in line with the guidelines
established by the high court. "We're going to go ahead and
make some adjustments," said GOP state Sen. Mark Ricks, a
leading abortion opponent in Idaho, where a strict
anti-abortion law was vetoed last spring by Democratic Gov.
Cecil Andrus.
   Public support for abortion rights lessens substantially
in cases involving minors, where voters tend to see the issue
as more of a family problem than a question of personal
rights and reproductive freedom. Abortion-rights activists
have avoided making minors' rights the centerpiece of their
movement. Nevertheless, Kate Michelman, executive director of
the National Abortion Rights Action League, called the two
decisions "alarming."
   Many abortion-rights activists have avoided a hard line on
the question of abortion for minors; NARAL assisted Democrat
Douglas Wilder in his successful Virginia gubernatorial race
last year despite his support for parental-involvement
provisions.
   "The court is going through the exact same balancing act
that every candidate is going through: They want to be a
little pro-choice and a little pro-life," said Douglas
Bailey, a Republican political consultant. "If you're a
candidate, the safest position to be in is to be pro-choice
overall but in favor of some parental notification."
   The court's action permits laws to go into effect in at
least six states where they had been blocked: Georgia,
Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, Nebraska and Ohio. Variations of
such laws are already in effect in Arkansas, Utah and West
Virginia.
   Parental-involvement provisions are an issue in the Texas
gubernatorial race, and controversies are certain to flare in
other fall elections, particularly in gubernatorial and
senate races in Iowa. The issue probably will be tested in a
public vote in Oregon.
   The Alan Guttmacher Institute, which formerly was
affiliated with Planned Parenthood, estimates that about
183,000 abortions are performed annually on minors under 18
years of age, roughly 11% of the total performed in the U.S.
Studies show that about half of the minors who get abortions
consult with at least one parent, with three out of four of
those under the age of 15 discussing the issue with a parent.
   "The young women who feel they can talk to their parents
about this situation will do it, and the young women who feel
they can't often have good reasons not to," said Ellen Story,
associate executive director of the Family Planning Council
of Western Massachusetts. "There are abusive family
situations; there are cases when the pregnancy is caused by a
family member; there are instances when this information
could lead to serious health and psychological crises in a
family."
   The rulings marked the first time that Justice Sandra
O'Connor voted to find a state abortion regulation
unconstitutional. She joined the 5-4 Minnesota ruling,
written by Justice John Stevens, that a requirement for
notifying two parents, without an alternative for a court
hearing, is unconstitutional. She also was the deciding vote
to uphold the two-parent Minnesota law once the court
procedure is activated.
   In the past, she has acted to stop the court's
conservatives from overruling the right to abortion, while
joining them to uphold most state restrictions on abortion.
But yesterday "was the first time that she has said the
constitutional liberty of a woman includes the right to
terminate a pregnancy," said Harvard Law School Prof.
Laurence Tribe. That may limit how far Justice O'Connor is
willing to cut back on the right to abortion.
   The decisions showed how divided the court remains over
the issue, taking months to try to reach consensus, yet
producing nine separate opinions in the two cases.
   While the justices said a two-parent-notice law must allow
for a court procedure to bypass the parents, they didn't
decide whether a one-parent-notice law also must allow a
court bypass: They simply upheld Ohio's law, which does
provide for a court procedure. That open question, in Justice
Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in the Ohio case, is
likely to encourage states to pass one-parent-notice laws
without provisions for court hearings, according to both
Prof. Tribe and James Bopp of the National Right To Life
Committee.
   In the Minnesota case, the justices also voted, 6-3, to
uphold a requirement that minors wait 48 hours for an
abortion after notifying their parents.
   In the Minnesota case, Justice Stevens's decision blocking
the absolute two-parent requirement was joined by Justices
O'Connor, William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry
Blackmun. Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Justices Byron White and Antonin Scalia
dissented, voting to uphold the requirement. Separately,
Justice O'Connor joined Justice Kennedy's bloc to uphold the
two-parent requirement once a court hearing provision is
added. The 48-hour wait was agreed to by six members of the
court, with Justices Marshall, Brennan and Blackmun
dissenting.
   In the Ohio case, Justices Blackmun, Brennan and Marshall
dissented from Justice Kennedy's decision. (Hodgson vs.
Minnesota; Ohio vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health.)

   Carter Holt Harvey Ltd., a New Zealand timber and building
materials concern, said it is buying a 52.7% stake in Elders
Resources NZFP Ltd. from Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia for
822.3 million New Zealand dollars (US$482.3 million), part of
a major restructuring of Elders IXL announced in March.
   The sale is conditioned on Elders Resources' selling all
except its forestry-based assets, which requires
authorization by Elders Resources directors and shareholders,
and approval by regulators in New Zealand and Australia,
where Elders Resources has oil, gas and coal interests.
</LP>

   Carter Holt said the base price values the 411,159,696
shares it is buying at NZ$2 each. The final price is
adjustable to between NZ$700 million and NZ$900 million,
depending on the nonforestry assets' sale price. Once the
stake is acquired, a Cart Holt-Elders Resources merger
proposal will be put to holders of both companies.
   Elders IXL's restructuring includes plans to sell
resources and financial-services interests and spin off
agribusiness operations to concentrate on its core brewing
business.

   NEW YORK -- The National Football League Players
Association filed a lawsuit accusing the NFL of illegally
interfering with the union's licensing business.
   In a suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the union
accused the NFL of intimidating potential licensees to stop
doing business with the players' association. It also accused
the league of enticing individual players into breaking their
licensing agreements with the association.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit claims that the NFL is trying to cripple the
union financially by hurting its licensing business, the
union's main source of revenue. Last year, licensing brought
in $6.1 million in revenue for the players' association, the
suit said.
   The suit seeks at least $40 million in damages for the
alleged antitrust violations.
   The suit accused the NFL of threatening the union's
licensees by telling them they wouldn't be allowed to use the
league's own trademarks unless they broke their licensing
agreements with the players' association. It said the NFL
offered to protect the licensees from any legal actions the
union might take as a result of abandoned agreements.
   The suit also charged that the league enticed several
individual players into breaking their agreements with the
association by paying the players $8,500 to $100,000 each to
assign licensing rights to NFL's own licensing arm.
   NFL officials couldn't be reached for comment.

billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income declined 7.9% to 13.02 billion yen from 14.13

extraordinary profits caused by the disposition of reserves
for retirement allowances. As a result, per-share net fell to

   Ciba-Geigy AG, a Swiss chemical group, said present
currency rates are making it harder to reach management's
1990 goal of at least matching last year's profit.
   Hans-Peter Schaer, chief financial officer, declined to
make more specific profit forecasts, saying it was still too
early.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Profits will hinge on developments in currency rates and
on the company's efforts to control costs, Schaer said,
adding that to match last year's group net profit of 1.557
billion Swiss francs ($1.10 billion) is the company's goal.
   Schaer said Ciba-Geigy was not yet planning investment in
factories and fixed assets in Eastern Europe. However, the
company is boosting its marketing and is trading with
companies there.
   Speaking on Eastern Europe to a Zurich business group,
Schaer later predicted that financial risks of investment and
trade will increase for a period, then gradually diminish, as
Eastern European countries reform their economies.
   For large companies with a long-term view, he said, "the
cost of lost opportunities is in all likelihood larger than
the risks to be taken."

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- MGM Grand Air wants to ease one
of the business traveler's greatest burdens: coach-class
travel.
   The small transcontinental luxury airline said it will
begin offering Aug. 16 a new, upgraded service for standard
coach-class fare. For the standard unrestricted Los
Angeles-New York coach fare of $623 one way, MGM Grand Air
will offer such frills as roomy leather seats, telephones,
video monitors and gourmet meals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The airline, a unit of MGM Grand Inc., has offered a
first-class service, at a current unrestricted fare of $1,017
one way, since September 1987.
   The airline's newly reconfigured DC8 Super 62 aircraft
will seat 79, with 39 passengers in first class and 40 in
coach. Those planes will replace MGM Grand's 727-100s and
will nearly double its capacity. The bigger planes prompted
MGM's decision to offer the new service, rather than trying
to fill all seats with first-class passengers.
   The cheaper fare raises questions as to whether MGM
Grand's current clientele will try to save a few bucks by
moving to the back of the plane. Charles Demoney, the
airline's president and chief executive officer, said the
company believes those customers will still want first-class
service.
   Last year, the airline reported a load factor of 73.9%,
and revenue of $30.2 million.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Rep. Gray Remains Dogged by Issue of His Ties
   To Church to Which He Donated Speaking Fees
   ----
   By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Edward T. Pound

CONGRESS (CNG)
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- For Rep. William Gray, it's the
investigation that won't go away.
   Mr. Gray's name was linked a year ago to a
Philadelphia-based criminal inquiry -- unfairly, his attorney
says. But federal agents have continued to ask questions
about his finances. The probing appears to have intensified,
centering, in large part, on his ties to a Philadelphia
church where he is the unpaid senior pastor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for the Bright Hope Baptist Church says that
as far as he can tell the Federal Bureau of Investigation
wants to know whether Mr. Gray, the third-ranking House
Democrat, improperly benefited in any way from speaking fees
he assigned to the church as charitable contributions.
   "It doesn't take a rocket scientist" to see that federal
investigators want to "determine whether the honoraria went
to Bill's church and not to him personally," says Rotan Lee,
the church's attorney. Mr. Lee emphasizes that he doesn't
know of any instance in which speaking fees earmarked for the
church were kept by Mr. Gray or used for his benefit.
   It is unclear what possible law violations might be under
scrutiny. Lawmakers are subject to laws restricting how much
outside earned income, such as speaking fees, they may keep.
In addition, they must comply with guidelines for disclosing
their financial dealings.
   Last year, after word leaked that Mr. Gray had been
visited by FBI agents, the Justice Department publicly
declared he wasn't under investigation -- a statement that
contributed to his election as majority whip, one of the most
important leadership posts in Congress. In addition, Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh initiated a leak investigation
that led to the reassignment of two of his top aides.
   But when asked last week about the status of the Gray
inquiry, a Justice Department spokesman, Dan Eramian,
declined to repeat the earlier statement that Mr. Gray isn't
a target. "I have absolutely nothing to say," he said.
   Rep. Gray declined to be interviewed. Instead, he issued a
four-paragraph statement decrying the "cowardly individuals"
and "shadowy figures" in the Justice Department who, he
charged, were spoonfeeding "false charges" to the media.
   In the statement, Rep. Gray asserted: "Apparently, the
leakers feel they can restore the good name of the Department
of Justice by ruining mine." He added: "Enough is enough. I
will not spend another minute allowing these so-called
Justice Department `sources' to engage me in this type of
nonsense."
   As for the investigation itself, Mr. Gray's attorney, Abbe
Lowell, insists that "the focus is not Bill Gray" but a
Philadelphia accountant, Neil Godick, who once worked for Mr.
Gray's congressional office and who, according to Mr. Lowell,
handled his tax returns and public financial disclosure
forms. From 1981 to 1986, Mr. Gray's congressional office
paid Mr. Godick at least $46,111, according to House records.
   Mr. Godick has been under investigation in Philadelphia
where his accounting firm filed for bankruptcy-law protection
in 1987. A creditor in the bankruptcy-law case accused Mr.
Godick of embezzling $278,000. Mr. Godick's attorney, Marc
Durant, says Mr. Godick has been paying off the debt and
hasn't been charged with a crime.
   Mr. Durant also says the inquiry involving Rep. Gray's
name isn't directed at Mr. Godick at all. "Any suggestion
otherwise is simply unfounded and a diversionary tactic," he
says.
   Federal investigators continue to ask questions about Mr.
Gray and seek documents pertaining to his finances. In a
telephone interview June 12, Mr. Lee, the church's attorney,
said the FBI inquired about the church's "relationship to its
pastor," Mr. Gray.
   Mr. Lee said the FBI questioned two church officials,
Shirley Sharpe, an administrator at Bright Hope, and Lawrence
Wells, head of the board of trustees.
   House records show that Mrs. Sharpe served on Mr. Gray's
congressional payroll as a part-time employee in the 1980s
and has been paid at least $36,500 since 1982. Mrs. Sharpe
declined to comment. William Robinson, who serves on the
board of trustees, also has been on Rep. Gray's congressional
payroll. Mr. Robinson has been paid at least $131,000, mostly
for part-time work, since 1979, House records show. Mr.
Robinson couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Lee also said that FBI agents were given access to
financial records involving Mr. Gray and the church in the
latter part of last year and again early this year. Mr. Lee
said the records included information on speaking fees that
Mr. Gray assigned to the church as well as data on the 1985
sale of his Philadelphia house to Bright Hope.
   A lawyer in private practice in Philadelphia, who is
familiar with the church-FBI situation, gave a similar
account. He said the FBI had asked the church staff about Mr.
Gray's contributions to the church and about the sale of his
house.
   After providing The Wall Street Journal with his account,
Mr. Lee changed it. He said federal agents hadn't seen church
documents or interviewed church officials, at least "to my
knowledge." Mr. Lee said he had spoken with Mr. Gray's chief
of staff, Jon Plebani, but that he wasn't under any pressure
to alter his account and that his initial remarks were
misconstrued. Mr. Plebani says he didn't ask Mr. Lee to
change his account.
   The government's interest in Rep. Gray's sale of his house
apparently was sparked by a story in the Washington Post last
year. The newspaper said the church bought the house for
$125,000, and took out a $100,000 mortgage to pay for it in
1985. That same year, the Post account said, Mr. Gray began
donating some speaking fees to the church, a fact that
suggested he might have been paying the church's mortgage.
   Just how much money Mr. Gray donated to the church isn't
known. Mr. Lee says that the church has been "a major
beneficiary" of charity from Mr. Gray and that he asked the
trustees to make the information available to the Journal.
But the board decided against releasing the information, Mr.
Lee says. Rep. Gray won't provide the information either.
   Mr. Gray has been one of the most active speakers-for-pay
in Congress. In 1989, only one other lawmaker earned more in
speaking fees than Rep. Gray, who made $164,098.17. Under
House rules, members can keep only $26,850 in outside earned
income, or 30% of their congressional pay of $89,500. Mr.
Gray kept $25,000, according to his disclosure statement, and
donated the rest to charities. His office declined to
identify the charities, other than the church and Burke,
Va.-based Kids Inc., where Mr. Gray's wife, Andrea, works as
a part-time fund-raiser and events planner.
   Investigators have sought information on speaking fees
Rep. Gray has given to Kids -- some $16,200 since 1986, his
staff says. That's the equivalent of about one-fourth of the
$60,000 in salary that Kids paid Mrs. Gray from 1987 to 1989.
   This spring, a federal grand jury in Philadelphia issued
subpoenas on Washington lobbying groups that paid honoraria
to Rep. Gray. The subpoenas sought data on any payments to
Mr. Gray, his wife and to charities. Some subpeonas named
Kids and the Bright Hope church and sought data from 1984 to
the present. The subpoenas were disclosed in May by
Congressional Quarterly magazine.
   Kids was established in 1984 and has been supported by a
number of congressmen and senators. Kids, which tries to
fulfill the dreams of gravely ill children, says Mrs. Gray is
one of two paid employees.

   Motorola Inc. is gambling that the world needs a new
cellular phone system that uses dozens of low-orbit
satellites to connect people in remote spots to the rest of
the planet.
   The system, to be announced with fanfare today at the
Hayden Planetarium in New York, would cost $2.1 billion to
fully put in space as early as 1996. "We think this is the
way of the future," said John F. Mitchell, Motorola's vice
chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the 77-satellite system -- which the company has
dubbed "Iridium" -- faces big obstacles. Among other things,
the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics and semiconductor company
needs partners, money, regulatory approval and customers to
make it work.
   The way Motorola sees it, a call from a portable cellular
phone in the middle of nowhere -- beyond the range of current
cellular systems -- would be routed through the
"constellation" of small satellites. That would give the
business person in the boondocks and the skipper at sea
instant, clear contact with anyone else -- and vice versa.
   The Iridium system would use digital switching and
transmission to handle both voices and data. But it wouldn't
replace the current land-based cellular system. That means
Motorola could continue to sell existing equipment even as it
pushes expensive new equipment necessary to make calls on the
new system.
   A big risk is that consumers will get confused. Craig O.
McCaw, chairman of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cellular phone service company, noted that
cellular is growing and changing faster than anyone dreamed
just a few years ago. "All of us have a lot of work to do to
see how all these {different networks} are going to fit
together."
   Still, Mr. McCaw said his company is "excited" at the
potential of the new system to provide universal phone
coverage.
   Others think Motorola's new system is closer to
pie-in-the-sky than satellites-in-the-sky. "This may have
some applications for {airline} flight communications
services and in countries where there is limited service, but
there's no way I can see this technology will be viable
anywhere in the U.S.," said Herschel Shosteck, president of
Herschel Shosteck Associates Ltd., a Silver Spring, Md., firm
that specializes in cellular market analysis.
   He noted that by 1992 -- before Iridium is expected to
transmit its first call -- more than 90% of the people in the
U.S. and Canada will have access to regular cellular service.
This will be augmented by the first high-capacity digital
systems. And most of Western Europe will have similar
coverage.
   Motorola expects the mobile and portable terminals that it
would make for the system to cost "as low as" $3,000. Though
Motorola expects the price to fall over time, Mr. Shosteck
notes that today's cellular phones are far cheaper at $400 to
$500.
   Motorola also must get other companies or countries to
participate in a consortium to operate and pay for the $2.1
billion space portion of the system. Motorola might put up as
much as 20% of that total, but John Pemberton, a mobile
communications analyst at Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.,
says the cost is far higher than he expected.
   In addition, operators of the new network face the
daunting task of getting new licenses from the Federal
Communications Commission and other international bodies to
operate a satellite network in the new frequency.
   And since current cellular systems operate at a different
frequency, existing phones "would have to be programmed to
operate with the new frequency," said Gregory J. Vogt, chief
of the FCC's Mobile Services Bureau. "That could be a very
expensive proposition" for customers, he said. Motorola
brushed aside such concern, saying it would design its system
to be compatible with all cellular phones.
   Still, Motorola's plan isn't being taken lightly. "They're
a well-established company" both in working with regulators
and coming up with money, said Mr. Pemberton of the Gartner
Group. He says there's an 85% chance that the system will
fly.
   In contrast to larger communications satellites now in
high orbit, the Motorola plan calls for small, low-orbit
satellites that would allow easy radio links with portable
cellular phones and clear sound with no delays or "echoes."
It envisions 600,000 to 800,000 users in the first five
years, and millions more after that.
   The company says it's investing $40 million to $60 million
to help prove the concept. But it sees itself mainly as a
supplier to the system. Motorola's ambitious schedule calls
for the launch of two demonstration satellites in 1992.
   Motorola said the U.S. Delta and Atlas rockets and the
European Ariane could launch multiple satellites, and the
Pegasus air-launched vehicle could send up individual
satellites.
   The company said three organizations have agreed to study
the potential of the satellite network: American Mobile
Satellite Corp., which is licensed to provide mobile
communications by satellite for the U.S. (and in which McCaw
Cellular is a partner); and Telesat Mobile Inc., which has
similar authorization for Canada; and the International
Maritime Satellite Organization, a consortium that provides
satellite communications for ships and aircraft. The maritime
group's director general, Olof Lundberg, said it will study
the system as a possible successor to its existing satellite
network.
   Motorola also said it has briefed the FCC on its plans and
talked with potential partners. "The technical effort is
going on full bore," said Mr. Mitchell. "By the end of this
year, or early next year, we'll have a much clearer picture
of who the players will be."

   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. removed New Jersey's
triple-A general obligation and related agency bonds from a

after the state Legislature passed a series of
revenue-raising measures.
   On March 19, S&amp;P had placed New Jersey on its CreditWatch
list with negative implications, after Gov. James Florio's
budget indicated a "substantial gap-closing" measure would be
needed to balance the budget. Over the weekend, the
Legislature approved a package that included a $1.5 billion
increase in revenue from a boost in the state's sales taxes
and a $1.3 billion increase in revenue from a rise in the
state's income tax.

   "We had fiscal concerns that they took quick action to

   Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd., a London unit of
Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., said a
step-out, or appraisal, well in the Saltire field in the
North Sea indicates the field's estimated recoverable oil
reserves are 30% greater than formerly believed, or about 130
million barrels.
   Previously, the field's recoverable reserves of
high-quality oil were estimated at 100 million barrels.

   Occidental said the appraisal well had flows at stabilized
daily rates of 9,635 barrels of oil and 13 million cubic feet
of gas.
   The Occidental unit said the test-well results also
indicate that the Saltire field, about 120 miles northeast of
Aberdeen, Scotland, is larger than previously believed. As a
result, the company will seek Britain's approval to develop
the field, starting next fall, at an estimated cost of $600
million. Production is expected to begin in the second half
of 1992. Occidental is the well operator and holds a 36.5%
interest in it.

which recently produced "Total Recall," prevailed.
   Mr. Eszterhas, author of "Flashdance," "Music Box" and

   IBM Stirs Up Market With Plans to Unveil
   Home Computer That Will Be Easy to Use

   International Business Machines Corp.'s scheduled
announcement today of a new home computer is stirring up the
computer market as only IBM can.
   Computer makers who are chasing the elusive home market
say IBM's attempt to make the machines easy to use, even for
novices, makes some sense. Dealers and consultants add that
IBM's prices are reasonably aggressive and that it seems to
have thought through many of the delicate marketing issues.
As a result, it appears that IBM has at least a limited
success on its hands.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, as IBM provided details of the new
machines' "specs" to reporters in interviews yesterday, some
competitors and consultants disparaged the new computers'
capabilities and raised the specter of the PCjr, IBM's
much-ridiculed and unsuccessful attempt to crack the home
market in the mid-1980s. The competitors and consultants
especially argued that it is too awkward to add circuit
boards to the new machines to expand their computing power.
   "These machines are all marketing and no technology," says
Fred Davis, director of the testing laboratory at PC
Magazine, one of the trade publications whose reviews
influence the sales of personal-computer products.
   As widely expected, the announcement says the machines use
the moderately powerful Intel Corp. 80286 processor. List
prices for the line will run from $1,000 to $2,000 and the
systems will range from a computer with a black-and-white
monitor and no hard disk drive to a computer with a color
monitor and a 30-megabyte hard disk. Actual selling prices
will be somewhat lower than list prices, but discounts may be
only half the size of the 25% discounts that are common on
most personal computers.
   All the systems will have a fairly fast modem for talking
with other computers across phone lines. In addition, IBM is
including the software for the Prodigy videotext service that
it and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. have set up for users to shop by
computer and to gather information electronically.
   The new IBM computers also include a "mouse" pointing
device, for moving the cursor around the screen, and
Microsoft Works, a software package that lets users do a
little bit of everything from word processing to spreadsheets
and data bases. Some of the basic software is loaded in
chips, so the system actually presents the user with a
meaningful screen as soon as it is turned on instead of just
staring back blankly.
   IBM will sell the machines through many of its current
dealers. But it also is taking a bold gamble and will attempt
to sell the complex machines through department stores. The
company says computers should become as ubiquitous as
microwave ovens and video cassette records and thus will need
to be distributed the same way as appliances. It adds that
most of its regular dealers aren't open when people are
buying home computers -- Thursday and Friday nights and on
weekends.
   IBM says it will sell through nearly 1,000 Sears,
Dayton-Hudson and Dillard stores nationwide when the new
machines become widely available in September. This summer,
as a sort of shakedown cruise, IBM will sell limited
quantities through those department stores and dealers in
Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Dallas-Fort Worth.
   IBM will toss in more service than is generally available
for home computers. It will promise to replace faulty
hardware within 48 hours, for instance. The company also will
offer extensive facilities for people to dial into the
Prodigy service to get answers to questions such as how to
use the software that comes with the system.
   IBM also promises not to point any fingers at the
developers of the software, either; one of the biggest
headaches in getting service these days seems to be that
every company a user calls blames a problem on someone else
who made some of the system's hardware or software.
   "It's the wrong approach to expect people to become
computer-literate," says Alan Hald, chairman of MicroAge
Inc., a big computer chain. "It makes much more sense to make
computers human-literate, and IBM seems to be taking some
steps in that direction."
   There are also some consumer trends that seem to be
working in IBM's favor. Link Resources Corp., a
market-research firm, says the number of U.S. households with
a personal computer is growing 10% a year. Only about 40% of
that market currently is taken by IBM-compatible machines but
that percentage is expected to grow considerably, as people
take more work home from the IBM-compatible machines they use
at the office.
   Jim Cannavino, the general manager of IBM's
personal-computer and workstation group, is even more
optimistic than Link. He says that 20 million U.S. households
now have PCs and that the number could double within five
years.
   "The home market is too big to ignore," he says.
   Still, IBM may face a withering series of comparisons by
competitors on price and performance. IBM-compatible "clones"
that are somewhat more powerful than the new machines
currently are available for at least $400 less than IBM's
most powerful system. In addition, these clones include
so-called expansion slots for additional circuit boards that
can, for example, let the computer also function as a
facsimile machine. IBM's new systems, called the PS/1 line,
have most of the features that normally require a slot
already built in, but anyone wanting to go beyond these
features must buy a $169 piece of hardware that includes
three open slots.
   "You have to give people a way to expand," complains Tim
Bajarin, a consultant at Creative Strategies Research
International. "The PC magazines are going to have a field
day with this."
   IBM also could run into some snags with its customer
service. While extensive, the service requires that people be
comfortable dialing into an electronic system that might
confound a novice computer user.
   There are potential problems with IBM's existing dealers,
too. Matt Fitzsimmons, owner of a ComputerLand store in White
Plains, N.Y., says he likes the new system but adds that
"dealers' greatest fear is that someone will come in and make
you explain how this differs from everything else in IBM's
product line -- and then go off and buy the machine at a
lower price from one of the mass merchandisers."
   Even if the PS/1 becomes a rip-roaring success,
consultants say competitors such as Tandy Corp. should do
well, too. "I think IBM will generate a lot of interest at
the low end," says Bobby Orbach, who recently founded a
computer and software marketing consulting firm. "Not only
will IBM sell a lot of boxes, but other companies will, too."
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, IBM
rose 37.5 cents to $116.625.

   Taiwan Glass Co. has postponed a convertible-bond issue,
and analysts said the delay was prompted by the long slide in
the Taipei stock market.
   The issue by Taiwan Glass, a tightly managed company that
dominates the Taiwanese domestic glass market, would have
been the nation's second convertible-bond issue open to
foreign investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Late last year, Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Co.
became the first Taiwan company to issue a convertible bond
marketed overseas. Though foreigners are prohibited from
directly owning shares of Taiwan companies, and though the
conversion premium on the Yuen Foong Yu issue was a steep
50%, overseas investors snapped up the bonds. Many bought
them in the belief that the government will change
regulations to allow foreign ownership of Taiwan shares
before the conversion date on the issue. (The premium is the
amount the price of the bond must increase to make conversion
to the issuer's shares on a fixed date profitable.)
   However, the Taipei stock market has lost more than 50% of
its value since the start of the year, and the Yuen Foong Yu
bonds have fallen to a deep discount to their issue price.
   Taiwan Glass said it is postponing its issue because it is
intended to fund construction of a plant in Malaysia that is
still awaiting Malaysian government approval, according to
analysts in Taipei. However, these same analysts said market
conditions likely played a large role in Taiwan Glass's
decision.

   The justices, providing legislators another opening to
curtail abortion rights, ruled that states can require most
minors to notify at least one parent before obtaining an
abortion. However, the high court said mandating notification
of both parents may interfere with the constitutional right
to abortion. Separately, the court ruled 5-4 that states may
require clear proof that a patient in a vegetative state
wishes to die before allowing food and water tubes to be

   MANDELA URGED Bush to support efforts to end apartheid in

   The black nationalist leader, who met for three hours with

force wouldn't be used as long as the South African

   Chinese officials permitted Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li
Shuxian, to leave Beijing for Britain on a U.S. military
plane. Fang, an astrophysicist and human-rights advocate, and
his wife took sanctuary in the U.S. Embassy after last June's
crackdown on a prodemocracy movement. China's official news
agency said the pair were given "lenient treatment" so that
they could receive medical care abroad. Fang is said to have
a heart ailment.
   The U.S. declared, "This humanitarian action is a

   NEW YORK -- A securities trader accused of helping set up
$4 billion in rigged U.S. securities transactions was
sentenced to one year and a day in prison for conspiring to
defraud the U.S.
   The trader, Paul Foont, 51 years old, of Manhattan,
pleaded guilty in April. Jeffrey Feldman, 42, of Skillman,
N.J., also pleaded guilty in the scheme and is to be
sentenced July 5 in federal court in Manhattan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Foont was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Charles
Haight. He could be eligible for parole after serving four
months.
   Mr. Foont was head trader for a series of limited
partnerships called the Cralin partnerships. Mr. Feldman was
a principal and promoter of the partnerships. The U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan charged that the partnerships
were used in the pre-arranged transactions to create phony
losses for tax deductions of about $140 million. The
partnerships were marketed to investors for their tax
benefits, and investors didn't know that the tax losses
weren't legitimate, prosecutors said.
   Because the crime occurred in the early 1980s, new federal
sentencing guidelines don't apply in this case. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary said that under the new
guidelines, Mr. Foont would have been sentenced to 63 to 78
months in prison.

   NEW YORK -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. won a skirmish
in its court battle concerning bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. that
were issued before the food and tobacco company's late-1988
leveraged buy-out.
   Met Life, which owns about $240 million of RJR's old
bonds, filed suit in 1988 arguing that the buy-out hurt the
value of the old bonds and broke pledges made to bondholders.
Among the remedies sought by Met Life was early repayment of
the bonds, some of which don't come due until 2016.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court overturned a lower-court ruling to
which Met Life had objected. Met Life wants to start a 60-day
clock running in which RJR must cure the alleged default on
its bonds or face a series of steps that bondholders can
take. RJR had asked a lower court to, in effect, freeze the
clock until its claim can be heard that there hasn't been any
default.
   The lower court had granted RJR an open-ended injunction.
But yesterday's appeals court ruling disallowed that
injunction and directed the lower court to resume
proceedings.
   A decisive verdict in the Met Life suit still is a long
way off. Both sides are expected to file briefs with the
federal district court this summer. The district judge,
Michael B. Mukasey, isn't expected to hear the case until
October and isn't expected to rule until early 1991. Whatever
his verdict, it's likely to be appealed, and that could take
another 18 months or longer.

   U.S. Issues
   Payout Rules
   For Thrifts

   WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision issued
rules spelling out how much thrifts can pay in dividends, a
move that OTS Director Timothy Ryan said was intended to make
thrifts more attractive to buyers and investors.
   Mr. Ryan also said he intends to issue a policy in the
next several days outlining when the OTS will disclose
administrative charges brought by the agency against thrift
executives. The decision could affect whether the thrift
office airs its case against Neil Bush, the president's son,
regarding his actions as a director of a failed Colorado
thrift.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the dividend policy, thrifts that currently meet
capital standards that are due to take effect in 1995 can pay
all their net income and half their surplus capital -- or
capital in excess of the 1995 requirements -- in dividends.
Thrifts that meet current capital standards but not the 1995
standard can pay dividends totaling 25% to 75% of their net,
depending on how close they are to the 1995 requirement.
Thrifts that fall below current capital requirements can't
pay dividends without specific approval from the OTS.
   About 1,200 thrifts with $215 billion in assets, or 20% of
the industry's total assets, currently meet the 1995 capital
requirements. The new policy takes the place of a complicated
mix of regulations under which undercapitalized thrifts
generally weren't allowed to pay dividends. In the past,
applications by thrifts to pay dividends were often handled
on a case-by-case basis.
   Mr. Ryan said the policy was intended to make it clear to
investors that they can get a return through dividends. "We
need to provide for thrifts to increase capital, but we also
need to provide some attractiveness to investors," he said.
"The value of the thrift charter is very much in question,"
he added, referring to the reluctance of investors to buy the
hundreds of insolvent thrifts the government is selling off.
Buyers of insolvent thrifts are required to bring them into
compliance with capital standards.
   The OTS also said it plans this week to propose relaxing,
during a transitional period, limits on the size of loans
thrifts can make to an individual borrower. Last year's
thrift-bailout law limited loans to an individual borrower to
15% of the thrift's capital. Previously, the limit was 100%
of capital. The restriction has sparked controversy in the
real estate industry, where many say it has forced lenders to
turn down economically viable projects.
   Mr. Ryan also said he is working on a policy governing
when the OTS will announce administrative charges brought
against thrift executives. Currently, final judgments against
individuals are announced, but regulators don't announce
charges, for fear of the possible effects on a thrift. In the
case of failed thrifts, Mr. Ryan said, that wouldn't be a
consideration.
   Some congressional Democrats have pushed for the OTS to
announce details of its conflict-of-interest charges against
Neil Bush, who was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings &amp;
Loan Association in Denver. Mr. Bush has denied any
wrongdoing.

   WASHINGTON -- House and Senate conferees approved
legislation that would bar discrimination against handicapped
individuals on a broad front, including public accommodations
and employment.
   The bill was approved by wide margins in both chambers,
and if the conference version passes the House and Senate, it
is expected to be signed by President Bush. Known as the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the measure would extend to
about 43 million disabled persons the kind of protection
against discrimination now afforded by a patchwork of state
and local rules and in requirements for federal contractors
and grant recipients.

   The conferees killed an amendment in the House bill that
specified that food companies could transfer workers with
contagious diseases to jobs that didn't involve handling
food. The amendment dealt with employer concerns about
employees with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Senate conferees ignored a nonbinding resolution passed by
the Senate, instructing them to accede to the House
amendment. They quoted Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan that the AIDS-causing virus cannot be
transmitted by handling food and that an amendment based on
public "fears and misconceptions" would only complicate
efforts to control the disease.
   The Senate conferees also noted that both the bill and
existing law already allow employers to transfer or fire
workers who pose a direct threat to the health and safety of
others.

   EUROPEAN COURT bars sexual discrimination in pension
plans.
   In a decision binding throughout the 12-nation European
Community, the European Court of Justice says companies can't
set different pension benefits for men and women. The U.S.
Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion a decade ago. But
consultant Kwasha Lipton says the European decision is likely
to have a sharper impact than the U.S. ruling because more
plans there, following the lead of local social security
laws, have a built-in sex bias. Social security laws aren't
affected by the ruling.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sharpest impact could come in Britain, where women get
full retirement benefits at age 60 while men must wait until
65. Pension plans in Belgium, Greece and Portugal also may
have to be rewritten. And U.S. companies operating in Europe
won't be exempt from the change. "Most multinationals will
have to redesign their European subsidiaries' retirement
programs," says Towers Perrin, another consulting firm.
   The ruling means "companies face sharp rises in pension
liabilities," Towers Perrin says.
                                                                                                       

   JOBLESS INSURANCE reserves could be inadequate for
recession.
   The congressional General Accounting Office says the
federal-state unemployment-pay system -- financed mostly by
payroll taxes on employers -- has accumulated substantial
reserves in the past seven years of economic expansion: $36.2
billion in state trust funds and $8.1 billion in federal
accounts as of January. Yet, a severe recession next year
could force 22 states to borrow $17.4 billion through 1995
and 17 of these states still wouldn't have enough money to
cover benefits, the GAO says.
   States could respond as they have in the past: "making it
more difficult for people to qualify for benefits, reducing
the duration of such benefits and increasing employer taxes,"
the agency declares. Employers now pay varying amounts to
states to pay for actual benefits. The federal government
taxes employers up to $5.60 a year for each worker to finance
state and federal administrative costs, loans to states and
one-half of an extended benefits program.
                                                                                                       

   EDUCATIONAL reimbursements thrive despite confusion and
uncertainty.
   It's seen more cliffhangers than a Perils of Pauline
serial, but tax code Section 127 continues to entice
companies to subsidize at least part of the tuition of
workers going to school. As written now, the tax code lets
workers escape income tax on up to $5,250 a year reimbursed
by their employers for basic education and undergraduate
programs; M.B.A. and other graduate courses aren't covered.
But the law expires Sept. 30, and its fate is no more clear
now than at a series of other expirations in recent years.
   Consultant Hewitt Associates says nearly one in 10 workers
uses the tax break. At General Motors Corp., participation by
hourly workers dropped to 6% last year from 12% in 1987,
before graduate programs were banned. But Freeport-McMoRan
Inc. goes beyond the IRS limits and reimburses all expenses;
firms can deduct the payments as compensation even if the
workers can't exclude the income from their returns. Corning
Inc.'s assistance ranges from high school night classes to
full-time study.
   Ford Motor Co. pays 100% for any course approved by a
boss: "Education makes a better employee," it says.
                                                                                                       

   RECRUITERS NEED four months to fill jobs, a month longer
than a year ago, because candidates are wary of switching
positions, says Executive Search Review.
                                                                                                       

   MOST COMPANIES rely on a job applicant's ability to

   ENGINEER JOBS are hardest hires. But companies get by.
   One of three "toughest-to-fill" positions on recruiter
hiring lists are engineering posts, says the Professional
Employment Research Council. So companies search wider to get
the talent they need. "We hired all we wanted but it took
longer than usual and we had to work harder," says
International Paper Co. Armstrong World Industries Inc. ends
up talking to 97 candidates for 21 jobs, up from 63
interviews a year ago when it had 22 positions to fill.
   General Electric Co. says it's been "extremely pleased
this year with the quality and quantity" of candidates, but
it allows that cutbacks in other industries may be helping it
attract from among a slimmer number of graduates. Black &amp;
Decker Corp. says it, too, hasn't had any recruiting
problems. "Our brand awareness and reputation" helps, the
company suggests.
   QMS Inc. says being one of the few employers of high-tech
engineers in southern Alabama aids its quest.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Telling it like it is: Harris Bank, in a
news release announcing that 320 workers are going to be
fired, inserts a "note to editors" cautioning that "no one at
Harris will receive a `pink slip'; everyone will be informed
in person." . . . A news release we never finished reading:
"The majority of 1990 college graduates are not in the top
10% of their class."

   WASHINGTON -- Last week the federal government held a pep
rally for its prosecutors.
   President Bush attended the Friday session, promising with
the help of the assembled U.S. Attorneys a new crackdown on
savings-and-loan criminals. Three times the lawmen stood to
applaud the boss. Then the Marine Corps Band struck up "God
Bless America."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But earlier last week, in a nondescript federal office
building in Dallas, the real work of trying to put S&amp;L crooks
in jail was being carried out by Murray Neighbors and Russell
Shelton of the Internal Revenue Service. And they were in no
mood for cheering.
   The two investigators unfurled a three-by-four-foot
schematic diagram of a $32 million Texas S&amp;L loan gone bad.
The pyramid-shaped map of intersecting arrows, circles and
dollar signs showed how dozens of insiders, real-estate
developers and middlemen purportedly looted the thrift by
means of the complex loan arrangement.
   The IRS team has tracked this one loan for 2 1/2 years.
With a little luck and a few cooperating witnesses, there may
be as many as 15 indictments in the case -- a year from now.
   Even then, the charges will probably be narrow tax-evasion
counts -- not the kind of sweeping fraud charges that
taxpayers are clamoring for. Finding enough solid evidence to
prove a larger conspiracy allegation "could take the rest of
our lives," Mr. Neighbors says glumly. "We've been through
millions of {pages of} documents already."
   If there were an S&amp;L equivalent of "Hawaii Five-O," it
would be in Dallas, the apparent epicenter of S&amp;L fraud and
now the showcase of the federal crackdown. But in a close-up
look at a successful prosecution, it's clear why so few of
the perpetrators have so far gone to jail. The bottom line:
There's no smoking gun or hidden-camera videotape in an S&amp;L
heist. The evidence is a complex paper trail, a chain of
evidence that's usually ice-cold by the time prosecutors lay
their hands on it.
   "Incriminating stuff doesn't just roll off the truck,"
says Michael Santimauro, an FBI supervisor in Dallas, where a
multiagency task force has filled 14,000 square feet of
office and warehouse space with subpoenaed documents.
   What's more, no matter how many convictions the government
piles up, little of the tens of billions of dollars lost in
the nation's S&amp;L debacle will ever be recovered. Criminal
fines and court-ordered restitution in a given case rarely
exceed several million dollars. And big chunks of the thrift
industry's losses are sunk into failed shopping malls and
empty condominium developments. Most failed S&amp;Ls didn't
collapse directly because of criminal activity; egregious
mismanagement and feckless regulation were more often the
culprits.
   Still, American taxpayers, bracing for decades of higher
taxes from the scandal, demand to know whether those who did
steal money from the loosely regulated S&amp;Ls are being brought
to justice. Thus, both Democrats and Republicans increasingly
fixate on the criminal aspect of the S&amp;L debacle, imbuing the
issue with fiercely partisan hyperbole and outright
misstatement.
   Democrats charge that the Bush administration has been
soft on S&amp;L crime. "Not one indictment has been handed down,"
says Rep. John Tanner of Tennessee.
   That statement is wrong. The three-year-old Dallas task
force, after early organizational troubles, has in fact
brought charges against 77 people and obtained 52
convictions, with only two acquittals. Increasingly,
defendants are getting prison terms, including a 30-year
sentence for the former chief of the defunct Vernon Savings &amp;
Loan in Dallas.
   At the same time, though, President Bush has exaggerated
the adequacy of the federal dragnet. In Denver, for instance,
where 30 failed financial institutions are under criminal
investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigaton doesn't
have "anywhere near the people we need to keep up," says the
area's special agent in charge, Robert Pence. "Do we have a
large backlog?" asks Denver U.S. Attorney Michael Norton.
"Yes, we have a big backlog."
   In Oklahoma, U.S. Attorney Tim Leonard has a mere five
lawyers available to supervise some 40 investigations in
Oklahoma City alone. Until very recently, he acknowledges,
"these cases were stagnating."
   The Bush administration's claim that it has responded
sufficiently to the avalanche of S&amp;L cases even has been
undercut by the Justice Department's own calculations. In a
study of 59 field offices last year, the FBI concluded it
needed 425 new agents to begin work on some 2,300 languishing
thrift fraud and embezzlement cases. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh has since deployed 202 additional agents -- fewer
than half of what the FBI requested.
   A look at the government's successful INFOUR investigation
-- named for the "infamous four" institutions controlled by
Sammy Wayne Spikes, a West Texas wheeler-dealer, illustrates
just how difficult these S&amp;L cases are.
   The Spikes case dates to 1984, when four of the
financier's banks went belly up almost at once. Banking
regulators came in to clean up the mess -- making sure that
depositors were made whole, for instance. But while the
regulators have civil police powers, they aren't criminal
investigators. That job belongs to the FBI.
   In January 1985, the regional FBI office in Dallas began
sorting through dozens of referrals from the regulators --
all suggesting areas of inquiry, such as suspicious-looking
loans, but that's it. Regulators typically don't look for, or
pass along, specific incidents of criminal misconduct.
   The number of these pending referrals lies at the heart of
the burgeoning partisan conflict in Washington. Congressional
Democrats, eager to embarrass the Bush administration, have
stressed that the FBI has a backlog of nearly 7,000 criminal
referrals from S&amp;L regulators.
   But agents in the field insist that many of these alerts
describe stupid or negligent business practices, falling well
short of possibly illegal conduct. "We've got to have a
reasonable belief that a crime has been committed," says
Thomas Rupprath, a senior FBI agent in Dallas.
   With their limited manpower, investigators perform a kind
of legal triage, saving and throwing out referrals on the
basis of whether they can be easily and quickly tied to a
specific criminal statute. Another consideration is which
referrals will get the attention of the prosecuting attorney.
In the Spikes case, regulators repeatedly referred cases in
which the thrifts exceeded their lending limits. But the FBI
ruled out such referrals. To interest a busy prosecutor,
"you'd have to have something with a lot more meat on it,"
explains Dale Hogue, one of three FBI agents assigned to the
case.
   Like some of his colleagues with the Dallas task force,
Mr. Hogue, a 14-year veteran, has an accounting degree and
experience working on conventional financial fraud cases. The
Spikes case went far beyond his training and expertise. This
wasn't embezzlement -- something that the FBI is
well-equipped to investigate. This was essentially a
real-estate case -- involving home-grown transactions the
likes of which he had never seen during an earlier post
investigating bank fraud in Boston.
   "I felt like I was going back to school," he says.
   The Spikes case sent him chasing down numerous blind
alleys. He began stitching together other suspicious-looking
transactions, including cases where Mr. Spikes appeared to be
shuttling bad loans from one institution to another, keeping
just one step ahead of the regulators. The agent spent months
issuing subpoenas and deciphering records. But he ultimately
abandoned that aspect of the investigation because it seemed
too complicated to explain to a jury.
   The winnowing process involved several million pages of
personal financial statements, loan applications, canceled
checks, land title statements -- even divorce records, which
revealed the location of houses and bank accounts. The
investigations consumed three offices on the fourth floor of
the federal building in Lubbock. "We took off Christmas Day,
New Year's Day and I think Thanksgiving," recalls Roger
McRoberts, an assistant U.S. Attorney.
   Although the proof lies in the paperwork, in this as in
all criminal cases the best leads often come from human
beings, not documents. In this case, the vengeful ex-wife of
a Spikes associate described some kind of funny business
involving a land transaction. "She was wrong on all the facts
-- the state, the people and land involved, everything -- but
she did know the name of a lawyer" who was familiar with the
deal, recalls Mr. Hogue. The lawyer, in turn, named a
now-defunct Colorado thrift called Key Savings &amp; Loan. The
thrift, they found, had made a large loan integral to a
complex and illegal set of transactions called a land flip.
   The participants had set up a series of dummy corporations
to buy and sell 8,000 acres of useless New Mexico desert. The
fraudulent exchanges, orchestrated by Mr. Spikes and some of
his cronies, pushed the real estate's "price" from $800,000
to nearly $4 million, increasing its value as collateral. The
greater the collateral, the greater the sums that could be --
and were -- borrowed against it.
   "You don't have to be real sophisticated to understand
that, so we went with it," says Mr. McRoberts.
   Elapsed time so far: two years.
   Mr. Hogue relied on his accounting experience to create
ornate handwritten spreadsheets on each participant's
day-to-day financial dealings. One tracked dozens of
high-flying deals made by a shill for Mr. Spikes who was
himself on the edge of bankruptcy but was still getting a
surprising amount of bank and thrift credit.
   Rather than leaving that entire aspect of the case to some
financial esoterica, the prosecutors struck a deal with the
borrower -- under which he pleaded guilty to lesser charges
and provided essential testimony for the government.
   In the end, Mr. Spikes also pleaded guilty in December
1986, and is now serving a 10-year term in Big Springs Prison
Camp south of Lubbock. Three defendants went to trial, where
prosecutors had to balance simplicity against the demand to
prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. It wasn't easy.
Complex appraisals, some of them fraudulent, had been
conducted on the New Mexico real estate involved in the land
flip. But what prosecutors say grabbed the jury were the
photographs of sand and sagebrush -- land supposedly worth $4
million. The three were convicted in 1987.
   The best cases are the "live" ones -- the referrals
involving actual crimes under way at the time, when
witnesses' recollections are strong and when the suspects
have left fresh tracks through the paper trails.
Unfortunately, the opportunity for most such prosecutions has
come and gone. Prosecutors realized too late that
deregulation of the thrift industry, beginning in 1980, would
inevitably create new opportunities for wrongdoing.
   "With 20-20 hindsight, it seems maybe law enforcement
should have been better prepared," says Dallas U.S. Attorney
Marvin Collins, a Republican named by former President
Reagan. "But at the time, that didn't occur to people. It
certainly didn't occur to me."
   To the investigators, there are rewards even from a
conviction on narrow grounds after years of work. "We take
this personally here," says Mr. Neighbors of the IRS. "I
bought a house here a few years ago that's worth about
$25,000 less now because of this S&amp;L bull."

   Aequitron Recalls Machines to Monitor
   Respiration and Heart Rates of Infants

<LP>
   MINNEAPOLIS -- Aequitron Medical Inc. said it is recalling
thousands of machines that are used primarily to monitor the
respiration and heart rates of infants.
   The move, disclosed in an earnings report, is the second
time in two years that the medical device company has had to
recall monitors to fix faulty alarm systems. The monitors are
designed to set off an audible alarm if it detects irregular
respiration or heart rate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As in the March 1988 recall, the company said it isn't
aware of any deaths or injuries related to malfunctioning
monitors. A spokesman for the company said Aequitron detected
the latest problems itself.
   The spokesman also said the these latest recalls aren't
related to an out-of-court settlement it reached earlier this
spring with a Corpus Christi, Texas, couple who had claimed
that their baby died because an Aequitron monitor allegedly
failed. The couple also testified before a congressional
subcommittee investigating the medical instruments industry.
   The spokesman for Aequitron said the inspector general's
office of the Department of Health and Human Services
subpoenaed some of the company's monitors last winter and
that they were eventually returned to the company. The
spokesman said the company isn't aware of the status of any
inquiry by the department.
   "As far as we know, nothing is going on," he said.
   Two years ago, the company told hospitals and families to
run the model 9200 Respiration and Heart Rate Monitors on
house electrical current instead of batteries because some
machines appeared to malfunction when used in a certain
voltage range.
   This time, the problem seems to be that electro-magnetic
emissions can interfere with the monitor. What's more, the
respiration alarm on some monitors doesn't produce the steady
sound that its designers intended.
   The problems involve its 8200 apnea model and its 9200
apnea model. The spokesman said that the company doesn't know
how many of the 21,000 monitors are still being used.
   In a release about its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, the
company disclosed that it voluntarily decided to alert the
users of the monitors after discussions with the Food and
Drug Administration.
   Aequitron said it is making available to owners a kit that
is designed to reduce the sensitivity of the monitors to
electro-magnetic interference. The company said it is also
telling dealers to return monitors so it can repair the
faulty respiration alarm.
   The company said it established a $375,000 reserve to
cover the expenses of its action.
   The one-time charge for the reserve was included in the
results the company announced for the fourth quarter ended
April 30. Aequitron said it earned $101,200, or two cents a
share, compared with a loss of $416,100, or nine cents a
share, for the 1989 fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter sales rose
16.5% to $6.5 million from $5.6 million.
   Aequitron said in a release that it doesn't know how
severely the recalls will hurt its sales. But the company
said it has more than enough working capital to weather any
temporary revenue decline and that it believes that any loss
of market share would be temporary.
   The spokesman for the company said the monitors represent
about one-third of Aequitron's business.

   Melville to Buy
   Peoples Drug Stores
   For $330 Million

   RYE, N.Y. -- Melville Corp. announced plans to create the
nation's fifth-largest drugstore chain by acquiring Peoples
Drug Stores Inc. for $330 million.
   Melville, which owns CVS drugstores, an 811-unit chain in
14 states, mostly in the Northeast, with sales in 1989 of
$1.95 billion, agreed in principle to buy Peoples. Peoples, a
subsidiary of Montreal-based Imasco Ltd., operates 490 stores
in five mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia. It
had 1989 sales of $1.02 billion. The acquisition would
increase the size of Melville's drugstore division more than
50%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Melville, which also owns specialty retailers of apparel,
footwear, toys and household furnishings, said it will
finance the acquisition from operating cash flow and existing
lines of credit.
   At the start of 1989, Peoples was nearly twice its current
size. But in three separate transactions, Imasco sold 319
stores to focus on the chain's core mid-Atlantic market.
Analysts say the remaining stores were Peoples' best, and the
price Melville agreed to pay reflects it. While Melville said
it is paying slightly less than book value, analysts say the
purchase price, based on Peoples' 1989 operating income of
$14 million, is a hefty multiple of 24 times earnings.
   "The stores they picked up are the successful core of the
drugstores that remained," says Bruce Buckley, editor of Drug
Store News, a trade journal. "But it sounds like Imasco got a
good price."
   "CVS and Peoples make an ideal geographic and strategic
fit," said Stanley P. Goldstein, Melville's chairman and
chief executive officer. "Both have excellent store
locations, with similar customer profiles, and Peoples is
positioned in dynamic and growing markets."
   Mr. Goldstein, who co-founded CVS in 1963, defended the
price he is paying for Peoples. The chain's operations
already are improving, he said. "We see this as an
underperforming asset."
   Robert Huth, Melville's chief financial officer, said
"over time, Peoples should add substantially to the growth
and profitability of the drugstore divisions."
   William Smith, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., says, "There's definitely room for improvement" in
Peoples' operating profit margin, which is less than 2%. By
contrast, CVS's operating margin in 1989 was 7.8%. But given
Mr. Goldstein's record at CVS, which is highly regarded among
drugstore analysts, the acquisition "looks like a good fit,"
Mr. Smith says.
   In 1989, Melville earned $398 million on sales of $7.5
billion. In addition to CVS, its stores operate under the
Marshalls, Wilsons, Chess King, Meldisco, Thom McAn, and
Kay-Bee Toy names.
   Melville expects to continue to operate Peoples stores
under its current name.

   Irvine Heir Stake
   Is Valued at 30%
   Above Bren Offer

   A court-appointed referee in Michigan valued heiress Joan
Irvine Smith and her mother's 11% stake in Irvine Co. at
about $149.1 million, 30% more than they were offered by
developer Donald Bren in 1983 when he bought out all of the
other investors in the real-estate concern.
   The referee, Robert B. Webster, ruled that Irvine was
worth $1.355 billion in 1983, far less than the $3 billion
proposed by Mrs. Smith and her mother. Mr. Bren paid $200,000
a share to 33 other Irvine investors, based on a total value
for the company of $1 billion at the time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The long-awaited decision is a major victory for Mr. Bren,
a 57-year-old real-estate baron who had been called the
"Donald Trump of the West Coast" until Mr. Trump's recent
financial problems. Irvine owns one-sixth of booming Orange
County, south of Los Angeles. Its holdings include
undeveloped land, sprawling industrial parks, luxury retail
centers and upscale apartment units.
   Mrs. Smith and her mother, Athalie Clarke, launched the
litigation nearly seven years ago by asking a Michigan state
court to determine the "fair value" of their stake. Irvine is
incorporated in Michigan. A 155-day trial ended in December
1988 and was followed by 1,500 pages of post-trial briefs.
The case was submitted to the referee a year ago.
   Gary H. Hunt, an Irvine senior vice president, said the
company is very pleased with the decision. "The bottom line
is that Mrs. Smith and her mother will receive only modestly
more than {they} would have received on the day the merger
was approved in 1983, an amount, $34 million, that is
approximately the cost to both parties of litigating this for
the past seven years."
   Howard I. Friedman, a Los Angeles attorney representing
Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Clarke, said he didn't know yet if the
decision would be appealed.
   "We're somewhat disappointed," he acknowledged. "It's
considerably less than what we believe the company is worth."
Mr. Friedman said his clients would receive interest in
addition to the 30% improvement over Mr. Bren's offer of
$208,400 for each of their 550 shares.
   Irvine, based in Newport Beach, Calif., had argued that it
was unlikely that some of the nation's most astute investors
and business people, who were among the 33 selling
shareholders, would have accepted a low offer. The sellers
included Albert Taubman, a shopping center developer, Herbert
Allen, a Wall Street investment banker, and Henry Ford II, an
heir of the auto making family.
   Irvine Co. was originally an enormous ranch pieced
together from Spanish land grants by James Irvine and his
partners. His great-granddaughter, Mrs. Smith, inherited her
shares in the early 1950s. She is the last Irvine family
member to own a large block of stock.

   DSC Communications Corp. said it and other defendants
preliminarily agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit by
paying plaintiffs about $30 million.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Dallas in 1985,
alleged that DSC; several top officers; the company's
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen & Co.; and its investment
bank, Allen &amp; Co., among others, defrauded shareholders by
publishing inflated financial statements during certain
periods in 1984 and 1985.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Arthur Andersen and Allen &amp; Co. couldn't be
reached for comment.
   DSC, a maker of telephone switching and transmission
equipment, subsequently changed its revenue accounting
procedures and restated the figures from those periods.
   The company said its share of the proposed settlement is
about $9 million, while the company's insurance carrier and
other defendants will pay the remainder. It said the
settlement won't materially affect its financial position.
   Under the settlement, which remains to be ratified by a
judge, the claims against the company and the individual
defendants will be dismissed without any admission or
presumption of liability by the defendants, DSC said.

   LOS ANGELES -- Southern Natural Gas Co. agreed to pay
Atlantic Richfield Co. $300.5 million to settle a lawsuit for
damages resulting from an accident last year on an Arco
offshore drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Seven workers were killed and 23 injured in the March 19,
1989, fire and explosion on Arco's South Pass "B" platform.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An Arco spokesman said he didn't know when or how the
$300.5 million would be paid. The settlement came during a
recess of the trial of a suit brought by Arco in April
against Sonat, two of its affiliates and Pipe Lines Unlimited
Services, Houma, La. The trial began June 11 in state court
in Texas.
   In the suit, Arco charged Birmingham, Ala.-based Sonat and
Pipe Lines Unlimited, an oil transportation concern, with
negligence that caused the fire. Sonat's pipeline was
connected to Arco's platform.
   The pact resolves all of Arco's claims against Sonat, the
Arco spokesman said, including damages to the platform and
lost production. Prior to the accident, the platform produced
about 18,000 barrels a day, the spokesman said. It has
remained shut since then.
   The settlement assigns Arco's claims against Pipe Lines
Unlimited to Sonat, the Arco spokesman said. Separate
settlements were reached earlier, he said, between Sonat and
families of the accident victims.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress passed an Amtrak authorization
bill after removing the railroad anti-takeover provision that
drew a veto from President Bush.
   The bill, approved by voice votes in the House and Senate
and sent to the White House, caps federal subsidies for the
government-owned passenger railroad at $684 million in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and at $712 million the
following year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In vetoing an earlier version, Mr. Bush said he accepted
the spending figures but objected to a requirement that the
Interstate Commerce Commission review proposed acquisitions
of the 16 largest freight railroads by non-railroad
companies. The House voted to override the veto, but the
Senate narrowly failed to get the needed two-thirds majority
to override.
   "Because the president's concerns have been addressed . .
. the current version of the bill is acceptable to the
administration," the White House said.
   Rep. Thomas Luken (D., Ohio), chairman of the House
subcommittee on transportation, said the bill authorizes
enough money for Amtrak to replace and upgrade its passenger
cars. The actual appropriations, however, still must be
determined in a separate spending bill.
   In addition to Amtrak service, the bill would clear legal
impediments to starting commuter rail service between
northern Virginia and the District of Columbia.

   TOKYO -- Koito Manufacturing Co. claimed it has evidence
that its largest shareholder, T. Boone Pickens Jr., is trying
to greenmail it. Mr. Pickens dismissed the accusation and
said he plans to buy more Koito stock.
   Through Texas-based Boone Co., Mr. Pickens has a 26% stake
in Koito. But the company has repeatedly rejected his demand
for representation on its board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday, it released a copy of what it said was Boone
Co.'s 1989 Franchise Tax Report to the state of Delaware,
which showed total gross assets of about $1.9 million as of
Dec. 31. Koito said that as of that same date, Boone Co. was
registered on Koito's books as the owner of 39.4 million of
the company's shares, with a market value at the time of
about $950 million.
   Koito asserts that the difference between the two figures
reflects its contention that Boone Co. isn't the beneficial
owner of the shares and is acting as an agent for Kitaro
Watanabe, which Koito claims has tried to greenmail the
company before. A greenmailer tries to force a company to buy
back its shares at a price higher than the market price.
   But Boone Co. officials released a copy of what they said
was an amended filing, showing assets of more than $916.6
million. They said that they made a mistake in their initial
filing, dated Feb. 21, by failing to include overseas
holdings in Koito, and that the amended filing reflects the
holdings.
   "If they think they found a smoking gun, it just blew up
in their face," Mr. Pickens said in a statement. He didn't
say how many additional Koito shares he plans to buy, but he
insists he is a long-term investor, not a greenmailer.

   DALLAS -- The president and four other top employees of a
division of LTV Corp.'s Missiles and Electronics Group were
suspended indefinitely pending the completion of a review by
the federal government.
   The five men work for the Buffalo, N.Y., Sierra Research
division of the LTV unit. An LTV spokesman said the division
develops radar and other defense electronics, and its primary
government contracts are with the Navy and Air Force.
</LP>

   The spokesman wouldn't comment on the nature of the
government review of Sierra Research programs. He said the
suspensions, which were effective Friday, are intended as "a
prudent measure . . . to make sure everything is clean and on
the up and up." The spokesman said none of the five men has
been charged "in any way" with wrongdoing.
   In a letter to employees of the LTV Missiles and
Electronics Group, group President Robert N. Parker said,
"these suspensions are with pay and are not intended to
prejudge any involvement of these individuals in the matters
being reviewed by the government."
   Mr. Parker said he will assume the duties of suspended
President Tom Cobb. Also suspended were Stu Penny, vice
president of business development; Roger Witt, vice president
of operations; Gene Streips, a director of business
development, and project engineer Jack Borkowski. Mr. Witt
declined to comment, and the others couldn't be reached for
comment.

   Norway Ends Output Limit
   On Oil for the Rest of 1990

   LONDON -- The Norwegian cabinet decided Monday to drop oil
production controls for the second half of the year, Oil
Ministry Director General Marit Ingebretsen said.
   The measure, which takes effect July 1, eliminates the 5%
control the country's oil producers were forced to observe in
the first half of the year, Ms. Ingebretsen said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Ingebretsen said the cabinet decided to scrap the
limit for the remainder of the year because it "was having
very little effect" on reducing the amount of oil currently
overhanging the world market.
   Norway enacted the controls -- which slowed crude oil
production growth but not actual output -- in February 1987,
in support of efforts by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to stabilize the crude-oil market.
   From the onset of the voluntary controls, Norway said the
country's oil producers could produce no more than 92.5% of
their capacity. The limit was later pushed up to 95% of
capacity for the first half of 1990.
   But the measures didn't include a limit on the amount of
new production to come on stream; thus the country's output
increased as capacity grew with the development of new oil
fields.
   In a telephone interview from Oslo, Ms. Ingebretsen said
the cabinet would review the control system before the first
half of 1991 and would make changes if necessary.
   "We enacted the measures when OPEC production was low, but
since then OPEC has increased output by 50% while production
from outside the organization has stabilized," she said. "Now
that it seems that OPEC has trouble staying within its quota,
our measures are having very little effect on the market."
   In May, Norway produced 1.67 million barrels of crude oil
a day.

   Farmers Are Living High on Hog Prices,
   But Not Everyone Brings Home Bacon

   CHICAGO -- The cost of bacon in that summertime favorite,
the BLT, is going up, thanks at least in part to the White
House.
   Pork prices in grocery stores have gone hog wild recently,
exceeding $2 a pound for the first time in one government
measure, in a development that has also triggered the closing
of several major slaughterhouses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Few anticipated this price surge last year when the
average hog was so cheap that farmers asked Uncle Sam for
help. It came in an unusual form: a donation of 12.4 million
pounds of U.S. pork bellies to food-strapped Poland. With the
gesture, the White House wanted to help prop up the new
government there while reducing U.S. stockpiles that had
swollen to their highest level in 18 years.
   Since then, the price of a hog has at times soared roughly
50% above year-earlier levels. The price of a pork belly --
which is sliced to make bacon -- fetches almost twice what it
did last year.
   Farmers are bemused. In Independence, Iowa, Dick Frye is
pocketing the best profits he has seen in more than a decade.
"It's really strange," says Mr. Frye, whose porcine profits
helped him buy his first new tractor in 16 years, "but it's
great."
   Off the farm, however, things are grim.
   Seven major slaughterhouses have closed so far this year
compared to the closing of one plant for all of 1989, the
Agriculture Department says. In most cases, the plants
couldn't afford to pay the stiff price for hogs. The plant
closings have laid off thousands of workers and are speeding
the concentration of market power into the hands of the top
slaughterhouses.
   Several companies are blaming high hog prices for eroding
their earnings. Bob Evans Farms Inc., a Columbus, Ohio,
restaurant chain, said earlier this month that its net income
for the year ended April 27 dropped 9.5% to $27.7 million on
sales of $454.3 million because of lower profit margins from
its sausage business.
   Pork processor Smithfield Foods Inc. of Smithfield, Va.,
said its net in the year ended April 29 fell 28% to $7.1
million from a year ago despite a non-recurring net gain of
$1.1 million in the fourth quarter. Aaron D. Trub, Smithfield
secretary and treasurer, said a dip in hog prices in recent
weeks from their record high level is easing pressure on the
company.
   As for consumers, they'll feel the impact of high hog
prices at the supermarket and restaurant counter for months
to come. According to the Agriculture Department, the price
charged by supermarkets for a composite of fresh pork cuts
hit $2.06 a pound in May, up about a nickel from April and up
16% from May 1989.
   In an Indiana supermarket, the price of a pound of bologna
has jumped 40 cents, to $3.29, from a year ago. Elsewhere,
the retail price of sausage has climbed 25% in the past 12
months to a record.
   The National Pork Producers Council, which pushed the
White House to send pork aid to Poland, credits its lobbying
effort with improving the lot of its hog farming members.
   But Agriculture Department officials insist that the
shipment of pork bellies to Poland was too small to have
driven up prices significantly in the U.S.
   Economists didn't know it at the time, but the government
mobilized last fall to combat low prices just as those prices
were prompting farmers to significantly trim the number of
pigs being born. Because fewer pigs were born, the supply of
hogs fat enough for slaughter during the second quarter
probably fell 6% from the year-earlier quarter, analysts
said.
   Complicating matters, the flow of Canadian hogs to U.S.
meatpackers has thinned just as the Japanese have increased
their purchases of U.S. pork.
   Relief in the form of more hogs probably isn't coming
anytime soon. Analysts are divided over whether a quarterly
department survey of hog farmers slated for release Friday
will show an increase in the number of pigs. To fatten a pig
for slaughter takes about six months.
   The major slaughterhouse companies that have stopped at
least some operations so far this year handled, combined,
about 10% of the hogs slaughtered last year. Several smaller
plants have also closed.
   Because of the tight supply of hogs, meatpackers are
bidding up prices to keep their plants operating. They are
finding only about 290,000 hogs each weekday, which means
they are operating at three-fourths of capacity, says Thomas
Morgan, a livestock analyst and president of Sterling
Research Corp.
   In the high-volume, low-margin business of slaughtering
animals, such a low operating rate means that some
meatpackers are losing between $2 and $4 on every hog killed.
   "Everybody is losing money," says Mel Davis, vice
president of raw materials at the meatpacking unit of
Farmland Industries Inc., a Kansas City, Mo.-based
cooperative. "The question is whether you have the money to
weather the storm."
   So far, the situation hasn't slowed the plans of two big
beef slaughtering companies to expand in the hog-killing
business.
   Omaha, Neb.-based ConAgra Inc. has completed a renovation
project at its three hog slaughtering plants that will allow
it to double its combined capacity to 12 million hogs a year.
   Last month, IBP Inc. opened the world's largest hog
slaughter plant in Waterloo, Iowa. Construction on the $40
million plant, which has the capacity to kill 15,000 hogs a
day, began two years ago.
   Analysts aren't clear on where hog prices, and thus retail
pork prices, will go this summer. Hog prices have eased about
8% so far this month, and some supermarkets have been cutting
their purchases of pork amid worries that the high retail
price is beginning to chill consumer demand. However, hog
prices usually hit their highest levels in mid-summer.

   Seven of 8 VMS
   Funds to Continue
   Distribution Ban

DIVIDENDS (DIV)

<LP>
   CHICAGO -- All but one of the eight publicly traded funds
originally sponsored by VMS Realty Partners said they would
continue to suspend distributions to shareholders despite
recouping about $108 million from the ailing syndicator this
year.
   At the first annual meetings since the unravelling of the
syndication giant began earlier this year, Leonard G. Levine,
president and chief executive officer of the funds, told
shareholders of three of the funds that no distributions
would be made because of pending class-action lawsuits
against the funds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One fund, VMS Strategic Land Trust, will pay a special
dividend of 21 cents a share and a regular quarterly dividend
of 10 cents a share, amounting to about $3.7 million in
distributions. Mr. Levine said the trust could be liquidated
"in the not-too-distant future."
   In addition to the litigation, Mr. Levine told
shareholders that the funds needed to conserve their cash
because VMS continued to withhold mortgage payments to the
funds and because existing loans may have foreclosure costs
or require payments to senior lenders. Mr. Levine
characterized the situation as "terribly unfortunate."
   In an interview, Mr. Levine, a former officer of VMS who
helped structure the funds, said that negotiations with VMS's
chief operating officer, Peter T. Cyrus, take place about
"friendly foreclosures" on a "daily basis." The funds haven't
yet taken possession of any VMS properties, Mr. Levine said,
although VMS is making payments on "less than five" of some
100 properties.
   Mr. Levine told shareholders that the discussions were
often "very heated. VMS is trying not to pay anything."
   The eight funds, including five real estate investment
trusts, or REITs, and three master limited partnerships, or
MLPs, raised $1.1 billion from about 100,000 investors in the
late 1980s to make loans exclusively to VMS and its
affiliates.
   VMS, which boasted as recently as last February that it
was one of the world's largest and most successful real
estate management and development firms, disclosed major cash
problems that month and the independent directors took
control of the eight funds.
   Xerox Corp., which owns a 25% stake in VMS, took a $400
million first-quarter charge to reflect its investment loss
in the partnership.
   Mr. Levine said the funds had seized control of secured
cash accounts and "significant amounts of interest reserves"
at VMS to protect against "the unfortunate event of any
bankruptcy by VMS." Mr. Levine, who hasn't any current
affiliation with VMS, said the partnership promoter was "in a
state of winding down."
   The funds also are in "daily contact" with Joel A. Stone,
VMS's president, over unsecured VMS assets, including
Rockresorts, the Boca Raton Hotel and Club in Boca Raton,
Fla., and the Omni Park Central Hotel in New York City, Mr.
Levine said. In addition, the funds are attempting to gain
control over guarantee funds established by VMS to make
distribution payments to shareholders. Mr. Stone couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Mr. Levine said the funds would continue their recent
profitability "but not at the same level as the first
quarter" when VMS was still making interest payments for two
months. He said the funds would move from being "exclusively
mortgage REITs" to a "hybrid" of "mostly equity and some
mortgages" as they resolve their demands on VMS.
   In other business, shareholders overwhelmingly re-elected
the independent directors of the Land Trust, VMS Mortgage
Investment Fund and VMS Strategic Land Fund II. The two other
REITs meet Tuesday. The three MLPs don't hold annual
meetings.

   HONOLULU -- Hawaiian Airlines said it filed suits aimed at
blocking a competitor, Discovery Airways.
   The HAL Inc. unit said it is seeking to recover $9.9
million in alleged damages and asking for a federal
investigation of the air carrier, which it claims is
un-American because of its reliance on Japanese loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a two-pronged litigation, Hawaiian Airlines filed one
suit in federal court charging that Discovery violated the
Federal Aviation Act, and another suit in the First Circuit
Court of Hawaii charging Discovery with unfair competition.
   Hawaiian's attempt to stop its rival's operations is based
on an assertion that Discovery is "foreign owned, and
therefore not an American corporation."
   Discovery officials couldn't immediately be reached for
comment. Discovery was formed last summer by ex-airline
executives who announced they wanted to enter the
inter-island air carrier business.
   Hawaiian claims it has lost $3.3 million in revenue since
Discovery began operations and asks the state court to award
it that amount in actual damages, plus an additional $6.6
million in general and punitive damages.
   In addition, Hawaiian says it will ask the Justice
Department to investigate Discovery's actions before the
Department of Transportation.
   HAL has weathered a turbulent year so far. Former baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth completed his $37 million
takeover of HAL in January. In April, the company disclosed
plunging passenger traffic on Hawaiian Airlines in the wake
of extended aircraft downtime and reduced capacity on
inter-island routes.
   As a result, HAL posted a loss of $46.9 million, or $24 a
share, for 1989, more than five times the year-earlier loss
of $8.8 million, or $4.48 a share.

   Finally Is Leveling Out
   And Slump May Be Over

   DETROIT -- Sales of domestic cars, vans and trucks in the
U.S. fell 3.6% in mid-June from a weak year-ago period, as
slumping sales for the Big Three U.S. auto makers were only
partially offset by gains reported by the U.S. operations of
Japanese auto makers.
   U.S. auto makers reported sales of 341,662 vehicles in the
June 11-20 period, compared to 315,138 last year. But there
were nine selling days in the period this year compared to
eight a year ago, making the daily average sales volume drop
in the latest period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said the latest figures suggest the auto market
is leveling out and the worst of a nine-month-old sales slump
may be over. The market "is probably not going to get any
worse," said David Healy, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete
Wedd in New York. But he added improvements probably will
come slowly. Spokesmen for the auto makers, meanwhile, said
the latest sales were in line with expectations, and wouldn't
force significant production cutbacks or substantial
additional discounting.
   Because of sharply-reduced output earlier this year, most
major U.S. auto makers are sitting on relatively lean
inventories of unsold cars.
   In a continuation of recent market trends, sales of
passenger cars dropped more severely than van and pickup
truck sales. Auto makers reported a 4.5% decline in domestic
car sales, while combined truck and van sales fell only 2.2%.
Domestic cars sold at a 6.8 million seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the period, identical to the sluggish rate of
a year ago, according to a Commerce Department formula.
   In sharp contrast to the lackluster performances of the
Big Three auto makers, the U.S. operations of Japanese auto
makers continued to outstrip their year-ago performances.
Overall, Japanese auto makers boosted their share of U.S.
produced car sales to 13.7%, from 8.9% last year.
   Honda Motor Corp., which has added a second U.S. auto
assembly plant to its facilities in Ohio, saw sales of its
domestically-produced Civic and Accord models jump 62% in
mid-June. Honda officials credited the sales strength of the
redesigned 1990 Accord, and a dealer incentive program on its
Civic models.
   Chrysler Corp. posted the deepest sales decline. The auto
maker recorded an 18.3% drop in domestic car sales, and a
12.9% decline in sales of domestic trucks and vans.
Chrysler's market share has been declining for most of this
year despite a major marketing campaign that included a
six-city tour by Chairman Lee A. Iacocca and advertising that
compares its cars to Honda's.
   General Motors Corp., reported a 7.8% decline in domestic
car sales and a 3% drop in domestic truck sales. Ford Motor
Co. fared about the same, with domestic car sales down 7.4%
from a year ago. Officials said they were buoyed by a partial
recovery in sales of the new version of the Escort, the
company's basic subcompact model. Escort sales dropped only
3% through the first 20 days of June, compared to a decline
of 18% for the entire month of May.
   Ford's truck and van sales rose 4%, thanks largely to the
strong launch of the Ford Explorer, a four-door sport-utility
