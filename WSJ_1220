   China Is Heeding

   BEIJING -- The fear of losing special U.S. trade
privileges appears to be causing China to alter its attitude
and begin paying attention to U.S. complaints about human
rights violations.
   U.S. Ambassador James Lilly and Richard Schifter,
assistant secretary of state for human rights, say they
detected this change during 16 hours of talks with Chinese
officials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Judging from the way this issue was handled one year ago,
with people snarling at each other over the table, at least
the atmosphere was substantially improved," Mr. Lilly said
last night. "Attitudinally, you've got a sea change."
   Mr. Lilly and Mr. Schifter met with some 30 Chinese
officials from the Ministry of Public Security, Supreme
People's Court, Ministry of Justice and several other
agencies. The meetings were arranged after China's foreign
minister, Qian Qichen, visited President Bush at the White
House in late November, ending a policy that banned
high-level meetings with China.
   Mr. Schifter said he gave Chinese officials a list of 150
political prisoners and asked that those not convicted of
acts of violence be released from jail. The list contained
names of people jailed for participating in last year's
Tiananmen Square demonstrations as well as names of Tibetans,
Catholic priests and people still in jail from participating
in protests 10 years ago.
   The Americans said that by accepting the list, the Chinese
displayed a change of attitude. Since the June 4, 1989,
Tiananmen massacre, Chinese officials had dismissed America's
complaints as interference in China's internal affairs. But
the diplomats said that Chinese officials gave no indications
whether they will take actions to improve human rights.
   Mr. Schifter said that he pointed out to the Chinese that
Congress is overwhelmingly in favor of punishing China
economically. The U.S. House of Representatives on Oct. 18
approved legislation by a 383-30 vote to end China's Most
Favored Nation trade status unless specific human rights
improvements take place.
   Foreign trade now equals 30% of China's gross national
product, as compared to about 9% in 1978, the year before
economic reform began. The country's exports to America are
expected to total $16.5 billion this year, which represents
27% of China's exports and an increase of $4.5 billion from
last year.
   Many diplomats believe that the Communist Party realizes
it will remain in power only if China's economy remains
healthy. As a result, some diplomats believe that America's
huge share of China's exports provides enough leverage to get
China to act on human rights.

   TOKYO -- Export orders for Japanese shipbuilders in
November tumbled 82% from a year earlier, as orders for only
four vessels brought combined tonnage to 145,900 metric tons,
compared with 803,250 tons in November 1989, the Japan Ship
Exporters' Association said. A metric ton is equal to about
2,204.62 pounds.
   Association officials said the latest statistics reflect a
wait-and-see attitude by ship owners and shipbuilders,
resulting from uncertainty about the pace of world economic
growth and concern about growing labor and materials costs in
Japan. They said the yen's appreciation in value against the
dollar this year has hurt competitiveness of Japanese
exporters.

   Quayle-Led Panel
   Helped Kill Plan
   On Recycling Rules

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- A White House council headed by Vice
President Quayle used its muscle to kill a government
proposal for trash recycling just days before it was to go
into effect.
   Opposition from the vice president's Competitiveness
Council led the Environmental Protection Agency to drop a
proposed regulation that would have required municipal waste
incinerators to recycle at least 25% of the trash destined
for burning.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The regulation would have imposed the first federal rules
mandating recycling of the nation's trash. But the
requirement also stirred complaints from the business
community that reregulation is on the rise under President
Bush.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly said the action doesn't
mean the Bush administration is reneging on the president's
campaign commitment to reduce waste through recycling.
"Everyone in the administration remains committed to
recycling," Mr. Reilly said in an interview.
   Mr. Reilly said the panel concluded that it was
inappropriate to enact a major recycling requirement as part
of a broader rule designed to curb air pollution from the
scores of incinerators that now burn 14% of municipal waste
in the U.S. After stripping out the recycling provisions, the
remainder of the air-pollution regulation will be issued and
put into effect later this month, Mr. Reilly said. And
recycling ideas will be considered next year when Congress
reauthorizes the nation's principal waste-disposal law, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
   Opposition to the recycling measure, however, wasn't
merely on technical grounds. Michael Deland, chairman of the
president's Council on Environmental Quality, said many panel
members felt that voluntary recycling works best and "we
don't want to force it down people's throats."
   The recycling rule also was strongly opposed by the
National League of Cities. The group objected to it being
mandatory and said that it would be harder to get sites
approved for new incinerators to handle the nation's mounting
trash problem.
   Also opposing the rule was the waste-handling industry,
which includes companies like Wheelabrator Technologies Inc.
and a subsidiary of Ogden Corp. that make incinerators that
burn trash to make energy.
   This was the first time that Mr. Quayle's obscure panel,
which was created to stop rules that stifle industry, has
intervened to block a regulation. The panel is the successor
to the deregulation task force Mr. Bush had headed as vice
president during the Reagan years.
   The aggressive recycling initiative was the highlight of
the broader air-pollution rule that the EPA proposed for
incinerators last December after getting clearance from the
Office of Management and Budget.
   While the Quayle commission is only an advisory panel,
officials said there was so much opposition to the recycling
proposal within the administration that the EPA had little
choice but to agree to strip it out.
   A White House official said Mr. Reilly was the only
official to speak in favor of the proposal at the
cabinet-level meeting. The official said Mr. Quayle also
stated at the meeting that the administration continues to
support recycling.
   The panel's actions suggest, however, that the
administration will find it hard to deliver on the
president's campaign commitment to recycling and the EPA's
goal of reducing the nation's waste 25% by 1992.
   "Dropping this element from the rule sort of cuts the legs
out from under that campaign promise, and it leaves everyone
wondering how the administration will meet its commitment to
make recycling more than a slogan," said Eric Goldstein, a
lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. A lawsuit
by the council, an environmental group, forced the EPA to
draw up the incinerator air-pollution regulations.
Environmentalists widely supported the recycling requirement.

   MAYNARD, Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp., in its largest
outside venture to date, said it agreed to invest $230
million in a new company it will form with the computer
division of German conglomerate Mannesmann AG.
   The venture is expected to give Digital a sorely needed
boost as it struggles to cut costs and reverse sagging sales.
"Overnight, this gives Digital a considerably larger presence
in Germany, which is the largest European market, and a
springboard into the growing Eastern European markets," said
Philippe de Marcillac, a Paris-based analyst with Dataquest
Corp. "It appears to be one of the first cases of an American
acquisition of a European computer company," he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Digital said it will own 65% of the new company, which
will consist of the German concern's Mannesmann Kienzle
Computer Systems Division and the division's Procad G.m.b.H.
and PCS G.m.b.H. units. Mannesmann, which makes automotive
parts, steel tubing, electric motors and other products, will
own 35% of the new company. Digital will have an option to
purchase Mannesmann's stake "over time," but has no immediate
plans to do so, said Digital executives. The new company,
called Digital-Kienzle Computer Systeme G.m.b.H., will be
based in Villingen, Germany.
   The venture represents a break with Digital's tradition of
making relatively small investments in outside companies.
Employing about 3,900 people, Mannesmann Kienzle is Germany's
second-largest domestic computer supplier. It will have 1990
revenue of about $539 million; its revenue is expected to
rise next year, Digital said. For the fiscal year ended June
30, Digital earned $74.4 million, or 59 cents a share, after
a pretax restructuring charge of $550 million. Its sales were
$12.94 billion.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Digital closed at $58, down $1.25.
   Mannesmann Kienzle's computer systems are targeted at
small and medium-sized companies -- the kinds of computer
customers expected in Eastern Europe, said Pier Carlo
Falotti, head of Digital's European operations. The German
concern is tailoring its software to run with a version of
the Unix operating system, enabling the software to be
combined with Digital's slightly different Unix-based systems
without major changes, Digital executives added.
   Digital said its current German unit, based in Munich,
caters mainly to large customers; it will continue to operate
independently of the new venture.
   Mannesmann Kienzle's marketing arm "will complement our
channels of distribution," said John F. Smith, Digital's
senior vice president for operations. "We will sell our
products through their channels" and vice versa, he said. Mr.
Smith added that the new venture also will have "synergy"
with the Mannesmann group of companies, which have annual
sales of about $15 billion and a growing need for computers.

   ...Real Rip van Winkles in `Awakenings'

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14

<LP>
   The author-neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks has translated his
treatment and study of neurological disorders into exquisite
tales of medical mystery and spiritual probing. In his books
"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" and "Awakenings,"
Dr. Sacks introduced the lay reader to bizarre cases and the
larger moral meaning that could be drawn from individual
afflictions and how they were dealt with by patients, their
families and doctors.
   "Awakenings," based on a true story, is about a group of
people who were beset by encephalitis and then fell into a
living sleep. After spending decades in this condition, one
group of these Rip van Winkles was brought back to this world
in 1969 by a doctor who found out that they could be
awakened. Their re-emergence, facilitated by drugs, was a
miracle -- a miracle that lasted only briefly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The director Penny Marshall has gone straight to the heart
of this complex story and made a powerfully poignant and
illuminating film. She doesn't hesitate to push for the grand
sentimental moment, but balances the teary stuff with
restraint and humor. To be sure, "Awakenings" seems
calculated to induce weeping -- and it does, without making
the weeper feel cheap.
   Robin Williams, in the part of Dr. Malcolm Sayer the
neurologist, has become so accomplished and familiar an actor
that it's no longer shocking to see him outside his manic
stand-up-comic persona. The movie's neurologist has been cast
as an absent-minded introvert, a man who's just come off a
five-year stint observing the behavior of earthworms. He
leaves his car keys dangling in the outside lock all day and
uses his refrigerator to store plants.
   Mr. Williams plays this fuzzy little man nerdy to the last
detail, down to his white socks. He walks with his shoulders
hunched awkwardly, like a 12-year-old who thinks he'll become
invisible if he wills himself to be. He is almost invisible;
you can barely see his eyes peering out of the confluence of
beard, glasses and hair. Yet there's always something twinkly
about Mr. Williams, even submerged like this. It's readily
apparent that this quiet, brainy guy just might spot a
miracle because he's oblivious to everything else.
   He's gone to Bainbridge Hospital in the Bronx, which
caters to chronically ill neurological patients, to work in
the lab. At his job interview it becomes apparent to him that
the job that's available isn't, as he thought, a research
job. As it dawns on Dr. Sayer that he's being offered a staff
position, he seems panicky, in his quiet way. "People?" he
says.
   The hospital is desperate; he is hired. An orderly leads
him to the ward referred to as "The Garden"; its inhabitants
are fed and watered. Instead of settling in comfortably to
these surroundings, where patients resemble research
specimens not humans, Dr. Sayer determines to find flickers
of life. He does, and this leads him to look for other
flickers, and to find the connections between the patients
who show signs of vitality behind their blank eyes.
   His research leads him to a doctor who first analyzed the
"children who fell asleep" back in the 1920s, during an
outbreak of encephalitis. Max von Sydow plays the elderly
doctor who shows the younger man films of the patients he'd
observed years before. In one of the movie's simple,
clarifying moments, the older doctor tells the younger man
these patients don't know they've been "asleep" for 40 years
or more. When pressed, the old man gives his reasoning: "The
alternative is unthinkable."
   Ms. Marshall and her screenwriter, Steven Zaillian,
incorporate into their story many familiar movie tactics that
serve the purpose of moving things along without tarnishing
the story's delicate magic. So, as Dr. Sayer begins to test
the reflexes he's sure he sees in his patients, he rouses the
previously indifferent nurses and orderlies to his cause.
And, because every movie hero needs an antagonist, John Heard
is called upon to play the doubting head doctor, Dr. Kaufman,
whose main job is to give Sayer a challenge. Ms. Marshall
even manages to pull off the rather unnecessary parallel
story that requires Dr. Sayer to learn a lesson from his
patients. To further this line, the film makers have arranged
a wistful flirtation between nurse (Julie Kavner) and Sayer,
her boss. He's oblivious, of course, until he watches his
patients return to life and realizes that they're not the
only ones who have been sleeping. Though this adherence to
Hollywood code that romance must be injected everywhere isn't
worthy of the film's general spirit, it doesn't diminish the
picture's emotional strength.
   Meanwhile, in the medical plot line Dr. Sayer learns about
a drug he thinks will work on his patients, and convinces his
superior, Dr. Kaufman, to finance an experiment on just one
patient. Robert De Niro plays the patient, a 50-year-old man
named Leonard. Mr. De Niro was an ideal choice for this role,
the adult whose personality stopped developing when he fell
asleep as a smart, polite adolescent. The actor has an
uncanny ability to appear sweetly free of experience, and
then to disintegrate into a confusion of tics and spasms as
side effects take hold.
   This film isn't a repeat of the marvelous trick Ms.
Marshall pulled off before in "Big," where Tom Hanks played a
12-year-old inhabiting a 35-year-old man's body. Leonard
didn't -- poof] -- make an instant leap in age. He's been a
child, year in and year out, for a very long time, tended by
his elegant and eloquent mother. When he realizes what his
life has been, his joy is severely mitigated by what he's
lost -- and Mr. De Niro makes his loss vividly, sorrowfully
apparent.
   As Leonard's mother, Ruth Nelson achieves a clear,
wrenching beauty that stands out even among these exceptional
actors doing exceptional things.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: To appreciate how much Ms. Marshall has
accomplished here, it's worthwhile to look at her two
previous films. When it was released there seemed little to
note in "Jumpin' Jack Flash," the director's first film, a
comedy that seemed to indicate Ms. Marshall should stick to
acting. Then she surprised everyone with the charming "Big,"
whose success at the box office made Ms. Marshall a serious
player in the industry.

   MILAN, Italy -- Acqua Pia Antica Marcia S.p.A., a holding
company headed by financier Vincenzo Romagnoli, has sold a
controlling stake in its diversified investment company
Bastogi S.p.A. to a consortium led by Milan real-estate
investor Giuseppe Cabassi, Italian newspapers reported.
   The Cabassi group reportedly will also acquire control of
Rome's Galleria Colonna, a centrally located arcade offering
commercial and office space.
</LP>

   The reports follow Mr. Romagnoli's resignation as
president of Bastogi and the appointment of Alphonso Amico, a
Cabassi group director, as Bastogi's managing director. Two
other Cabassi directors were also named to the Bastogi board.
   The total price of the acquisition was put at 500 billion
lire ($445.8 million). Of that, an estimated 150 billion lire
would come from Mr. Cabassi's purchase of around 40% in
Bastogi, and the remainder from the Galleria Colonna sale.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   For Missouri's Webster, '92 Gubernatorial Race
   Appears Likely to Be a Life-and-Death Campaign

   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- William L. Webster argued the
"right to life" after receiving a death threat himself.
   In April 1989, as anti-abortion and abortion-rights
demonstrators jostled and clamored outside the U.S. Supreme
Court, the Missouri Attorney General presented an oral
argument against the performance of abortions in public
hospitals and clinics. Extra security surrounded him that
day, and he arrived at the court through a secondary
entrance. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court eventually
upheld his position; Mr. Webster hailed "a great victory."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now the question is whether that great victory will help
translate into a great springboard -- into the governor's
office in 1992.
   Although he hasn't formally declared, there's little doubt
that the fresh-faced and controversial Mr. Webster is
running. He has a $1.3 million war chest, he has a campaign
organization, and he leads two GOP nomination rivals in a
recent Missouri net poll. In the broadest sense, the coming
race will be a referendum on the views -- and the consistency
-- of a man who has become identified with the most explosive
issues of contemporary politics: The right to live and the
right to die.
   "There are people who say Bill Webster is trying to play
God," he says in his conference room here. "But the question
isn't whether I am trying to play God. It's whether I will
enforce the laws of the state." Serving during what he calls
an extraordinary "confluence of law and public policy,"
Attorney General Webster and his office have represented
Missouri in three life-and-death U.S. Supreme Court cases
within the past two years.
   The 1989 abortion case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services, eroded the landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling of 1973,
which recognized a woman's constitutional right to an
abortion. In a second ruling last year the court, again
upholding Missouri, ruled that the execution of a 16-year-old
murderer would not be cruel and unusual punishment.
   Early this year, the high court sided with Missouri for a
third time. It ruled that a Missouri hospital could not end
the feeding and hydration of Nancy Cruzan, who has been in
what some doctors term a "persistent vegetative state" since
a 1983 auto accident. The ruling was a blow to Miss Cruzan's
parents, who felt their daughter would not have wanted to
live this way, and to the national "right to die" movement
generally.
   The abortion and Cruzan cases made Mr. Webster a hero to
the anti-abortion movement and a target for abortion-rights
activists. After the abortion decision, abortion-righters
staged a huge rally in front of Mr. Webster's office here,
singing "Bye-bye Billy" and cheering as GOP state Treasurer
Wendell Bailey exhorted them to "de-Websterize Missouri." Mr.
Bailey now seeks the gubernatorial nomination on an
abortion-rights platform; the third GOP hopeful is Secretary
of State Roy Blunt, who takes an anti-abortion stand.
   The object of all this passion is a boyish-looking
37-year-old who, when elected, was the youngest attorney
general in the nation. Generations of Websters have been
active in Missouri politics, and his late father, Richard
Webster, was arguably the most powerful man in the Missouri
Senate. (However, Mr. Webster is no relation to another
William Webster from Missouri, the man who headed the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and now heads the Central
Intelligence Agency.) He is, he agrees, a symbol.
   "I guess to some I am a symbol of a state attempting to
put restrictions on abortion," says Mr. Webster. "I guess I'm
an easy target for the pro-choicers."
   But he's a moving target. There are signs that Bill
Webster the attorney has begun a metamorphosis into Bill
Webster the gubernatorial candidate. The process has
unsettled some of his anti-abortion supporters and
conservatives generally.
   After his office represented Missouri in the Cruzan case
all the way to the Supreme Court, Mr. Webster declared last
September that he saw "no reason for the state's involvement"
in a second attempt by her parents to have her feeding tube
removed. Last week, after listening to supporting testimony
from new witnesses, a Missouri judge granted the parents'
request. Miss Cruzan is now expected to die within the next
two weeks.
   "I'm personally very disturbed by his decision," says Mary
Kay Culp, an official of Missouri Citizens for Life. "I'm not
prepared to say it was a political decision. I hope it
wasn't, because Nancy Cruzan will die a very painful death
and I wonder how he'll feel then."
   Mr. Webster says neither Cruzan decision was political. He
says that his office was drawn into the first case and that
his goal was to establish precedent in an unusual medical and
legal situation. (Among other factors, Miss Cruzan was
considered merely disabled, not terminal; doctors said that,
with continued feeding, she could perhaps live for decades).
Once the Missouri and U.S. supreme courts had established
standards for such cases, Mr. Webster argued, there was
"really no legal basis for Missouri to be in there."
   In another incident that jarred some conservatives, Mr.
Webster was quoted by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch as saying
during a Missouri AFL-CIO convention that the 1980s were "a
decade when the signal was it's OK to bust unions, bend the
rules, have lax regulatory enforcement." Mr. Webster says he
doesn't "believe that {quotation} is correct" and the story
"missed the context." The Post-Dispatch stands by its story.
   Although the nomination race hasn't even officially
started, indications are it will be a bare-knuckled contest.
As a case in point, critics of Mr. Webster provided The
Journal with a copy of a Jan. 9, 1990, letter written by
Charles H. Cozean Jr., an ophthalmologist who's chairman of a
political-action committee, Missouri EyePac. In the letter,
Dr. Cozean writes of a reception attended by Mark Rhoads, Mr.
Webster's director of administration.
   The letter states that Mr. Rhoads "told me, in effect,
that if ophthalmology would support him for governor, he
would assure us that no new optometric initiatives would come
down the legislative pike."
   Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Rhoads called the letter "a
totally untrue and irresponsible statement from a doctor
hoping to impress his colleagues with the appearance of
political clout." In an interview, Attorney General Webster
said it was "not only wrong but patently ludicrous." He said:
"We would never predetermine the fate of any legislation for
any group, whether they support me or not."
   A day after the interview, Mr. Webster's office faxed The
Journal a second letter written by Dr. Cozean, this one dated
Dec. 11, 1990. In it, Dr. Cozean wrote that his first letter
"overstated" his conversation with Mr. Rhoads. "While Mr.
Rhoads and I discussed a variety of topics, he did not {and
as a practical matter, could not} give any assurances
regarding legislation which might be introduced or ultimately
passed by the General Assembly," the letter stated. "With
regard to the 1992 Missouri governor's race, Mr. Rhoads
indicated that he felt confident that Bill Webster would
welcome support from our professionals."

   Retailing:
   Sales of Religious Goods
   Are Inspired by Adversity

   MESQUITE, Texas -- Before undergoing life-threatening
cancer surgery in 1985, Ruth Kaun says, "I opened my heart to
the Lord." As a result, she says, she survived.
   She also added some new stops to her Christmas shopping
trips. This week, on a gift-buying spree at the sprawling
Town East Mall here, Ms. Kaun shunned Victoria's Secret and
other glamorous stores in favor of two religious retailers,
Heavenly Gifts and Family Bookstore. "Faith is the most
valuable gift I have to share," says the elementary-school
teacher, buying a silver angel at Heavenly Gifts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Kaun's experience shows why purveyors of religious
goods are enjoying a merrier Christmas than most other
retailers: Adversity -- whether it be cancer, an economic
downturn or the threat of war -- tends to awaken spiritual
impulses, and spiritual impulse buying. William Graham,
director of Baptist Book Stores, based in Nashville, Tenn.,
says the chain grew during the Depression. Fred Cook, manager
of Catholic Arts &amp; Gifts in Dallas, says: "The busiest time
we ever had was during the Cuban missile crisis."
   "The rule of thumb," says Michael Becker, owner of
Donnelly's religious-goods store in Kansas City, Mo., "is
that when times are good, business is good. When times are
bad, business is better."
   Sales gains this Christmas range from 12% to more than 30%
at the two dozen Christian retailers surveyed so far by
William Anderson, president of the Christian Booksellers
Association, which represents 3,000 stores with mostly
Protestant customers. The National Church Goods Association,
which represents sellers of Catholic goods, says its members
report similar results.
   Part of that success may stem from a shift in
merchandising strategy. In earlier crises, Christian stores
carried mostly devotional items, reflecting the belief that
prayer alone could solve all problems. But today, they are
full of inspirational books and videos describing how to deal
with hard times. Growing especially fast is a line of
Christian fiction portraying believers struggling with
real-life problems.
   "The attitude used to be that if you loved the Lord and
lived a clean life, you wouldn't have any problems," says Mr.
Anderson. "But now our products are geared more and more
toward helping people deal with loneliness, anxiety, job
insecurity and marital problems."
   In a category known in the trade as "holy hardware," a
relatively new product called Kneeling Santa (Mr. Claus
himself, on his knees before a creche) is hot this year. But
so are old standbys such as crucifixes, Jesus portraits and
medals featuring St. Christopher, patron saint of travelers.
"People are buying lots of St. Christopher medals for
soldiers in the Middle East," says Sylvia Tillotson, owner of
Heavenly Gifts.
   Fashion is also popular. Customers are snapping up
T-shirts featuring a weight lifter and the words "God's Gym,"
as well as baseball caps that say "Jesus Saves."
   Meanwhile, parents are buying Noah's Ark sets, biblical
puzzles and "action figures" such as Jonah and the Whale for
their kids. "Children's products are our fastest-growing
category," says George Buck, president of Family Bookstores,
the nation's largest Christian chain, with 128 stores and
sales of more than $70 million.
   The Christian-goods industry has taken on a higher profile
in recent years, increasingly operating out of upscale malls
beside some of the biggest names in retailing. And it
features players as established as Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp., owner of the Family Bookstores chain.
   The higher profile, coupled with the growth of
fundamentalist Christianity, caused industry sales to triple
to more than $3 billion a year in the 1980s. General-interest
stores such as Waldenbooks have responded by giving more
space to religious books, whose sales nearly doubled to $737
million in 1989 from 1982, according to the American
Booksellers Association.
   Shoppers seeking spiritual solace also can find good deals
at Christian stores. Books of comparable size cost $2 to $5
less in Christian stores than in mainstream stores, and other
items are generally lower priced, too, says Mr. Anderson of
the Christian Booksellers Association. "Merchants in this
business have traditionally operated with narrower margins,"
he says.
   The reason: Their quest for profit is tempered by their
missionary zeal. Although that's especially true at
church-run stores, it's also the case at Rupert Murdoch's
Family Bookstores chain, an all-denominational Christian
store that seeks not only profits but converts.
   Promoting Jesus in shopping malls "is part of our
corporate mission," says Family Bookstores' Mr. Buck.
Although Mr. Murdoch's newspapers are known more for
titillating photographs than for spirituality, his company,
which acquired Family Bookstores as part of Harper &amp; Row, "is
supportive" of its evangelistic mission, says Mr. Buck.
   Many customers seem to be pursuing missionary goals as
well, buying gifts for unconverted acquaintances who face
difficulties. "In hard times, what could be more reassuring
than a gift that says, `Jesus loves you'?" asks Janice
Robinson, a Mesquite teacher. "And at Christmastime, what
could be more appropriate?"

expenditures for payroll and start-up costs.
   Separately, the company said its engineering unit was

   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont said
the nation's deepening recession wouldn't move him to adjust
current exchange-rate and monetary policies.
   "We will do whatever is necessary to maintain sterling's
position in the exchange-rate mechanism," he declared in his
first press conference since assuming his post last month. In
holding firm to the arrangement, which sets a median
exchange-rate of 2.95 marks for the pound, Mr. Lamont dashed
hopes for a Yuletide cut in interest rates or a realignment
within the European Monetary System.
   Meanwhile, government figures released separately showed
that the British economy contracted by 1.2% between the
second and third quarters this year. Amid such signs that the
U.K. recession is proving to be harsher than anticipated,
industry officials have stepped up a campaign for a cut in
base rates, which stand at 14%.
   The Confederation of British Industries' latest survey
reported that the manufacturing sector expects the biggest
falloff in production in 10 years.
                                                                                                       

   THE EC LOOKS EAST
                                                                                                       

   The European Community will begin today to negotiate
accords with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary that could
eventually lead to membership in the 12-nation bloc. The EC
said the accords would set up free trade in manufactured
goods and strengthen economic and cultural cooperation.
Provisions for financial assistance from the community may be
included in the accords, the EC said.
                                                                                                       

   SAS PLANE FOR VIETNAM AIRLINES?

   Scandinavian Airline System plans to lease one of its
Boeing 767 jets to Vietnam Airlines. However, Kjell Fredheim,
head of SAS Airline, said, "A prerequisite for the signing is
the approval of the U.S. government." He added: "We will not
enter an agreement that violates American regulations." If
the deal goes through, the aircraft will operate between
Thailand and Vietnam.
                                                                                                       

   REFORESTING THE AMAZON
                                                                                                       

   Brazil has approved the first major plan to reforest part
of the Amazon, at a cost of $3 billion, officials said. The
plan, to be funded by private industry and foreign
contributions, envisages the reforestation of 2.5 million
acres over 10 years. The state mining concern Companhia Vale
do Rio Doce, which helped draft the project, said that the
project should begin within a year.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA'S TRADE POSITION
                                                                                                       

   South Korea told the U.S. it would review its position on
global trade in an effort to contribute to the success of
stalled trade talks. Seoul officials said the U.S. complained
that South Korea had sided with the European Community and
Japan on the thorny farm-subsidy issue in the Uruguay Round
negotiations that broke down in Brussels earlier this month.
South Korea also promised efforts to prevent the country's
controversial frugality campaign from discriminating against
imported goods.
                                                                                                       

   `FORGOTTEN EMERGENCY'
                                                                                                       

   A 10-month civil war has made Liberia the world's biggest
human tragedy at present, but there has been no response to a
United Nations appeal for aid, a U.N. relief official said.
   "It's a forgotten emergency," said Frank Verhaegen, senior
relief coordinator with the U.N. Disaster Relief
Organization. "Government structures are non-existent,
hospitals are not functioning, no one has been vaccinated
since the beginning of the year and agriculture is at a
standstill."
   Mr. Verhaegen said an aid appeal launched by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Dec. 5 had gone
unheeded. "The response from the international community has
been zero," he said. "There has been an embarrassing silence
. . . at a time when everyone is rushing to the rescue of the
Soviet Union."
   Mr. Verhaegen said some countries, including the U.S.,
were probably waiting for a political settlement before
offering aid. "In the meantime," he said, "the lives of
thousands of Liberians, some threatened by famine-related
diseases, are at risk."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   In Australia, the top of the Sydney Opera House sported a
huge pair of sunglasses yesterday, put there by the
environmental group Greenpeace. The inflatable sunglasses --
70 feet wide by 20 feet high -- were accompanied by a banner
that read: "Ozone Depletion: stop it or we'll go blind." A
portable generator inflated the glasses at about 6:30 a.m.,
and they stayed in place for about an hour until police
pulled the plug. . . . Four out of 10 Britons are bored with
eating turkey at Christmas, according to a new poll. The
survey, by Market &amp; Opinion Research International, showed
salmon and duck as top choices for alternative Yuletide fare.

   Reality of the '90s Hits Yuppie Brands

   They have adjusted their Brooks Brothers suspenders,
glanced at their Rolex President watches and marched off in
their Cole Haan loafers. Perhaps never to return.
   The demise of yuppies, those young exhibitionists of
consumerism, brings a smile to many working stiffs, but
others aren't so happy to see them go. These days, marketers
of some brands like Haagen-Dazs and BMW -- icons of an era of
self-indulgence and conspicuous consumption -- are scrambling
to cope with the new values of the 1990s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Marketing experts are still debating the new psychology of
consumers, but a wholesome profile is being crafted. As baby
boomers have aged and had children of their own, family
values have replaced the quest for individual gratification.
In an uncertain economic climate, overt materialism has
become less fashionable: Nowadays, young professionals are
apt to choose the Gap over Gucci, even if money is no object.
And some boomers now fret over problems more global than
personal, including the deteriorating environment.
   "In the 1980s, Ralph Lauren's print advertising worked
because it looked like photos of George Bush's extended
family," says John Lister, executive vice president at Lister
Butler Inc., a New York consulting firm. The ads showed Mr.
Lauren's clothes and household furnishings as part of a
sporty, affluent life style plenty of consumers coveted. "But
now we're entering an age of more reasonable aspirations,"
Mr. Lister says.
   That leaves many marketers of yesterday's status symbols
desperately trying to distance themselves from the dated
yuppie image. Those companies now stress real product
attributes in their advertising, rather than trying to
conjure up a fantasy-laden life style. Marketers from Club
Med to Haagen-Dazs are pitching to families and older
individuals. Some other elite brands -- such as BMW and
Filofax -- are rolling out budget models.
   "The products that have a value separate from their brand
image are the ones that will continue to flourish," says
Clive Chajet, chairman of Lippincott &amp; Margulies Inc., a New
York image consultant. Here is a look at how seven brands of
the '80s are navigating the '90s.
   ---
   Haagen-Dazs
                                                                                                       

   It was the preferred caloric indulgence of the Me
Generation. But with health concerns mounting and families
growing, the once-elite Haagen-Dazs brand is undergoing what
management calls a democratization program.
   Although it seemed to have burst onto the scene in the
1980s, Haagen-Dazs has banged around refrigerator cases since
1961. Its popularity soared in the 1980s, however, and food
marketer Pillsbury snapped up the company in 1983. In turn,
Pillsbury was swallowed by Grand Metropolitan PLC last year.
   By then, Haagen-Dazs's sales growth had cooled to a skimpy
3% or 4% a year. Dieting had replaced self-indulgence for
many of the brands' loyalists, but Haagen-Dazs was as
fattening as ever. In part to foster an aura of exclusivity,
Pillsbury had done little advertising to draw in new
consumers.
   Under Grand Met, however, Haagen-Dazs will be pitched more
clearly to the masses, although the company swears it hasn't
tinkered with the original recipe. And prices won't be cut.
To broaden Haagen-Dazs's appeal to families, the company has
begun selling the ice cream in quart-sized packages. Early
next year, it will introduce a 96% fat-free frozen yogurt
under the Haagen-Dazs name. To get its message out, Grand Met
will spend $12 million on advertising in fiscal 1991, more
than four times 1989 levels.
   Yet convincing consumers the brand is still worth a
premium price may not be so easy if its aristocratic image is
diluted. And the brand's track record with new products isn't
stellar. Consumers weren't impressed by Haagen-Dazs snack
bars, introduced about two years ago.
   Ove Sorensen, president of Haagen-Dazs, shrugs off such
criticism. The company is already rethinking its ice cream
snacks and will introduce a new version next year. "There's
nothing inconsistent about selling the best ice cream in the
world and making it available to families, too," Mr. Sorensen
says. "At the end of the day, we're selling something that
only costs $2.59 a pint."

   Filofax Organisers
                                                                                                       

   Through much of the 1980s, Filofax leather-bound personal
organizers, costing $180 and up, were de rigueur for
hard-charging young professionals. These days, however, the
company is hoping to broaden its market by organizing the
less affluent.
   Owners of these bulging fashion accessories, which came to
be called yuppie bibles, once rhapsodized about their creamy
leather covers and myriad inserts. But after a date yuppies
will never forget -- Oct. 19, 1987, the day of the
stock-market crash -- young climbers have been less
interested in date books priced so dearly. What's more,
Filofax now faces competition from scores of cheap imitators,
as well as new pocket electronic organizers from the likes of
Sharp Electronics Corp. Last year, the 69-year-old Filofax
PLC slipped into the red for the first time.
   To keep U.S. sales growing, Filofax is rolling out two
"budget" models -- the $55 "Lincoln" and the $100 "Sherwood."
   "We want to offer organizers to the masses," says John
Belvedere, vice president of sales and marketing for Filofax
Inc., the company's U.S. unit.
   Mr. Belvedere contends the move doesn't conflict with
Filofax's elite image. The inexpensive models will simply
introduce a new generation to the brand, he says. But some
retailers, many of whom now make Filofax-like organizers of
their own, have turned up their noses at the $55 model. In
New York, for example, department stores snubbed the product
altogether, leaving it to be sold by two local office-supply
stores.

   BMW
                                                                                                       

   BMW, the "Ultimate Driving Machine," became the ultimate
status symbol of the 1980s. But with the U.S. economy ailing
and competitors like Toyota Motor Co.'s Lexus and Nissan
Motor Co.'s Infiniti crowding into the luxury car market,
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG's U.S. sales have shifted into
reverse.
   Last year, the company's U.S. unit sales were more than
30% below its 1986 peak. By November of this year, BMW had
sold 56,784 cars in the U.S., down 6% from the corresponding
period in 1989.
   To revive sales, BMW has cut prices as much as 9% on some
of its existing models. And in a move that would chill the
blood of 1980s status seekers, it has even introduced two
"entry-level" models that sell for around $20,000. New ads
for BMW will tout the car's technical attributes and resale
value, rather than its place in a glamorous life style.
   "We had to change," says Carl W. Flesher, BMW's vice
president for marketing in the U.S. "Consumers are shaky
about the economy, and it's important to reassure them."
   Not that the company will sell out completely. Don't
expect to see green marketing for BMWs, for example. "But
what we can say, and will be saying," Mr. Flesher adds, "is
that the filtered air on the inside of a BMW is cleaner than
the air on the outside."

   Corona Extra
                                                                                                       

   Yuppies loved Corona Extra Mexican beer because it looked
like an import but tasted like a good old American brew.
Adding a sliver of lime -- something no self-respecting
Mexican would do to a bottled beer -- made it doubly exotic.
   But just as the brand's popularity soared in the mid-'80s,
it plunged toward decade's end as yuppies moved on to the
next fad. Competition from domestic beer makers, in the form
of new products such as dry beers, further cut into sales.
The weakening U.S. economy hasn't helped, either. Last year,
Corona Extra sold 16 million cases of beer in the U.S.,
according to Impact, a beverage-industry publication. That is
a far cry from the 22.5 million cases sold in 1987, and sales
are likely to slip even further this year.
   To bolster the brand, Corona introduced a light beer in
1989. In its first year on the market, it sold more than a
million cases, a record for any imported beer. And both
Corona Extra and the light version are now available in
12-packs, another gimmick to increase revenue.
   Nonetheless, sales will probably never again reach the
lofty levels of the late '80s. Whether its decline will slow
remains to be seen. "This brand is not a fad," insists Ellis
M. Goodman, who imports Corona through Barton Beers Ltd. in
Chicago. "We're still the No. 2 imported beer, and that's a
position we intend to keep."

   Coach
                                                                                                       

   The Coach "Metropolitan" bag was an essential fashion
accessory of the bow-tied woman of the early 1980s.
   But the 50-year-old Coach Leatherware brand, acquired by
Sara Lee Corp. in 1985, seems to be faring just fine in the
less ostentatious 1990s. Coach's annual sales have grown from
$20 million in 1985 to over $150 million in 1989. Despite the
dismal retailing environment, its sales are expected to jump
another 20% this year.
   Once a maker of only items for women, Coach has branched
out into leather products for both men and women, including
wallets, briefcases and desk sets. The company has updated
its designs and added new colors to its line. Coach has also
broadened its distribution to include catalogs, and it now
operates 52 boutiques of its own. "We've made a conscious
effort to make our product more available to consumers," says
Lew Frankfort, president.
   But Coach's popularity has also endured because it
resisted plastering its name all over its purses.
Nevertheless, the products, which range in price from $25 for
a key case to over $300 for a woman's briefcase, are easily
recognizable. So much so that when Coach sued several
retailers recently for stealing its designs, a federal court
in New York ruled in its favor.

   Club Med
                                                                                                       

   Try as it might, Club Med can't seem to shake the dated
"swinging singles" image that clings to its name. The resort
organization, which is 73% owned by French tourism group Club
Mediterranee S.A., claims the majority of its guests are
married couples. Of the 17 villages under the North American
unit, only three still cater to hedonistic singles. Club Med
focuses on selling family vacations, and six facilities can
provide full-time day care.
   "A huge chunk of our business is already families with
children," says Michael Kubin, the newly appointed president
of Club Med Sales Inc., the company's U.S. unit. "We're also
looking at attracting vacationers over the age of 50." The
company will also emphasize corporate sales and attracting
conventions.
   But Mr. Kubin acknowledges that the organization is
wrestling with its image problem, and hasn't yet found a
solution. Club Med's current television ads, created by
Ammirati &amp; Puris Inc., a New York ad agency, seem to portray
the organization as something for everyone. The commercials
show kids, families and even older couples doing their thing
in a beautiful tropical setting.
   Image isn't Club Med's only problem. The company faces
competition from vacation packagers and other resorts that
try to duplicate Club Med's all-inclusive pricing formula.
And with the U.S. economy slumping, company officials say
European visitors account for the bulk of its guests. Club
Med's occupancy is hovering around 62%, about the same as in
recent years.

   Swatch
                                                                                                       

   When Swatch introduced its colorful watches in the U.S.
eight years ago, it almost single-handedly created a market
for fashion timepieces. Nowadays, though, many adults view
the watches as frivolous.
   Swatch, a unit of SMH (U.S.) Inc., is struggling to change
that perception. The Swiss company is rolling out new models
to attract grown-ups and has begun advertising its watches on
network television for the first time. Next year, Swatch vows
to boost U.S. ad spending by 25%.
   To get sales moving, Swatch introduced a $45 scuba watch,
guaranteed to keep ticking at depths of 600 feet. Next
summer, the company will launch a chronograph watch that will
sell for about $70, or twice the price of a classic Swatch.
The company is also considering using well-known artists to
design watches in the future. "We're doing those things to go
after that more adult, and more masculine target," says Chris
Keigel, Swatch's U.S. vice president of sales.
   A comeback is still a long way off: The U.S. market for
inexpensive watches is flat, and the competition is fierce.
Swatch has suffered from product shortages in the past, and
the introduction of its chronograph watch has already been
delayed. And though the company's U.S. sales inched up to
four million units this year, they are still far below the
company's 1986 peak of five million.

   Tokyo stocks surged Wednesday on expectations of lower
Japanese and U.S. interest rates, sparked by the half-point
cut in the U.S. discount rate to 6.5%, traders said.
   In London, futures-motivated buying and a year-end
shortage of stock in many of the blue-chip leaders pulled the
broadbased index higher.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite widespread gains, Tokyo prices were off from
intraday highs on selling related to the expiration of
futures contracts on the Singapore International Monetary
Exchange, or Simex, traders said.
   More significantly, institutional investors repeatedly
entered the market to sell into the rally, which was led by
advances on blue-chip shares, they said.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 selected issues was up 452.76
points at 24876.78.
   In early trading Wednesday, the Nikkei Index was up 455.60
to 24879.62.
   In trading early Thursday, the Nikkei Index was down
124.87 to 24751.91.
   Volume on the first section Wednesday was estimated at 620
million shares, up from 382.1 million shares Tuesday.
   Winning issues outnumbered losing issues 686 to 278, while
171 issues remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section advanced 30.93 points, or 1.7%, to 1821.41.
   The second section index fell 3.33 points, or 0.1%, to
close at 2846.78.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at 5.6 million
shares, up from 4.6 million shares Tuesday.
   Mike Kawakami, senior trader at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.,
said that Simex futures-linked unwinding between 24500 and
25000 on the Nikkei cash index during the afternoon and at
the close was partly responsible for the index's inability to
sustain intraday gains.
   "We saw some sizable selling pressure from institutions
selling into the rally," Mr. Kawakami said. Large-capital
issues that have led the market's recent rally closed lower
on heavy volume because of profit-taking pressure, he said.
   He added that although the market's supply side still
looms over its demand side, there are some investment trusts,
margin investors and institutions shopping for bargains at
lower levels.
   Hopes for softer Japanese monetary policy have been
sparking buying in interest rate-sensitive issues during the
early December rally. Steel and shipbuilding shares have been
consistent volume leaders, gaining on support from investment
trust funds and brokerage houses.
   But Wednesday, major blue-chip shares, rather than
domestic issues, saw the real activity. Mr. Kawakami said
that the yen's level also encouraged some buying of
export-oriented companies.
   "The only factor that will assure a year-end rally is an
official discount rate lowering" by the Bank of Japan
following the Fed's move, said Mr. Kawakami. The central
bank, however, remains unwavering in its cautious stance,
with an official saying Wednesday that the Fed's easing
"won't have any impact on Bank of Japan policy."
   Blue-chip issues, along with banking and other financial
stocks, were higher Wednesday.
   Sony rose 170 yen ($1.28) to 6,230 yen, TDK added 180 yen
to 4,490 yen, Fanuc rose 120 yen to 4,620 yen and Kyocera
gained 130 yen to 5,840 yen. Pioneer advanced 170 yen to
4,120 yen. Mitsubishi Bank soared 170 yen to 2,300 yen,
Mitsubishi Trust rose 110 yen to 1,790 yen, Sanwa Bank jumped
170 yen to 2,080 yen and Fuji Bank rose 140 yen to 2,450 yen.
   Ending mostly lower, steel and shipbuilding stocks were
the day's volume leaders. Nippon Steel fell 5 yen to 445 yen,
Sumitomo Metal dropped 2 yen to 469 yen, and NKK fell 3 yen
to 416 yen.
   On Wednesday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange posted data
regarding stock-futures arbitrage trading during the week
ended Dec. 14.
   The number of short cash positions held at the end of the
week totaled 288.1 million, amounting to 352.75 billion yen.
The number of long positions totaled 227.5 million, amounting
to 254.33 billion yen.
   As of Dec. 14, the number of short cash positions held
against March futures contracts rose from zero to 37.4
million. The amount came to 42.59 billion yen.
   The number of long cash positions held against March
futures contracts increased 285.1 million to 343.7 million,
marking a 322.39 billion-yen increase to 387.34 billion yen.
   In London, traders said several factors combined to propel
prices upward.
   These included valuation arguments that London shares look
cheap on an international level, the weight of institutional
liquidity and the likely good news in the new year that
interest rates will be coming down. Market watchers also said
that by factoring in the potential for a peaceful settlement
in the Middle East, shares could move significantly higher in
the short term.
   "All the sellers have been scared away," said Nick Knight,
equity strategist at Nomura Research Institute in London.
"All of a sudden the market is looking squeezed. It wouldn't
take much to push it higher, which would only exacerbate the
shortage of stock," he said.
   At the closing bell, the closely watched Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was up 16.9 points at
2178.7.
   In the futures market, the December FT-SE 100-Share Index
contract settled at 2193.0 on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, up from its Tuesday settlement
level of 2178.5.
   At its latest calculation, the narrower FT 30-Share Index
was up 12.9 points at 1707.1. Volume registered a moderate
509.3 million shares.
   In corporate developments, Pilkington, a U.K. glass
manufacturer, added 10 pence (19 cents) to 182 pence on news
that major industrial conglomerate BTR raised its stake in
Pilkington to just over 4%.
   A total of 7.5 million Pilkington shares traded while 1.8
million BTR shares changed hands. BTR closed 3 pence higher
at 335.
   Banking shares, which have been recently laboring under
fairly sizable downgrades, bounced back in moderate dealings.
Barclays added 7 to 360; National Westminster gained 6 to
270; Lloyds was unchanged at 282; Midland closed unchanged at
198.
   Wellcome shares showed the largest advance of any FT-SE
100 stock at the end of trading, gaining 20 to 463 on
turnover of 1.1 million shares. Dealers said the stock was in
demand in anticipation of an analysts' meeting this week that
is expected to be bullish for the company.
   In early morning trading Wednesday, the Hang Seng was up
12.43 points to 3079.08.
   Elsewhere Tuesday, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt
and Madrid; lower in Paris, Brussels, Stockholm and Milan;
and mixed in Zurich, Amsterdam. South African gold stocks
closed lower.
   Stocks closed higher in Hong Kong, Manila and Wellington,
lower in Singapore, Taipei and Seoul, and little changed in
Sydney.

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission showed its
mettle by imposing its biggest fine to date on a single
company for alleged breach of EC competition law.
   The Belgian chemical company Solvay &amp; Cie. was fined 30
million European currency units ($41.4 million), Imperial
Chemical Industries PLC of Britain was fined 17 million ECUs
and a unit of BASF AG of Germany was fined 1 million ECUs.
The case involved alleged market-sharing and illegal pricing
arrangements for soda ash, a chemical used mainly in the
glass-making industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Solvay and ICI said the commission's decision is
groundless and the two companies plan to appeal to the
European Court of Justice. Solvay said the fines are "totally
unjustified," while ICI said it was "shocked" by the
decision. The BASF unit, Chemische Fabrik Kalk G.m.b.H.,
couldn't be reached for comment.
   The commission said its action would help open up the EC's
soda-ash market to "genuine competition," particularly by
U.S. producers.

   Gorbachev Says He'll Use Direct Rule
   In Areas Posing `Serious Threat' to State

   MOSCOW -- President Mikhail Gorbachev, in the clearest
sign yet of his growing authoritarian mood, declared that he
will bypass local authorities and introduce direct
presidential rule in areas where events "pose a serious
threat to the state."
   The Soviet leader's remarks to the Congress of People's
Deputies, the supreme national legislature, seem sure to
aggravate an already bitter battle between the Kremlin and
the nation's 15 republics over the future structure of the
Soviet Union.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Only a few hours before Mr. Gorbachev spoke, Boris
Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic, attacked the
Kremlin for ignoring the republics' sovereign rights and
accused it of "seeking to keep its absolute power at any
cost."
   "Russia does not agree with the creation of a dictatorship
of the Kremlin," Mr. Yeltsin said, adding that Soviet leaders
seemed to be motivated by "a mad rage" against the republics.
   Brushing off such criticism, which has been echoed by
other republican leaders at the congress, Mr. Gorbachev said
he was worried about growing nationalism and ethnic conflicts
in the republics of Moldavia and Georgia, and was "extremely
concerned" about events in the Baltic states of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia.
   "I would like to stress that where the situation becomes
especially tense and there is a serious threat to the state
and to people's well-being, I will have to introduce a state
of emergency or presidential rule," he said to enthusiastic
applause from the largely conservative Congress.
   "In such a situation, I think the president will have to
take full responsibility on himself, because my attempts to
reach an agreement on working together end up by us not being
able to agree," he added.
   Over the past few days, Mr. Gorbachev has frequently
called for discipline and the restoration of law and order.
At the congress, he took issue with critics of his new
stance, describing them as being motivated by "a populism
with rotten roots."
   He spoke shortly after 53 deputies, including several
top-ranking military leaders, issued an appeal for the
president to clamp down on "separatism" and "subversive
anti-state activity."
   "Perestroika is bogged down in ruinous darkness," the
appeal said, adding that the West would understand any tough
measures that were taken. "You will be resolutely supported
by the leaders of world politics who no longer dread the
U.S.S.R. as a totalitarian superpower, but fear that
fragments of the collapsing colossus could destabilize the
world order," it added.
   Behind such rhetoric lies a growing fear in the Soviet
establishment that their powers are being usurped by leaders
of the republics. Local authorities throughout the nation
have recently ignored or directly contradicted numerous
decrees issued by Mr. Gorbachev on restoring order and
stabilizing the economy.
   The Soviet president says disarray is a result of his lack
of executive powers, and he is seeking to persuade the
congress to give him more direct authority. At the same time,
he has made some token concessions to the republics in a new
union treaty that the congress is discussing.
   But the restless republics are not impressed. Four of
them, Georgia and the three Baltic states, are flatly
refusing to sign any new treaty because they want to regain
their independence. Delegates from Moldavia walked out of the
congress on Tuesday, and Armenia, Russia, the Ukraine,
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have all said they won't sign Mr.
Gorbachev's treaty unless it is redrafted.
   The issue of giving the Soviet president greater powers
has now overlapped with wrangling over the union treaty,
casting doubt on Mr. Gorbachev's ability to create any
functioning power base.
   Mr. Yeltsin, who only four months ago appeared ready to
cooperate with Mr. Gorbachev, denounced the planned new
executive powers, saying they would give the president more
unchecked legal rights than such discredited former leaders
as Joseph Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.
   An opponent of Mr. Yeltsin, Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov, in what could be a farewell speech, lashed out at
unidentified "political forces" he claimed were trying to
destroy the Soviet economy. He said many groups were using
the cover of market economics to wage "a real political
struggle."
   At the same time, he acknowledged the failure of his
government to halt the Soviet economy's rapid decline. "We
have not managed to implement perestroika in the form that it
was originally conceived," he said, referring to Mr.
Gorbachev's economic restructuring program. Excusing the
Soviet president's "tactical errors," he added that he
himself was partly to blame because he allowed ideology to
take priority over economics.

   KKR Expands Leadership by Naming
   Fox and Ammon as General Partners

   NEW YORK -- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. said it is
adding two general partners, further expanding its leadership
beyond founding partners Henry Kravis and George Roberts.
   The new partners in the nation's largest leveraged buy-out
firm are Saul Fox, 37 years old, and R. Theodore Ammon, 41.
They both joined KKR as associates in 1984.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   KKR will continue to operate with a remarkably tiny cadre
of executives, relying on seven general partners and 10
associates to oversee an industrial empire with about $50
billion in sales. Through various investment partnerships,
KKR owns majority stakes in RJR Nabisco Inc., Safeway Stores
Inc., Duracell Holdings Corp. and more than a dozen other
sizable companies. Messrs. Ammon and Fox declined to comment,
as did other KKR executives.
   People who have worked with KKR, though, say the
14-year-old firm appears to be deliberately spreading
authority beyond its best-known partners, Messrs. Kravis and
Roberts. "It's a good sign," said Richard Beattie, a KKR
attorney with Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett. "Adding the new
general partners signals a maturation of the firm," he said.
   With the new promotions, KKR also appears to be
acknowledging that significant parts of the firm's work in
recent years have been carried out by people other than
Messrs. Kravis and Roberts.
   Mr. Fox, for one, has been closely involved with KKR's
investments in Motel 6 L.P. and Union Texas Petroleum Corp.
"He was the guy I worked with the most," said Joseph
McCarthy, president of Motel 6. Mr. McCarthy praised Mr. Fox
as "decisive and a good negotiator."
   Mr. McCarthy also said Mr. Fox's background as a tax
attorney helped Motel 6 create some innovative partnerships
to help finance the lodging company's growth. "Anyone who can
understand something as complex as the U.S. tax rules can
sift their way through a deal structure of almost any kind,"
Mr. McCarthy said.
   Mr. Ammon, in turn, played a major role in KKR's
investment in Storer Broadcasting Co., as well as its current
work with RJR. Some investment bankers have described Mr.
Ammon as a prickly negotiator. But RJR's general counsel,
Lawrence Ricciardi, said that Mr. Ammon, a lawyer by
training, has been a valuable contributor to RJR's financial
strategy.
   "Ted was the guy driving RJR's recapitalization efforts,
day to day," Mr. Ricciardi said. "A lot of people were
involved, but he had a very important role. He's
extraordinarily creative. He has a gyroscopic ability to
swivel around and adjust to a changing financial
environment."
   Messrs. Ammon and Fox become general partners at somewhat
of a crossroads for KKR. The firm skyrocketed to prominence
in the 1980s by completing more than $55 billion of
acquisitions, more than any other buyer. KKR both popularized
leveraged buy-outs -- in which companies are acquired
primarily with borrowed money -- and fueled wide
controversies about whether buy-outs were good or bad for the
U.S. economy.
   In the past 18 months, however, the U.S. takeover business
has shrunk drastically. KKR has been casting about for new
business opportunities, including making small "toe-hold"
investments in public companies, forming alliances with
industry executives seeking acquisitions, and looking for
buy-outs overseas.
   While Messrs. Ammon and Fox aren't likely to have nearly
as large an ownership share of KKR's earnings as Messrs.
Kravis and Roberts possess, they will now be able to add
their voices to the discussion about KKR's next strategic
moves.
   KKR has long emphasized consensus in its internal
workings, so it's unlikely that Messrs. Ammon and Fox will
push the firm aggressively in any new direction. But their
promotion does tilt one small balance within KKR, Mr. Beattie
observes. "Four of the seven partners now are lawyers by
training," observed Mr. Beattie, a lawyer himself, adding,
"They've got the M.B.A.s outnumbered."

   Linda S. Gottfredson's Dec. 6 editorial-page article,
"When Job-Testing `Fairness' Is Nothing but a Quota," is a
useful reminder of the extreme attempts made to justify
racial preferences. Ms. Gottfredson errs, however, in
implying that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) endorses such divisive, condescending and
inequitable policies. We are well aware of "race-norming"
advocacy that both scholarly psychometric studies and
common-sense observations justifiably denounce.
   Unlike the police chief in "Casablanca" who professed to
be shocked to learn about gambling at Rick's, we do know that
policies promoting race and gender preferences have come
about in the 25 years that EEOC has enforced Title VII. In
the course of the search for justice, governmental policies
clearly have gone awry; de facto quotas exist now, and the
1990 Civil Rights Act would have touched off a quota
explosion, forever embedding them in our employment practices
and other spheres of life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Gottfredson errs in maintaining that the EEOC has
"quietly filed suit against at least five Fortune 500
companies for not using disguised quotas for test results."
The EEOC has not filed suit and is now investigating certain
employment practices in these companies. We have, for some
time now, been reviewing our settlements and conciliations to
ensure that the relief provided is free of preferential
treatment. We wish to make clear that altering test scores to
favor a particular group is not a legal or "less
discriminatory alternative." Of course, this would be unfair
to everyone involved -- employees as well as employers. The
radical redefinition of fairness that Ms. Gottfredson
describes is in no way agency policy.
   This commission stands for aggressive law enforcement that
protects individuals from illegal discrimination. The
vitality of civil-rights enforcement should not be measured
by the preferences given different groups.

   Museum Musings: Never a Blockbuster at the Hotel Salm

   Paris -- Stepping out on the terrace of the Musee d'Orsay,
high above the Seine and the chestnut ramble of the Tuileries
Gardens and beneath a raft of white and silver clouds, you
see the landscape of the impressionists whose canvases are
fixed directly behind in the galleries you have just left.
   A Frenchman I know protests he is "scandalized" by the way
the Monets and the Pisarros and the Sisleys are hung there,
crowded together on dull gray walls in ill-lit rooms,
lacking, in short, the eclat they had when they could be seen
in the Jeu de Paume.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is hard to know what is right any more about such
paintings after having been imprisoned so long by their
fashion, a fashion that has focused a preponderant attention
on the art of late-19th-century France. We have been kept
staring at the same few painters for 50 years now as their
prices have soared into the tens of millions of dollars.
   Still, that is not the fault of the Musee d'Orsay. In
fact, once up off the ground, the visitor becomes happily
lost in the iron beams and the industrial glass of the
suburban railroad station the place once was. The great
luminous clocks that face the Seine are still the glory of
the art nouveau facade: Now you can squint out at Paris from
behind the huge hands and heroic Roman numerals.
   Across the rue de Bellechasse stands a quite different
museum, that of the Legion d'Honneur, tucked away behind the
serene neoclassic facades of the Hotel Salm, a good place to
go after the hubbub of the Musee d'Orsay. The exhibits
consist, very restfully, of ribbons and medals and
memorabilia of Napoleon I, who founded the order. There are
other displays of earlier orders of the old monarchy, notably
the order of the Holy Ghost, the one with the blue sash or
cordon bleu, familiar to all those who know the portraits of
the Bourbon kings. A connoisseur's item is a full-length
tapestry representation of the Emperor Napoleon III stepping
forward from what looks like a great ermine bathrobe.
   The Hotel Salm, which ironically was finished in 1789 and
survived the revolution only to be burned by the Commune, was
restored by the Legion of Honor and taken for its
headquarters. Its shallow dome adorned with statues looks,
leaffringed, across the Seine. Its handsomely proportioned
windows, sweeping to the gleaming parquet of the floor, are
themselves swept with thickly lined curtains of yellow silk.
   Could we visit the rest of the building, now that our tour
of the museum's few rooms is finished? "Only 25 visitors a
month," snaps the secretary from behind her formidable lobby
desk, her blue-gray eyes snapping in time. "We are already
subscribed fully for this month. If you wish to put your name
down, it will be for the next visit six weeks hence."
   "Remember, only 25 visitors at a time. Monsieur le
Chancelier is most inflexible on this point and there shall
be no exceptions," she continued. Perhaps it's a good idea.
The prehistoric cave at Lascaux had to close after only 30
years because of the pollution caused by an excessive number
of human visitors.
   Up at the corner of the rue de Bellechasse and the
Boulevard St. Germain, there is an elegant butcher shop next
to the bus stop. I watched the young butcher bone a leg of
lamb, neat as a surgeon, twirling it around with string,
finishing smartly with a single, snapped-off knot, and then
setting down on the wide wooden block before him a
rose-mahogany bundle of admirable meat geometrically laced
with white.
   An elderly couple was studying this ritual with fierce
attention. It was their meat he was preparing of course,
leaning over the glass counter as the lamb was juggled to the
scale to be weighed, tossed on a paper and wrapped
cracklingly for the cashier, an aloof, white-haired woman,
seated high at her counter.
   The butcher at once released himself into another sequence
of graceful clockwork, fencing and flicking his knife around
a large lump of white fat, which he soon transformed into a
succulent veal kidney, again tied and trimmed -- just so] And
here was the No. 68 bus.

   A sustained drop in fixed-mortgage rates to the lowest
level in nearly four years has failed so far to boost sagging
home sales.
   According to a survey of 2,000 lenders by HSH Associates
of Butler, N.J., the average 30-year rate as of last Friday
had fallen to 9.66%, the lowest since April 1987, when it was
9.5%. But real-estate agents and builders around the country
are reporting little or no new movement in the residential
market. And they expect little change until the underlying
causes of consumer concern -- high home prices in some areas,
battered regional economies, fears of a serious national
recession and the Persian Gulf crisis -- are resolved one way
or another.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Everybody is scared to death to make a move in any
direction," said Alfred Gobar, a real-estate consultant in
Brea, Calif.
   Of course, housing isn't dead in all parts of the country.
Homes are still relatively easy to sell in certain areas,
particularly in the Northwest and Midwest. Moreover, analysts
agree that lower interest rates have to be regarded as a
longer-term positive for the market. But right now, they
aren't sufficient to overcome the uncertainties that have
walloped housing sales on both coasts and sent housing starts
plunging. Indeed, a government survey indicates that the
average fixed-rate mortgage available this year will be the
lowest in 12 years, but home sales nonetheless shrank
significantly.
   The Commerce Department reported yesterday that overall
starts were up 9% for November, but the increase was
concentrated in apartment construction while single-family
starts dropped to their lowest level in eight years. If
current trends persist, some economists predict overall
starts for 1991 will fall to a post-war low well under one
million units.
   Even though the lowered interest rates have failed to
jump-start the housing market, prospective buyers are showing
more interest. Jim Arnold, vice president of sales for The
Mortgage Market, a northern California lender offering a
9.25% fixed rate with 2.5 points, said more people are
calling in for information about the rates but have yet to
act.
   "It starts with the phone calls and people asking a lot of
questions," Mr. Arnold said. "Then, usually, they come in two
weeks later and ask for a loan."
   Randall W. Lewis, executive vice president of Lewis Homes,
a builder in California and Nevada, said the interest rates
have drawn more people to the company's sales lots -- though
not to buy.
   "They come in saying, `We're just checking. We want to
make sure the time is right,'" Mr. Lewis said.
   A few agents and builders report improved sales because of
sharply falling prices. In Boston, Douglas Bray, president of
Century 21 Cityside, said his sales are up 25% from last year
due to lower prices and reduced inventory. He added that the
lowered interest rates have been instrumental in not impeding
sales.
   Lower interest rates aren't nearly as important as they
were eight years ago when the fixed rate dropped down from a
peak in the upper-teens, invigorating home sales, said J.
Larry Sorsby, vice president of finance for Hovnanian
Enterprises, a Red Bank, N.J., builder of less-expensive
homes. Today's rate, while favorable, is still only a
drop-off from the 10- to 11-point range, which was also
favorable, Mr. Sorsby said.
   "Certainly, lower interest rates will help," Mr. Sorsby
said. "But the Northeast has been hit pretty hard with the
layoffs on Wall Street, combined with lower job growth and
the Mideast crisis."
   More than anything else, the lower interest rates provide
a necessary foundation for the market's eventual recovery.
Lower home prices are the other ingredient for recovery,
along with a restoration of consumer confidence. Some
industry officials feel the lowered rates, in and of
themselves, can help bring buyers' confidence back on track.
   "It will help restore some confidence in the housing
market with the prospect that interest rates are pretty good
and things are okay," said Harley E. Rouda, a Columbus, Ohio,
realtor and president of the National Association of
Realtors.

   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- On soundstages at the Columbia
Pictures Entertainment lot, construction crews are building a
pirate ship the size of an ocean liner and a gargantuan,
multitiered tree house for the set of "Hook," an updated
treatment of "Peter Pan." Appropriately, the "absolutely no
visitors" signs posted all around the sets are marked with
skull and crossbones.
   Although the production of "Hook" is cloaked in secrecy,
it is already the most talked-about movie in Hollywood -- and
it may turn out to be among the most expensive movies ever
made here. Depending on who's talking, the compensation deal
struck with its stars, Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams, and
director Steven Spielberg will either produce the next "E.T."
megahit or the 1990s version of "Heaven's Gate," moviedom's
biggest and most expensive flop.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After nearly a decade of abandoned efforts by Mr.
Spielberg and studios such as Paramount Pictures and Walt
Disney Co. to make a modern day version of the tale of the
boy who could fly, "Hook" is scheduled to open next
Christmas, a production of the Tri-Star Pictures division of
Columbia, which was purchased by Sony Corp. last year.
   Powerful Creative Artists Agency, which represents Messrs.
Spielberg, Hoffman and Williams, negotiated an agreement that
will pay its clients roughly 40% of the movie's gross revenue
from all markets, including theatrical, video, television and
merchandising. Although the percentage varies, it can go as
high as 50% at some revenue levels.
   "Hook" -- starring Mr. Hoffman as the evil pirate Captain
Hook, Mr. Williams as the grown-up Peter Pan and Julia
Roberts as a buxom, talking Tinkerbelle -- isn't the first
movie deal that gives a big chunk of the proceeds away up
front. Two years ago, Thomas Pollock, the newly arrived head
of MCA Inc.'s Universal Studios, set tongues wagging when he
agreed to pay Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito 35% to
40% of the proceeds to get them to make "Twins," a deal that
other stars soon sought to imitate. But "Twins" cost only
about $16 million to produce; with box office revenue at
about $150 million, Universal says it made hefty profits for
the actors and the studio.
   Although "Hook" has the potential to become a blockbuster,
its much higher cost and the escalation clauses for the
director and actors will make it tough for the studio to make
much of a profit. "Hook" is currently budgeted at $40 million
to $45 million, but industry executives predict special
effects and other costs could bring the final tally closer to
$50 million to $60 million. The most conservative estimate by
rival studios that have studied the project is that "Hook"
will have to sell $125 million of tickets just to break even.
   Tri-Star also had to pay a reported $1.7 million to
producers Jerry Weintraub and Dodi Fayed to buy out a project
they had started after obtaining certain rights to the Pan
tale from London's Hospital for Sick Children, to which Sir
James Matthew Barrie, author of "Peter Pan," bequeathed the
rights. Messrs. Weintraub and Fayed also get an executive
producer credit on "Hook," even though they have had nothing
to do with the film.
   Another $850,000 and a small percentage of profits went to
Nick Castle, the director replaced by Mr. Spielberg. Indeed,
the only remaining member of the original team that developed
"Hook" is Jim Hart, who wrote the script in 1986.
   CAA declines to discuss the terms of its clients' deal.
But Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, dismisses
most of the industry talk as "jealousy." He says the deal
enables the studio to recoup its costs, but acknowledges the
movie will have to do $100 million at the box office to break
even. Still, he says, the movie is "a slam-dunk" for success,
and worth the risk. "We got a very good deal on this project
and everyone is going to make money," he says. "We'd never
have made this deal under any circumstances if we didn't
think we could make a profit."
   For Tri-Star and parent Sony, a new -- albeit rich -- kid
on the block in Hollywood, there may be reasons other than
profit for making the "Hook" deal. "They made a strategic
decision to show that they could be in business with a
director and stars of this caliber, no matter what the cost,"
says one executive involved in the transaction.
   "Hook" also makes a splash for Mr. Medavoy, who has moved
quickly to pump up Tri-Star production in the six months
since he was recruited by new Columbia Co-Chairmen Peter
Guber and Jon Peters. Tri-Star's production had fallen off
sharply after Sony acquired it and overhauled management.
Earlier this month, Mr. Medavoy officially unveiled a slate
of new projects and development deals that include such
high-priced talent as Warren Beatty, Sylvester Stallone, Al
Pacino and Robert DeNiro.
   Sony and its movie executives have ambitious plans for
"Hook." Together with Amblin Entertainment, Mr. Spielberg's
production concern, Tri-Star is already working on a
world-wide marketing campaign and dreaming up merchandising
ploys that include joint promotions with a major fast-food
chain, a toy company, and a publishing concern. Longer term,
Columbia officials envision reusing Captain Hook's pirate
ship and the tree house that is the central set for
Never-Never Land in a "Sonyland" theme park the company may
build in Southern California.
   For Mr. Spielberg and Amblin, whose biggest successes have
been such fantasy-adventure films as "E.T." and "Raiders of
the Lost Ark," making "Hook" is the culmination of a long
interest in the Peter Pan story. Mr. Spielberg and his team
worked with Paramount Pictures in the early 1980s on a
project that would have been set in modern day Ohio. But
Kathleen Kennedy, president of Amblin, says they were
reluctant to tamper too much with the original story, and
"arrived at a point where we didn't have a script we really
wanted to make and just sort of drifted away."
   Writer Jim Hart had come up with his own idea for a modern
Peter Pan tale in 1986, after his son Jake posed the
question: "What if Peter Pan grew up?" Mr. Hart, who hadn't
had a script produced, found that certain rights to the story
had entered the public domain in 1988, and came up with a
grown-up, stressed-out, overachieving Yuppie descendant of
Peter, who must journey to Never-Never Land to save his
children after Captain Hook returns from the fantasy world to
steal them away.
   Producers Gary Adelson and Craig Baumgarten introduced Mr.
Hart to director Nick Castle, and together they set up the
project at Tri-Star with then-president Jeff Sagansky. Before
the script was finished, however, Mr. Sagansky left to take
over as head of CBS Entertainment. Mr. Medavoy inherited
"Hook," and decided to go ahead with it.
   Mr. Medavoy says he immediately went to Mr. Hoffman, who
had been interested in playing Hook in another proposed
version of Peter Pan, and to Mr. Williams. Mr. Medavoy also
sent the script to Mr. Spielberg to try to get him to direct
it. Ms. Kennedy of Amblin says Mr. Spielberg fell in love
with the script's "child in all of us" concept.
   One complication, of course, was that the film already had
a director: Mr. Castle, also a CAA client. Mr. Castle was
made an unusually lucrative offer to turn the project over to
Mr. Spielberg.
   Although Mr. Medavoy maintains the deal isn't a "CAA
package," the agency clearly negotiated an astonishing deal
for its clients, one that some worry will inflate already
out-of-control demands by Hollywood talent. But supporters
note that the combination of Spielberg, Williams and Hoffman
required an unusual compensation plan, and Tri-Star had to
agree to their terms if it wanted to get the movie made.
"Even if `Hook' is a big home run for the studio, it won't be
enormously profitable for them," says one executive familiar
with the deal. "But it could give them enormous credibility."

   Begins Offer to Buy
   Half of Its Debentures

   DALLAS -- MorningStar Foods Inc. said it began an offer to
buy half of its debentures outstanding at $480 for each
$1,000 face amount as part of a plan to restructure about
$243 million in debt.
   MorningStar, a dairy concern, said it needs to restructure
$93.2 million in bank debt and $150 million in 13% senior
subordinated debentures due 2000 to avoid a bankruptcy-law
filing. The company said it doesn't believe it will be able
to repay a $22.2 million working capital loan when it comes
due March 31 or $71 million in loans that come due in June.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company was formed in 1988 to purchase the dairy
business of Southland Corp. and then purchased Avoset Corp.
from Kraft Inc. However, increases in raw milk prices hurt
its operations and liquidity last year, when it had a $39.5
million loss. This year, it sold its Texas and California
regional dairies and used the $54.2 million in proceeds to
reduce debt. It had a net loss of $15.7 million for the first
nine months on sales of $563.1 million.
   As part of its restructuring, the company said, Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan and NMB Postbank Groep N.V. have agreed
to provide a $45 million working capital loan and as much as
$95 million to refinance debt and purchase as much as $75
million face amount of debentures.
   In addition, the company has agreed to sell new preferred
stock for $11.5 million to an unidentified investor group.
After the transaction, current holders of its common will own
5% of MorningStar.
   Before the offer, MorningStar's bonds were trading at
about $350 for each $1,000 face amount. The company and its
financial adviser, Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities
Corp., appear to be betting that the premium involved in the
$480 price -- and the risk of further price declines if
holders don't tender -- will be enough to win over
bondholders. The exchange offer currently is scheduled to
expire Jan. 16.

   Bond traders cashed in all the big gains they made in
Tuesday's rally, but stock market investors held on to their
winnings.
   An accelerating round of profit-taking wiped out the gains
in Treasury bond prices that occurred Tuesday in the wake of
the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the discount rate.
Yesterday's profit-taking came despite yet another Fed move
to lower interest rates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The central bank again cut the federal funds rate, which
banks charge one another for overnight loans, this time to 7%
from 7 1/4%. Still, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost more than 1 1/8 points, or more than $11.25 for each
$1,000 of face amount.
   But the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended unchanged at
2626.73 after wandering aimlessly all day. The dollar
rebounded from the drubbing it took Tuesday, while gold
prices posted an unexpected increase. Traders said the
$9.50-per-ounce gain was mostly a response to stepped-up gold
buying in the Middle East.
   Analysts said bond traders had already bid prices higher
on speculation that the Fed would continue to aggressively
push down interest rates as the economy deteriorates. When
the Fed announced the discount-rate cut Tuesday, some traders
began to sell into the big bond rally. And when it became
evident yesterday that the Fed had once again cut the federal
funds rate, that was enough to persuade more bondholders to
sell before the expected lethargic trading of the holiday
season takes over.
   The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges
member financial institutions for loans. A change in the rate
is a powerful symbol that the Fed is moving to stimulate the
economy with lower rates.
   "Speculators saw a reward for their correct anticipation
that the Fed would ease, and they chose to take their profits
rather than carry them over into the new year," said Brian
Fabbri, chief economist for Midland Montagu in New York.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices were unchanged. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange totaled 180.4 million shares. Advancing issues on
the Big Board were ahead of losers 854 to 712.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices slumped. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year issue climbed to 8.17%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar gained. In late New York trading the currency
was quoted at 1.4785 marks and 134.05 yen, compared with
1.4762 marks and 132.62 yen Tuesday.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., citing
concern over hostile takeover activity in the electronics
industry, strengthened its anti-takeover provisions.
   The computer maker said it reduced to 10% the amount of
Sun stock that a buyer must purchase before triggering a
"poison pill" that would dilute the buyer's holdings. Sun's
anti-takeover agreement previously set the trigger point at a
20% acquisition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   William Raduchel, Sun's chief financial officer, said the
move wasn't a response to any specific takeover attempt
directed at Sun, but that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Corp.'s hostile takeover bid for NCR Corp. "certainly
focussed peoples' attention on these issues."
   Sun's anti-takeover provisions now give the holder of each
Sun share the right to buy another share at half the market
value if a person or group acquires 10% or more of Sun's
stock without the company's agreement. Sun said the amendment
won't affect AT&amp;T's 19% holding in Sun as long as the phone
company honors the terms of its stock-purchase agreement
which forbids AT&amp;T from buying more than 20% of Sun until
1998.

   Designer of a Better Baseball Cleat Finally Gets on Base

   Tight Money, Big Rivals and His Own
   Inexperience Almost Struck Him Out

<LP>
   Desperate for financing to sell a unique baseball cleat he
designed, entrepreneur Fred Ihlenburg negotiated an agreement
with a New York venture-capital firm. On the way to lunch
after signing the deal, one of the brothers who ran the firm
told him half-jokingly: "You're a lousy negotiator. I never
would have signed this contract."
   "That's when I knew I was in the hands of the
Philistines," says Mr. Ihlenburg.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was one of the most jarring revelations in a string of
painful lessons over almost a decade. He learned that coming
up with a winning product often has little to do with
success: He suffered as much from tight-fisted banks and
corporate rivals as he did from his own inexperience.
   Mr. Ihlenburg's baseball cleat was an undeniable hit.
Dozens of high school and college players, university
coaches, and several baseball stars, including the Cardinals'
Ozzie Smith, say his shoe grips better than most they've
worn.
   But it took Mr. Ihlenburg's tiny firm nearly a decade to
come close to making a profit. In that time, he lost the
company in a desperate deal with the wrong lender. A foreign
manufacturer took it over and offered him a lowly job in
sales. He won back the company only to be snubbed by more
lenders. "In the years since this started, we've been on a
wild horse trying to find someone who could give us a
saddle," says the 48-year-old Mr. Ihlenburg.
   When he first dug his heels into the cleat business, Mr.
Ihlenburg was selling women's nightgowns and lounge-wear
designed by his wife, Carol, for Why Not? Fashions, in Lake
Oswego, Ore.
   In 1980, U.S. high schools moved to ban metal-spike cleats
that at the time were considered dangerous. Too often, spikes
punctured and gashed athletes and caused twisted knees and
ankles by lodging into the ground as a player's body turned.
   While other manufacturers responded with cleats made with
rows of plastic spikes, Mr. Ihlenburg hit upon the idea of
putting two circular ridges of plastic in sections around the
soles of the shoes. The design, though hardly revolutionary,
allows a runner to dig into the ground, yet turn his foot
easily. A separate plastic protrusion in the center of the
sole allows a pivot action that one wearer describes as
"power steering of the foot."
   In 1981, Mr. Ihlenburg took his idea to Rawlings Sporting
Goods Co. It granted him a conditional license to use the
brand name in testing the design, but not to sell it. High
school and college baseball teams loved the shoe. "I was
impressed with the stop-and-go bite we got. It was
incredible," says Gary Pullins, a baseball coach for Brigham
Young University.
   In July 1983, Rawlings offered to buy the trademark, but
"the offer was so low," Mr. Ihlenburg says, "I won't even
dignify it by repeating it."
   In February 1984 -- much too late to sell to retailers in
time for the season -- Mr. Ihlenburg decided to sell directly
to high school and college coaches over the phone. In two
months, his company, Ringor Corp. of Oregon, made $800,000 in
sales.
   With demand climbing, Mr. Ihlenburg needed money to make
more shoes. But countless banks and brokerage houses refused
him credit. They also questioned his chances of success
against giants such as Nike Inc. and Adidas USA Inc.
   In 1984, a friend introduced Mr. Ihlenburg to a small
venture-capital firm that agreed to lend him $200,000 and
make its "best efforts" to raise $800,000 more within months.
Mr. Ihlenburg turned over 20% of his company's stock as
payment and the rest as collateral. The terms prompted the
"lousy negotiator" comment.
   At first, the description seemed apt. The venture-capital
firm couldn't come up with the additional $800,000 Mr.
Ihlenburg needed to expand, and he, in turn, lacked the cash
to repay the $200,000.
   But along came a blessing in disguise. Mr. Ihlenburg was
also unable to pay back $500,000 to his shoe manufacturer,
the Liao family of Taiwan. He was forced to turn over the
trademark to them, which he had put up as collateral. Because
the trademark was his company's only valuable asset, he was
able to liquidate his debt to the New York venture
capitalists with stock that was now worthless collateral.
   In 1985, the Liao family offered Mr. Ihlenburg a job as
sales manager. He refused, embarking instead on a plan to
sell 20,000 pairs of shoes that he still owned.
   Then, in 1986, the Liao family sold the trademark back to
him for a bargain $50,000. It had met resistance from
customers loyal to Mr. Ihlenburg, and had trouble competing
for shelf space against Nike and other big companies. Mr.
Ihlenburg later applied for a patent for a better design,
which he received in September 1987.
   New to the athletic footwear work, he also picked up on a
marketing truth: Endorsements by top athletes sell shoes. But
instead of paying fees, he sought to entice them with stock
in his company. He lobbied many baseball stars, including the
Los Angeles Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela and Ozzie Smith.
Though they like the shoe, they wanted fees, not stock.
   Meantime, Mr. Ihlenburg enlisted sports figures for other
tasks. Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda accepts stock as payment
for promoting the shoes at coaches' clinics and exhibitions.
And Bart Starr, the legendary Green Bay Packers quarterback,
joined Ringor as a director.
   In 1988, Ringor raised $100,000 through a merger with a
"shell," a small publicly traded company that has some
assets, but no operations. That didn't end its financial
problems, though. Last year, a New York merchant banker that
was to provide a major credit line filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 7 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. "My
heart fell right out of my chest," says Mr. Ihlenburg.
   Today, the outlook is brighter than it was nine years ago
when he got started. Sales have begun to pick up, mainly
because Mr. Ihlenburg has focused on direct sales to coaches
and schools. He can't meet demand; the company turned away
$2.5 million in orders in 1989, he says.
   About a month ago, a group of Asian investors, including
Mr. Ihlenburg's manufacturer, offered him virtually unlimited
credit for the next six years on 120-day terms. With hardly
any name recognition, a narrow market niche and crush of
corporate competitors, Mr. Ihlenburg forges ahead. "It can
only get easier," he says.

   Government Study
   Says Drug Abuse
   Is on the Decline

   WASHINGTON -- The government reported a steep decline in
the use of illegal drugs in the U.S. over the past five
years, leading President Bush to declare "our hard work is
paying off" in the war against drugs.
   A Department of Health and Human Services survey, based on
interviews with 9,259 people age 12 and older, found a 44%
drop in the overall number of Americans using illicit drugs,
to 12.9 million in 1990 from 23 million in 1985. The decline
in the current use of cocaine -- perhaps the biggest drug
scourge of the 1980s -- was even sharper. The survey showed a
72% decline in cocaine use, to 1.6 million this year from 5.8
million in 1985.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the use of crack, the most deadly form of cocaine,
remained steady. Of the 1.6 million cocaine users this year,
500,000 used crack. The department defined "current use" as
use within the past month.
   Democratic lawmakers immediately disputed the findings,
claiming that they painted too sunny a picture of the
nation's progress in battling drugs.
   The study "actually misses more addicts than it counts,"
charged Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee. His committee released its own study
yesterday that put the number of people who use cocaine at
least once a week at 2.4 million, compared with the 662,000
government figure.
   Mr. Biden noted that the HHS survey, which was conducted
by the department's National Institute on Drug Abuse, only
measured drug use among the general population -- not among
people living in prisons, shelters, treatment centers and on
the streets.
   Other critics said the survey showed that the improvement
being made was largely among the well-educated middle class,
where drug abuse tends to be occasional, rather than among
the poor.
   The HHS survey reported that while occasional use of
cocaine has dwindled in recent years, the number of people
who use the drug daily increased during the past two years,
to 336,000 in 1990 from 292,000 in 1988.
   "The favorable trends on casual drug use reported by the
survey cannot hide the fact that hard-core drug abuse in
America is a continuing crisis of epidemic proportions," said
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee.
   The HHS survey also reported:
   -- The percentage of whites in the U.S. using cocaine at
least once a month fell to 0.6% this year from 1.3% in 1988
and 3% in 1985. For blacks, use fell to 1.7% from 2.6% in
1988 and 3.2% in 1985. For Hispanics, it dropped to 1.9% from
2% in 1988 and 2.4% in 1985.
   -- Marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit drug
in the U.S., although its use has been falling since 1979.
That year, 22.5 million people, or 12.7% of the population
over age 12 used it at least once a month, compared with 10.2
million, or 5.1% of the population over age 12 this year.
   -- Consumption of alcoholic beverages also has declined.
Nearly 103 million Americans drank alcohol at least once a
month this year, according to the government survey, down
from 105.8 million in 1988 and 113.1 million in 1985.
   -- The number of adolescents using drugs fell by 13% over
the past two years, with 1.6 million youths aged 12 through
17 using drugs this year, compared with 1.8 million in 1988.
Adolescents using cocaine at least once a month fell 49% to
115,000 this year from 225,000 in 1988.

   The Homeless Lose
   Sympathy, Says
   U.S. Mayors' Study
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Conference of Mayors reported that
public sympathy toward the homeless is dwindling.
   "People don't seem to have the tolerance for homeless
people that they used to have," said Sue Myrick, mayor of
Charlotte, N.C., at a news conference held to announce the
mayors' latest study on homelessness.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The change is reflected in the trend toward limiting
homeless people's access to public property. Nine of the 30
cities surveyed in the mayors' study reported such actions,
ranging from a panhandling ban on New York City subways to
enforcement of a no-sleeping ordinance in San Francisco's
Civic Center Plaza to removal of homeless camps under bridges
in Portland, Ore.
   City officials not identified in the study reported that
the public seemed increasingly testy about the homeless
population. "People seem to be tiring of the problem," said
an official from Providence, R.I. "There is an increasing
tendency to blame the homeless for being homeless."
   Advocates of the homeless also noted the public's growing
hostility. "Certainly, as panhandlers have gotten more
aggressive, I think there have been instances where people
are intimidated," said Joan Alker, assistant director of the
National Coalition for the Homeless. "After that's been
happening for a few years, people's attitudes start to
harden."
   Even the opinion-making class, whose members just a few
years ago were trumpeting the plight of the homeless, appears
to be fed up with the issue. In a recent New York magazine
cover story titled "How to Save New York," commentators
ranging from novelist Michael M. Thomas to real estate
developer and publisher Mortimer Zuckerman called for a less
sympathetic attitude toward "vagrants," as Mr. Zuckerman
called them.
   One reason for the new hostility may be the growing size
of the homeless population. According to the mayors' study,
requests for emergency shelter increased during the past year
by an average of 24%. Nineteen percent of the homeless people
requesting emergency shelter were turned away, usually
because the cities lacked proper facilities to house them.
   Another factor in the public's attitude may be the lack of
adequate facilities for the mentally ill homeless, who are
estimated in the mayors' report to constitute 28% of the
homeless population. "I'm seeing more and more mentally ill
people on the street," said Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, who
every night ferries homeless people to Boston shelters. "I
don't even know where to take them."
   The housing bill recently signed by President Bush sets
aside $123.2 million for housing for the homeless, tied to
the provision of services such as mental health care and the
rehabilitation of drug users. But Congress hasn't yet funded
the bill.

   FASB Issues
   Rule Change
   On Benefits
   ----

   NEW YORK -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board, in
one of the most significant changes to accounting ever,
issued a rule on post-retirement health benefits that could
cut corporate profits by hundreds of billions of dollars.
   The controversial new rule, approved unanimously by the
FASB's seven members, requires companies beginning in 1993 to
accrue, or set up a reserve for, future medical benefits of
retirees rather than deduct them from reported profits each
year when paid, as is current practice. Government officials
estimate that the rule may reduce total corporate profits by
at least $200 billion -- and maybe by as much as $1 trillion
-- over a period of years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's the most significant accounting change since the
adoption of depreciation about 80 years ago," says Eugene H.
Flegm, assistant controller of General Motors Corp.
   Like most corporate executives, Mr. Flegm agrees with the
basic principle of accruing such benefits because they are a
real and rapidly growing obligation. But he is unhappy that
the FASB wasn't able to do more damage control in framing the
rule. "We're not thrilled by this new FASB statement {rule}
because we're not sure it will produce accurate enough data
worthy of the annual financial statement," he said.
   For some time, it has been clear that the rule would
sharply reduce reported corporate profits. But now that
companies and their benefit consultants are crunching more
definite numbers, they are discovering exactly how great the
damage will be -- even with recent FASB changes to
accommodate corporate gripes.
   Companies with long-standing union contracts guaranteeing
health benefits are particularly concerned. For example,
financial analysts and actuaries estimate the rule could
reduce General Motors Corp.'s annual reported profits by more
than $600 million, or about $1 a share. For 1989, GM reported
after-tax profit of $4.2 billion, or $6.33 a share.
   Asked about this estimate, Mr. Flegm said it is too early
to gauge the FASB rule's effect on GM profits "but there's no
question it will be a significant number."
   For some big industrial companies, the rule could wipe out
retained earnings or possibly stockholder's equity, depending
on how they apply it, say financial analysts and accountants.
   Financial analysts, for example, point to Chrysler Corp.,
whose actual "pay-as-you-go" retiree health costs amounted to
$260 million in 1989, or 47% of pretax profits. Actuaries and
health-benefit consultants say the FASB rule could boost
annual health-care costs on an accrual basis for Chrysler by
as much as six times.
   And the huge amount that Chrysler would have to book to
catch up on health-care retiree costs for its current
employees could wipe out its retained earnings of $5.2
billion reported last Dec. 31, say financial analysts,
actuaries and accountants. Chrysler declines to confirm or
deny this estimate. "We aren't in a position to estimate the
potential impact {of the FASB rule} . . . due to the
flexibility that the company will have in implementing it," a
Chrysler spokesman said.
   Under the final version of the FASB rule, however,
Chrysler has an out. It can spread that catch-up accrual
costs over the next 20 years, avoiding the major damage to
its financial results. All companies, in fact, may amortize
such costs over the two decades or take the big hit
immediately over one of the next three years.
   But the dual choice will make it tough for financial
analysts to compare corporate financial results. "It's an
analyst's nightmare," said Pat McConnell, a managing director
with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. who publishes an accounting
newsletter for the securities firm.
   The new FASB rule also creates tricky new problems for
business in designing health-plan changes. "The new FASB
statement {rule} contains a lot of minefields that will
trigger damage to the bottom line for unwary companies making
such changes," warns Harold Dankner, a benefits-consulting
partner in Washington, D.C., with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a major
accounting firm based in New York. For example, the rule
immediately penalizes reported profits if new health-plan
changes aren't consistent with past practice, says Mr.
Dankner.
   Timothy Lucas, research director for FASB, the chief
rulemaking body for accountants, based in Norwalk, Conn.,
concedes that the new rule "does have a downside for
financial analysis." Mr. Lucas says the dual accounting
treatment "was in response to some corporate requests for
relief" from the huge catch-up charge for the current work
force.
   But many companies are still riled at the FASB for not
providing more relief from the rule. Currently, companies
only deduct health-care benefits from profits as they are
paid each year because, unlike pension benefits, such costs
aren't tax-deductible.
   Paul Lukens, chairman of a subcommittee on health-benefit
accounting of the 13,500-member Financial Executives
Institute, asked the FASB to ease the rule even further but
was rejected.
   Mr. Lukens asked the FASB to calculate benefits from the
date of hire until actual retirement rather than the date of
eligibility for benefits, which would have reduced the profit
decline by as much as 15%. He asked the FASB to permit
companies to deduct the accrual costs from retained earnings
-- where the reduction is less damaging to a company's
stock-market performance and debt-raising -- rather than
profits. And he asked that a less-punitive index be used to
measure such costs.
   Many companies haven't yet decided whether to implement
the rule now or over 20 years. "We're tilting toward a
one-time hit but we still haven't made up our minds," said
Earl Timmons, vice president and controller of Du Pont Co. in
Wilmington, Del. "Why choose to hemorrhage your earnings over
20 years when you can get the entire hemorrhage behind you?"
he says.
   Some companies are reducing their health-care costs for
retirees to ease the effect of the FASB rule, which has been
under study for years. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.,
for example, last year negotiated with its union to pay
health-care benefits to retirees to a maximum fixed amount,
based on years of service.
   This dollar-denominated cap -- in contrast to open-ended
medical benefits that many companies offer retirees -- will
help reduce health costs from 30% to 50% in the future when
retirees begin sharing premium costs in mid-1995, AT&amp;T said.
   And Grand Metropoliton PLC's Pillsbury subsidiary in
Minneapolis is giving employees dollar credits for years of
service to be applied to retiree health care.
   Coopers &amp; Lybrand's Mr. Dankner said that with the FASB
rule, companies will have to be very careful to avoid
immediate impact on their profits. "Its very tricky," he
adds.

   Airline's Fleet of Midsize
   Jetliners to Be Replaced
   By Both 777s and A-340s

   TOKYO -- All Nippon Airways, caught in an intensifying
battle between the U.S. and European aircraft industries, has
decided to split orders for its next generation of midsize
jetliners between each side.
   In a long-awaited announcement, the Japanese airline said
Wednesday that it will spend as much as $4.1 billion on
orders for Seattle-based Boeing Co.'s new 777 model and as
much as $1.7 billion on orders for the A-340 made by Europe's
Airbus Industrie consortium.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All Nippon's is the second order for the 777, Boeing's
first all-new model in more than a decade, since it was
introduced in October. Industry officials have been closely
monitoring orders for the new plane to determine whether the
high-stakes Boeing project will succeed in the increasingly
competitive market. With its military segment losing money in
recent years, Boeing's profitability has been riding on its
commercial aircraft business.
   All Nippon's decision to place one-third of its total new
order with Airbus gives the European consortium its first
contract in Japan for its midsize A-340. A spokesman for the
airline said the orders were the first that it had split for
one category of plane.
   Boeing officials downplayed the split. "Certainly it isn't
unprecedented," a spokesman for the Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group said. "I think it's very difficult to
second-guess what a customer ultimately is going to do."
   All Nippon said it is committed to buying 15 777s, which
Boeing values at $2.6 billion in delivery-year dollars,
including spares and support, and has options to buy 10 more.
ANA also placed five firm orders with Airbus and took options
on five more A-340s. The airline spokesman said the company
has never canceled an option. Industry observers say such a
move can increase maintenance costs.
   Many analysts and industry officials also believe All
Nippon split the orders "for political reasons," said Peggy
Furusaka, an airline analyst with Baring Securities Ltd.'s
Tokyo office. Competitors have accused Airbus's European
sponsors of using subsidized rates and the lure of potential
European landing rights to secure orders and develop a viable
aircraft industry.
   An Airbus official in Tokyo strongly denied that the
consortium used either tactic to get the All Nippon contract.
By choosing the A-340, the airline has helped to sow "the
seeds of an even deeper and longer-lasting relationship
between our two companies," Airbus managing director Jean
Pierson said in a statement.
   Boeing itself gave All Nippon a few incentives to buy the
777, including turning over 20% of the plane's development to
Japan's three leading aircraft makers. "Unless Japanese
companies purchase this," said Noriko Umino, an analyst for
Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd., "Japanese bureaucrats who
make it a national policy to develop an aircraft industry
lose face."
   In addition, "this reduces Japan's trade surplus" with the
U.S., said Jesus Duarte, an analyst with W.I. Carr (Overseas)
Ltd. The aircraft field is the last remaining major
industrial sector in which the U.S. has a trade surplus with
Japan.
   The clear loser from ANA's decision is St. Louis-based
McDonnell Douglas Corp., whose midsize MD-11s were also under
consideration. The next major competition in Japan for
aircraft orders is expected to be a Japan Air Lines order in
the third quarter of 1991. Officials at the Douglas Aircraft
Co. unit in Long Beach, Calif., declined comment on the All
Nippon order.
   Although Boeing controls more than half of the world
commercial-aircraft market, its new 360-seat wide-body 777
fills a longstanding gap in its lineup. The aircraft has
several features considered innovative, such as folding
wingtips that allow it to be parked in slots designed for
smaller planes. Boeing received its first order for the 777
two months ago, when UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines,
said it would buy as many as 68. All Nippon will begin taking
delivery of its planes in 1995.

   Last Christmas, Earl Havlock of Ashland, N.H., was hailed
as a living Santa Claus. In a widely reported heartwarming
story, Mr. Havlock gave the $8.9 million he won in the New
Hampshire lottery to his older brother, Elwood.
   Today, Earl wants his money back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a lawsuit filed against his brother, Earl, 43 years
old, claims he didn't really mean to hand his winnings over
to Elwood, 50. Rather, he now claims, the so-called gift was
an attempt to trick authorities and the general public so
that Earl, an epileptic, could continue receiving about $300
a month in Social Security benefits.
   "That story about brotherly love and the spirit of
Christmas was a great story," says Robert Foley, Earl's
attorney. "Unfortunately that's not the whole story."
   A year ago, this account was given:
   Two days before Christmas, Earl bought a $1 lottery ticket
at Luff's Corner Cupboard, a general store in Ashland, and
discovered a few minutes later that he had won the large sum.
Overjoyed, he called Elwood from the store, asking him to
collect his Christmas present. When Elwood arrived, "Earl
said to him, `Merry Christmas, brother,'" reported Patricia
Vallieres, the store owner.
   "People from around the country called to ask: `Is that
true? Did he really give the money away?'" says Malcolm
Taylor, a reporter for the Evening Citizen, who broke the
story. "Apparently we were all the victims of a charade."
   What really happened, according to the suit, was that the
two brothers agreed, at least orally, to split the money six
ways, including shares for four other siblings.
   The first of the 20 annual installments -- amounting to
$357,600 after taxes -- was paid last December to Elwood.
Since then, he has given some money to family members, but
"significantly less than the one-sixth agreed to," Mr. Foley
contends.
   Meanwhile, Elwood's wife, Rowena, has filed for divorce,
asking for half the jackpot. Fearing he could lose millions
of dollars in a divorce settlement, Earl filed suit, claiming
he was duped by his brother into duping the public.
   "He's unsophisticated, he's gullible," Mr. Foley says of
Earl. "He doesn't know much about the value of money. Some
people might think, `Gee, he must be crazy to give up $8.9
million for a $300 monthly check.'"
   Elwood's attorney, Stephen Kain, declined to comment,
saying he plans to file a response to the complaint next
month.

   EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- In an apparent attempt to
calm any fears over the continued existence of N.V. Philips,
the president of the Dutch electronics giant said a break-up
of the company would be "the very last resort."
   In an interview published in a company newsletter, the
executive, Jan D. Timmer, said: "We are assuming that if
everybody does their bit, improvements can be made throughout
Philips that will allow us to maintain the company in its
current form. Splitting the company up is the very last
resort, a step that neither I nor Philips are ready to take."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was the first time Mr. Timmer had publicly mentioned
the possibility of a breakup of Philips if his restructuring
plan fails.
   Tom Gietman, an analyst with Van Meer-James Capel,
speculated that the statement was intended as a warning to
Philips's Dutch unions not to present obstacles to the
restructuring drive.
   Last summer, Mr. Timmer decreed an extraordinary
cost-cutting effort aimed at trimming corporate fat and
reversing losses. Part of the cutback involves eliminating
55,000 jobs in Philips's world-wide operations. The company
makes a wide range of consumer electronic items from light
bulbs to televisions.

   UPS Challenges Leaders in Air Express

   Improved Service and

   In its own methodical way, United Parcel Service of
America Inc. is muscling deeper into the $9 billion-plus
domestic air-express business.
   That business was largely created -- and is still
dominated -- by Federal Express Corp. But in recent months,
UPS -- the Greenwich, Conn., ground-shipping giant -- has
been:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- Hammering away at Federal's service edge. Armed with
more than $1.5 billion in improvements to its system of
tracking and scheduling deliveries, as well as a more
flexible Teamsters contract, UPS now guarantees 10:30 a.m.
next-day delivery in more locations than Federal. It also is
expanding its ability to pick up packages for delivery within
an hour, and is talking about matching Federal's Saturday
delivery option.
   -- Offering bigger discounts to large-volume customers.
UPS started experimenting with limited discounts two years
ago. Now the company's salespeople are bidding on more
contracts and telling shipping managers that UPS is willing
to haggle on price as other carriers have done for years.
   -- Reorganizing and enlarging its sales force. The company
is trying to hire sales specialists from other carriers and
has realigned its national sales staff to focus on specific
industries, including health care and electronics.
   UPS, with 237,000 employees and $12.4 billion in revenue,
has hit several roadblocks -- some the result of its own
inertia. Some shippers say UPS's discounts, reportedly in the
10% to 20% range, aren't substantial enough; others complain
that its sales staff still hasn't learned to compete with
Federal. Some analysts, meanwhile, say UPS is trying to play
catch-up in an industry battered by too many players, too
many fax machines and a looming recession.
   Competitors, however, are wary.
   "When a company of the size and resources of UPS decides
it wants to be involved in a particular niche of ours or
Federal Express's, I think it's cause for concern," says Kent
W. Freudenberger, executive vice president for marketing and
sales at Airborne Freight Corp., a Seattle-based competitor
that operates as Airborne Express. "The worst thing we could
do is underestimate UPS."
   How much UPS already has gained in the air is difficult to
measure, because package volume is reported and calculated in
different ways. Federal, for instance, claims (and some
analysts agree) that its own share of the next-day market has
held steady at about 45% for the past two years. It
acknowledges that UPS has grown -- but at the expense of
other competitors. Closely held UPS declines to estimate
market share.
   But Air Cargo Management Group, a Seattle consulting firm,
says UPS's share of first- and second-day air has grown by 10
percentage points since 1988 while Federal's may have dropped
as many as 14. Moreover, UPS's decision earlier this month to
raise retail air-shipment rates an average of 9.9% could give
it the freedom to offer better prices to frequent customers
and thus gain market share.
   Some companies are changing their loyalties. Before this
year, Square D Co., an electrical-equipment manufacturer
based in Palatine, Ill., gave little of its $7 million to $9
million in annual air shipping to UPS, says Charles A.
Gerardi, manager of transportation. Now, however, UPS gets
25% of the business because it's giving Square D a break on
price. (Mr. Gerardi wouldn't say how much.)
   "Before, {UPS} said, `This is the lowest geographically
published rate there is,'" recalls Mr. Gerardi, who says he
reminded the company that its competitors were offering
discounts. UPS replied, "Well, we don't do that," Mr. Gerardi
adds. But, "They're doing that now."
   The company, however, still has a lot to learn about
wooing volume customers, according to some shipping managers.
That includes the art of staying in touch.
   "Federal Express was on the phone every day or every other
day, saying, `Hey, how's it coming? Have you made any
decisions yet? Is there anything else you need?'" says a
shipper for a large New Jersey pharmaceutical company that
was considering signing a contract with an air-express
company. "With UPS, the bid was sent out, and it came back,
and there was nothing else."
   "Nobody would ever accuse them of being pushy
salespeople," says Philip M. Binkow, president of Payment
Technologies, an Atlanta firm that helps companies reduce
their express-mail costs. Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, an Emory
University professor who has studied UPS in depth, thinks
that's because the company's culture has long encouraged
humility and modesty.
   UPS is also making its moves from a position of some
weakness. Increased competition on the ground from Roadway
Express Inc., an Akron, Ohio, unit of Roadway Services Inc.,
as well as the cost of expansion overseas, have helped reduce
UPS's profit margin to 8.4% through the first nine months of
1990, down from 9.5% a year earlier. Still, the company's
$847.9 million of long-term debt represents a relatively
comfortable 10.3% of assets. That compares with more than $2
billion of debt at Federal, representing almost 36% of
assets.
   Indeed, UPS's efforts come at a particularly bad time for
its biggest rival. Federal, based in Memphis, Tenn., has seen
growth in domestic volume slow to 9%, compared with 16% to
20% earlier in the year. Last month, to win a $50
million-plus contract to provide next-day service to the
federal government, Federal Express bid $3.75 a light package
-- a rock-bottom price that surprised government officials
and astonished some competitors and customers.
   Federal insists the low price reflects favorable geography
(most of the government's shipments come from Washington,
D.C., and Los Angeles, where Federal Express has extra
capacity) and not market pressures. Still, a combination of
concerns about pricing pressures, slower volume growth and
competition from UPS have prompted some analysts to cut their
earnings estimates for Federal. (Current estimates for fiscal
second-quarter figures, scheduled to be released today, range
from 55 cents to 65 cents a share, off from 70 cents last
year.)
   Paul R. Schlesinger, a Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
analyst who slashed his earnings estimate last month for
Federal, expects customers to push for bigger discounts. If
that happens, UPS has the advantages of a small debt load and
a formidable ground-delivery service: Its drivers already
drop in daily at 1.1 million accounts.
   Mr. Schlesinger said it was largely UPS that kept Federal
from instituting a fuel surcharge this fall. "Federal Express
-- they wouldn't like to hear it put this way -- but they
take their pricing marching orders from Greenwich."
   Not surprisingly, Federal executives disagree. The company
says it has no plans to match UPS's price increase, for
instance, which takes effect in February. "We set the pricing
in the market," says William J. Razzouk, Federal's senior
vice president of sales and customer information. "When
somebody else gets to be the market leader -- and we have no
intention of letting that happen -- then someone can say
we're taking our pricing orders from them."

   Just Saying No Isn't Enough

   In her important new book, "Narcoterrorism" (Basic Books,
272 pages, $19.95), Rachel Ehrenfeld explores the connections
between drugs and political power in a changing world. She
documents the unholy alliance, prior to the end of the Cold
War, between Soviet-supported Marxist states and drug
traffickers. And she describes the threat posed to the West
by the burgeoning relationship between narco-traffickers and
various terrorist insurgencies.
   Ms. Ehrenfeld, whose background is in criminology, begins
with a discussion of Bulgaria, the most loyal of Soviet
allies. She describes how the Bulgarian intelligence service
created a front company to facilitate the movement of Middle
East heroin to Europe and Asia; profits were sometimes used
to buy weapons for Palestinian and other Middle Eastern
terrorists; sometimes weapons were simply exchanged for
drugs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sandinistas and Colombia's M-19 have also profited nicely
from the drugs flowing through Cuba and into the U.S., writes
Ms. Ehrenfeld, who lifts some of the mystery surrounding the
show trial and execution of several Cuban military officers
on trafficking charges in 1989. She argues that Castro may
have feared his drug operations had been penetrated and were
about to be exposed. By blaming a popular perestroika-leaning
general, Castro simultaneously eliminated a potential threat
to his leadership and prevented an embarrassing
drug-trafficking scandal.
   The information is indeed fascinating and historically
extremely important. However, the author fails to discuss how
changes within the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as well
as the ending of the Cold War, have influenced Marxist
support of narco-terrorism. It seems likely that recent
events have already damped the Soviets' capacity and desire
to involve themselves in foreign adventures.
   Ms. Ehrenfeld also makes the mistake of giving too much
credit to Castro and other Marxist/Leninists by arguing they
have "nearly totally dominated this particularly dirty
business." But those dominating the drug-trafficking business
are more interested in profits than politics.
   Still, there is no question that the relationship between
narcotics trafficking and terrorist insurgencies will
accelerate with fading Soviet support. An increasing number
of groups, from South America to the Middle East to Asia,
have learned methods of financing their activities either
through dealing drugs directly or by inserting themselves
into the drug-trafficking process as middle men or security
operatives.
   Ms. Ehrenfeld raises questions about the traditional U.S.
approach to anti-narcotics policy outside our borders:
illicit crop eradication in drug-producing countries,
coordinated by the U.S. Department of State; and the
indictment, extradition and prosecution of foreign "drug
kingpins" carried out in most cases by the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   Crop eradication has been an abject failure; there are
world-wide bumper crops of opium poppy and coca leaf.
Furthermore, the prosecution approach, while recently
providing some valuable extraditions, is inherently limited
because it is directed at individuals who purposely avoid
subjecting themselves to U.S. law-enforcement jurisdiction.
The folks at DEA can paper their walls with indictments of
Pablo Escobar, but it won't do any good unless they catch him
vacationing at Disney World.
   Altogether, Ms. Ehrenfeld raises worrisome questions
concerning national security implications and reinforces the
belief that the U.S. national security agencies must get
actively involved in dismantling drug-trafficking
organizations, overtly and covertly.
   The DEA does an excellent job abroad. Its people are
probably the single most courageous group of U.S. civil
servants, but they should not be forced to shoulder the
entire international anti-drug mission. President Bush has
energized most federal agencies to tackle the drug problem,
but the U.S. national security community has only recently
geared up for its new mission. The Defense Department and
Central Intelligence Agency have mounted impressive efforts
to collect information on narcoterrorism. Yet it is not at
all clear how all this information will be used to actually
attack the problem.
   For example, when told of my proposal to shoot down
aircraft outside our borders (only in situations where we are
certain they are smuggling drugs), a National Security
Council staffer responded that it would be ill-advised to use
force "on a suspect before he'd been indicted." From this one
might conclude that the national security community views
Pablo Escobar in the same way it views Colonel Gadhafi, whom
we are perfectly willing to attack without an indictment.
   Moreover, the circus atmosphere surrounding the
prosecution of Gen. Manuel Noriega, even prior to the
beginning of the trial, further demonstrates the weaknesses
of treating international narco-terrorism as a traditional
law-enforcement problem.
   "Narcoterrorism" lays out an important strategic challenge
for the U.S. in the 1990s. A number of agencies within our
government need to work to disable growing narco-terrorism
movements before they start destabilizing entire regions of
the world. This is one part of the drug war we had better
win, and we can only win it if we begin to fight.

   Regulators Give
   Nynex Increase
   Short of Request

   Raised Depreciation Charges
   Offset the Revenue Gain
   Of New York Telephone

   New York regulators granted Nynex Corp.'s New York
Telephone unit a $250 million rate increase, far less than
the company's $831.7 million request but well above most
recommendations.
   Investors who thought they soon would see higher earnings,
however, received a surprise. The commission offset the
revenue gains by increasing depreciation charges. While most
companies would be happy to write off their equipment faster,
New York Telephone complained that the commission "did not go
far enough in recognizing our need to improve earnings in
1991."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Those looking for a windfall in earnings are going to be
disappointed," said Jack Grubman, analyst with PaineWebber
Inc. "But those who look for cash flow and firm value will be
happy."
   New York Telephone had sought depreciation charges of
nearly $190 million in connection with upgrading its network.
The six-member Public Service Commission yesterday voted
unanimously for the $250 million increase but boosted
depreciation charges by $72 million.
   "Investors expected a rate increase of $250 {million} to
$300 million, with $60 million or more in additional
operating income," said Robert Morris, analyst with Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. "They don't get that now."
   Nynex shares, which had been climbing all week, fell 87.5
cents to close in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
at $73.375 yesterday. They had traded as high as $75.50
during the day.
   "We didn't want additional funds to be going to earnings,"
said Commissioner Gail Garfield Schwartz. "We believe a 12.2%
return on equity is reasonable and justified."
   New York Telephone said it was disappointed by the
decision, which it said could hurt plans to upgrade its
network. The commission, it said, "did not go far enough in
recognizing our need to improve earnings in 1991." The
company, which agreed to a rate moratorium in 1985 and
extended it in 1987, said it had cut rates by $467 million,
and that the new rates "will still be significantly below
those that were in effect five years ago."
   The commission reserved judgment on any extra charges New
York Telephone customers may have paid in connection with
transactions among Nynex affiliates as well as transactions
between the company's former purchasing unit and suppliers
who attended annual parties in Florida. The PSC has been
investigating transactions involving the phone company and
other Nynex units that stemmed from disclosures of
overcharges by its purchasing unit to New York Telephone
affiliates as well as the annual Florida parties, nicknamed
the "Perverts Conventions."
   The rate increase goes into effect Jan. 1, but the
commission must further consider how the increase will be
apportioned among New York Telephone's various categories of
service. Robert Anderson, the phone company's managing
director for regulatory planning, said the decision
apparently will result in an overall 4.8% rate increase, with
a 7% boost for residential customers and 2% for businesses.
The exact increases, however, won't be known until tomorrow
when the commission issues its formal report.
   In voting for a $250 million increase, the commission
rejected the recommendation of three administrative law
judges, who two months ago urged the commission to allow only
a $23.6 million boost. Data submitted by the company during
the contentious rate case didn't support a big increase, they
argued. The commission also rebuffed the state Consumer
Protection Board, which recommended rolling back rates.
   Richard Kessel, head of the consumer agency, said he was
"terribly disappointed by the decision because the company
isn't entitled to any rate increase whatsoever." Mr. Kessel
said the agency plans to challenge the decision.
   Nevertheless, the decision does give New York Telephone an
added incentive to pare costs and operate more efficiently.
The commission earmarked $35 million to improve wiring in
neighborhoods and other phone equipment outside of phone
company switching centers. As for the company's complaint
that network modernization will be stifled, Commissioner
Schwartz said that New York Telephone "didn't have anything
in the revenue request that would have gone toward building
an intelligent network."

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has a big stake in whether the
German government finances reunification through raising
taxes or borrowing, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office
said.
   If Germany does what former President Ronald Reagan did a
decade ago and borrows heavily in world markets to finance
government spending, the CBO projects that U.S. interest
rates in the 1990s will be about one percentage point higher
than they otherwise would be.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But if Germany raises the money by taxing its citizens,
U.S. interest rates will be only about three-tenths of a
percentage point higher, the CBO study projects.
   For years, Germany has been supplying savings to the rest
of the world, but the huge cost of rebuilding the former East
Germany will change this signficantly.
   "In recent years, the U.S. budget deficit has kept real
{inflation-adjusted} interest rates high," said the
congressional Joint Economic Committee, which requested the
study on how changes in Europe will affect the U.S. economy.
"The budget agreement just enacted is designed to alleviate
the deficit's upward pressure on interest rates, but this
could be countered by the interest-rate effects of German
fiscal policy."
   The CBO projections rely on a computer model of the
economy developed by Warwick McKibbin of the Reserve Bank of
Australia and Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University.

   WASHINGTON -- Savings and loans under government
management posted losses of $2.3 billion for the third
quarter, said the Resolution Trust Corp. That was a slight
expansion from the previous quarter.
   Losses for the 206 thrifts awaiting sale or liquidation by
the government included $1.5 billion in write-downs on assets
and losses on the sale of assets. Losses on assets are
expected to represent the biggest slice of the $200 billion
cost of the thrift-industry cleanup.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 206 reporting thrifts held $90.7 billion in assets,
which have shrunk 27% since the thrifts were seized by the
government, the agency said.
   Meanwhile, the longer the thrifts remain in government
hands, the higher their operating costs, incurred by
taxpayers, pile up. Third-quarter results include $863
million in operating losses, which stop accruing when the
government disposes of those thrifts.
   The losses of 247 government-controlled thrifts in the
second quarter were restated yesterday to $2 billion,
according to the agency. S&amp;Ls that aren't under government
management recently reported losses of $631.4 million for the
third quarter.
   Losses from government-controlled thrifts aren't likely to
abate soon. About 218 S&amp;Ls are considered to be immediate
candidates for government takeover. Several hundred more S&amp;Ls
could fail, if the economic slowdown is protracted,
regulators say.

   Wall Street Prods Investors to Mediate
   Rather Than Arbitrate Broker Disputes

   NEW YORK -- Wall Street, beset by an avalanche of investor
complaints, is increasingly prodding small investors to
mediate -- rather than arbitrate -- disputes with brokers.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, which
handles two-thirds of all arbitration filings, has launched a
pilot program that encourages investors and brokerage firms
to try the mediation route. Several stock exchanges and the
American Arbitration Association also are urging investors to
use mediation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mediation has long been used in labor and other disputes,
but has been slow to catch on in the securities business.
Unlike litigation or arbitration, there is no formal hearing
or binding decision when a case goes to mediation. Instead,
the parties voluntarily meet to try to hammer out a
settlement.
   "It's a way to get people together early on in their case,
cut costs and have a neutral party listen and evaluate both
sides," says Deborah Masucci, the NASD's director of
arbitration.
   The typical result: quicker and less costly cases for
investors and brokers. And mediation helps reduce the
fattening caseload of arbitration cases involving the
securities industry and unhappy investors. In the NASD pilot
program, about 60% of the cases that went to mediation were
settled, compared with about a bit more than 50% in
arbitration.
   While most securities disputes are heard by a panel of
three arbitrators who decide the case, mediation typically is
handled by an independent attorney in an informal series of
meetings. The mediator's job is to work with the parties to
analyze the case and settle it. Most securities mediation
cases are heard before the American Arbitration Association
or U.S. Arbitration and Mediation Inc.
   "A mediator's role, as opposed to that of arbitrators, is
one of conciliation, not decision-making," says Richard P.
Ryder, editor of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, a
Maplewood, N.J., newsletter. "He doesn't sit as a judge, but
more of a referee."
   Securities specialists applaud the move toward mediation.
They say the process helps investors and brokers analyze
their disputes and find ways to reach a compromise. "A lot of
these cases just have to do with how much a broker is going
to pay to get rid of the claim," says Robert Coulson,
president of the American Arbitration Association.
   Investors typically sign an agreement when they open a
brokerage account, binding them to accept arbitration rather
than file a lawsuit if a dispute arises. While arbitration is
less costly than litigation, the buildup in arbitration cases
is leading securities firms to look to mediation as an even
less costly alternative.
   But mediation is no panacea. Sometimes, investors or
brokers don't need or want it; they are able to reach a
settlement amicably without mediation. More important, the
facts or circumstances of some cases lead the parties to want
to avoid any kind of compromise.
   And some securities lawyers claim that investors lose out
in mediation because they typically are giving up the chance
to get back all they claimed is owed them.
   "Most people go into arbitration with the idea that they
want to win it all or be prepared to lose it all," says
Jeffrey L. Liddle, a New York lawyer who often handles
arbitration cases against brokerage firms.
   The NASD's recent pilot program is far from a smashing
success. After randomly selecting 203 cases to refer to
mediation, only in 36 cases did both parties agree to attempt
mediation. Says the NASD's Ms. Masucci: "The number of cases
funneled into mediation is smaller than we really expected."
   Still, the mediation cases were closed out more quickly
than arbitration. The average mediated case took nine months,
compared with nearly a year for arbitration, the NASD says.
   And mediation in securities cases is picking up steam.
Although statistics aren't available on the number of
securities disputes being mediated, "we're seeing more of it,
because it works," says the American Arbitration
Association's Mr. Coulson.
   At least, the parties agreeing to mediation have nothing
to lose. If they can't hammer out a settlement, they can
always go to arbitration.

   WASHINGTON -- The head of the Small Business
Administration's minority small-business program was removed
from her job effective immediately.
   Erlene Patrick, associate administrator for minority
small-business programs, was named to the post in August
1989. According to individuals close to the agency, she was
fired because the program, which has long been plagued by
controversy, hasn't improved under her leadership. The office
is responsible for helping minority-owned companies compete
for government contracts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   SBA officials denied that Ms. Patrick had been fired. A
spokesman said that she would be reassigned as acting deputy
regional administrator in Boston effective Jan. 2. Ms.
Patrick couldn't be reached for comment, and SBA officials
wouldn't elaborate on a terse statement announcing the new
assignment.
   The minority program has been under fire for alleged poor
service to participating companies and for operating under
unfair rules.
   Before joining the SBA, Ms. Patrick was a member of the
staff of the Senate Small Business Committee. She also was
the principal author of the Minority Business Opportunity
Reform Act of 1988, which set tough new rules for the
government's program for minority-owned contractors.
   In its statement, the SBA said Ms. Patrick was reassigned
to the office of finance effective immediately. Her deputy,
John Whitmore, will head the minority office until Jan. 2,
when Ike Washington, who now heads the minority programs in
the Atlanta region, will become the office's acting
administrator, an agency spokeswoman said.

   Holders Pushing Pennsylvania Concerns
   To Forsake the State's Takeover Shield

   Pennsylvania companies that accepted protection under the
state's controversial anti-takeover law are getting hit by a
barrage of challenges from disgruntled shareholders.
   Members of the United Shareholders of America, a
Washington, D.C.-based group backed by T. Boone Pickens, have
filed holder initiatives against Aluminum Co. of America, PPG
Industries Inc., and AMP Inc., and also will file a proposal
at Zurn Industries Inc. The initiatives direct the companies
to reincorporate elsewhere, or take other measures, to escape
the state takeover protection. In addition, the influential
California Public Employee Retirement System filed
resolutions directing Armstrong World Industries Inc. and
Scott Paper Co. to reincorporate in Delaware.

   These six companies are the largest Pennsylvania concerns
that accepted protection under the state law. Alcoa, Amp and
Scott confirmed they had received proposals. Armstrong and
PPG declined to comment. Zurn said it hadn't yet received a
proposal.
   Proponents believe they have widespread support for the
initiatives, which will appear on the ballot at the
companies' annual meetings this spring unless they are
withdrawn or are found to violate Security and Exchange
Commission guidelines.
   The companies are expected to oppose the resolutions, and
-- as with all such resolutions -- won't be formally bound by
them if passed. Still, the initiatives underscore the
hostility that many investors feel toward both the
anti-takeover act and the companies that accepted its
protection.
   "This law is the worst ever," asserts Ralph Whitworth,
United Shareholders president. "Pennsylvania's winning the
race to the bottom."
   The Pennsylvania law, which took effect April 27, is
considered by many investors to be among the nation's
toughest against takeovers. Shareholders claim it violates
their rights and hurts stock value. Of the 117 companies with
capitalization of over $10 million in Pennsylvania, 80 opted
out of protection under the new law.
   Under the law, Pennsylvania companies had until July 26 to
opt out of protection. The only way companies can opt out now
is to pressure the state to re-open the opt-out period, to
reincorporate in another state, or to merge with a shell
company that already had accepted the opt-out provision.
   United Shareholder member Howard Hodges, who owns 200
Alcoa shares and filed the Alcoa initiative, said his
proposal would give Alcoa two years to find a way to opt out
of the Pennsylvania law, or else reincorporate in another
state. Mr. Hodges said he resubmitted his proposal to soften
its critical language after meeting with Alcoa Chairman Paul
O'Neill, but refused to withdraw it. "The Pennsylvania
statute does violence to the shareholders' right to vote," he
said.
   In an apparent concession to shareholders, the Pittsburgh
aluminum concern quietly dropped a "poison pill" shareholder
rights plan after it accepted coverage under the
anti-takeover law. The plan limited a would-be buyer's voting
power. But Mr. Whitworth calls Alcoa's concession "empty
symbolism" since the state law provides similar protection.
   Investors have been particularly irked by one provision in
the law that amends the "fiduciary duty" standards so that
company directors needn't consider shareholder interests
dominant over employee, community, and creditor interests.
The law also provides a "disgorgement" provision, which
directs takeover bidders to return profits to the company
that they made by putting the company in play.

   Foreign Exchange:
   Dollar Climbs, Defying Bearish Drag
   Of Lower Rates as War Jitters Continue

   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose, defying the bearish drag of
lower U.S. interest rates. Helping the U.S. currency hold
firm was the reluctance to let go of dollars in a
war-threatened environment.
   Meanwhile, louder speculation about sinking rates in Japan
battered the yen across the board, even as expectations of
strict monetary policy in Germany kept the mark robust
against its European counterparts and the yen.

   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.4785 marks,
just above 1.4762 marks late Tuesday in New York. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 134.05 yen, up from
132.62 yen in New York late Tuesday. Sterling was trading at
$1.9305, down from $1.9430 late Tuesday.
   In midmorning trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was
quoted at 134.20 yen, up from 133.27 yen late Wednesday.
   Potentially setting the stage for a sharply lower dollar
was aggressive action by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which had
announced a cut in the discount rate to 6 1/2% from 7% late
Tuesday afternoon. The Fed followed this move with action in
the money markets yesterday, signaling a new federal funds
target rate of 7%, down from 7 1/4% previously. The discount
rate is the interest rate the Fed charges member banks for
loans; the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one
another for overnight loans.
   Federal funds had been trading at 7 1/16% when the Fed
entered the market, arranging $1.5 billion of customer
repurchase agreements. Analysts said this signaled a 1/4
percentage point reduction in the target rate; a round of
system repurchase agreements would have been interpreted as a
1/2 point relaxation.
   While the quick loosening of credit seems surprisingly
aggressive for the Fed, which until now has taken the slow
and steady approach, traders noted, the dollar was able to
take the moves in stride.
   After the initial decline late Tuesday, there was little
follow-through. Participants said that a 1/2 percentage point
cut in the discount rate had already been factored into
exchange rates. The lowering of the federal funds target rate
didn't budge currencies at all.
   "People expected the discount rate cut. The only surprise
was {the timing}," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at
Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
   The timing of the discount cut may have been aggressive,
said Marc Cohen, vice president at Fuji Bank in New York.
"But when you look at the {U.S.} economy . . . then you
think, maybe drastic times call for drastic measures," so
that softening of U.S. rates doesn't have to trigger a broad
dollar sell-off.
   Participants said that under different market conditions,
the dollar might have suffered more. But, in thin markets,
"with many banks already square for the year end, it's a
recipe for doing little or nothing," said David Jaques,
senior corporate trader at Barclays Bank in New York.
   Until the market has a better sense of which way the
Mideast situation will swing, it's imprudent to try
establishing any strategic long-term positions, Mr. Jaques
added.
   Among the developments keeping the markets on edge about
the Persian Gulf crisis were disparate reports about the U.S.
capability in the Mideast. Sen. Daniel Inouye, (D., Hawaii)
indicated that a war with Iraq would last no more than five
days, while one of the U.S.'s top military deputies said U.S.
troops wouldn't be ready to mount an offensive by the Jan. 15
United Nations' deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery jumped $9.50 to $386 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a moderate 3.5 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$382.20 an ounce.
