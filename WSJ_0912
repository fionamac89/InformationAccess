   Kansas G&amp;E Says
   It Is Negotiating
   To Be Acquired

   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co., still cool to an $857 million
hostile tender offer from Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co., said
it is negotiating to be acquired by a company it wouldn't
name.
   The embattled Kansas G&amp;E disclosed the talks in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also said it
would provide certain "non-public information" about itself
to Kansas City P&amp;L, giving that company a chance to revise
its $27-a-share offer. Kansas City P&amp;L has said its offer was
based on public information about Kansas G&amp;E and could
possibly be adjusted.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a letter to Kansas City P&amp;L President A. Drue Jennings,
Kansas G&amp;E Chairman Wilson K. Cadman offered the same
"information . . . provided by KG&amp;E to other third parties
who have expressed an interest in exploring certain
combinations with KG&amp;E or a purchase of KG&amp;E assets," subject
to confidentiality agreements. Mr. Cadman also informed Mr.
Jennings of the negotiations with the unidentified company
and added that, "moreover, the company may also enter into
negotiations with one or more other parties."
   A spokesman for Kansas G&amp;E wouldn't go beyond a company
statement about the filing.
   A spokesman for Kansas City Power &amp; Light said last night,
"It's an interesting development and we're anxious to talk to
them ourselves. We look forward to seeing the same
information that's being supplied to other parties."
   Kansas G&amp;E has spurned the Kansas City P&amp;L offer, calling
it inadequate and overly conditional and saying that it
"raises substantial and serious legal questions and numerous
uncertainties under state and federal statutes."
   But the $27-a-share offer still tops Kansas G&amp;E's recent
stock price. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Kansas G&amp;E closed yesterday at $24.50, down 37.5
cents. Kansas City P&amp;L rose 37.5 cents to $21.875 in Big
Board trading.
   Kansas City P&amp;L's offer, made in late July, is set to
expire Friday. As of Aug. 20, about 43% of Kansas G&amp;E's
common shares had been tendered.

   CS First Boston, With Its Global Mission
   Under Strain, Shifts Management Again
   ----
   By Michael Siconolfi and Craig Forman

</IN>
<LP>
   CS First Boston Inc.'s effort to create an integrated
global investment bank is showing signs of strain.
   In an internal memo, the parent of First Boston Corp., the
big U.S. securities firm, said it will strengthen the
management role of a group of senior executives to coordinate
CS First Boston's far-flung operations better.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The memo, signed by CS First Boston's chief executive
officer, John M. Hennessy, said an executive committee of the
firm's senior executives will "be more actively involved in
the overall management of the CS First Boston Group under my
direction. This should serve to tie the firm more closely
together."
   With much hoopla, First Boston and its European affiliate
merged in late 1988 to create New York-based CS First Boston,
billed as a privately owned, "truly global" investment bank
with closely linked units in New York, London and Tokyo.
   But the combination has been hobbled by a slowdown in
traditional securities businesses and continued tensions
between First Boston investment bankers in the U.S. and
Europe. CS First Boston earned only $11 million last year.
   The memo effectively puts the future of CS First Boston
more in the hands of its top executives -- even though Mr.
Hennessy will continue to have the final say.
   The directive marks the latest management shift at the big
investment bank. Just last week, CS First Boston named
Archibald Cox Jr. president and chief executive of First
Boston Corp., which is the biggest part of CS First Boston.
The step removed Mr. Hennessy from day-to-day control of the
U.S. securities unit.
   In an interview yesterday, Mr. Hennessy said the merger
will take time to gel. "It took almost four years before we
got our first ticket" after First Boston started seeking
merger advisory business in the late 1970s, he said.
"Building new products takes time. You have to be patient."
   The CS First Boston executive committee will meet at least
once a month, the memo said, and will function much as a
corporate board. Besides Mr. Hennessy, the group will include
the top executives at CS First Boston and its three
investment banking units: Mr. Cox, Anthony Grassi, James
Maher, William Mayer, Hans-Joerg Rudloff, William Voute and
Allen Wheat.
   But make no mistake. Mr. Hennessy said in the memo,
"Decisions will be made by consensus, but I will retain the
ultimate power of decision." Mr. Hennessy said in the
interview, "There are seven strong-willed guys around the
table . . . but I don't want people to get the idea this is a
debating society."
   In Zurich, Credit Suisse, the big Swiss bank whose parent
controls 44.5% of CS First Boston, also slightly reorganized
Credit Suisse's executive board to reflect the investment
banking changes.
   In the biggest change, Mr. Rudloff will step down from the
parent bank's executive board at year end to "concentrate" on
his present responsibilities as chairman and chief executive
of the London-based Financiere Credit Suisse First Boston,
the bank's European investment banking arm. Separately, he
joins CS First Boston's strengthened group executive
committee.
   Mr. Rudloff's responsibilities on the parent bank's
executive board, which included monitoring certain investment
banking activities, will be assumed by current executive
board member Hans-Ulrich Doerig. Meantime, a longtime Rudloff
associate, Credit Suisse First Boston's deputy chairman,
Oswald Gruebel, joins the Credit Suisse executive board.
   Mr. Rudloff said yesterday that the changes are consistent
with the Swiss bank's strategy to strengthen the management
resources involved in investment banking. "When you start a
management restructuring, you start at the top, and then from
there, other decisions flow," he said. "Many of us have had
to play dual roles" with respect to investment banking. "It
took time to sort it all out."
   But by leaving the Credit Suisse executive board, Mr.
Rudloff eliminates a source of possible friction with CS
First Boston colleagues. Though the Credit Suisse post had
taken up little of his time in recent months, Mr. Rudloff's
presence on the powerful executive board was viewed by some
as an indirect provocation to Mr. Hennessy, to whom Mr.
Rudloff has reported for some responsibilities.

   Krieger Returns
   To Trading Role
   In Currencies

SECURITIES (SCR)
</IN>
<LP>
   Andrew J. Krieger, one of the biggest and most
controversial traders in global currency markets, is back in
the saddle.
   The 34-year-old currency options trader, who made about
$300 million in pretax foreign exchange earnings for Bankers
Trust Co. in 1987, is starting a new investment unit at
Capital Holding Corp., an insurance holding company based in
Louisville, Ky.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His new job means that, for the first time in two years,
Mr. Krieger will manage enough money to be a major player
again in the $640 billion-a-day currency trading market, the
world's biggest. At Bankers Trust, and later at Soros
Management Co., a New York investment partnership, Mr.
Krieger was known for making trades so gigantic that
awestruck colleagues credited him with singlehandedly moving
currency exchange rates.
   The co-head of the new subsidiary, Capital Holding
Currency Advisors, is Jonathan M. Berg, a former Bankers
Trust managing director. Both Messrs. Krieger and Berg have
been named managing directors of the unit, which will be
based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
   The unit will trade mostly currency options for large
institutional clients, central banks and wealthy individuals,
as well as manage a small amount of Capital Holding's own
funds. An option gives its holder the right, but not the
obligation, to sell or purchase a security or, in this case,
currency at a specific price on or before a specific date.
   The new Capital Holding unit will offer investors three
basic products: an aggressive investment involving a high
degree of risk and potentially big rewards; a less-aggressive
trading strategy in which losses are limited to 11% to 15% a
year; and one in which investors are guaranteed the return of
their full initial investments at the end of a prescribed
period. Minimum investments will range from $100,000 to $5
million.
   Through Messrs. Krieger and Berg, who will be responsible
for the unit's marketing and sales, Capital Holding hopes to
increase its fee-based income, expand its expertise in
foreign markets, and diversify its portfolios, said Joseph M.
Tumbler, president of Capital Holding's accumulation and
investment group, which also manages Capital's portfolio.
   Last year, Capital Holding earned $219.7 million on
revenue of $2.5 billion. At year end, the company had about
$15 billion in assets.
   "When Jon {Berg} first told me we're going to Kentucky, I
said: `The horse races aren't for a while,'" Mr. Krieger
said. "When he said, `We're going to Capital Holding,' I
said, `What's Capital Holding?,' and Jon said: `Trust me.'"
The insurance company had been one of Mr. Berg's clients at
Bankers Trust.
   "Frankly," Mr. Krieger said, "they wanted to take a look
at me to see what kind of animal I was." Part of the process,
he said, included seating Mr. Krieger in a room "at the head
of a table with 13 people and grilling me for three hours on
everything from how I make trading decisions to how, when and
why I take profits and losses."
   Most traders and investors use currency options to hedge
an existing foreign-exchange position or to speculate on
currency movements with a small part of a large portfolio.
   By contrast, Mr. Krieger regards options as a separate
investment or asset category, and a conservative way to trade
currencies. Because currency option trading volume is heavy,
"The amount of money I can manage on a leveraged basis with
limited downside risk is very large," said Mr. Krieger, who
earned a reputation at Bankers Trust as a mover of markets
because of his large trades.
   The big risk in investing with options is that they will
expire before they can be exercised at a profit. In that
case, the investor loses all of the money initially paid to
purchase the option.
   But Mr. Krieger said that with his approach, "I don't have
to be right a whole lot, only about 25% to 30% of the time,
to yield substantial results." This is because options allow
an investor to bet on moves in large amounts of currencies
with relatively small premiums. A $100,000 investment in
options would normally control $30 million to $40 million of
foreign currency.
   He also said that during the course of a year, he
generally spends only 10% to 15% of all assets under
management to buy options. "So, even if I'm wrong on every
play, the downside is quite tolerable," Mr. Krieger said.
   Like his view of the options he trades, Mr. Krieger is
controversial. Unhappy with the $3 million, or 1%, bonus he
received for making the $300 million for Bankers Trust in
1987, he quit the following February. With a 5% bonus, which
is common for traders, Mr. Krieger would have netted $15
million. "I was very, very disappointed with the bonus on
principal, rather than the actual amount," he said. "It was
more money than I ever thought I'd need, but it wasn't fair."
He also needed a break from the intense world of trading, he
said.
   He later joined Soros but said he resigned after making
$45 million for the investment firm in 14 weeks. "My hours
were worse than they were at Bankers," he said. After a break
and travels to India, Mr. Krieger then set up his own firm;
its business will be transferred to the new Capital Holding
unit.
   He described the new unit as "a long-term venture; we have
a long-term commitment."
   Mr. Krieger's eclectic background includes a master's
degree and doctoral studies in Indian philosophy,
translations of Sanskrit texts, and a brief six-month career
as a professional tennis player. He always intended to make
his career in academia, but in the early 1980s, a combination
of marriage, a child and cutbacks in educational funding
forced him to reassess.
   "I was told by my adviser: `You're a great student, you
will be a great scholar, but you won't get a job until
someone dies in a plane crash,'" Mr. Krieger said. "Rather
than wishing someone's death, I decided to change fields."

   IBM Is Expected to Unveil PCs in October
   That Compete With Compaq File Servers

<LP>
   International Business Machines Corp. will soon introduce
several new file servers, specialized personal computers that
act as the hubs of computer networks, industry executives and
consultants said. The announcement, planned for next month,
will finally put IBM in direct competition with Compaq
Computer Corp. at the top end of the fast-growing file-server
market, to which Compaq laid claim last year with its highly
publicized Systempro computer. The IBM machines also will be
a credible alternative to servers sold by NetFrame Systems
Inc. and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the executives
said.
   But IBM's new models will apparently fall short of the
impressive "superserver" technology the company has been
demonstrating at trade shows. Instead, the executives said,
IBM will position the new Personal System/2 Model 95 as the
first in a line of high-powered servers that will culminate
next year in the "superserver."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   IBM already sells two models that act as file servers: the
entry-level Model 65 SX, based on Intel Corp.'s 80386SX
microprocessor; and the mid-level Model 80, based on Intel's
80386 chip. But the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant still hasn't
designed a machine around Intel's latest and most powerful
chip, the i486, and has shied away from a technology race at
the high end of the PC market, where file servers have
attracted the most attention.
   "IBM has been lax so far in addressing this market," said
John Dunkle of WorkGroup Technologies Inc., a Hampton, N.H.,
market research firm. "At this point, they need to make a
very successful introduction if they're going to convince
people that they're serious about playing."
   File servers, which store files and act as traffic cops
for computers on a network, have gained in importance as
networks become more powerful and take work away from larger
and more expensive systems. Compaq in particular has touted
networks using its i486-based Systempro as a possible
replacement for minicomputers and even mainframe computers.
   Still, the Systempro and other high-powered servers are
much more complicated to sell and set up than regular
personal computers, and have sold slowly since they emerged
last year. As a result, IBM isn't too far behind the curve.
"If they can come up with a competitive product, IBM will
still be considered by everyone," said Matt Fitzsimmons, a
ComputerLand Corp. dealer in Westchester County, N.Y.
   According to the industry executives and consultants,
IBM's new Model 95, several versions of which are still being
fieldtested, will be based on the i486 and will include
special technology to speed the movement of data in and out
of its hard disk drives.
   It also will offer high-capacity drives providing a total
of as many as 2.3 gigabytes of memory -- about 1.4 million
typewritten pages -- and can use IBM's new four-megabit
memory chip for its internal memory, they said.
   The new machine will be introduced along with a
number-crunching desktop companion, the Model 90, which also
will be based on the i486, the executives said.
   And both models will offer a new standard for displaying
graphics on computer screens. Dubbed XGA, for Extended
Graphics Array, it will be compatible with more previous
standards but will provide more color and detail -- enough to
handle video input comfortably, the executives said.
   An IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's
plans for a file server, but IBM executives have previously
indicated that they intend to provide a i486-based server
before the end of 1990.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, IBM
rose $1.625 to 107.50.
   Separately, IBM said it reduced prices and increased the
standard memory on its entry-level PS/2 Model 25 286 personal
computer.

   Salomon to Pay
   $83.8 Million
   On Oil Claims

   NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc. said it agreed in principle to
pay the Department of Energy $83.8 million to settle claims
stemming from an investigation of alleged violations of the
government's crude-oil price controls.
   Salomon said the settlement won't lead to a charge against
earnings. The parent of Salomon Brothers Inc. disputed many
of the department's claims but said it agreed to settle to
avoid years of litigation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The settlement is the latest from a string of claims made
by the Energy Department. For several years, the department
has been investigating the transactions of thousands of
companies suspected of violating the government's crude-oil
price controls, which were in effect during the sharp rise in
oil prices in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil embargo.
   The Reagan administration terminated the controls in 1981.
   In September 1988, the Energy Department started
administrative proceedings against Salomon, seeking payment
of as much as $108 million, plus interest. But Salomon said
the department's recent administrative proceedings "have
reduced significantly the company's maximum potential
exposure" under the government's allegations.
   The planned settlement would be one of the few jolts for
Salomon so far this year; both its securities business and
its Phibro Energy oil unit have been thriving, particularly
in the wake of the recent Iraqi attack against Kuwait and the
resulting wild swings in oil and stock prices.
   The settlement caps a four-year battle between Salomon and
the Energy Department. In 1987, a federal judge ordered
Salomon to turn over to the department virtually all its
documents relating to the company's purchases and sales of
crude oil from 1973 to 1980.
   The judge's order came despite complaints by Salomon about
the "voluminous" amount of data the department was seeking --
specified in 103 pages of subpoenas. The Energy Department
was looking into whether Salomon resold crude oil at an
appropriate price under the government's regulations when
they were in effect.
   In 1987, Salomon separately settled with the Energy
Department concerning crude-oil sales from 1973 to 1977 by
paying about $16.3 million, including interest.

   TransCanada PipeLines Shares Plunge
   On News of BCE Pact to Sell Big Stake

   Investors drove down the price of TransCanada PipeLines
Ltd. stock in heavy trading yesterday after BCE Inc.
announced late Monday a pact to sell its 48.8% stake to a
group of investment dealers for about 1.3 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.1 billion).
   TransCanada's shares closed at US$13.25, down US$1.125, on
relatively light volume in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, the stock closed at
C$15.375, down C$1.50, on volume of about 4.4 million shares,
making it by far the day's most actively traded issue there.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said the steep decline in the stock's price
reflects worries that the market will soon be flooded with
TransCanada shares as dealers resell their holdings to the
public after the transaction closes next month.
   "The market seems to be balking at the prospect of
TransCanada having a larger public float, and is perhaps
reading something into the timing of the sale," said Winfried
Fruehauf, an energy consultant and analyst with Toronto's
Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon Inc. "This isn't exactly an act of
faith by BCE" in the Calgary, Alberta, pipeline company, he
said.
   But a spokesman for TransCanada, the country's largest
natural gas pipeline operator, said the planned two-step sale
of BCE's 75 million TransCanada shares won't affect its
operations, or impede its C$2.57 billion expansion program.
   "About all it means is that we are losing a shareholder.
This will not impair our ability to raise capital" for the
previously proposed expansion of TransCanada's system in
1991-1992, he said, which is currently awaiting Canadian
regulatory approval.
   Canada's National Energy Board, the federal agency that
must approve TransCanada's bid to add almost 1,000 miles of
pipeline and 832 million cubic feet of natural gas
transportation capacity a day to its system, is expected by
November to decide whether to approve the company's toll rate
proposal. Approval would set the stage for the first part of
TransCanada's expansion to proceed, the company spokesman
said.
   Analysts appeared less certain that TransCanada will be
able to sell new equity to finance its expansion, without the
backing of its major shareholder. "They'll have to finance
their future offerings of primary equity from the market at
large, in a market already glutted with TransCanada paper,"
said James Doak, analyst with First Marathon Securities Ltd.
   While investors in TransCanada reacted with dismay,
holders of BCE, the Montreal-based parent of Bell Canada,
reacted with a yawn. In Big Board composite trading, BCE
shares closed at $30.875, up 12.5 cents.
   Montreal money manager Stephen Jarislowsky said his firm
recently sold most of its BCE stock and that the company's
decision to sell its TransCanada stake isn't enough to tempt
him back. Always leery of BCE's diversification over the past
few years, Mr. Jarislowsky said the new, slimmer BCE still
has to prove itself. "I feel a bit sorry for the incumbent
{management} because they have to clean up the mess," Mr.
Jarislowsky said.
   BCE is loathe to call the decision to exit the pipeline
business a reversal in strategy. BCE spokesman David Orr said
that when BCE decided to branch out in the 1980s its core
telephone business was seen as a mature industry. Now it's
anything but.
   Telecommunications "has changed rapidly, much more rapidly
than people thought," Mr. Orr said. "We {decided} we have to
focus on our core telecommunications businesses."
   BCE also wants to be ready to grab opportunities overseas,
Mr. Orr said, pointing to Australia's decision this week to
open up telecommunications services to competition as an
example of the changes in the industry. BCE has experience
overseas. It helped Saudi Arabia build its phone system and
is currently involved in a cellular venture in Mexico and
cable television in the U.K.
   After selling off its TransCanada stake BCE will be left
with its Bell Canada unit, a 53% stake in Northern Telecom
Ltd. and a recently acquired financial services unit,
Montreal Trustco Inc. Mr. Orr said BCE sees financial
services as a good fit with telecommunications.

   Inside Track:
   Warner-Lambert Insiders Trim Stakes
   In Rare Move; Sales Are Relatively Heavy

   NEW YORK -- Warner-Lambert Co. has been seized upon by
money managers as a stock sheltered from the effects of
recession. But some of the company's insiders are looking
elsewhere for shelter.
   Insider selling has historically been rare at the Morris
Plains, N.J., drug and consumer products company. This
summer, however, presidents of three of the company's
divisions have trimmed their holdings by $660,971 of stock,
according to insider filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Two of the sales occurred right around the time the stock
hit its 12-month high of $70.125 on Aug. 1. Did the insiders
believe the stock had peaked? They were out of the office
yesterday at the company's annual strategic-planning meeting
in Absecon, N.J., and couldn't be reached for comment.
   But Peter Wolf, a spokesman for the company, said, "The
(stock) market has got a lot of people making phone calls and
looking to diversify." Since the officers "still retain
significant holdings, (the selling) is not a display of lack
of confidence. The company's doing swell. "Warner-Lambert
stock hit its high last month on a prediction by Chairman
Joseph D. Williams that per-share earnings would be up more
than 16% this year. The same day, John F. Walsh, president of
the company's international operations, sold 2,011 shares for
$138,377. The shares represented 17% of his holdings.
   On Aug. 8, Robert Serenbetz, president of the company's
confectionary division, American Chicle, sold 4,466 shares
for $226,469, according to SEC filings. That sale represented
about one-third of his holdings.
   Those recent sales, along with a 4,600-share sale late
last June by Jay M. Gwynne, president of the company's Asia
and Australia Capsugell division, totaled more insider
selling than Warner-Lambert experienced in all of 1989 and
the first five months of this year combined, according to SEC
filings. Mr. Gwynne also sold about one-third of his
holdings.
   The three executives who sold shares got prices ranging
from $64.25 to $68.81 a share. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Warner-Lambert shares closed
below that level, at $63.125, up 25 cents.
   John Hoffman, associate director of research at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., which is recommending purchase of
the stock, said that although Warner-Lambert has declined in
the month, so have the prices of other drug and consumer
stocks. He said Smith Barney considers the stock "a
predictable grower which would weather a recession."
   ---
   A CHANGE OF CLOTHES: The stock of ClothesTime Inc., an
Anaheim, Calif., apparel retailer, has nosedived from a high
of $13.875 late last year to less than $3 lately.
   Meanwhile, the company's chairman, Michael DeAngelo, has
been on a selling spree. He has sold 600,000 shares since
July 23 -- almost 60% of his holdings in the company -- for
$2 to $3.75 apiece, SEC filings show.
   As previously reported, late last year, Mr. DeAngelo sold
763,467 shares, according to SEC filings. Some of those
shares fetched prices as high as $9.38, SEC filings show. Mr.
DeAngelo declined to comment on the insider sales.
   Elizabeth A. Armstrong, analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben
Inc., said that, for much of last year, the company
experienced double-digit gains in sales at its established
stores. But since about April, she said, there has been
"relatively small increases, or negative growth in sales."
   In over-the-counter trading, ClothesTime shares closed at
$2.375, down 18.75 cents.
   ---
   A STRIDENT BULL: Arnold Hiatt, chairman of Stride Rite
Corp., made the largest insider stock purchase reported to
the SEC last week.
   Mr. Hiatt spent $2.4 million on 98,000 shares of the
company, a purchase that increased his total holdings in the
Cambridge, Mass., shoe retailer by more than one-third, SEC
filings show. He declined to comment on his purchase.
   The chairman paid an average price of $24.30 a share. In
New York Stock Exchange trading, Stride Rite shares closed
yesterday at $23.75, up 50 cents.
   In the second quarter, ended June 1, Stride Rite had
record earnings of 60 cents a share, up from 49 cents a share
a year earlier.

   CHICAGO -- Soybean futures prices rose for a second
consecutive day on a report of record demand for soybean meal
coupled with diminishing world soybean production.
   Analysts said an article in a German publication, Oil
World, reported that world soybean meal consumption between
January and September reached an all-time high. Soybean meal
often is used as feed for poultry and cattle and is a
component of many foods produced for human consumption.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Purchases of soybean meal by the Soviet Union, generally a
big buyer, have been somewhat smaller than usual, so an
overall increase in world soybean meal use would be doubly
significant, analysts said. "Even without the Soviets,
consumption was up, so the market took that to be a very
encouraging sign," said Anne Frick, soybean analyst for
Prudential-Bache in New York.
   The effect of increased demand for soybean meal on futures
prices was heightened by diminishing world production of
soybeans, particularly by soybean growers Brazil and
Argentina. The market also reacted to a U.S. Agriculture
Department crop ratings report released late Monday that
traders said showed hot weather in the Mississippi Delta
growing region had hurt the developing soybean crop. "That
confirmed a general decline in yield prospects for the U.S.
crop," said Mario Balletto, soybean analyst for Merrill Lynch
in New York. One Chicago weather forecaster's Monday
prediction of possible frost in the northern Midwest this
weekend appeared to be isolated; no other forecasts mentioned
frost.
   Other factors influencing the market yesterday included
speculation on the contents of an Agriculture Department crop
production report due out after trading today. Most analysts
expect the department's soybean crop estimate for the 1990
growing season to be practically unchanged, perhaps down
slightly to about 1,835,000,000 bushels from last month's
figure of 1,836,000,000 bushels. Because of the past two
weeks' hot, dry weather in the South, traders will adjust the
department's crop figures downward. So it will be hard for
the report to exert anything but upward pressure on futures
prices, analysts said.
   Underlying the two days of price rallies in soybean
futures is persistent speculation that the U.S. may offer
credit to the Soviet Union for grain purchases from U.S.
farmers. However, analysts downplayed rumors that such a
package would be announced soon. "President Bush has other,
more pressing issues in front of him," one analyst said.
Though Middle East tensions didn't play a major role in
yesterday's soybean futures price increase, analysts said
events there will continue to support grain futures prices
generally as long as the region is in a crisis.
   The soybean futures contract for November delivery rose 6
1/2 cents a bushel yesterday to settle at $6.3875 a bushel.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices closed lower yesterday in
moderate trading marked by a late sell-off. "Aggressive
buying on expectations of military action {in the Persian
Gulf region} late yesterday and earlier today" pushed prices
higher, said John Hill, a broker at Merrill Lynch Futures
Inc. Technical factors provoked additional buying, but as the
price approached $32 a barrel, interest dissipated. October
light sweet crude finished trading at $30.76 a barrel, down
54 cents. Activity was fairly light, with traders showing
little conviction. The only piece of fresh news to affect
price levels yesterday came around midafternoon when the U.S.
Defense Department said Iraqi troops were observed moving
along that country's border near Syria and Turkey. While a
spokesman for the Defense Department said hostilities weren't
thought to be imminent along those borders, crude oil futures
popped to intraday highs. They later declined, however. And
prices are unlikely to get a boost from inventory statistics
released by the American Petroleum Institute late yesterday.
The figures showed that all oil stocks -- crude, gasoline and
heating oil -- increased last week.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were steady. The most actively
traded December contract ended with a gain of 0.25 cent a
pound at $1.2855. However, the soonest-to-expire September
delivery, which is reflecting concern over relatively small
supplies of copper available for delivery against a large
number of outstanding contracts, rose one cent a pound to
$1.3480. The stronger advance for September widened the
premium for that month over December by 0.75 cent to 6.25
cents. Strong speculative demand for futures contracts
developed in London. "It was well absorbed and had little
impact, price-wise, on the market. As a result, New York
failed to move much also," an analyst said. Negotiations
continued in the mine strike in Peru and speculation
continued that the dispute may be settled this week, analysts
said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed, with gold and
silver rising while platinum continued weak. December
delivery gold ended with a gain of $1.80 an ounce at $386.60.
December silver advanced two cents an ounce to $4.87. October
platinum dropped to a new life-of-contract low, $448.50, for
the second consecutive day, then partially recovered to
settle at $452.80, down $4.70. What support there was in gold
was mostly derived from a rally in crude oil from its lows
early in the session, according to one analyst. He noted that
gold was also helped when the dollar late in the day gave up
some of its gains. Platinum's industrial character is working
against it, especially with the slowing U.S. economy, the
analyst said. A great disappointment to traders, he said, was
that the Middle Eastern crisis has failed to touch off any
significant investor buying of platinum in Japan, where it is
the favorite precious metal.

   Chase Manhattan Forced to Sharply Boost Yield
   On $200 Million Subordinated Notes to 13.017%

   NEW YORK -- Uncertainty about the future of interest rates
and trepidations about the banking industry prompted
investors to demand unusually high yields from the nation's
second-largest banking concern.
   Chase Manhattan Corp., the parent of Chase Manhattan Bank,
was forced to reset the rate on $200 million of auction-rate
subordinated notes to yield 13.017%, up from the previous
rate of 9.66%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new yield was 4.92 percentage points higher than the
yield on two-year Treasury notes and just shy of the maximum
permissible spread of five percentage points above two-year
Treasurys.
   "Most people were pretty shocked" by the rate, said one
corporate bond trader who had expected the notes to be reset
at a spread of between 2.5 to three percentage points above
the two-year Treasury note. When the Chase notes were last
reset in 1988, they were priced to yield 1.05 percentage
points more than two-year Treasury notes.
   But times have clearly changed for the banking industry.
Spreads between yields on Treasurys and on securities issued
by financial corporations have been widening for months as
concerns about rising loan losses and fears of an economic
recession prompted credit rating agencies to downgrade
banking securities. That, in turn, prompted investors to dump
the securities, sending prices spiraling lower.
   Chase Manhattan has a credit rating that is on the
borderline of investment grade. If the bank's debt is
downgraded another notch, it would be rated on the same level
as a top-tier junk bond.
   In addition to concerns about the industry, analysts said
some investors demanded a premium because they are worried
that Chase may be unable to successfully reset the notes
again in 1992. However, syndicate officials said, investors
demanded premiums because they are concerned that Chase may
retire the debt in 1992.
   In any case, many analysts seem to feel that the rates
were priced at exaggerated levels which reflected investor
hysteria rather than market fundamenatals.
   "In a historical perspective, these spreads seem
ridiculous," said Jay Weintraub, a banking analysts at
Salomon Brothers Inc. The firm was a member of the syndicate
that managed the reset auction. "There is a lot of negative
psychology about the banking industry. But the fundamentals
are not nearly as bad as the psychology would tell you."
   Officials at Chase Manhattan said the high yields reflect
poor market conditions along with increasing competition for
limited funds with foreign banks which recently began
flooding the global bond market with subordinated debt.
   In July, Sumitomo Bank Ltd. issued a total of $1 billion
in subordinated debt in the U.S. and Europe. Last week, three
other Japanese banks, Fuji Bank Ltd., Nippon Credit Banks
Ltd. and Bank of Tokyo Ltd., issued a total of $1.8 billion
of subordinated debt in the Eurobond market. Some analysts
argue that the aggressive debt issuance of Japanese banks,
which have strong credit ratings, may crowd banks with lesser
ratings out of the market.
   Last month, underwriters at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. were
forced to pull a $100 million issue of Continental Bank
10-year subordinated capital notes due to poor market
conditions.
   Although Chase could have called its $200 million issue of
subordinated auction rate notes, corporate bond traders said
that since it is so difficult for banks to raise subordinated
debt financing today, that wasn't a viable option.
   In a sign of how difficult the commercial paper market has
become, Citicorp yesterday said it would discontinue its
weekly $100-million commercial paper auction after next
Tuesday's sale.
   A bank spokesman said Citicorp intends to continue selling
commercial paper through direct placement, which he said
offers the bank more flexibility in setting maturities.
Commercial paper accounts for less than 1% of Citicorp's
overall funding.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury securities inched higher in choppy, aimless
trading as investors gave up hopes for lower interest rates
but saw a glimmer of hope for a quick deficit-reduction plan
late in the day.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 98 2/32, up
nearly 3/8 points from 97 23/32 on Monday. The issue's yield,
which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to
8.92% from 8.96% on Monday. Two year notes ended at 100 5/32,
up 2/32 to yield 8.02%.
   The recent disappointment that a bipartisan deal to trim
the government's budget shortfalls had not been forthcoming
weighed heavily on fixed-income investors. But prices rose
late in the session following reports that Congressional
negotiators were trying to finalize a broad budget outline in
time for President Bush's address to Congress yesterday
night.
   But sapping investor interest for much of the day was the
spreading perception that the Federal Reserve is not prepared
to change its monetary policy despite clear signs of economic
weakening. As recently as Monday, the anticipation of an
imminent Fed easing was boosting shorter-term securities,
which are particularly sensitive to any change in Fed policy.
   Short-term rates ended little changed. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills was slightly lower at 7.40% for
a bond equivalent yield of 7.63% while the rate on six-month
bills was unchanged at 7.34% to yield 7.71%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   The Resolution Trust Corp.'s sale of $70 million of
high-yield bonds depressed prices of some junk bonds but
barely bristled the broader market.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended about 1/8
point lower.
   The junk bonds of GNS Finance Corp. lost even more. GNS's
12% guaranteed notes sold on behalf of Golden Nugget, was
reportedly among the names on the RTC's bid lists Tuesday.
The notes fell 1 1/2 points to end at 89.
   Some analysts said the GNS bonds also were adversely
affected by efforts on the part of underwriters at Salomon
Brothers Inc. to market a new $100 million Golden Nugget junk
bond issue.
   Among the issues reportedly on the RTC's bid list were
bonds from Eastern Airlines, Penn Traffic Co., Telemundo
Group Inc., and GACC Holding Co.
   The RTC is expected to sell another $40 million in junk
bonds, posssibly as early as today. Market sources said among
the names included on the new bid list are Coltec Industries,
Century Communications Co. and American Cablesystems.
   Meanwhile, the Australian government announced that it
would repurchase about $515 million of its outstanding Yankee
bonds, which are bonds issued in the U.S. market by foreign
issuers.
   Syndicate officials at Salomon Brothers, which is managing
the tender offer, said the buy-back will be the biggest
tender ever in the Yankee market and one of the few ever
fixed-spread tender offers.
   Rather than offer a fixed price for the bonds, Australia
will pay investors a fixedspread over Treasurys. Australia
has been repaying its debt aggressively since 1987.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were unchanged to 1/8 point higher.
   Trading was light as investors focused on more than $753
million of new issues priced during yesterday's session.
   In one of the largest deals, a PaineWebber Inc. group
tentatively priced $278 million Connecticut single-family
housing mortgage finance program bonds to yield from 6.1% in
1991 to 7.7% in 2022.
   An $81.2 million issue of Charlotte, N.C., general
obligation bonds was won by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
group. About $8.8 million of the issue, which was priced to
yield from 5.8% in 1991 to 6.6% in 1999, remained unsold late
yesterday.
   Among active issues, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
bonds due in 2018 were unchanged at 97 7/8 to yield 7.37%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities prices rose as much as 1/8 point.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue
for September delivery gained 1/8 point to 98 27/32. Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9 1/2% issues for September delivery each rose
2/32 to 98 11/32 and 98 29/32, respectively.
   In the asset-backed market, a $425 million issue
securitized with J.C. Penney credit-card receivables sold
out, according to First Boston Corp. The certificates,
offered through special J.C. Penney Master Credit Card Trust
Series D, carried a coupon rate of 8.70% and were priced at
99 23/32 to yield 8.97%.
   The securities are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   In Japan, bond prices continued to fall on speculation
that the long-term prime rate will be raised again soon.
   The long-term prime rate, which is set monthly by Japan's
long-term credit banks, was increased by .60 percentage point
to 8.5% at the end of last month. The long-term credit banks
try to keep the prime rate at .90 percentage point above the
coupon rate on five-year debentures issued monthly by the
banks.
   The rate on the debentures in September was 7.6%, but the
yield is now at 7.96%. As a result, dealers said the coupon
on October debenture issues is certain to increase, which
would also push up the longterm prime rate.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the No. 119
10-year bond was quoted at a price of 82.07, down 0.35 point,
to yield 8.345%. (When calculated using the semi-annual
compound method, the yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.64%,
according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   Most West German bonds ended modestly lower. British
government bonds, called gilts, ended moderately higher.
Dealers said that investors have been buying mostly
longer-term gilts because they feel more confident about the
government's anti-inflation measures.

   Preston Sturges: The Director Close Up

   Things hadn't been going well for film director Preston
Sturges, for years, when the publisher Henry Holt
commissioned his autobiography in 1959. Mr. Sturges, an
exuberant eccentric, dictated "The Events Leading Up to My
Death" just as he had dictated the quickstep film scripts
that made him famous in the '40s, fast and formless.
   The publishers reacted the way almost everyone seemed to
react to Sturges at the end: with a rejection slip. He died
not long after that.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sandy Sturges, his fourth and last wife, stored the 300
typed pages in the UCLA archives, to keep them safe for her
sons and for future biographers (two Sturges biographies have
been published; a third is due next year.) Then, at the
suggestion of an editor at Simon &amp; Schuster, Mrs. Sturges
expanded the original material with letters and journals and
has become, 30 years after his death, her husband's
collaborator on his autobiography, now retitled "Preston
Sturges by Preston Sturges" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 352 pages,
$22.95).
   The most striking thing about this energetic and witty
memoir is how little it has to do with Hollywood, the place
that made Sturges an enormous success and a failure in a very
short period of time. There's almost nothing about his
legendary battles with the studio bosses, his fights for
control and how he lost the fights and the control.
Two-thirds into the book Sturges had lived almost everywhere
but California, and hadn't written or directed anything,
though he had invented a way to print directly onto curved
porcelain makeup jars, had gotten married and had briefly
found success as a cosmetics manufacturer.
   Yet by not talking very much about his work, and talking a
great deal about his life, this smart, bouncy book really
gets at the heart of Preston Sturges's films. This is so,
because the Sturges trademark -- slapstick antics and nutty
characters who are very American yet also bizarre fringe
creatures -- turn out to have been lifted directly or
indirectly from his own peculiarly adventuresome upbringing.
   His early life was so chaotic and so packed with events
and characters that it's impossible to encapsulate. It's
enough to know that his mother married five times, shuttled
between the U.S. and Europe as though one were a suburb of
the other, sought all manner of artistic and spiritual gurus
and started her own cosmetics company long before most
affluent women were independent enough to dress themselves.
She was Isadora Duncan's best friend; the scarf that choked
the dancer to death was a gift from Preston's mother.
   So dilettantism came naturally to her son, and he
practiced it in a feverish way. He was a songwriter, an
inventor, a playwright, a restaurateur, a sailor, a country
gentleman -- before and after he became a screenwriter and
director. His films skipped ingeniously all over the place,
but usually had somebody in them pulling some kind of scam or
other, and often in a place populated by the rich, or the
poor trying to get rich.
   They are about smart, pretty women who use what they've
got to get more ("The Lady Eve," "The Palm Beach Story"), and
men trying to do the same though they're not always as sure
about what "more" is ("Sullivan's Travels," "The Great
McGinty"). The Sturges pictures, which are the subject of a
retrospective at New York's Film Forum for the next six
weeks, have a style and pace that hasn't been matched yet.
Though it's easy to find the roots of many Sturges films in
the autobiography, Mrs. Sturges said in a recent interview
that she deliberately avoided too much of that kind of
cross-reference ("It's boring, boring if you haven't seen the
films," she said).
   She was 30 years younger than her husband, and you can
still see in her the high-spirited mixture of theatricality,
smarts and giddy enthusiasm that must have drawn him to her.
She lives in a comfortably airy apartment off Sunset
Boulevard with its fair share of Preston Sturges memorabilia
(a model of his yacht, "The Destiny," for example).
   Yet she doesn't insult her late husband by conferring
sainthood on him, or by pretending that he was fascinating
all of the time. "He would tell anecdotes like the kind that
were in the book because they'd get a good laugh, and you'd
hear them quite a lot," she said. "Like the one about his
father not being his father was a heartbreaker the first time
-- and less so 50 times later."
   Very little of the original autobiography has remained
intact exactly as it was, though most of it is somewhere in
this expanded revision. For example, said Mrs. Sturges, "He'd
start off talking about his forebears and then skipped to
when he went to Chicago and then went off on 50 pages of
anecdotes about Chicago. Then he'd say, `Then I was a month
old,' and that would lead back to his mother and that would
lead to Isadora."
   She'd take a sentence about Chicago, then find another
sentence, sometimes 50 pages later, that would follow in a
logical way. "There are not two paragraphs that run the way
they did. The two paragraphs were there, there was just a lot
of other stuff in between," she said.
   Mrs. Sturges isn't a writer by profession -- she does
estate planning at a Los Angeles law firm -- yet she has
managed to rearticulate "Preston Sturges by Preston Sturges"
in a fast, light style that sounds remarkably the way you'd
expect Preston Sturges to sound.
   For instance, there's the description of his induction
into the movie business, just after having had some success
on Broadway with a hit play called "Strictly Dishonorable."
"In Hollywood I started at the bottom: a bum by the name of
Sturgeon who had once written a hit called `Strictly
Something-or-Other.' . . . My wife had decamped, my fortune
was depleted, and even though I was living on coffee and
moonlight, my costs of living continued to cost."
   His life was difficult as well as exotic -- he was eight
before he knew the man he thought was his father wasn't --
and he doesn't gloss over the sorrowful times. He takes
death, divorce and poverty as seriously as they should be
taken, but always with the sense that something else is about
to happen that will move things along.
   "He never felt as if he'd been impaled," said Mrs.
Sturges. "I don't mean he didn't have the Irish depression
and that's a black one. But if you're as open as he was to
things, anything was there to lighten his heart."

   Souter Critics Are Armed With Hard Questions,
   But Apparently No Bombshells, on Eve of Hearing

   WASHINGTON -- For seven weeks, liberal interest groups
have been amassing ammunition against President Bush's choice
for the Supreme Court, Judge David Souter. Now those groups
are about to unleash their assault -- and will be firing
mostly blanks.
   With the Senate Judiciary Committee set to begin its
confirmation hearing tomorrow, there is little organized
opposition thus far to the 50-year-old Judge Souter. After
poring over briefs he filed as New Hampshire attorney general
from 1976 to 1978, studying his actions as a state trial
judge from 1978 to 1983, and analyzing his 221 opinions as a
New Hampshire Supreme Court justice from 1983 to 1990,
several groups have voiced concerns about his receptivity to
claims of civil rights and liberties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But no one has apparently come up with the incendiary
statement or ruling that could be used to mobilize forces
against the judge as was the case in Robert Bork's ill-fated
nomination during the Reagan administration. As a result,
Judge Souter seems likely to be confirmed for the seat
vacated by retired Justice William Brennan.
   Before he can be confirmed, though, Judge Souter must
steer his way through two or three days of detailed
questioning, primarily by Democratic committee members
struggling for insight into how the little-known nominee
views the Constitution and the court's role.
   It is in his responses to this interrogation that liberal
groups hope to garner additional ammunition to stave off what
they fear will be a decidedly more conservative turn if Judge
Souter joins the court. Their best hope is that the former
Rhodes scholar and Harvard Law School graduate will commit a
major blunder in his testimony tomorrow or Friday, giving
them the weekend to begin to try to mobilize opposition. That
is a faint hope, as what little is known of Judge Souter is
that he is calm, cautious and thoughtful, not given to strong
or impulsive statements.
   The process is in marked contrast to the 1987 nomination
of Judge Bork, when the nominee's own words and written
record provided the ammunition for a heated political
campaign to defeat him, albeit one that Mr. Bork's supporters
still say was distorted.
   Liberal groups also press a subtle argument that the
burden is on Judge Souter to convince the committee that he
is qualified, rather than on his doubters to prove that he is
unqualified.
   "David Souter must assure the Senate and the public that
he has an open mind, is forward-looking, and has a vision of
the Constitution which respects individual rights," says Nan
Aron, director of the Alliance for Justice, a coalition of
liberal groups. "If he fails to meet this burden, the Senate
should withhold its consent," she says.
   Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, expresses a similar sentiment. "All the
evidence weighs against him; there is no evidence on the
other side. The question should be is there enough evidence
to confirm him."
   What these groups want from Judge Souter are assurances:
that he recognizes a right to privacy implicit in the
Constitution, that he isn't a zealous adherent to the narrow
text of the Constitution, as they argue that one of his state
court opinions indicates.
   In the delicate dance of Supreme Court confirmations, such
assurances are elusive, even when the nominees are
forthcoming. Questions are often posed by senators in terms
of abstract legal concepts, rather than specific cases, to
avoid forcing nominees to commit to views on which they might
later have to rule. But the more abstract the questions, the
more wiggle room there is for the nominee in answering, as
well as in following his own course of action once he is
confirmed.
   Conservative groups have received Judge Souter's
nomination favorably, in part because they have been assured
by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, a conservative
former New Hampshire governor, and others that Judge Souter
has little sympathy for the liberal path followed by the
Supreme Court in the 1960s and 1970s. A report by the
conservative Coalitions for America says Judge Souter's
record "paints a consistent picture of a conservative jurist
passionately devoted to the rule of law."
   One strike against the argument of liberal groups that he
must persuade the Senate that he is qualified was the recent
vote of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on
the Federal Judiciary. The 15-member committee unanimously
gave Judge Souter its highest rating of "well qualified."
   A few liberal groups, having already decided that Judge
Souter isn't likely to provide the assurances they want, have
decided to oppose the nomination. The most prominent of these
is the National Organization for Women.
   Other groups continue to raise questions. "On civil
rights, abortion rights, equal protection of the law and
separation of church and state, Souter's record raises
troubling questions," says Arthur Kropp, president of People
For the American Way Action Fund, a civil-liberties group.
   Democratic senators, including the Judiciary Committee
chairman, Joseph Biden of Delaware, and Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts, have spent the past few weeks boning up for
the hearing and are expected to engage in tough questioning.
   In a speech yesterday, Sen. Biden said that with the
possible exception of Justice Sandra O'Connor's nomination in
1981, "David Souter has the slightest record on
constitutional law" of any nominee in 25 years. The senator
said he wouldn't seek "assurances" of Judge Souter's views.
But he said precedents of past hearings "suggest that there
is nothing wrong in putting to Judge Souter some rather
specific questions about constitutional issues -- including
religion, speech, civil rights and abortion -- and expecting
some rather specific answers."
   Some Republican senators may also have tough questions,
from a different direction. Aides to some Republicans say the
senators want to be certain that Judge Souter doesn't feel
too locked in to old liberal court precedents and that he
feels free to reconsider those that he believes are based on
shaky foundations.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Industrials End Off 2.97 as Stocks
   React to Movements in Oil Prices

   NEW YORK -- Stocks fell slightly as nervous investors kept
watch on oil prices, which remained above $30 a barrel, and a
rout in several technology issues.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.97 to 2612.62.
Stocks bounced around in an inverse relation to oil prices
throughout the day. Crude oil for October delivery rose above
$31, but closed down 54 cents to $30.76.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among the broader indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index dropped 0.59 to 321.04, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 0.31 to 176.39 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index lost 0.41 to 297.73. Declining issues topped
advancers by 835 to 609 on the Big Board.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to
113,220,000, the lightest since September 4 when 92,940,000
shares traded. Volume Monday totaled 119,730,000 shares.
   "The light trading volume of the past week shows there is
a tremendous lack of enthusiasm and uncertainty" among
investors, said Edward Shopkorn, general partner at Mabon,
Nugent &amp; Co. He said investors have three specific fears: a
war in the Mideast, which could result in an explosive rise
in oil prices and sharply falling stocks; a lack of progress
on trimming the budget deficit; and limited interest rate
reductions, if any, from the Federal Reserve.
   Meanwhile, investors received a reminder that earnings
growth is still a driving factor in the stock market: Tandem
Computers, which shocked investors with disappointing
third-quarter results in July, said it might not meet
fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Tandem's stock fell 2
1/8, or 15.6%, on 2.8 million shares, making it the most
active issue and the day's biggest loser on the Big Board in
percentage terms.
   Compaq Computer, which lowered resale prices by up to 20%
on more than a dozen desktop personal-computer models, fell 2
to 43 1/4 on 1.3 million shares. Other technology stocks that
came under pressure included Digital Equipment, which went
down 1 3/8 to 63 5/8; Cray Research, down 1 1/8 to 34 3/8;
Unisys, down 3/8 to 8 3/8; and Motorola, down 1 3/8 to 59 7/8
on 1.1 million shares.
   But Texas Instruments soared 3 1/2 to 29 1/8 as U.S.
market players learned of a report in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a
Japanese newspaper, that the company would seek $1.5 billion
in annual royalties under a Japanese patent for a basic
computer chip, known as a dynamic random access memory. The
company declined immediate comment on the report.
   International Business Machines, which lowered prices on
some of its Personal System/2 computers by 5% to 8%, also
managed to avoid being caught in the technology sector's
retreat. IBM rose 1 5/8 to 107 1/2 on 1.4 million shares.
   "IBM and Texas Instruments are up on stories; it is a
market of stocks right now," said Thomas Gallagher, managing
director in charge of institutional equity trading at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "In the old days, when Compaq, Digital and
Tandem broke it would have put a lot of selling pressure" on
all technology shares.
   Another possible reason for IBM's upturn may be that after
a sixth-place finish in 1989, the company appears ready to
seize the crown as this year's most profitable company in
terms of total earnings.
   IBM is estimated to have total after-tax net income of
$5.78 billion, or $10.10 a share, this year, making it the
most profitable company in a universe of 3,700 companies
tracked by the Institutional Brokers Estimate System, a
division of Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan.
   Last year's winner was Exxon, which earned $4.75 billion,
or $3.66 a share; this year Exxon is expected to earn $4.78
billion, or $3.83 a share.
   Institutional Brokers says earnings estimates for the full
year show the following ranking of the top ten earners:
General Electric (3); Royal Dutch Petroleum (4); Philip
Morris (5); American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (6); General
Motors (7); Ford (8); Du Pont (9); and Chevron (10).
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber dropped 5/8 to 20 3/8. Moody's
Investors Service put the company's credit ratings under
review for a possible downgrade, citing concerns about the
company's profit outlook and other factors.
   Circuit City Stores dropped 1 3/8 to 15 3/4 on 1.2 million
shares. Salomon Brothers lowered its earnings estimate for
the fiscal year ending in February by 10 cents a share, to
$1.90, and for the following year by 20 cents a share, to
$2.20. However, Analyst Jack D. Seibald told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report that he continues to believe the
stock will outperform the market.
   Ralston Purina jumped 3 1/4 to 96 3/8. Analysts at several
brokerage houses raised their earnings projections after the
company said its sales volume and profit margins have
improved in key businesses. Also, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette raised the stock's investment rating from
"moderately attractive" to "very attractive."
   Georgia-Pacific fell 1 3/8 to 36 7/8 and traded as low as
36 1/2, a 52-week low, after Morgan Stanley downgraded the
stock to "sell" from "hold" and lowered its estimate for 1991
earnings to $3 a share from $3.70. The changes were made
after Morgan Stanley revised its U.S. economic forecast to a
"recession alert" from "slow growth," which led to downward
revisions in the firm's price forecasts for several grades of
paper, such as linerboard.
   Collins Foods International added 1/2 to 17 3/4 following
news of its plans to sell its Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurants to PepsiCo, the fast-food chain's parent, for
stock and to exchange its own shares for the 34% stake in
Sizzler Restaurants International it doesn't already own.
PepsiCo went up 1/4 to 25 1/8 on 1.5 million shares, while
Sizzler dipped 1/4 to 16 1/2 on the over-the-counter market.
   Bally Manufacturing rose 3/8 to 7 3/4 on a report that
investor Arthur Goldberg has accumulated nearly $15 million,
or 6%, of the company's common stock and plans to take an
active role, with the support of management, in strengthening
its operations.
   TransCanada PipeLines slipped 1 1/8 to 13 1/4 after BCE
agreed to sell its 48.8% stake in the company to a group of
Canadian investment firms for about 1.3 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.1 billion). BCE, whose holdings will be resold
to the public, added 1/8 to 30 7/8.
   Fluor, which reported that net income for the fiscal
quarter ended in July rose 18% from a year ago, went up 1 to
37. The latest results were on the high end of expectations.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.20
to 323.01. Volume totaled only 9,120,000 shares.

   For six days now, the budget summiteers have been
sequestered in a converted bar at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington. For all of their economic relevance, it
might as well be the weird bar in the movie "Star Wars."
   Certainly the creatures in that movie are no stranger than
the summit menagerie in its glass cocoon at Andrews. Bounty
hunter Robert Byrd of West Virginia has his laser gun ready
to shoot anything remotely like a spending cut, much less a
budget-process reform. Republican Pete Domenici, the
intergalactic all-star trader from New Mexico, wants a higher
tax on energy even as he proposes "incentives" for oil
drilling. He'd get a political commission on both]
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Playing the role of tax Wookie, Georgia liberal Wyche
Fowler growls whenever anyone says "capital gains." And who's
that tending bar? Why, it's budget director Dick Darman,
trying to get everyone so sloshed on elaborate concoctions
that they'll forget he gave up the President's no-tax pledge
for nothing. Luke Taxpayer doesn't have a chance with this
crowd.
   When it comes to economic substance, the summiteers do
seem from a faraway land. The economy is lumbering and
perhaps stalled. Unemployment jumped last month to 5.6%, and
job growth has virtually stopped. The dollar is sinking and
long bonds are close to 9%, so the Federal Reserve has little
flexibility to ease. Oil prices have climbed past $30 a
barrel, slamming the economy with a new multibillion-dollar
tax.
   The summiteers seem oblivious to such real-world concerns.
Iraq? The lessons of the 1980s? They don't mean a thing. What
matters above all else is government "revenues." So the
Democrats opened their bidding with "$206 billion" in new
taxes over five years. Working stiffs would pay more for
beer, wine and gasoline. (The economic logic seems to be that
if a crisis raises the price of something, tax it to raise
the price even more.) The "rich," who in the end turn out to
be the middle class, would see their top income tax rate
climb to 35%, pay more for "luxuries" (like cars), and have
their income cap raised for the payroll tax.
   Republicans don't want to be demagogued, so they're
proposing their own luxury tax. They'd also stick it to
Northeastern states with heavy tax burdens -- and Democratic
governors -- by reducing the deduction for state income
taxes. Somehow all of this is supposed to help the economy.
   Ah, but what about "spending cuts" and "growth
incentives"? We've seen this movie before too. The opening
Democratic offer actually proposed a net increase in
non-defense spending over five years of some $40 billion.
Each side is offering a multitude of new tax breaks, the
better to buy political influence. Who knows, before this is
through we might yet see the return of George McGovern's
$1,000 tax rebate.
   We count it as a hint of progress that the White House has
decided to re-propose a cut in the capital gains rate to 15%.
Mr. Darman is finally lending an ear to Newt Gingrich, the
House GOP whip and the only budget summiteer who's actually
uttered the words "economic growth." No wonder everyone else
wants to keep him quiet in the cocoon, too.
   Mr. Darman's plan for sequestration is that everyone
sweats it out until they agree, and then everyone shares the
political camouflage for November. But things aren't going so
smoothly, perhaps because the summiteers are so divorced from
the normal pressures of democracy. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday, "We haven't seen the kind of
candor we hoped to see." Nonetheless, Mr. Darman was letting
the summiteers out on work release last night to listen to
President Bush speak to Congress.
   While they're out, maybe the summiteers will pick up signs
of rank-and-file discontent. There are even hints that
Senator Pat Moynihan might link his Social Security payroll
tax cut with Senator Bob Kasten's capital gains cut. On the
Senate floor Monday, Mississippi Republican Trent Lott caught
the prevailing winds. In his state, he said, "The people
understand that there is too much spending going on up here,
too much positioning, and tax increases are paid by real
people out in the real world."
   Mr. Lott said he won't vote for any tax increase, and
added that maybe it's time for George Bush "to go over the
heads of the Congress to the American people and sock it to
the Congress for not being serious." Or maybe next time Mr.
Darman should sequester the entire Congress?

   Warehouse had said earlier it expected proceeds of about

repayment of debt on the properties and certain other related
expenses. The company said in August that it planned to use
the proceeds for working capital.
   Warehouse also said it will take a $1.8 million charge in

   Bill to Boost Level

   WASHINGTON -- The House approved a measure to improve the
professional standards of the huge Pentagon work force
responsible for buying and developing more than $100 billion
in defense equipment every year.
   The provision would create a career-oriented "acquisition
corps" in each of the service branches and establish higher
standards in education and experience for the managers of
major weapons programs. No Pentagon aide can step into that
kind of job, for instance, unless he or she has first
attended a Pentagon management-training course and has had
eight years of experience in defense acquisition, according
to the proposed rules.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The measure, which was tacked on as an amendment to the
House defense authorization bill for fiscal 1991, passed by a
413-1 vote.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D., Mass.), the principal sponsor
of the amendment, said it would affect as many as 240,000
Pentagon civilians and uniformed personnel engaged in various
aspects of defense procurement.
   The Mavroules proposal would convert the Pentagon's system
of revolving officers in and out of procurement jobs with one
that more closely resembles Britain's "procurement executive"
or France's delegate general for armaments. The amendment
also directs the Pentagon to create a Defense Acquisition
University to further the training of these corps.
   The House approved by voice vote an amendment that would
help the Pentagon and other federal agencies attract and
retain qualified professionals. The amendment, proposed by
Rep. Benjamin Gilman (R., N.Y.), would allow these agencies
to reimburse employees in critical jobs for the cost of
earning academic degrees and repay their student loans in
exchange for a commitment to do government work for a
specific period of time.
   The House also voted 230-188 to block a move by New York
Democrats to designate Staten Island's Navy base for
immediate closure.

   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency proposed

   The regulations, which would be phased in for new models
between 1993 and 1995, are estimated to add $19 to $31 to the
average price of a new vehicle. Over the life of the vehicle,
however, owners would realize net savings of $1 to $12,
because of improved fuel economy resulting from more-complete
combustion, the agency said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposal would require auto makers to meet carbon
monoxide standards for tailpipe emissions at temperatures as
low as 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Currently, controls apply only
as low as 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The EPA said carbon monoxide
concentrations increase significantly at colder temperatures.
   Vehicle tailpipes spew carbon monoxide as a result of
incomplete fuel combustion. Emissions are particularly high
during the first few minutes after an engine is started, when
it needs extra fuel.
   Carbon monoxide, when inhaled, weakens the amount of blood
pumped to various parts of the body and causes a reduction of
oxygen available to muscles and organs. Cigarette smokers and
people with heart disease are especially at risk. Carbon
monoxide emissions exceed federal limits in 41 urban areas.
   Some proposals pending before the House-Senate conference
committee that is considering clean-air legislation would go
beyond the agency proposal in regulating carbon monoxide
releases. The EPA said it is studying whether further
regulation is warranted.
   The new standards would establish a limit of 10 grams a
mile for passenger cars, 12 grams a mile for trucks weighing
as much as 3,750 pounds and 15 grams a mile for trucks up to
8,500 pounds. Manufacturers that make fewer than 10,000
trucks a year and trucks weighing more than 6,000 pounds
would be exempt from the rule until the 1995 model year.
   To meet the new standards, auto makers will have to
improve the engine calibration in most vehicles. Some models
may need multipoint fuel injection for more-precise fuel
control or air injection to provide additional oxygen to the
catalytic converter during starts in cold weather, the agency
said.
   The proposed rules will be published in the Federal
Register soon. In addition, the agency will conduct a public
hearing on the proposal 45 days after publication of the
rules.
   Auto makers said they've been working with the EPA on
standards for carbon monoxide emissions and expected a
proposal requiring tighter standards at colder temperatures.
However, they declined to comment further until they've had
time to review details of the proposal.

   WASHINGTON -- The administration stepped up its attack on
proposed textile legislation that is expected to pass the
House next week.
   The bill, which would apply quotas to additional items and
make existing protections permanent, could torpedo current
trade negotiations and cost the U.S. as much as $30 billion
in trade retaliation, a senior official said here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Seattle, meanwhile, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills told a Council for International Trade meeting, "This
bill would cause tremendous economic harm." She said the
proposed legislation also could "severely jeopardize our
chances of success in the Uruguay Round," the current talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's
trade treaty organization.
   One major reason the administration is accelerating its
campaign against the legislation is that, in the view of many
officials, the textile industry may already have enough
support in Congress to override a presidential veto if the
bill is passed.
   The industry says it needs the protection from foreign
competition. But the administration estimates that U.S.
textile exports grew 27% in 1989, capacity utilization at
U.S. mills is high, and unemployment in textile-producing
states is generally below the national average.

   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti luxury
division, which stumbled in its first months on the U.S.
market, said it's now on track to sell 40,000 cars in the
1991 model year, which begins Oct. 1, up from about 17,000
cars in the current period.
   A key to Infiniti's plans is the new G20 luxury sedan,
which goes on sale this fall at a starting price of $17,500,
division officials said at a product preview here yesterday.
At that price, the G20, powered by a four-cylinder,
140-horsepower engine, is less expensive than many of its
European competitors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To enhance the image of its flagship Q45 sedan, Infiniti
said it will offer an optional $4,000 "active suspension"
system, one of the first of its type offered in the U.S. The
system uses computer-controlled, hydraulic pumps that drive
the wheels down into the road to counteract the jolts from
bumps. Infiniti raised the 1991 model-year base price of the
Q45 by 2.6%, or $1,000, to $39,000.
   Infiniti officials conceded that the brand got off to a
slower-than-expected start in the U.S., and suffered from
comparisons with Toyota Motor Corp.'s more successful Lexus
division. Lexus has sold 40,146 cars as of the end of August,
compared with 13,303 for Infiniti.
   William R. Bruce, Infiniti's vice president and general
manager, said the division stuck too long with its initial
arty ad campaign. Moreover, the division took longer to
establish its dealer network than expected.
   Still, Mr. Bruce said the division expects sales to rise
to 80,000-90,000 cars a year within five years.

   Microsoft, IBM
   Differ Yet Again
   About Software

   Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.
are again at odds over how best to market OS/2, the
underlying software both companies say is central to the
personal computer's future.
   The differences are wide, but most observers think they
are unlikely to force a complete breach between the two
companies, which together defined the basic features of the
PC during the 1980s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   IBM and Microsoft have been fighting for years over how
best to develop and promote OS/2, which controls the basic
functions of a PC. Introduced by the two companies in 1987,
OS/2 initially was described as an eventual replacement for
DOS, the operating software made by Microsoft for IBM's
original PC. More than three years later, OS/2 is considered
a flop, requiring expensive hardware and failing to meet
technical promises made for it.
   Meanwhile, customers remain as loyal to DOS as ever.
That's partly because Microsoft greatly contributed to DOS's
longevity by releasing a program in May called Windows 3.0
that allows DOS to match some of OS/2's most compelling
features. Analysts expect Microsoft to sell about two million
copies of Windows this year, while sales of OS/2 are
estimated to be a fraction of that.
   Last November, Microsoft and IBM called a truce to the
wrangling over OS/2, but it hasn't held. "The accord is still
officially in place, but it's clear that IBM and Microsoft
aren't exactly of one mind with regards to OS/2," said Will
Zachmann, a computer analyst in Duxbury, Mass. "Microsoft is
pushing Windows, and IBM is saying, `No, no, OS/2 is just
fine.'"
   Under the November deal, the two companies agreed to
release a revamped version of OS/2 that requires less than
half of the internal computer memory of the full-blown OS/2.
According to a spokeswoman, IBM is widely showing this "lite"
version of OS/2 to customers and is considering introducing
it shortly.
   "It's our intention to bring it out as a product, but we
haven't said when," said the IBM spokeswoman.
   For its part, Microsoft is having second thoughts about
the product and has been leading a quiet campaign to
disparage it. In a series of meetings recently, Steve
Ballmer, who oversees Microsoft's operating systems business,
has said that the memory requirements for OS/2 can only be
slightly reduced without abandoning some of the program's
most impressive features. He said it makes more sense for
Microsoft to continue working to fulfill the intitial
technical promises for OS/2, which would give OS/2 clear
advantages over Windows in such areas as speed, multitasking
and networking. Observers think Microsoft can deliver this
so-called 32-bit version of OS/2 by early next year.
   Industry observers say it's likely OS/2 "lite" and the
32-bit OS/2 will coexist. They say IBM is attracted to OS/2
"lite" because it would satisfy many of its biggest
customers, large corporations that have designed OS/2 into
companywide computing systems and now need an improved
version. But they fear that in reality IBM seeks to slow
sales of Windows, because if it becomes too popular, it
threatens to kill off OS/2 altogether.
   "OS/2 `lite' is much better than any existing version of
OS/2," said George Grayson, president of Micrografx Inc., a
software company in Richardson, Texas. "The problem is that
IBM insists on doing it as an alternative to Windows,"
setting up a situation where IBM is trying to reduce Windows'
appeal.
   The renewed dispute over OS/2 comes at a time when IBM is
broadening its reliance on Microsoft's rivals. Recently, Big
Blue has struck several new alliances with software makers,
such as Go Corp. and Next Inc., and some say these new
relationships could grow in importance and even jeopardize
Microsoft's status as IBM's most important software supplier.
   Indeed, IBM announced what appears to be its most
significant new software partnership only last week, when it
said it plans to develop a set of software guidelines with
Metaphor Computer Systems Inc., a closely held company in
Mountain View, Calif. The partnership aims to relieve some of
the confusion among developers of PC applications such as
spreadsheets and word processors over which operating system
-- OS/2 or ones sold by rivals -- they should work on.
   By adopting the partnership's guidelines, developers
"wouldn't have to worry much about making an operating-system
bet," said David Liddle, Metaphor's chairman. "Once they've
done an application {to the guidelines}, it works with lots
of operating systems."
   Mr. Liddle stressed that the partnership's work, which may
take several years to come to market, is "not a replacement
for OS/2." But analysts said it marks a shift in the
relationship between IBM, Armonk, N.Y., and Microsoft,
Redmond, Wash.
   "That's the statement from IBM, which they can't make
publicly, that they are declaring independence from
Microsoft," said Stewart Alsop, editor of PC Letter. Mr.
Alsop said that should the partnership succeed, IBM "will
have driven a wedge" between it and Microsoft, "regaining
control over applications" for PCs.
   But no one expects IBM's reliance on Microsoft to lessen
overnight. "The relationship between IBM and Microsoft has
been very beneficial to our customers, and it's too important
to both companies to have it not continue to be a good
relationship," said Jim Cannavino, the general manager of
IBM's PC business.
   Indeed, the long-term ambitions of Microsoft and IBM
dovetail nicely. Big Blue needs a robust OS/2 in order to
fulfill its desire to tie PCs together with its disparate
families of mainframe and minicomputers. In coming years,
customers are expected to demand operating software that
allows them to perform many tasks at once. Some of these
tasks are likely to be performed automatically. OS/2, and not
the combination of DOS and Windows, is designed for precisely
such work.
   Microsoft, meanwhile, needs OS/2 in order to retain its
control of software standards for PCs. In an interview
earlier this year, Mr. Ballmer said a successful OS/2 should
block the spread to PCs of Unix, another operating system now
used mainly by minicomputers and workstations.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues dropped 476.24 points,
or 1.9%, to 24604.66. The index soared 1118.83 points Monday.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index recaptured 87.92
points to close the morning session at 24692.58.
   Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 400
million shares, up from 336.6 million shares Monday. Losers
outnumbered winners 609 to 322, while 137 issues were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section dropped 22.58 points, or 1.19%, to 1880.70.
   The second section index fell 8.84 points, or 0.24%, to
3603.40. Volume was estimated at six million shares, up from
4.8 million shares Monday.
   A technical downward correction was seen as a natural
follow-up to Monday's advance. The Nikkei dropped about 250
points on profit-taking at the morning opening.
   Stocks also followed the weaker bond market, traders said.
   Bearishness stemming from a higher interest rate
environment kept investors from buying into the market,
traders said. Some speculative issues were the only targets
of buying, which came in small-lot spurts and was mostly by
dealers.
   The Japanese government bond market was weaker partly on
unfounded rumors lingering from Monday that Iraqi troops were
headed toward Jordan, but also because of the continued rise
in money market rates, traders said.
   The overnight unsecured call money rate was up 1/32 on the
day at 7 26/32% before settling at 7 22/32%. The yield on
December Euroyen interest rate futures closed at 8.75%, up
from 8.69% Monday.
   In response, the yield on the benchmark, the No. 119, 4.8%
coupon due 1999 was at 8.345%, up 8.5 basis points, at the
close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A basis point
is 1/100th of a percentage point.
   With short-term and long-term interest rates looking to
remain at high levels, funds will continue to be pulled from
stocks, traders said.
   In addition to interest-rate concerns, the market is seen
as remaining unsteady for the remainder of the month. Trading
ahead of Thursday, which is the expiration day for September
futures and options contracts, will likely reflect
manipulation by futures traders in preparation for the
special price fixing Friday.
   Moreover, institutions have little time left before fiscal
book-closings at the end of the month; window-dressing is
expected to heighten volatility.
   Investors must also deal this month with margin calls for
purchases made six months ago.
   On a day-to-day basis, therefore, only short-term plays,
particularly speculative or incentive-backed shares, are
being targeted.
   Minebea rose 100 yen to 1080 yen (72 cents to $7.75).
Kurabo jumped 70 yen to 1870 yen.
   Pharmaceutical shares were largely higher, with Ono
Pharmaceutical up 100 yen to 4500 yen and Mochida up 70 yen
to 3100 yen.
   Higher-quality issues were sold off for profits derived
from gains Monday.
   Sony fell 140 yen to 7040 yen, Hitachi fell 30 yen to 1280
yen, and Kyocera dropped 230 yen to 7120 yen.
   Nippon Light Metal slipped 30 yen to 1260 yen.
   Construction shares, which benefited Monday from the
market's jump, fell sharply. Nippon Hodo fell 110 yen to 2680
yen, Maeda Construction dropped 50 yen to 1570 yen, and
Kajima fell 40 yen to 1360 yen.
   London's fall reflected the lower U.S. market. Traders
said the American market was knocked down by a Government
Accounting Office report that several U.S. banks were likely
to fail in the next year.
   Volume picked up as a result of overnight positioning and
two-way business generated from program trading. However the
market was still "hopelessly dull" according to one trader,
and stifled by uncertainty over the Middle East and the U.S.
economy.
   Speculation ahead of U.K. companies' midyear results was
generating some business, traders said, as institutions
bought stock on expectations of dividend gains.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index was
down 2.7 points at 2144.3. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
fell 4.1 points to 1651. Volume was 338.8 million shares, up
from Monday's 296.4 million shares.
   Fisons PLC, a pharmaceutical and horticultural products
concern, recorded a 35% gain in pretax profit following
first-time contributions from V.G. Instruments, a scientific
equipment maker. The shares gained 3 pence to 350 pence (5.6
cents to $6.48).
   Paper, filters and plastics concern Bunzl PLC reported a
26% fall in pretax profit resulting from declining sales of
manufactured goods in key overseas markets. Bunzl climbed 9
pence to 69 pence despite the midyear results.
   Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Co. recorded a 22% fall in
pretax profit as residential and commercial property
development interests depressed earnings. Traders said that
the 8% rise in the midyear dividend payment helped the share
price rise 9 pence to 504 pence.
   Positive expectations for Rolls-Royce's midyear results
due Thursday boosted the stock 5 pence to 193 pence.
   Enterprise Oil dropped 13 pence to 669 pence on market
rumors that Elf Acquitaine might try to place a stake in the
company again. British Petroleum climbed 2 pence to 369 pence
and Shell was unchanged at 495 pence.
   Meanwhile, shares closed higher in Milan, lower in Paris,
Madrid, Frankfurt and Stockholm and mixed in Zurich and
Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Taipei, Manila, Singapore and
Wellington, mixed in Hong Kong and Seoul, and little changed
in Sydney.

   Equifax Inc. said it and Telecredit Inc. set special
meetings of shareholders for Nov. 7 to vote on Equifax's
acquisition of Telecredit in a stock swap currently valued at
about $489 million.
   Equifax, an information-services concern in Atlanta, said
shareholders of record of the two companies as of Sept. 21
will be entitled to vote at the respective meetings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The definitive agreement calls for Telecredit shareholders
to receive 2.69 shares of Equifax common for each share held.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Equifax
closed at $16.375 a share, down from $19.50 a share when the
deal was announced June 21. The exchange will bring the price
for Telecredit to $44.05 a share. However, Equifax has the
option, but not the obligation, of increasing the exchange
ratio to bring it to a $50-a-share value. Telecredit, a check
authorizer and credit processor based in Los Angeles,
conversely can terminate the transaction if the deal doesn't
fetch a bottom price of $50 a share.
   Both companies said that proxy materials will be sent to
holders about Sept. 21.

   New York's Mayor David Dinkins last month formed a
committee to advise him on New York City's competitiveness in
financial services. Friday, the committee produced the
following statement on the stock transfer tax, one of the
proposals being considered by the president and Congress in
this week's budget negotiations:
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   Recent discussions of the federal budget deficit have
raised the possibility of a securities transfer excise tax of
between 15 and 50 basis points, or 0.15% and 0.5%. STET would
tax all sales of marketable securities (including stocks,
bonds and commercial paper) other than Treasuries. Reaction
to this proposal has been overwhelmingly negative. Several
studies demonstrate the adverse impact STET would have on the
U.S. economy and, in particular, on New York. We agree with
the emerging consensus that STET would seriously, and perhaps
irreversibly, damage the competitive viability of the U.S.
securities markets and its financial institutions. STET would
also have the short-term effect of further depressing the
U.S. stock market, which has already fallen by 10% since
mid-July.
   To help foster public understanding as to why STET would
cause severe, self-inflicted injury to our financial markets,
impairing their global competitiveness, we address the most
important issues raised in regard to STET.
                                                                                                       

   How can a tax of of less than half a percent erode the
competitive position of the U.S. securities industry?
   The tax only appears to be insignificant. Total
transaction costs typically paid by institutions such as
pension funds and insurance companies (which are responsible
for 70% of trading) are only four or five basis points. Thus,
at 15 basis points, STET would triple transaction costs for
institutions.
                                                                                                       

   Aren't securities transfer taxes prevalent in most major
overseas markets?
   They used to be. Many countries -- Germany, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom -- that have had such
taxes are in the process of either reducing, repealing or
phasing them out.
                                                                                                       

   Would STET drive securities trading overseas?
   The answer is yes; the real issue is not whether but to
what extent. There is good reason to believe the losses would
be very substantial. One consequence would be to reduce
anticipated revenues from STET. A more enduring consequence
would be to weaken our financial markets.
   The securities business is characterized by high
efficiency, low margins and intense competition. Thus, a
tripling of transaction costs is not likely to be merely a
speck of "sand in the gears" of securities trading. By
analogy, the historical disparity in transfer tax rates
between France and the U.K. is thought to be responsible for
the fact that London trading in French securities is 20% of
the trading volume on the entire Paris Bourse.
   The revolution in information and communication technology
has shrunk the global marketplace, making capital mobility in
the 1990's higher than at any other time in history. Trading
in New York is easily shifted to London or Tokyo with
virtually no increase in costs. Trading links among exchanges
actually facilitate the migration of securities transactions.
   Foreign investors, who today account for about 12% of the
trading volume in the U.S. equity market, would be likely to
move their trading activities to more cost-competitive
markets. STET would accelerate the recent (and already
dramatic) growth in the number of U.S. stocks listed abroad.
Given problems of enforcement, U.S. investors in foreign
securities, including American Depositary Receipts, and even
in U.S. securities, may be expected to move offshore to less
expensive markets.
   In order to deter avoidance, STET is expected to apply to
trades by Americans on foreign exchanges. There is a
widespread view, however, that effective enforcement of
foreign trading would be extremely difficult and expensive.
   The commercial paper market, one of the few securities
markets in which the U.S. remains pre-eminent, would be
particularly susceptible to offshore migration, due to the
short maturity of commercial paper, which increases the
relative impact of STET on returns, and the high sensitivity
of this market to transaction costs.
   Trading in futures on securities, which are settled only
in cash, can easily be moved offshore. The mobility of this
market became evident on Oct. 20, 1987, when price limits on
the Chicago Board of Trade Treasury bond contract were
reached. The trading immediately moved to a similar contract
in London, where the usual volume increased that day by a
factor of eight.
   The history of the Eurobond market provides another
example of how domestic tax policy can have the unintended
effect of moving a securities market offshore. In 1963, the
U.S., as part of a balance of payments policy, levied a 1%
interest equalization tax on foreign borrowing to induce
foreigners to borrow in currencies other than the dollar.
That tax rapidly drove dollar-denominated borrowing overseas,
where it could not be taxed by the U.S., giving rise to the
Eurobond market, which thrived even after the tax was
rescinded and which continues to draw a large volume of
business away from U.S. markets.
                                                                                                       

   Would STET reduce stock market volatility?
   Some economists have argued that STET would reduce
volatility in the stock market. However, throwing "sand in
the gears" would only assure less liquidity. Many believe
STET would increase, rather than decrease, volatility.
Transaction taxes did not prevent the Tokyo and London stock
markets from crashing in 1987. STET's restraint on trading
volume would cause information to be reflected in prices in
large doses, providing a more discontinuous (jerky) market
with larger price swings.
   Studies by the Brady Commission, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, the
Congressional Research Service and the Federal Reserve Board
have all concluded that volatility is not materially greater
today than it has been in the past. Both in its certainty of
result and its severity of consequence, the harm to liquidity
would far outweigh the speculative effects on volatility.
   While applauding the efforts now under way to cut the
deficit, we deplore the STET proposal, because the long-term
damage it would cause to the competitive viability of our
securities markets and financial institutions would greatly
exceed all the tax revenues it could produce.

   Canandaigua Faces
   Pressure to Drop
   High-Alcohol Wine

   Groups Claim Consumers
   May Mistake Cisco Brand
   For Regular Wine Cooler

   Two consumer groups are seeking to pressure Canandaigua
Wine Co. to discontinue sales of its Cisco brand wine, a
high-alcohol-content product frequently sold beside
less-potent wine coolers.
   Though it isn't labelled as a wine cooler, Cisco is
available in a variety of fruity flavors, which the
Washington-based consumer groups say may lead buyers to
confuse it with such beverages. But Cisco has an
alcohol-content level of 20%, higher than many so-called
"fortified" wines and much higher than wine coolers, whose
alcohol content averages 4% to 5%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two groups, the National Council on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence and the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, said they investigated the sale of the product in
black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Washington, where Cisco
has come to be known on the street as "liquid crack." The
groups said they will announce details today for a "national
grass roots" campaign to force the company to halt sales of
the product.
   Canandaigua denied the consumer groups' charges. "We have
no indication nor evidence in the marketplace that this wine
is being mistaken for a wine cooler," said Marvin Sands,
chairman of the Canandaigua, N.Y., wine producer.
   Fortified wines, which are made with cheap ingredients and
bolstered with alcohol, have long been associated with the
shadowy market of low-income alcoholics and indigents. But
the lobbying groups claim that the Cisco point-of-purchase
materials and the product's packaging may trick ordinary
consumers who may be looking for a simple wine cooler.
   Cisco is pitched in point-of-purchase displays as a brand
that "Takes You by Surprise]" Cisco is sold in two sizes of
bottles with twist caps similar to traditional wine-cooler
packaging.
   "We want to tell consumers what kind of product this
really is and to warn them so there aren't more people who
inadvertently consume it to the detriment of their health,"
said Christine Lubinski, director of public policy at the
NCADD.
   "We believe that these allegations are purely hypothetical
and theoretical," said Mr. Sands of Canandaigua, which bought
the Cisco brand from a small Western winery two years ago. He
said, for example, that consumers couldn't be confused
because Cisco costs 50% more than wine coolers and is sold
only in single bottles, not in packs of four like most wine
coolers. What's more, he said, the product isn't advertised
on TV or radio like the other wine coolers.
   But officials of the lobbying groups say the complaints
they've received and their own scouting of Washington-area
convenience stores suggests Cisco is often priced only
slightly higher than wine coolers. And it's not uncommon,
they said, to find single bottles of wine coolers in the
refrigerated "carry-out" section of some neighborhood stores.

   BOSTON -- Criminals, crooks, thugs of all varieties.
Beware.
   Law-enforcement agencies in Boston have hooked up their
version of the Batphone. If you see wrongdoing, day or night,
call 1-800-SOS-FRAUD.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Is the city about to have a crime wave?
   Absolutely. But, up here, they call it public works.
   Boston, a city with a glorious past of public corruption,
is on the brink of its two largest-ever public-works
projects: the $6 billion cleanup of Boston Harbor and the $5
billion construction of an underground central-artery roadway
and a tunnel to the airport.
   Though the harbor cleanup is just under way, and the
central-artery construction has yet to begin, a task force of
nine law-enforcement agencies, ranging from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service, has assembled a first-strike capability to ferret
out corruption -- as soon as it begins.
   "Over the next 10 years, $11 billion will be spent on
these two giant projects -- an amount of cash that will
invite a measure of theft, fraud and corruption," says
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ralph Gants, who is heading the task
force. "We see the task force and hot line as prudent
foresight."
   Yesterday, the task force held a news conference to show
off hot-line posters to be hung at job sites and to announce
an advertising campaign to trumpet 1-800-SOS-FRAUD in
newspapers, magazines, radio and television.
   Mr. Gants, who believes this is the first hot line to
detect -- and, it is hoped, deter -- fraudulent activity,
acknowledges that the media campaign is bound to ruffle
feathers.
   On that, there's some agreement.
   "Once they take care of the S&amp;L scandal, they can worry
about some construction worker stealing a two-by-four," says
Mark Erlich of the Massachusetts Building Trades Council, who
is especially miffed that the hot-line ad features a photo of
a construction worker. "Better they should show a contractor
in a blue suit or some sleazy developer."
   Meanwhile, operators are on duty. Mr. Gants says agencies
in the task force will rotate covering the phones. Postal
inspector John Burns reports two calls yesterday after radio
stations publicized the number. "Real calls," he says
gleefully, "both possible leads."

   Confidence and Europe's Money

   A single European currency has much to recommend it, but
the European Community obviously still lacks the political
unity necessary for its creation. That was evident in Rome
this past weekend, as Britain sidetracked the express train
known as European Monetary Union. This probably is best seen
as a case of the ideal having to yield to the merely
possible. The underlying problem, of course, is the
widespread doubt over who would actually control the EMU.
   Germany's Karl Otto Poehl, director of the Bundesbank,
helped the U.K., Spain and some smaller nations at the Rome
meeting put a spoke in the wheel of the plan promoted by the
European Community's president, Jacques Delors. Early this
year, Mr. Poehl had said, in effect, that so far as he is
concerned a European central bank, and common currency, are
fine, providing that such a bank would run monetary policy as
well as does the Bundesbank.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The value of money -- any money -- is based on confidence.
The Bundesbank, through careful and apolitical management of
the deutsche mark, has generated such confidence. Other major
currencies have fared less well. Confidence in the dollar
isn't everything it should be and that no doubt can be
attributed, among other things, to a world-wide perception
that Congress and the Treasury have created a major fiasco in
the U.S. Savings and Loan industry.
   France went into the Rome meeting full of hope for support
of a move into stage two of the Delors plan. There were
expectations that stage two's transfer of monetary authority
to a European entity from national central banks could begin
on Jan. 1, 1993. A single currency might be achieved five
years later, it was believed. But after this weekend's Rome
meeting there now are doubts that such a goal could be
reached before the year 2000, if then.
   One of the merits of a plan that has been proposed by
British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major is that it
recognizes the importance of public confidence. It would
create a 13th currency, called the "hard ECU," which would be
available for public use and could be spent or used to settle
debts in any EC country.
   Its creation theoretically would not inflate the total
European money supply, since national currencies would be
exchanged for it. There would be an attempt to keep it sound
and attractive. If that succeeded, the combination of public
confidence and convenience gradually would increase the use
of the ECU, and decrease the use of national currencies.
   Mr. Poehl, even as he supports the slower evolution
inherent in the Major plan, apparently isn't keen about the
13th-currency idea. As the proprietor of Europe's leading
central bank, he obviously feels the need to be convinced of
the idea's soundness before putting his weight behind it.
   So the level of confidence in the Major plan is not yet
high enough to guarantee implementation. Yet it is not
impossible that it could gain support in the months ahead, as
EC governments prepare for a December meeting to work out a
draft treaty on monetary union. Adoption of something along
the lines of the Major plan, particularly if it would bring
Britain into the EMU fold, wouldn't necessarily be the worst
solution in the world.

   Poles Exhibit a New Knack for Selling

   Bargain Prices, Capitalist
   Verve Bring an Export Boom

   WARSAW -- If you don't own a Polish vacuum cleaner yet,
Adam Parys thinks you ought to check out the Zelmer Compact
Type 800.
   Mr. Parys heads Zelmer Mechanized Household Equipment
Works, Poland's biggest -- and only -- vacuum cleaner maker.
In the thick of his first capitalist recession, he got up off
his central plan and stuck his foot in the door of the
Western world.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With special recesses for accessory storage, ergonomic
hose handle and foot-operated cord winder, the Compact 800
tops the Zelmer line. Mr. Parys awards it Poland's highest
accolade: "It's average," he says. "It's no different from
any vacuum cleaner made in France or England or Japan."
   A well-fed man in a gray suit, Mr. Parys has come to
Warsaw from the Zelmer plant in Rzeszow for a meeting in his
export agent's office. "You want to buy and I want to sell,"
he says. "So not only is it a good vacuum cleaner, it's also
cheap."
   "Not cheap," his trade director interrupts. "Inexpensive."
   Maybe it isn't the slickest pitch of all time, but it
sells. Zelmer's exports westward have jumped 20% this year,
and the company has company. Having predicted a hard-currency
trade deficit of $800 million for 1990, Poles now gawk in
amazement at a surplus that is $2.5 billion and rising. The
zloty is strong. The $1 billion set aside for emergencies by
the International Monetary Fund sits untouched.
   An honest exchange rate has made anything Polish a bargain
for foreigners this year, and anything foreign more costly to
Poles. But that isn't the whole story. As Poland leaps toward
capitalism, some managers, including communist warhorses such
as Mr. Parys, have had character transplants. With their
guaranteed home market killed by an austerity-borne
recession, they have turned into salesmen.
   Exports are up in shoes, fabric, furniture, lighting,
machinery, leather, berries, mushrooms and chickens. "You
can't say Poland is an exporting power," Marek Gucik, an
export promoter at the foreign trade ministry, says. "But
enterprises that never sold in the West before are finding
buyers there."
   But they will have to find a lot more. Just as Poland and
the other newly free nations of Europe have opened their
sample cases on capitalism's front porch, their old customers
in the Soviet Union have kicked them onto the sidewalk. The
Soviets' trade bloc, Comecon, is washed up. Without it, this
year's unexpected surplus may be doomed to become next year's
unavoidable deficit.
   The Cold War's end has its advantages, too. Hungary owes
its good trading luck to a tide of Western tourists. Zelmer's
arch rival, East Germany, is vanishing from the map -- and
from world-wide vacuum cleaner competition, as well. Another
Polish company recently changed its name to "North," for ease
of Western pronunciation, and won a contract to make uniforms
for West Germany's navy.
   East Germany's disappearance, however, also will eliminate
its former bloc partners' second-biggest market. Their
biggest, the Soviet Union, is going broke. Moscow's reneging
on oil deliveries is more of a shock to its former empire
than this summer's rising oil prices.
   Iraq owes Poland 750,000 tons of oil as part payment for
$500 million in Polish military hardware. The Poles won't get
paid for all their goods, and will have to buy the oil
elsewhere, for a total short-term loss of about $300 million.
But the Soviets owe them much more: 12.7 million tons, 85% of
Poland's annual oil need, priced not in dollars but in
Comecon's cheap, ruble-based funny money.
   Their oil industry a wreck, the Soviets have cut their
shipments in half, teaching Poland and the rest of the old
bloc that political freedom hasn't come close to ending
economic dependence. To choke off demand, the Czechoslovaks
have raised fuel prices 50%. In late August, the Poles raised
theirs 30%.
   Poland's other recession-pummeled Soviet imports have
crashed, too, producing another trade surplus, this one in
the East. But a surfeit of funny money is useless to Poland's
economic remodelers, even though it accounts for half the
country's trade. So they have arbitrarily halved the exchange
rate, tromping down the value of the rubles brought home by
the numerous Polish companies with wares that have rarely
found buyers outside the Soviet Union.
   One of these is Bumar-Warynski, maker of the K-406A1
hydraulic excavator with externally toothed, tapered roller
slew bearing. This item -- and its sludger bucket, ripper and
stone grapple -- is built with much clanging and drilling in
a dingy shed on the edge of Warsaw. In a dingy office block
next door, Jozef Kowalczyk is in a bad mood.
   "Our problem is profitability," Mr. Kowalczyk, the acting
director, says. (The director resigned.) "We're down 30%," he
says. "But our problems will become acute on Jan. 1." On that
day, Comecon will burn its funny money and start trading for
dollars. Having forbidden this for 40 years, the Soviets are
itching for it. The old bloc, having dreamed of it, is
terrified.
   "Enterprises in the Soviet Union don't know how they will
get dollars from the state," Mr. Kowalczyk says. "They don't
know how much they will have. In the Soviet Union, everything
is needed, but they won't have the money to buy. Our trade
volume must drop."
   Prices, too. Appraised honestly in dollars, Mr.
Kowalczyk's sludger buckets won't buy nearly as much Soviet
oil as they used to. Neither will the 10 million tons of coal
Poland sends the Soviets each year. Add an oil price increase
to their 1991 energy bill, and the Poles could come up short
by as much as $2.5 billion.
   So much for 1990's surplus. Much as they cling to the
distant hope of a rich Soviet market, many an eastward
exporter could go bust by next year. Dozens of high-cost coal
mines are sure to fail. With less coal and fewer excavators
to pay for Soviet oil, Poles will be under pressure to earn
dollars by pushing products in the West. This is where the
vacuum cleaner salesmen come in.
   "I have 17 people writing letters, sending samples,
mailing catalogs -- to everywhere," Andrzej Guk, head export
agent for the Zelmer vacuum cleaner, says. "We're looking for
big contracts."
   Tall and suave, Mr. Guk worked in Raleigh, N.C., from 1981
to 1987 at a company that dealt in one of Poland's top
exports to the U.S., electric golf carts. Mr. Guk himself
sold sewing machines. His greatest success was breaking into
the 1988 J.C. Penney catalog.
   Now Mr. Guk is back in Warsaw at Universal Co., a state
trading company and the first in Poland to try selling shares
to the public. In an office under renovation, redolent of new
paint and furniture, he is pumping up the Zelmer account.
   He woos the French and the Italians away from the East
Germans, buttonholes anybody who buys from Yugoslavia or
South Korea, dangles discounts before Portugal and Brazil.
Rare among Polish companies, Zelmer has invested in a new
electric-engine plant to give it enough vacuum cleaner volume
to assault the U.S.
   "It's not easy to get to J.C. Penney direct from the
street," Mr. Guk says, but he figures the sewing machine coup
gives him an opening. True, Americans favor upright vacuum
cleaners over compacts. On the other hand, to help destroy
communism, the U.S. did away with the duty on Polish
appliances. So the price is right.
   Mr. Guk has a man in Rutherford, N.J., working on it. If
Penney won't bite, he'll be knocking on Wal-Mart's door next.

   We persist in believing that the folks in Washington who
are turning themselves into pretzels to raise taxes are truly
out of touch with the public mood around the country. We
recently encountered an intriguing piece of evidence to
support this view. New Jersey's electorate is in an uproar
over the new taxes proposed by Gov. Jim Florio, who used to
be one of Congress's most ardent liberals and spenders.
Earlier this week, the Philadelphia Inquirer dropped into New
Jersey to visit Mr. Florio's old political stomping grounds,
a district that gave him 82% of its vote in 1986. Something's
changed. Reflecting sentiment in the state, Robert E.
Andrews, a Democrat running for Mr. Florio's old seat, has
pledged that he will vote against any federal tax increase in
Congress. He's offered a plan to cut the federal deficit
without raising taxes, suggesting reforms in welfare and
health programs. Whether in New Jersey or the country
generally, people got used to the idea of working hard to
achieve private economic growth in the '80s. They didn't
think they were working so that government could grow larger
and engorge itself on their incomes. Washington still doesn't
understand that.

   Lockheed Panel
   Mulls Redemption
   Of Poison Pill Plan

   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. said a special
committee of the board met yesterday to consider redemption
of its poison pill plan, but what the panel will recommend to
the full board won't be decided for some time.
   Dallas financier Harold Simmons, who controls a 19.8%
stake in Lockheed through NL Industries Inc., has asked the
company to amend its poison pill provision, allowing him to
buy 10 million Lockheed shares now controlled by the trustee
of the company's employee stock-ownership plan. The poison
pill, which can be activated when an investor obtains 20% or
more of Lockheed's stock, is meant to dilute a hostile
suitor's position and make a takeover prohibitively
expensive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep has said in the past he is
reluctant to rescind the pill because it would leave the
defense contractor vulnerable to "coercive and unfair
takeover tactics." A Lockheed spokesman said Mr. Simmons
would be notified of the status of the poison pill after the
full board has made up its mind. The next regularly scheduled
board meeting is set for Sept. 24.
   In a letter dated Aug. 24, NL asked for an opportunity to
present its case to the special committee, as well as to
review any Lockheed-generated studies on the issue being
considered by the group.
   However, both requests were turned down by Lockheed. In an
Aug. 31 letter, Mr. Tellep cited continuing litigation
between NL and Lockheed, saying that "some of the material
which will be presented to the committee is attorney-client
privileged information" and "as such, your request . . .
cannot be honored." He invited NL to submit in writing any
material it wished to provide, but the Lockheed spokesman
said that NL didn't act on that offer.
   The chief executive officer of Houston-based NL, J. Landis
Martin, responded in another letter dated Sept. 7 that
"dubious claims of privilege are being asserted" by Lockheed.
He further noted that shareholders voted at the company's
annual meeting to redeem the poision pill, formally known as
a shareholder-rights plan, 54% to 41%.
   "You are going through an elaborate charade that will
purport to justify a course of action that avoids compliance
with the resolution," Mr. Martin wrote. "Your efforts to
avoid the committee hearing views with which Lockheed's
current management disagrees confirm the built-in bias in the
special committee's deliberations." The correspondence was
made available through an NL filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

   WASHINGTON -- Strong exports of goods and services
continue to provide the one bright spot in an otherwise
wilting U.S. economy, according to new Commerce Department
figures.
   The department said the current account trade deficit,
calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, was $21.84 billion
in the second quarter, barely changed from $21.67 billion in
the previous quarter. Exports of goods set a record, and
exports of services rose. Taken together, the two quarters
marked the U.S.'s best trade performance since the early
1980s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But analysts caution that rising oil prices will cause the
deficit to widen sharply in the next few months. The U.S.
imports roughly half of its oil, and prices have risen
steeply since the U.S. imposed an embargo on Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil after Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait last
month.
   "Oil is the big clinker," says David Hartman, managing
director of Data Resources Inc. "This data doesn't say much
about the future."
   Strong economic growth overseas is the primary reason for
continued U.S. export growth. Although the U.S. led world
growth throughout much of the 1980s, it now is dragging along
behind its trading partners.
   "The very positive thing in the midst of all the gloom and
doom in the U.S. economy is that, with the exception of
Canada and to some extent Britain, the rest of our trading
partners are growing quite strongly," said Mr. Hartman.
   Merchandise exports expanded to a seasonally adjusted
$159.4 billion in the second quarter from $159.16 billion the
previous quarter. That brought the overall merchandise trade
deficit down to $22.58 billion from $26.28 billion. In 1989,
the deficit exceeded $28 billion in every quarter.
   Exports of services rose to a seasonally adjusted $31.7
billion in the second quarter from $31.4 billion. The U.S.
ran a surplus on services of $6.08 billion, compared with
$6.01 billion in the first quarter.
   The U.S. earned $30.93 billion on its assets abroad in the
second quarter, down slightly from earnings of $31.54 billion
in the first quarter. Foreign earnings on U.S. assets were
$31.56 billion in the most recent quarter, compared with
$29.55 billion. That left the U.S. with an investment income
deficit of $637 million, compared with a surplus of $2
billion in the first quarter.
   The new figures also provide a measure of foreign
investment in the U.S. during the second quarter. Net foreign
purchases of U.S. Treasury securities came to $2.88 billion,
which contrasts with net sales of $835 million in the first
period. Net foreign purchases of other U.S. securities came
to $4.92 billion, up from $2.49 billion.
   Net direct foreign investment in plant, equipment and
companies in the U.S. was $5.01 billion in the second
quarter, compared with $5.54 billion. All the numbers are
adjusted for seasonal variations.

   Likenesses of the Iraqi Leader
   Grow to Epic Proportions,
   Though Fewer in Number

   BAGHDAD, Iraq -- The Iraqi capital's landscape is
dominated, as it has been for a decade, by a single theme:
the face and figure of Saddam Hussein. But the iconography of
the Iraqi leader has shifted in revealing and sometimes
ominous ways.
   During and immediately after the Iran-Iraq war, Saddam
Hussein, like George Orwell's Big Brother, was watching you
at every turn. He stared down from portraits on all four
walls of the arrival terminal at Saddam International
Airport. He gazed out from mammoth billboards lining the road
into town. He was there waiting for you on TV, often with a
chorus singing praise in the background. He even eyed you
from the dials of wristwatches worn by Iraqi officials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, the airport portraits are gone, and intersections
that once displayed four paintings are down to only one. Much
scarcer, too, are images of the warrior-president, in combat
helmet or clutching a machine gun.
   In their place are portraits of a kinder, gentler leader,
who cuddles children, prays often and cooks his own food. But
the new and improved Saddam Hussein has another dimension as
well. Several new likenesses are three stories high,
including one enormous statue of Saddam Hussein standing
stiffly at attention, his arm outstretched at a 45 degree
angle. Many billboards show the president in a Tyrolean hat,
set against an alpine setting utterly foreign to
Mesopotamia's sun-baked plains.
   "This year's Saddam," says a veteran diplomat, "is one
part Caesar, and one part Adolf Hitler."
   Diplomats and Western residents say many pictures came
down early this year, possibly as a reaction to the overthrow
of Nicolae Ceaucescu, whose Romanian regime bore
uncomfortable resemblances to Saddam Hussein's. Officially,
there has been no change in what Iraqis insist is a
spontaneous outpouring of artistic adoration for the
president. Asked why so many portraits have disappeared, a
Ministry of Information official says, "It is normal. They
need to be cleaned."
   While the quantity is diminished, the scale of new
artworks is monumental. One new sculpture of the president is
visible from a half-mile away; an older artwork that occupied
an adjoining traffic circle, titled "Arab Horseman," has been
removed so as not to obstruct the view of the president.
"Normally you must be dead before they put up something so
big," says a taxi driver.
   Nearby, crossed swords rise a hundred feet into the air at
either end of a parade ground. At the hilt of each saber is a
hand of Pharaonic grandeur, modeled on the hand of Saddam
Hussein. In the same complex, workmen are completing an
Eiffel Tower-like structure, mounted with an enormous clock
and soon to be decorated with scenes from the president's
life.
   "London has Big Ben, now Baghdad will have a big clock,
too," says a watchseller named Mourad Salim.
   The display in Mr. Salim's shop includes much more modest
timepieces whose dials are decorated with the president's
face. Mr. Salim says sales are brisk in these days of
conflict with the West. But other watchsellers confide that
the watches are distributed to them free by the government
and don't attract many buyers. "People see his face all over
the place," says one merchant. "They don't need to look at
him every minute on their wrist."
   A few doors down, at a bookstore, the window is filled
with works by and about Adolf Hitler, decorated with
swastikas and translated into Arabic. One of the newest
monuments in Baghdad honors four Nazi-backed colonels who led
a failed revolt in 1941 against Iraq's British-backed rulers.
   In a statement directed at President Bush last month,
Saddam Hussein complained that "you have compared me to some
of the negative characteristics of Hitler" -- implying that
there is a positive side to the Nazi leader. One diplomat's
description of a recent meeting with Saddam Hussein sounds
straight out of Charlie Chaplin's satire on Hitler, "The
Great Dictator." The president, he says, holds his hand
extremely low when greeting visitors, forcing them to bow as
they shake hands.
   Some observers link these Hitlerian echoes to Saddam
Hussein's campaign to become leader of the anti-Israel
struggle -- a quest that included his threat to scorch half
of Israel with poison gas if attacked by the Jewish state.
   Equally pronounced is the president's obsession with
dynastic themes. Long cast as a revolutionary who rose from
humble origins to help topple imperialist forces, Saddam
Hussein increasingly links himself to the "ancien regime."
The Hashemite monarchy, installed by the British in Iraq
after World War I and overthrown in 1958, gradually is being
rehabilitated. The royal tombs have been fixed up after years
of neglect. A traffic circle long-named for the Arab
nationalist, Gamel Abdel Nasser, was recently renamed Faisal
Square, with a statue of the Hashemite king at its center,
replacing a similar one torn down by angry mobs in 1958.
   "It's an insult to those of us who risked our lives
fighting the monarchy," says one Iraqi.

   Prosecution of Sundstrand Ex-Aides
   Raises Questions as Trial Gets Underway

   CHICAGO -- The defense fraud scandals of the 1980s made
villains of a lot of big companies, but a case here involving
Sundstrand Corp. shows that catching possible crooks in the
executive suite is lot more difficult.
   In 1988, the Rockford, Ill., aerospace contractor pleaded
guilty to defrauding the Pentagon and paid a $199 million
settlement -- the largest fine ever of its kind.

<TEXT>
   Yet despite Sundstrand's own admission of criminal
wrongdoing, U.S. prosecutors have gotten bogged down trying
to find the executives who were behind the fraud. So far,
they've managed to bring charges against only three managers.
   None of the three indicted executives, whose trial began
here Monday, has a particularly high rank at Sundstrand. And
it seems highly unlikely that they alone could have
orchestrated the massive fraud Sundstrand itself
acknowledged.
   The highest-level executive charged, Joseph J. McCarthy,
was comptroller of the company's aviation unit. The other
defendants are his former employees, Ralph G. Hamann and Ray
John Chapel Jr. They are charged with conspiring to defraud
the government and making false statements.
   Current and former federal investigators, however, are now
saying that it's unlikely the inquiry will go any farther
than these three executives. The reasons: Investigators say
the government has had little success in "flipping" onetime
company middle-managers to testify against former superiors.
No documents that turned up have implicated higher-ups,
investigators say. And the complex Pentagon procurement
regulations led to an internal debate that seriously delayed
the investigation, pushing it up against the five-year
statute of limitations.
   The Sundstrand investigation "is not going past the three
individuals," said a federal lawman who was involved in the
case. "Maybe everybody {working on the case} got tired."
   The status of the Sundstrand investigation represents an
abrupt turnabout from prosecutors' initial optimism. In 1988,
Anton R. Valukas, then the government's top prosecutor in
Chicago, told a packed news conference that investigators
were scrutinizing officers of Sundstrand at all levels,
asserting that "there was an attitude on the part of many
within the company which permitted this to take place." At
the time, the judge in the case even referred to it as a
"sordid affair" and said executives of the company condoned
systematic efforts to "cheat, lie and steal" from the
government.
   Sundstrand, which sells aircraft generators and parts to
the Navy and Air Force through fixed-price contracts, pleaded
guilty to charges that it regularly underbid for government
business and then ran up millions of dollars in cost overruns
from 1980 through 1985 and charged them to the Defense
Department.
   The company charged the government for a wide range of
executives' personal expenses -- Steuben glassware, birthday
parties for officers, country-club fees and dog-kennel costs,
among them.
   The fraud scheme was carried out during the tenure of
Evans W. Erikson as Sundstrand's chairman and chief executive
officer. He retired at age 62 in December, 1988. His
successor as president and chief executive officer is Harry
C. Stonecipher, who joined the company from General Electric
Co. in 1987, after the fraud took place. Sundstrand declined
to comment on the case.
   A former prosecutor familiar with the case still holds out
hope that, if any of the three men on trial is convicted, he
might yet cooperate in a case involving the charges on which
the statute of limitations hasn't expired. But even this
former prosecutor concedes the chances of that appear slim.
   The government often faces obstacles like these in
pressing such complex accounting investigations toward the
indictment of executives, says Don Mancuso, the Defense
Department's assistant inspector general for investigations.
Top management sometimes institutes bonus programs for
cost-savings or finds other subtle means "to tell the
managers that the written procedures {demanded by the
government} don't have to be strictly enforced."
   One big headache faced by the prosecution in the current
case is the Defense Department's own in-fighting over what
accounting practices were illegal. Defense attorneys involved
in the Sundstrand investigation, but not in the current
trial, say the case could be difficult for the government to
win for this reason.
   The mischarging of cost overruns to taxpayers is at the
heart of the current trial, and the government contends
Messrs. McCarthy, Chapel and Hamann misstated to the
government just how company books were kept.
   But defense attorneys intend to argue that the accounting
practices were legal under confusing defense regulations that
the judge in the criminal trial terms "turgid, and very
difficult to comprehend."
   Government documents describe the intra-agency debate. In
a 1986 meeting, one criminal investigative report shows,
defense procurement official Paul Berg said the cost impact
of Sundstrand's accounting "was probably minimal and with
offsets may be a wash."
   But Michael McConnell, a Defense Department accountant who
played a key role in turning up the fraud, argued that there
were "great quantities of unallowable costs mischarged by
Sundstrand."
   There's also evidence that the government turned up hints
of the fraud about 15 years ago but failed to take action,
citing "little risk of loss to the Defense Department,"
according to a 1986 criminal investigative report.

   NEW YORK -- More forecasts of a slowdown in the technology
sector fueled declines in high-tech stocks, bringing the
over-the-counter market lower.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.24 to 379.49, a 0.6%
loss, as trading remained light in the absence of any major
Mideast developments. Volume rose slightly to 100.1 million
shares from 98.3 million Monday. Declining stocks overtook
advancing shares, 989 to 754; 143 stocks fell to new lows
while only 14 rose to new highs.

   Gloomy economic news continues to keep investors leery of
the market, said William A. Rothe, head of OTC trading at
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons. As fears of inflation, recession and
flare-ups in the Middle East haunt investors, its appears the
market will go even lower before it recovers, said Peter Da
Puzzo, co-head of world-wide equities at Shearson Lehman
Brothers.
   Four factors have helped slow the growth in demand for
technology products, according to Lawrence Bowman, portfolio
manager of the $62.5 million Fidelity Select Technology Fund.
Those factors are the traditional summer doldrums in the
industry, larger problems in the economy, the maturation of
some computer-related product cycles and slowing demand in
Europe, Mr. Bowman said in an interview. He added that the
slower growth is "incremental" and not extreme.
   "You can do well with companies with robust product
cycles, but you have to be choosy," Mr. Bowman said.
Companies that make low-cost computer clones such as Dell
Computer and AST Research look attractive, he said.
   Software makers are a "mixed bag" depending on how long
their products have been on the market, he added. Microsoft,
with the strong demand for its Windows 3.0 software, still
looks attractive, he said. He also is optimistic about the
outlook for workstation maker Sun Microsystems; minicomputer
systems maker Pyramid Technologies; semiconductor equipment
maker Novellus Systems; disk-drive maker Quantum and network
systems maker Novell.
   Yesterday, a gloomy forecast by exchange-listed Tandem
Computers and price cuts by exchange-listed Compaq Computer
spilled into the OTC market as investors pared their holdings
in other technology shares.
   Sun Microsystems lost 7/8 to 28 3/4; Apple Computer slid 1
3/4 to 34; Microsoft eased 1/4 to 55 1/2; Conner Peripherals
fell 1 to 22 1/2; Applied Materials lost 2 1/4 to 27; and
Intel dropped 1/2 to 32.
   Lotus Development tumbled 1 1/2 to 16 1/2. Shares of the
Cambridge, Mass., software maker dropped after its chief
financial officer, Robert Schechter, told money managers at a
San Francisco conference that Lotus was "pulling back" from
its goal of annual 25% revenue growth and of sustaining 25%
return on equity and pretax profit margins. Later in the day,
Lotus Chairman and President Jim P. Manzi said the company
isn't scaling back its growth targets as sharply as the money
managers at the conference perceived. He said the company's
revenue growth target is "20% to 25%."
   Ingres soared 3 5/8 to 9 and was the day's most active
stock after ASK Computer Systems said it plans to pay $9.25 a
share in cash for the Alameda, Calif., maker of database
management software products.
   In turn, Hewlett-Packard and EDS Corp. agreed to buy a $60
million stake in ASK, giving EDS 19.7% of ASK's shares
outstanding and Hewlett-Packard a 10% stake in the Mountain
View, Calif., computer systems company. ASK closed unchanged
at 8. More than three million Ingres shares changed hands, 75
times average daily volume.
   Spear Financial Services jumped onto the most active list
after the Los Angeles company's largest shareholder, Liberty
Mutual Insurance of Boston, sold its nearly 15.9% stake, or
1,086,221 shares, to Spear at 3 1/8. The stock rose 3/8 to 3
1/8 on 1.1 million shares.
   In other buy-out news, Sizzler Restaurants eased 1/4 to 16
1/2 after trading as high as 19. Collins Food International,
which owns 66% of the operator of steak restaurants, said it
will acquire the remaining shares its doesn't own in an
exchange offer.
   Hogan Systems traded as high as 3 1/2 but closed unchanged
at 3 1/8, after the Dallas maker of software for banking
systems said International Business Machines Co. bought a 5%
stake in the company. The two companies also renewed their
marketing agreements.
   The continuing Mideast crisis helped cause a casualty in
the OTC market. Valmont Industries, which halted sales of its
irrigation systems to Iraq, tumbled 1 3/4 to 13 1/4 after the
Valley, Neb., company said earnings for the 1990 third
quarter and full year will be lower than expected and below
1989 earnings of $1.78 a share.
   Valmont, which also makes components for the electrical
construction industry, attributed the lower expectations
largely to slower business in the U.S., as well as the loss
of its sales to Iraq. Valmont's sales to Iraq comprised about
1.5% to 2% of its total sales in 1989, according to Vice
President Brian Stanley.
   Burritt InterFinancial Bancorp skidded 1 1/4 to 3 1/2
after the New Britain, Conn., financial institution said it
expects a "significant decline" in third- and fourth-quarter
earnings. Burritt said it expects to report nonperforming
loans amounted to between 5% and 6% of assets at the end of
the third quarter. Monday, the stock slipped 1/2.
   Calgon Carbon fell 2 1/4 to 34 3/4 after Merrill Lynch
analyst William Genco lowered earnings estimates for the
Pittsburgh marketer of activated carbon, a company
spokeswoman told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Mr.
Genco's estimates had been the high end of analysts'
estimates, DJPIR said.

   Their reasoning: AT&amp;T's heavy expenses in promoting its
credit card won't start paying off until at least 1992. And
recession fears are haunting the company's phone-switch and
computer businesses, just as AT&amp;T was beginning to win
acclaim for getting its computer act together.
   "The economy is softening and the outlook for improvement
in the near term, particularly with the Mideast crisis, isn't
good," says Jack B. Grubman, a PaineWebber analyst. "AT&amp;T
isn't immune to this, especially in its equipment business,"
where he estimates profits have been strained by annual
pretax losses of $500 million in computers and office phone
systems.
   Robert B. Morris III at Goldman, Sachs notes that the
manufacturing business "is nonrecurring in nature in terms of
sales, compared with AT&amp;T's long-distance business. AT&amp;T is a
company with cyclical exposure."
   Joel Gross at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette says that when
the gross national product hummed along at 3% to 4% growth,
AT&amp;T's long-distance business grew at half the industry rate
of 12% to 14%. "In a full recession of negative 2%, AT&amp;T
could hit the low single digits or even flatten in terms of
(revenue) growth," he says.
   Larry Prendergast, AT&amp;T vice president and treasurer, begs
to differ: "The current view from our economists is we are
not expecting a recession in the near term," he says,
"although we are more concerned about it than we were several
months ago. . . . We have not changed our guidance of July 19
that we expect 1990 to be better than '89, a record earnings
year." The executive notes that AT&amp;T trades at 11.5 times
analysts' per-share profit estimate for 1990, "in line with
other companies such as MCI, IBM and GE." AT&amp;T stock has
fallen more than 20% since June, when analysts last cut their
estimates.
   A companywide reorganization has cut almost 40,000 jobs in
two years, and AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories -- until now the sacred
cow in cost-reduction efforts -- is expected to begin
downsizing later this year. "That's probably a good guess,"
says an AT&amp;T spokesman. "But those would be a couple of
hundred non-technical, behind-the-scenes type jobs."
   PaineWebber's Mr. Grubman Friday cut his full-year profit
estimate for AT&amp;T to $2.50 a share from $2.60 -- flat against
1989's showing. He cut his 1991 estimate to $2.70 from $2.95.
   Since March, AT&amp;T's credit card operation has broken
banking industry records, signing up nearly three million
accounts and five million cards and racking up more than $750
million in card purchases. AT&amp;T gets its cut from the fees
paid by merchants on those purchases and by long-distance
callers using the card. But analysts aren't sure how much
AT&amp;T has pocketed in transaction fees from the card (and
customers who order the card this year won't ever pay an
annual fee.)
   Mr. Grubman estimates that AT&amp;T could be spending as much
as $100 million a quarter to push its plastic against
entrenched giants such as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan. He
says the investment is worth it. "They could have 11 million
cards by this time next year," he says. "If they do and they
get a 3% return on their assets they'll earn 35 cents a share
annually from the credit card business."
   Mr. Morris isn't so sure. "It remains to be seen whether
AT&amp;T can make money off credit cards," he says. "Returns in
the industry have traditionally been high, but AT&amp;T's coming
in will likely drive industry returns down." Mr. Morris is
leaving his 1990 estimate for AT&amp;T at $2.60 -- already one of
the Street's lowest -- but he cut his '91 prediction to $2.80
from $3.
   Analysts are cautious about the long-distance industry's
prospects. AT&amp;T derives between 50% and 55% of its revenue
and 85% of its profit from long distance. Many analysts cut
their estimates for MCI Communications a few weeks ago. They
worry that the long-distance marketing wars are driving up
selling costs.
   AT&amp;T could match the spending of its long-distance foes
easily, but that wouldn't erase its immediate problems. Says
Mr. Grubman: "Long term, AT&amp;T has a very powerful base and is
a good investment. But near term, with all the economic
problems, its stock is going to move more sideways than up.
AT&amp;T's performance will mirror the market's."
   One of AT&amp;T's biggest shareholders is the University of
California, which holds about 6.2 million shares and believes
AT&amp;T can produce annual earnings growth of about 11% a year
over the long term. AT&amp;T's 4.2% dividend yield exceeds the
overall stock market's and provides "some dividend support"
for AT&amp;T shares, says Patricia Small, associate treasurer of
the university system, which manages about $16 billion of
pension and endowment funds. "The major question is whether
its growth rate will continue through all kinds of economic
cycles . . . We don't live and die with quarterly earnings
estimates."

   Haywire Digital Clocks
   Are Alarming Utilities

   THE PROBLEM of blinking digital clocks has caught the eye
of the utility-supported Electric Power Research Institute.
   Power outages, even for a moment, can cause digital clocks
on microwave ovens, videocassette recorders and bedside
tables to revert to 12:00 and to start blinking, indicating
they need to be reset. Owners then have to roam through the
house resetting them, often by complicated procedures.
   The problem "represents an increasing source of friction
between utilities and their customers," says a recent issue
of the EPRI Journal. For a Florida utility, subjected to
several split-second outages a day from lightning, blinking
clocks were the No. 1 complaint, the journal reports.
   A year ago, EPRI put a team of engineers on the problem.
It found that older digital clocks, produced in the 1970s,
resist the blinking problem because they have relatively
large capacitors, which store enough electricity to tide the
clock over for outages as long as 10 seconds. The smaller
capacitors on newer clocks can't deal with outages longer
than a fraction of a second. Many newer clocks have space for
backup batteries, but customers rarely buy them because the
clocks work without batteries.
   Rechargeable batteries or the addition of a low-power
electronic memory with an automatic reset button would solve
the problem. But makers of digital clocks, all of whom are in
Asia, probably would balk at the extra costs, the researchers
conclude. A forthcoming report, EPRI says, will advise
utilities on how to modulate customer ire by discussing the
problem in inserts to the monthly bill and other gambits.
                                                                                                       

   Drunken Driver Warnings
   Fall Flat in Taprooms
                                                                                                       

   APPEALS such as "if you drink, don't drive" are unlikely
to work, a psychology experiment in Canada found.
   To see how alcohol affects moral judgments, two
psychologists at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British
Columbia, toured local bars and parties. They gave drinkers
who volunteered a standard test involving hypothetical moral
dilemmas, such as mercy killings, and then asked them about
the morality of driving after drinking. The volunteers agreed
to take on-the-spot breathalyzer tests and to come to the
university a week later to be interviewed on drinking habits.
   When sober at the second interview, most volunteers were
more mature in their judgements about drinking and driving
than they had been a week earlier. They said that driving
after drinking was wrong, and that they were less likely than
other people to do so. Yet, "every subject but one who had
driven to a bar or party drove home, however impaired," the
psychologists report. The breathalyzer test showed that 12 of
the 26 drinkers who drove home were legally impaired.
   "This finding was surprising because these subjects had
just been interviewed about the values of life and law and
the wrongfulness of impaired driving, had been given the
results of a breathalyzer test and had been cautioned about
the effects of driving while impaired," Katy Denton and
Dennis Krebs say in the August issue of the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology.
   The findings "suggest that high-level moral appeals made
to people when they are sober will not constrain their
behavior when they are drunk," they conclude. To be
effective, "appeals directed toward sober people should
encourage them to take precautions ahead of time, before they
become intoxicated," they suggest.
                                                                                                       

   Cut Your Blood Pressure
   By Changing Armbands
                                                                                                       

   THE NATION'S high blood pressure problem might be sharply
reduced by a simple change in blood pressure measuring
devices, the editors of the Lancet suggest.
   In an editorial, the journal cites a study recently
published in England concerning blood pressure measurements
using the sphygmomanometer, the device involving a cuff
that's wrapped around the arm and then inflated to gain a
blood pressure reading. The study compared pressure readings
with the standard cuff that many manufacturers supply with
the machine against readings with a larger cuff.
   The larger cuff was designed so that the inflatable part,
the bladder, was long enough to wrap around at least 80% of
the arm's circumference. This is the size recommended by the
American Heart Association and the British Hypertension
Association because they say it's more accurate.
   The larger cuff gave lower pressure readings than the
standard cuffs supplied with the sphygmomanometers, the study
found. "Whilst the differences may be small, the researchers
point out that if the larger cuff were adopted it would
substantially reduce the numbers of patients committed to
treatment," the editorial notes.
   The journal estimated that in England and Wales, some
300,000 people would no longer be regarded as having mild
high blood pressure if the larger cuff were substituted for
the standard cuff. A 1988 American Heart Association report
indicates a similar problem exists in the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   SCIENTISTS at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton,
N.Y., will take samples of limestone from 50 French quarries
and 2,000 French medieval sculptures and bombard them with
neutrons. The resulting radioactivity should help tell which
quarry was the source of stone for each sculpture. . . . A
University of Illinois entomologist, checking literature on
American Indian herbal medicine, found that the Indians had
correctly identified a dozen plants as being toxic to
intestinal worms.

   Swiss Bank Announces
   Plans to Dissolve Syndicate

   ZURICH, Switzerland -- The largest bank syndicate in
Switzerland, which dominates the country's bond market, will
be dissolved, probably at the end of the year, according to a
spokeswoman for Swiss Bank Corp.
   However, a Swiss Big Bank syndicate statement by Union
Bank of Switzerland, or UBS, gave no indication that any
decision had been made. It said an announcement would be made
Sept. 26, but did not specify the subject. Swiss Bank Corp.,
UBS and Credit Swiss are the dominant members of the
syndicate; a number of smaller banks also belong to the
group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The development follows -- but goes far beyond -- a
government decree this week ordering the abolition of several
cartel-like agreements in the banking industry. The
dissolution of the syndicate would mean that smaller, rival
syndicates will have better opportunities in the bond market.
   A bank researcher said the change was sooner than expected
and that small and foreign banks will compete better, but
noted that the placing power of big banks will always be
needed.
   On Monday, Swiss Economics Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz
ordered the syndicate to drop by the end of the year a
so-called loyalty clause that prevents members of the
syndicate from joining outside underwriting houses.
   Jules Keller, a board member of Big Bank rival Warburg
S.G. Banque Soditic SA, said ending the syndicate goes much
further than abolishing the loyalty clause. The loyalty
clause, however, was the main problem, he said.
   The syndicate controls between 75% and 80% of the Swiss
franc foreign bond market by banning members from joining
other groups.

   Owners of Radar Detectors

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Drivers with Fuzzbusters can't be busted
by their insurance companies, according to an order by
California's insurance commissioner.
   The commissioner, Roxani M. Gillespie, yesterday ordered
Government Employees Insurance Co., or Geico, to stop
refusing to insure radar-detector owners in the state, saying
the practice violates California's insurance law. The
Washington, D.C., company had requested a hearing after a
motorist lodged a complaint last year charging that Geico
wouldn't renew his insurance after he confessed in a
questionnaire that he packed a radar detector in one of his
three cars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Gillespie found in her decision that Geico had
presented, "No credible evidence . . . that radar detector
users as a class are high-speed drivers or that as a class
they tend to drive in a manner which endangers the safety of
themselves or others."
   Geico won't appeal the decision immediately, but will
collect better data and "will eventually prevail" in proving
the connection between radar detectors and accidents, said
Tony Nicely, the company's president. Insurance departments
in Maryland and five other states require insurance companies
to sell policies to radar-detector owners, Mr. Nicely said,
but Geico refuses insurance to such owners in 42 other states
because "we know of no other plausible use of a radar
detector than to exceed speed laws."

   BRAZIL VS. ILLITERACY

   Brazil launched a national crusade against illiteracy.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office in
March pledging to modernize Brazil, announced the program
that aims to teach most of the 32 million illiterates to read
by 1995. The cost of the project through the end of 1991 will
be about $720 million.
   "By the end of my mandate, the number of illiterates will
be reduced by 70%," said President Collor, adding that Brazil
would always be backward if it didn't change its
"dramatically cruel and unjust" social system.
   Brazil, which had an estimated population last year of 154
million, has the worst distribution of income of any major
country in the world, and economists link this to the
extremely low standards of education for all except the rich.
                                                                                                       

   A PARKING BAN IN PARIS
                                                                                                       

   A ban on parking along 17 miles of major Paris streets
went into effect yesterday, part of a campaign to ease severe
traffic congestion. The restrictions prohibit parking at any
time along a series of designated roads that form major
east-west and north-south routes. A special force of 120
police and traffic officers will enforce the new rules;
violators face having their cars towed and fines of $85.
Affected routes include some of Paris's best-known streets,
such as the Rue de Rivoli and the Boulevard Saint Michel.
                                                                                                       

   CHINESE MAP AMAZON REGION
                                                                                                       

   China has won its first overseas aerial-survey contract, a
$7 million deal to map part of Brazil's Amazon River basin,
the China News Service reported. More than 100 Chinese
technicians arrived in Brazil last month to survey a 25,000
square mile region using remote sensing equipment, according
to the news agency. The project, funded by a World Bank loan,
will produce maps to improve land management in Brazil's
northeast.
                                                                                                       

   NEW TOURIST DESTINATION
                                                                                                       

   In anticipation of the 1993 opening of the tunnel under
the English Channel, England's county of Kent and the French
department of Nord-Pas de Calais are promoting themselves as
a new tourist destination, Region Transmanche. Two bilingual
publications are available -- a diary of festivals and fairs
and a guide to more than 60 tourist attractions in the two
regions. The books were financed by the European Year of
Tourism, an initiative of the European Community and the
European Free Trade Association.
                                                                                                       

   TRANSIT SYSTEM FOR BANGKOK
                                                                                                       

   Thailand's Council of Economic Ministers endorsed Lavalin
International Group's bid to build and operate the Skytrain
transit system in Bangkok, pushing the long-delayed, $1.66
billion project past its latest hurdle. With the decision,
Lavalin International, which includes Japanese and Thai
partners led by Canada's Lavalin Inc., triumphed over
Asia-Euro Consortium, made up of European and Thai partners
headed by Leighton Contractors (Asia) Ltd., the Hong Kong
unit of Australia's Leighton Holdings Ltd. Skytrain, an
above-ground, rapid-transit system has been on and off Thai

   Norway has earmarked $50 million in aid to help clean up
Soviet industries that are polluting the arctic regions of
both countries. "We are not doing this to solve a Soviet
problem, but to solve a Norwegian problem," said Prime
Minister Jan P. Syse. Pollution from outdated Soviet smelters
drifts into northern Norway, damaging the fragile arctic
environment.
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMANY'S NUCLEAR PLANTS
                                                                                                       

   East Germany's two Soviet-made nuclear-power plants are
likely to be closed for good after German unification because
it would cost too much to make them safe, West German
Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer said.
   Bringing safety equipment up to standard at the plants
made little economic sense because of time-consuming approval
procedures and expense, Mr. Toepfer told a news conference.
The Bonn Environment Ministry assumes authority over East
German nuclear-power reactors with unification Oct. 3.
   "Considering that the existing operating license expires
under the German unity treaty on June 30, 1995, the operating
time remaining would be shortened so much that modernization
would make little economic sense," Mr. Toepfer said in
reference to the larger Greifswald power plant. Time was
running even shorter at the Rheinberg plant, where the
license expires at the end of 1992.
   Under East Germany's former communist government, five
nuclear-power reactors operated at the two sites. The
Rheinberg reactor and three of four units at Greifswald have
already been turned off, with the fourth to follow soon.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   "It looks like a museum," said sailor Yevgeni Gerko of the
new Pizza Hut on Moscow's Kutuzovsky Prospekt. He was one of
about 300 Soviets who waited in line for up to four hours for
the restaurant's official opening yesterday. . . . There will
be a record 3,298 centenarians in Japan by the end of this
month, and four out of five of them will be women, a Health
and Welfare Ministry report said. Japan's oldest person is
Waka Shirahama, a 112-year-old woman from the Miyazaki
region.

   Overbooked Passengers
   Can Sue Airline, Court Says

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Airline passengers bumped from
overbooked flights can turn down the free tickets and refunds
they're offered and sue for damages, a federal appeals court
ruled.
   In a case from Montana, a three-judge panel of the Ninth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a federal ban on direct
state regulation of airlines does not prevent a passenger
from suing under ordinary state law for harm caused by
airline practices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling allows William D. West, a Helena, Mont., patent
lawyer, to pursue a suit against Northwest Airlines for
selling tickets that cannot be exchanged or refunded but are
subject to bumping when flights are overbooked. West is
seeking punitive damages.
   "Selling nonrefundable tickets limits a traveler's ability
to make changes but not the airline's ability . . . to switch
to a smaller-size aircraft, increasing the chances of
bumping," said attorney Cornish Hitchcock of the Public
Citizen Litigation Group, a Ralph Nader organization that
helped represent West.
   The right to sue for overbooking was established in a 1976
Supreme Court decision, a case that started when Allegheny
Airlines bumped Nader from a Washington-to-Hartford flight.
In Tuesday's ruling, the appeals court said the federal
deregulation of airlines in 1978 did not prohibit all such
suits.
   The airline was studying the ruling Tuesday and had no
comment, said its lawyer, Jon Metropoulos.

   Virginia and Rodney Bunker, white liberals from the Age of
Aquarius, were certain that their adoption of needy black
children not only was a good deed but also moved America
closer to true integration.
   They were hardly ready for the shock they encountered at
an adoption convention in St. Louis. There, before a hushed
crowd of scores of white couples cuddling their black babies,
the president of the National Association of Black Social
Workers accused them all of cultural genocide. Their
children, he charged, wouldn't develop black pride and a
black identity, both sorely needed to grapple with society
and racism.

<TEXT>
   "There was incredible hurt in that crowd," Ms. Bunker
recalls, the memory still vivid 18 years later. "I was in
terrible pain." Mothers nearby, some of whom were taking
hormones so they could breast-feed their babies, wept openly.
Several parents were evicted as pitched, emotional arguments
over reverse racism broke out in the convention hall. Others,
fearful they would destroy their babies' lives, soon gave
them back to adoption agencies.
   It was a watershed event in the adoption world. The
5,000-member black social workers group went on record
opposing what had become an accepted, even fashionable
practice in the activist 1960s and early 1970s. Adoption
agencies, which in 1971 had placed more than a third of their
black infants with white parents, were loath to court
controversy, and many began to bar so-called transracial
adoptions altogether.
   But a fierce debate over transracial adoption continues,
focusing attention on the fate of the Bunkers' four black
children and 20,000 other transracially adopted youngsters.
Mounting numbers of white parents are clamoring to adopt,
while tens of thousands of black children are languishing in
foster care because adoption agencies either can't or, as
some critics suggest, barely try to find them black parents.
   "Black children can rot in foster care, or they can be
adopted by white families," contends Mary Beth Seader, vice
president for the nonprofit National Committee for Adoption.
Her group is lobbying to start transracial adoptions anew and
remove restrictions on them in 35 states.
   The studies done on transracial adoptions show mixed
results. Clearly, the children are affected by influences all
adolescents face growing up: peer pressure, sibling rivalry,
occasional feelings of alienation. But without doubt, the
transracial environment generates its own adjustment and
identity issues.
   In many cases, the studies show the children achieving
well and developing high self-esteem. Kirsten Albrecht, who
is black, was adopted as a baby by white parents. She is now
19 years old and an accelerated student at the University of
Chicago. "I look very positively on interracial adoption,"
she says. "I felt like I had the best of two worlds." She
says she is loved by her parents, both ministers, and that's
what matters.
   But the research also shows that adjustment can be painful
and, often, unsuccessful. Many of the children say that being
black in a white family impeded their efforts "to belong,"
doubly important to an adopted child. It openly advertised
what they most wanted to forget: that they had been given up
by their natural parents. At times, these children roamed a
racial no man's land, outcasts from both black and white
society, a reminder of the great gap between the two worlds.
"These kids often don't know who they are or where they fit
in," says Virginia Sturgeon, a program specialist with
Kentucky's "special needs" adoption program.
   Here is how five black youngsters -- and their adoptive
white parents -- have dealt with the complex social
experiment of transracial adoption:
                                                                                                       

   Nathan Hatton
                                                                                                       

   Nathan Hatton was uncomfortable. The 22-year-old Eastern
Michigan University freshman had decided to spend more time
with black people, so he found himself one night at an Ann
Arbor bar drinking beer with black college acquaintances. But
when several white buddies showed up from Farmington Hills, a
nearby Detroit suburb where Nathan grew up, he began
frantically switching between trying to sound black and
trying to sound white. Both groups ridiculed him for the
attempts until Nathan fled, feeling humiliated.
   "I don't feel I'm being me around black people -- they
aren't like us," Nathan says, motioning to the three white
schoolmates with whom he shares a dilapidated house. After he
left the bar in confusion, Nathan says, "I resigned myself to
not being black. I'm not going to act something I don't want
to be. Who is to say I have to be black? It's so trivial."
   Nathan's adoptive mother, Elizabeth, says she never
thought her son would grow up so confused about his race.
Mrs. Hatton, a guidance counselor who often cried at the
dinner table while discussing the state of public schools in
Detroit, wanted a better life for Nathan. She considers
herself "colorblind" and didn't worry about her son being
reared in a nearly all-white suburb away from others of his
race. "Color is foolishness," she says. "You don't pick your
family and friends because of their color." Adds William
Hatton, Nathan's adoptive father: "I don't see a great deal
of advantage to adopting the same race."
   But from the time he was a tot, color made Nathan the
outsider. Unlike Andrew, his white brother, who was also
adopted, Nathan found himself repeatedly having to explain
what he saw as a devastating rejection by his birth parents.
"I used to say my parents were killed in a plane crash. I
didn't want anyone to think I was given up," he says. Nathan
says his adoptive grandfather always bounced his three white
siblings on his lap, but left the room when he entered. He
remembers a racist neighbor bellowing epithets at the front
door of the Hattons' red-brick townhouse, then threatening to
crucify him or run him over with a car.
   Nathan was only a few years old when he began trying to
look white, spending hours in the bathroom plastering down
his hair. He would get down on all fours and drag his head on
the living-room carpet, straining to straighten the kinks. He
craved acceptance, and tried to ease the tension of being
different by making people laugh, often at his own expense.
He was expelled from his nursery school for jumping from cot
to cot during nap time and pulling wallpaper off the walls of
the director's office. At five, Nathan perched naked on the
sill of a second-story window at his house, pounding his
chest and screaming: "I'm a nigger] I'm a nigger]" At 10, he
attempted suicide by swallowing a bottle of aspirin.
   "He needed someone to listen," says his sister Lydia. "We
were taught that children should repress anger, should be
seen but not heard."
   Nathan constantly battled older grade-school boys who made
him the target of racial insults, and broke one taunting
fifth grader's nose. He racked up 16 suspensions in the
seventh grade and spent time in several juvenile homes for
joy-riding accidents and car theft. His parents still sleep
with the car keys under their pillow and their valuables
locked behind a bolted bedroom door.
   Nathan says his limited experiences with blacks have been
alienating. Black children threw stones at him when his
mother took him to her inner-city office. He stormed out of a
meeting at a black college fraternity when talk turned to
what Nathan considered racist diatribes against white people.
   Jane Collie, the Hattons' only close black friend and
Nathan's childhood piano teacher, says, "Nathan can't deal
with blacks, but he has to accept himself for what he is."
The young man now says he is proud of his adoptive parents,
and grateful that they stuck by him. He adds that he plans to
associate with whites or Asians on campus, with whom he feels
more at ease. "I don't care what people say so much any more.
I'll lose my mind if I worry about it," he says. "I have to
feel better about myself."
                                                                                                       

   Samantha Davidge

   Samantha Davidge has almost always felt good about
herself. "There is nothing black parents could have done
better," says Samantha, 25. "I never felt I wanted a black
mother." She says she is able to feel comfortable with both
races. "Some of my {black friends} feel antsy if there are
too many whites in a crowd," she says. And, she is less quick
to blame many problems on racism. "A lot of my black friends
see themselves as victims. They are always defensive.
Sometimes that's best, but sometimes, it's not."
   Samantha gives lots of credit to her mother, Rosaearl.
Herself a foster child, Rosaearl went on to raise 12 foster
children plus four of her own in the San Fernando Valley
section of Los Angeles. Samantha says her mother carefully
nourished her self-esteem and confidence, and hammered home
that people's prejudices are their own problem.
   On a recent day, Rosaearl, a graying woman clad in
threadbare blue jeans, sat amid a clutter of cribs in their
stuccoed Southern California house feeding "little Miss
Cocaine Fits," one of her foster children who suffered from
drug or sexual abuse.
   Rosaearl Davidge is angry that opposition to transracial
adoptions has cut their number to only about 1,000 a year,
leaving many of the 14,400 adoptable black children bouncing
between various institutions or foster homes, which are
usually white. Half, by most estimates, will never find a
permanent home. Meanwhile, as many as two million families
want to adopt children, and 8,000 other couples this year
will choose to go abroad to adopt, taking home mostly
children from Korea and South America but also black babies
from Africa.
   Samantha says that at times in her life she suffered
because of her lack of familiarity with blacks. White girls
accepted her until junior high school, when "suddenly it was
not OK for the white kids I had grown up with to hang out
with me." Samantha didn't know any black youngsters except
for the inner-city children bused to her school; to her, they
seemed loud and intimidating. She was friendly for a time
with two local black girls, but when the three drifted apart
the two girls harangued her in a classroom, loudly saying
that she considered herself superior because she had a white
mother. "You're nothing but an Oreo," Samantha recalls them
shouting.
   But Samantha befriended other black girls and boys, some
of whom seemed stunned when her white mother greeted them at
the door. As a University of Southern California graduate
student in social work, Samantha says she is comfortable with
her race. "Society sees me as black," she says. "There's no
way I could do otherwise."
                                                                                                       

   Sarah Bunker
                                                                                                       

   Four years ago, a pregnant Sarah Bunker bolted upright in
bed, drenched with sweat from a nightmare. In the vision, a
white child had emerged from her womb, a child destined to
live the anxious life that has been Sarah's since a white
couple adopted her.
   "There have been so many times she needed someone to whom
she could relate experientially," says Sarah's mother,
Virginia, who adopted Sarah as a toddler before the family
journeyed to the 1972 St. Louis adoption convention. "I have
known the pain and frustration of wanting to be a black
parent" for her four adopted black children, she adds.
   It's not that the Bunkers haven't made sacrifices. In
1977, Sarah's father, Rodney, quit his tenure-track job as a
University of Wisconsin political science professor to move
from mostly white Eau Claire, Wis., to more racially mixed
Minneapolis, Minn. He has driven a city bus there for more
than a decade.
   Sarah played with black dolls. She took camping trips with
the Open Door Society, a group of families with transracially
adopted children. A portrait of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. hangs above the fireplace of the Bunkers' house. "Mom
constantly told us how special it was to be black," says
Sarah, now 21.
   For Sarah's brother Joshua, who is also black and adopted,
the environment proved richly nurturing. His parents
"encouraged me to experience black culture and my heritage,"
says Joshua, a recent graduate in East Asian studies from
Yale University. "There was no time I wanted to yell at them:
Why aren't you black? There was no time I felt a lack of
love. I felt fortunate for the stability of the family and
their economic means. I could have been raised by other
parents, less educated or less able to support me."
   But Sarah saw it differently. She says she felt like a
black person stuck with a white person's ways, appearance and
values. Blacks in her Minneapolis junior high school talked
differently, were more clothes-conscious and wore their hair
in neat cornrows. Sarah wore utilitarian garb and two braids
protruding from the sides of her head. "When you looked at
me," she says, "you knew I had white parents." Her black
schoolmates, she says, also seemed tough and more
confrontational; her parents counseled pacifism. "Why do you
walk like that?" one black classmate demanded. "Why don't you
get a little soul?" Sarah screamed back: "I have white
parents. It isn't my fault]"
   She became obsessed that something was wrong with her.
When she visited her adoptive grandparents in Rhinelander,
Wis., people in restaurants stared with their mouths agape.
"I felt like a big bright spotlight was on me all the time
because I had white parents," Sarah says. She hated dining
out alone with her father for fear others would take her for
a prostitute.
   In the ninth grade, Sarah suddenly gained 20 pounds, had
continual crying jags and saw her grades plummet. "I felt so
alone. I felt like an outcast. I wanted to be like other
blacks so badly," she says. "I felt that if I had black
parents, I would have fit in."
   Sarah says she later found comfort when she rebelled
against her parents and moved in with her black boyfriend.
She has since given birth to two children and says that
creating her own black family has finally brought her some
peace.
   Sarah says one positive aspect of growing up in white
society is that she now feels she understands whites better
than her friends do. She says her friends, who are mostly
black, view whites as distant authority figures generally out
to do them harm. "I can understand both worlds," she says.
"I've been on both sides."
   Still, she seethes when she sees white parents with a
black child. "I know they love the child to death," she says.
"But when I think of the kid I say: What a terrible thing."
                                                                                                       

   Kurt Reinhardt
                                                                                                       

   On a car trip last Christmas to his adoptive grandmother's
house, Kurt Reinhardt revealed the deep grudge he holds
against white society. He told his brother Eric, who is
white, that to develop their real potential blacks must live
separately from whites, and should use violent means if
necessary to cleave the two societies.
   Growing up in a white family hurt his own development,
says Kurt, 20. "Self-love was not there. All I came out with
was a collage of confusion." Since he began attending
predominantly black Howard University a year ago, he says he
wishes he had grown up in the black culture, too.
   Such thinking is a radical change for Kurt. For years, he
says, being part of a white family let him feel privileged
and different from other blacks. He used to drag Eric to
parties in his hometown of Lexington, Ky., to make the point
that he was from a white family. Amie Winn, his high-school
sweetheart, says Kurt told her he was better than her
previous black boyfriends because only one of his birth
parents was black. "He thought he was unique, that he didn't
belong to either category," says Eric. When he took a college
entrance test at age 17, he couldn't decide what to indicate
as his race, so he left the box blank.
   Kurt saw little advantage to viewing himself as black
while growing up. In the sixth grade, his principal bluntly
told Kurt, after he had fought a white boy over a young
girl's affections, that the girl's parents didn't want her to
date blacks. At the local department store, security guards
shadowed him, assuming he would steal, he says. And police
officers often stopped him to ask what he was doing in the
white neighborhood where he lived.
   "I enjoyed being the token," Kurt says. "I played soccer
and ate oysters on the half shell. Black people played
basketball and ate chitterlings." The illusions held until
his senior year in high school when he injured a knee and
many of his white friends, mostly soccer players, became more
distant after he was no longer on the team, he says. Kurt
became miserable. He gained 25 pounds and contemplated
suicide. As a freshman at the University of Kentucky the next
year, he felt rejected by both whites and blacks. He sank
into introversion and got a Mohawk haircut.
   Now at Howard, Kurt says he feels much more accepted. He
no longer averts his eyes from other blacks. During a stint
selling books door-to-door this summer, he purposely nods as
they pass him on the street.
                                                                                                       

   John Raible

   John Raible was Milwaukee's first transracially adopted
child. Now 30, he still sounds bitter when he talks about how
his parents minimized his being black. When he applied for a
Social Security card his mother said he should check the box
indicating he was white. When his high-school counselor
advised applying for a minority scholarship, his parents
"said to give it to a more deserving, real black student,"
John recalls.
   "We didn't want him to feel different from the other
children," says his mother, Patricia, who emphasizes that one
of John's birth parents is white, the other black. "We did
view him as essentially white," she says. "He was raised as
our son, just as we raised our other two children." John, an
elementary-school teacher who now lives in a Long Beach,
Calif., apartment lined with African masks, counters: "They
didn't understand how I felt as a person of color."
   Because they considered him white, John's parents played
down his encounters with racism. When his junior prom was
held at a country club that didn't allow blacks, he says,
they offered excuses for why it wasn't important that he
attend the affair. They didn't notice his dismay when, in the
seventh grade, classmates taunted him, comparing his skin to
the color of excrement. He began sucking in his lips so they
would seem thinner, more Caucasian.
   John gave up trying to talk to his parents about race
problems; he became a loner and his school grades dropped to
D's. He was terrified of the few blacks he encountered and
tended to stereotype them. When his father, a Unitarian
minister, took 10-year-old John to New York and visited the
United Nations building, 30 black children who came into the
gift shop together seemed rude, pushy and intimidating to
him. "All I knew of blacks was what I saw on TV -- all
negative, clownish people like George Jefferson. Or
criminals," he says. The only other black at his private high
school was the son of a trustee's maid.
   "I felt isolated and confused," John says. "You can't
raise kids to just think of themselves as human beings. You
must acknowledge that they are black, and will be perceived
as black." He adds, "It's not possible for white parents to
teach blacks about identity and racism." Slowly, he began to
seek out black experiences by listening to black radio
stations and mingling with other blacks at the local mall.
   John says adoption agencies are inflexible and too slow to
find black parents for black babies. He is single but adopted
his own black son, Kelly, three years ago, and says he now
realizes how hard raising a child can be. Still, it was only
after years of anger, during which he refused to speak to his
parents, that he finally visited them this summer. "Loving
me," he says simply, "just wasn't enough."

   New York Stock Exchange Sets
   Its First Limited Off-Hours Trades

   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange, taking another
step toward 24-hour trading of stocks, approved a limited
form of "off-hours" trading for big investors that could
start later this year.
   The Big Board approved two after-hours trading sessions --
known as "crossing sessions I and II" -- that will permit big
investors to trade major stocks through a computer for about
an hour after the regular trading session ends at 4 p.m. EST.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, true 24-hour trading -- the final phase of the
exchange's off-hours trading plan -- is still several years
down the road, exchange officials say. And many market
experts question whether round-the-clock trading of stocks is
something that many investors want.
   The Big Board also approved another service for big
institutional investors, starting as early as 1991. This one
will let them trade certain privately placed, unregistered
stocks and bonds that can now be more easily traded under the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 144a. The new
system would compete with the National Association of
Securities Dealers' Portal system, which has been running for
several months.
   The American Stock Exchange also is developing a 144a
system, called Situs, to compete with Portal and whatever
system the Big Board might introduce.
   The exchange's efforts in both off-hours and unregistered
trading reflect the direction in which the nation's
securities markets are headed -- toward increasing services
for big institutional investors such as pension and mutual
funds.
   The Big Board has seen the big investors direct more and
more of their trading business to off-exchange markets and to
regional and overseas exchanges. It has been scrambling to
protect its market share. Richard Grasso, Big Board
president, said the off-hours trading plan is, in part, an
attempt to "position the exchange competitively in the
evolution of a 24-hour marketplace."
   The exchange hopes the SEC will be quick to approve its
efforts in off-hours trading as a way of cutting down on the
growing trading of U.S. stocks in overseas markets, where
disclosure requirements can be much looser. Many big
investors, including brokerage firms doing computer-aided
program trading, have been using overseas markets such as
London's because they enjoy the relative anonymity there.
   The two "crossing sessions" that the Big Board approved
may be up and running before year end, an exchange spokesman
said. Neither session involves the physical presence of Big
Board floor traders, or specialists. They are assigned to
make markets in individual stocks on the exchange floor, as
part of a system that has been the heart of the exchange
since its founding nearly 200 years ago.
   Instead, in the first crossing session, from 4:15 p.m. to
5 p.m., traders will be able to execute orders in Big
Board-listed stocks using the 4 p.m. closing price. At 5
p.m., exchange computers will match buy orders with sell
orders and execute the trades.
   The second session is designed for brokerage firms
executing program trades for customers. From 4:15 p.m. to
5:15 p.m., exchange computers will execute multistock trades
in stocks in Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, the index
commonly used in program trading strategies.
   An earlier attempt by the Big Board to capture more
trading volume failed. That was the Big Board's Exchange
Stock Portfolio product, which allowed big investors to trade
all the S&amp;P 500 stocks in a single basket trade during
regular trading hours. The product has attracted virtually no
trades in recent months.
   If the crossing sessions catch on, the Big Board in 1991
hopes to begin "auction pricing" sessions, in which all Big
Board-listed stocks could be traded after hours, either by
computer or by floor traders. There wouldn't be continuous
trading; instead, orders would likely be entered, matched and
executed periodically at whatever prices the market dictates.
Finally, if customers want it, the Big Board might pursue the
final phase of the off-hours experiment: 24-hour trading.
   The Big Board said that, as part of its off-hours efforts,
it also approved a series of new rules referring to order
entry and execution, which the SEC must clear.

   Enterprise:
   Black-Owned Firms in U.S. Are Increasing at Rapid Pace
   ---
   Census Data Show Surge In Less
   Traditional Areas -- but Not in Sales

   WASHINGTON -- Entrepreneurship has been growing much
faster among blacks than among Americans in general, the
government's most comprehensive report on black capitalism
shows.
   The Census Bureau said the number of black-owned companies
in the U.S. jumped 38% in the five years ending in 1987, the
bureau's newest figures, to 424,000 companies. That's roughly
2 1/2 times faster than the 14% growth rate of total new
business formations in the same period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the bulk of black-owned companies remain tiny,
owner-operated "mom and pop" retail and service outlets, the
Census report showed an 87% jump to 70,815 in the number of
black-owned companies with paid employees. The number of
companies with workers had remained virtually unchanged in
the previous five years ending in 1982.
   "I think that's a pretty encouraging sign," said John
Dodds, chief of the Census Bureau's enterprise statistics
branch, which compiles the report. "Before, people were
making a business go just by hard work, maybe with a couple
of family members. Now they're expanding and hiring people.
It shows that black-owned firms are growing beyond the
formative stage."
   Timothy Bates, professor of urban policy at the New School
for Social Research in New York, says the increase in total
black-owned companies is "pretty impressive," but less
significant than the sharp rise in less traditional areas of
black business activity such as business services and
construction. The Census figures show the number of black
general contractors with paid workers doubling in the five
years ending in 1987, and business-service concerns with
employees more than tripling.
   "You're seeing a qualitative shift in the types of
business," said Mr. Bates. "Fewer barber shops and more
business-service companies. These are growth areas."
   But if black business ownership has been surging, other
figures in the Census report paint a more sobering picture of
the economic realities of minority entrepreneurship. Average
annual receipts for all U.S. companies covered by the report
(which didn't include publicly owned corporations) were
$146,000 in the 1983-1987 period, but only $47,000 for the
average black company. The annual sales of slightly more than
half of all black-owned companies were less than $10,000.
   Black-owned concerns in 1987 represented just 3% of all
U.S. companies and accounted for only 1% of gross receipts.
   Harry Brooks, chief executive officer of Advanced Consumer
Marketing Corp., Burlingame, Calif., says problems don't go
away as minority companies get larger. He notes that 19 of
the 100 largest black-owned industrial and service companies
listed by Black Enterprise magazine have gone out of business
in the past year. "That is a scary trend," he says. "When you
lose one of those companies, it's awfully difficult to
replace."
   Mr. Brooks, whose own concern is one of the bigger
black-owned businesses, says shortage of capital is a primary
concern for larger minority-owned companies. "We don't have
the staying power," he adds. "As you start growing, you use
cash at an accelerated pace. If you don't have some semblance
of deep pockets, you can be profitable and still go out of
business."
   Black entrepreneurs who have flourished under
affirmative-action programs also worry they'll be hurt by a
Supreme Court decision last year. In a case brought against
the government of Richmond, Va., the court said nearly all
programs that set aside a share of state and local
public-works programs for minority-owned companies are
unconstitutional. These local set-aside programs were
designed to spur minority-business formation.
   By sales volume, automobile dealers and service stations
ranked at the top of black-owned industry groups with $2.2
billion of receipts in 1987. Next were business services,
health services and special trade contractors.
   Not surprisingly, black business ownership is strongest in
areas with large black populations. The cities with the most
black-owned companies were New York, Los Angeles, Washington,
D.C., Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta.
   The Census Bureau began following minority business
ownership trends in 1969. Tracking down black-owned companies
involves considerable statistical legwork.
   The Internal Revenue Service gives the Census Bureau
names, addresses, Social Security numbers and dollar receipts
of every business tax return filed with the IRS. Names on the
business tax returns are then cross-matched with race codes
on an individual's Social Security application to compile a
list of black business persons. The bureau says its strict
non-disclosure policy protects the confidentiality of the tax
data.
   Mr. Dodds says the bureau also reviews lists from the
Small Business Administration's minority business office, and
various minority company directories in compiling its
five-year survey. "This is a real efficient operation," Mr.
Dodds adds. "It's very inexpensive because it uses existing
records."
   Because of statistical difficulties involved in matching
stockholder ownership by race, the report doesn't include
publicly owned companies, including those that may have
predominantly black ownership.
   Similar reports on companies owned by Hispanics, Asians,
American Indians and women will be released later.

management systems, to a company owned by Knightsbridge Inc.,
a Chicago-based investment concern, and Suntronic's managers.
   Though Sun Electric didn't disclose the value of the
transaction, it said one-half of the purchase price was paid
in cash and the balance in senior preferred stock in
Suntronic Technology Group Inc., the acquiring company.

   Sun Electric said that, as a result of accounting
adjustments associated with the deal, it will record a
third-quarter pretax charge of $1.2 million. In the 1989
third quarter, Sun Electric had a loss of $3.5 million, or 44
cents a share, after a $2.6 million charge related to
restructuring.
   It said the Suntronic unit, which has annual sales of
about $9 million, was sold to allow Sun Electric to focus on
further developing and expanding its core business of making
and selling diagnostic and test equipment for the motor
vehicle industry.

   Portray Decree, Lawsuit

   NEW YORK -- Lawyers at the Federal Trade Commission are
unhappy again with the U.S.'s major rare-coin grading
service, with whom the agency settled a big false-advertising
case last month.
   The coin grader, Professional Coin Grading Service Inc. of
Irvine, Calif., has mounted a public relations campaign in
which it portrays the long FTC investigation and subsequent
FTC lawsuit against the company as positive developments. The
reason the company can argue that: Although Professional Coin
signed a consent decree with the FTC, the company didn't
admit or deny wrongdoing, or pay any fine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The campaign included a nearly half-page ad in yesterday's
Wall Street Journal.
   "After taking an extensive look at PCGS," the Professional
Coin ad declares, the government "did NOT ask us to change
any of our policies or procedures."
   That's technically true, if one reads only the consent
decree. But FTC lawyers strongly dispute Professional Coin's
claim that the agency, in effect, gave the company a clean
bill of health. Signing a consent decree is standard practice
in settling civil enforcement actions with the government.
But that doesn't change the fact that the FTC had accused the
coin firm of making "numerous" false and misleading claims
about its objectivity, FTC lawyers say.
   Indeed, among other things, the FTC lawsuit said
Professional Coin hadn't provided the "objective or
consistent grading" the company claims and that it did not
"in all cases observe its `strict anti-self interest
policy.'" The consent decree bars Professional Coin from
making false claims in the future.
   Barry J. Cutler, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer
protection in Washington, said: "When PCGS goes around
telling everyone they should take a look at the consent
agreement, I wish they'd take a look at the complaint as
well." Mr. Cutler added that the agency doesn't file a
complaint unless it has "reason to believe the allegations
are true." He said the FTC hasn't asked Professional Coin to
change its new ad.
   David Hall, Professional Coin chief executive officer,
said, "I don't know for a fact that the FTC doesn't like our
ads. They haven't talked to me about it. But we've always
cooperated with the FTC, and certainly our intention is to do
things in the right way."
   The FTC's Mr. Cutler said one good thing is that the
Professional Coin ads, in line with the consent agreement, do
include many more warnings about the volatility of the
rare-coin market than typical coin-company ads of the past.
The important thing, said Mr. Cutler, is that investors and
big Wall Street brokerage firms have been put on notice that
rare-coin investing isn't fail-safe, despite the inroads of
grading services such as Professional Coin.
   "I think we fired a rifle shot, and we got attention where
we want to get attention," said Mr. Cutler.
   Professional Coin says it has graded nearly 2.3 million
coins valued at about $2.5 billion since its founding in
1986.

   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said ratification of a

the company to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection.
   The contract, ratified by the United Steel Workers of
America, calls for a $1.50-an-hour average wage increase,
which equals wage concessions union members took in 1982 and
1983 when Wheeling-Pittsburgh was short of cash because it
was building new facilities.

   The contract also calls for an average 50-cent-an-hour
increase in each of the next three years; a $3,000 signing
bonus; a $500 bonus in 1991; restoration of a service bonus;
a new profit-sharing plan; a 401(k) savings plan;
cost-of-living raises; and 50% payment of health plan
premiums.
   The company, based in Wheeling, W.Va., has been in Chapter
11 bankruptcy-law proceedings since April 15, 1985. Under
Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors while it
works out a reorganization plan.

   To Break the Deadlock, Reclaim Kuwaiti Airspace
   ----

<LP>
   If Saddam Hussein persists in flouting United Nations
demands to return Kuwait to its rightful government, he
should be told that combat aircraft will be allowed to fly in
Kuwaiti airspace only if permitted by the Kuwaiti government.
Preferably the news should come from the Kuwaiti government,
whose right to self defense the U.N. is invoking. Iraqi
combat aircraft on the ground -- fighters on the three
Kuwaiti airfields able to support them, as well as
helicopters -- would be permitted to leave Kuwait under
escort or stay put on the ground. Fighters penetrating from
Iraq would be subject to interception and hot pursuit.
   Blocking Saddam's use of Kuwaiti airspace would accomplish
directly and immediately an important part of the president's
-- and the U.N.'s -- goal of getting Iraq out of the whole of
Kuwait; it would make accomplishing the rest not easy, but
significantly easier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In another measure, Saddam would be told that the Kuwaitis
are retrieving their authority to allow aircraft of friendly
governments to use Kuwaiti airspace. If Iraqi surface-to-air
missiles (SAMs) attack aircraft legitimately using Kuwaiti
airspace, we would disable not only the sites launching the
attack, but all missile sites in Kuwait capable of
interfering with the use of Kuwaiti airspace.
   The measures proposed need not be applied in sequence.
Disabling the SAM launchers used to attack our aircraft might
be necessary in any case in order to enforce the first
measure's injunction against bringing fighters in from Iraq,
and in order to ground Iraqi helicopters based in less
accessible places than the three jet fields close to Saudi
Arabia and the coast. Our dominance of the air over Kuwait
would permit our helicopters to land Kuwaiti resistance
fighters and greatly improve their ability to harass and
hinder the resupply of Iraqi military forces now in Kuwait.
Both measures would increase the pressure on Saddam to get
out of Kuwait and would make his invasion of Saudi Arabia
even harder.
   There is a third measure that can break the deadlock,
worth weighing soberly but urgently. It would involve using
the air blockade to isolate and cut the overland
reinforcement of Iraqi ground forces now concentrated in the
southeast of Kuwait, where they threaten the Saudi oil
fields. The goal would be to cut also their resupply by road.
(The present naval blockade stops the resupply by sea of
Iraqi forces in Kuwait, but only as a byproduct -- less
focused on the military and on Kuwait -- of a wider effort to
stop shipments to all territory controlled by Iraq. We are
not recommending an air blockade now of all Iraq).
   Even more obviously than the naval blockade, which may be
effected outside of Kuwaiti territorial waters -- and which
we wholly support -- these aerial blockades would be an
exercise of the inherent Kuwaiti right of self-defense under
Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. Like the naval blockade, each
of these measures might be achieved without anyone actually
firing a shot; they leave it up to the Iraqis to accept them
-- or face a very high probability that a challenge to them
would fail. In this respect, the measures contrast with our
initiating an invasion on the ground in Kuwait or a strategic
bombing offensive against Iraq.
   Despite the lengthening odds, Saddam might invade Saudi
Arabia and attack our forces there. Then clearly the U.S. and
its partners would want to consider options extending far
beyond reclaiming Kuwaiti airspace. Nor has President Bush
ruled out any military option, including our own initiation
of a ground force invasion at some later date. These measures
focus on Kuwait, but they do not imply that any area of Iraq
will be a sanctuary in a war. Nor do they imply that we would
"escalate" actions gradually in such a war. Nor that in that
war we would aim for less than a decisive destruction of
Iraqi military forces and installations. For now, however, to
reclaim Kuwaiti airspace would go well beyond relying on the
present economic embargo of Iraq; and it would do that
without starting an invasion or a strategic bombing
offensive.
   Each of these measures focuses on combatants rather than
on noncombatants, whether Iraqi civilians or foreign
hostages. (Iraqi pilots flying MiG 23s are unlikely to carry
hostages as passengers.) And the measures focus tightly on
the Iraqi forces now illegally in Kuwait. All three measures
would aim at an important, but much more restricted and
precisely defined, objective than military options like the
vague calls for "carpet bombing" or a barrage of 2,700-pound
shells from the battleship Wisconsin's naval guns, or the
less obviously vague call for us to start at once a strategic
campaign "to deprive Iraq of the industrial and storage
facilities that supply its armed forces."
   The measures we propose are also more feasible -- and
would risk much less -- than a U.S. ground invasion. If the
measures supplement the naval blockade, the pressure is more
likely to wear down Saddam's will to defy the demands of the
large coalition President Bush has so skillfully assembled
before that coalition itself erodes. The larger any
coalition, the less likely it is to last without blurring or
losing its purpose -- here, getting Saddam out
unconditionally in order to show that in the future such
aggression will not pay off.
   Even the first measure, blocking Iraqi military aircraft
from any use of Kuwaiti airspace in peacetime, would
immediately reduce Saddam's ability to invade the major Saudi
oil fields, or to defend the Kuwaiti territory he has seized.
It would be a substantial, not only symbolic, break in the
deadlock. Yet the symbolic aspects in this test of wills and
endurance are entirely relevant.
   The president and his partners in this effort have staked
their credibility and that of their governments on getting
Saddam out of Kuwait unconditionally. Any concession that
Saddam exacts he can paint as a success for his invasion and
a symbolic launching platform for future aggressions.
Saddam's credibility and that of the president are not
mutually compatible. Through his spokesman, Saddam has again
and again talked of humiliating President Bush. Humiliation
is on his mind. These measures -- forcing him without
concessions to give up a critical part of what he has taken
-- are humiliating. They might shorten his political life.
They are designed to do that. Nonetheless, it could be a
long, hard winter.
   In that winter, we should expect a Saddam television show,
not of Iraqi soldiers, but of starving Iraqi and hostage
children. Saddam's care for "pretty children," like a cat's
for a mouse, is lethal. His public diplomacy abounds in
references to body bags. Saddam is not exactly a diplomat in
the mold of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
He is even less like such figures on the American scene as
Ambassador Sol Linowitz, who believes Saddam responded to
diplomacy with "flexibility" when he disgorged the last
residue of what he swallowed by invading Iran. Saddam,
however, was yielding not to Iran's diplomacy but to a U.S.
show of force: He has had to transfer Iraqi forces from his
Iranian border to better the odds we've been piling up to get
him out of Kuwait.
   For all his unlimited ambition, brutality and unyielding
bluster, Saddam has shown in other ways that he will bow to
plainly overwhelming force and the will to use it. He had
issued standing orders to his tanker captains to resist
boarding or be shot. When it was plain they would be boarded,
he told them not to resist.
   He shows signs of increasing awareness of the
vulnerability of his forces in Kuwait. He has already
withdrawn Republican Guards, his most effective ground
forces, and replaced them with members of the People's Army,
lower in morale. He has brought in Soviet SA-2s and SA-3s,
but he appears not to be putting many of his
highest-performance SAMs in Kuwait. He is cutting his losses
in case he is forced out. In short, while digging in, Saddam
seems also poised to get out. But he will leave Kuwait
unconditionally only if it is clear that the coalition
against him can and -- especially -- that it will enforce the
U.N. demand.
   To weaken the coalition's will, Saddam is using Iraqi as
well as foreign women and children to soften the naval
blockade; and as shields to deter strategic bombing as an
alternative to the blockade. He has made it clear that if
medical supplies and food are lacking, women, children and
other noncombatants will suffer. And the first cracks in the
coalition respond to or use that humanitarian concern. China,
India and Iran now talk of sending food and medical supplies.
   In the broadcast of his visit with Western hostages, he
said that Iraqis working in economic and "scientific" (i.e.,
chemical and nuclear) installations live on or near those
installations and "some pretty children, just as pretty as
the children we have here" would be at risk. His purpose is
to make any attack on military installations and combatants
inevitably an attack on noncombatants.
   For that reason, as well as on obvious moral grounds, the
three measures we propose would confine effects as much as
possible to the military forces rather than civilians. A
complete separation from civilians isn't feasible. But there
is a large difference between carpet bombing of military
targets embedded in population centers on the one hand, and,
on the other, intercepting a jet fighter or homing in on the
radiation from a SAM radar with 50 pounds of explosive or
cutting precisely an isolated road used as a supply line to
Iraqi troops in southeast Kuwait.
   Only staffs with the most recent data on the performance
and location of the varied aircraft and missiles arrayed
against each other in Kuwait can speak with any finality on
these matters. We hope that they will test, flesh out and
improve the three measures we outline. However, something
more can be said about the three measures proposed to break
the deadlock.
   First, keeping Iraqi jet fighters from using Kuwaiti
airfields should be possible with minimal danger to our
aircraft, our air crews, or civilian bystanders. These three
airfields are nearly 100 miles from Iraq, but so close to the
Saudi border or to the coast that aircraft flying from these
fields could be destroyed by air-to-air missiles fired from
aircraft that would hardly need themselves to penetrate
Kuwaiti airspace. The coalition now has in the Gulf airborne
warning and control aircraft, including the British Nimrod,
as well as the U.S. E-3 Sentry flown by the Saudis and
Americans, that can stay far back from Kuwait and detect,
identify and track all aircraft flying from these fields --
and from Iraq.
   We have also brought aircraft with air-to-air and
air-to-surface missiles with powerful radar or infrared
sensors, as well as decoys and missiles that can jam or
deceive passive sensors, that can home in on active sensors,
and that can jam communications. We can disable
surface-to-air missiles that would interfere with our
destruction of military helicopters rising from pads close to
Iraq, or our interception of aircraft from Iraq. While the
U.S. has brought in the preponderance of air power now in the
Gulf, in quality and quantity, the British and French have
qualitatively excellent air power and can contribute some
technologically ingenious capabilities that we have
neglected.
   The air power assembled in the Gulf appears able to carry
out the second measure, to gain air dominance by finding and
rendering ineffective essentially all SAMs, even those that
have been moved and are being recalibrated to make them
operational. During testing or operation, radar or radio
emissions would reveal their location. Powerful optical and
infrared sensors on board both aircraft and satellites could
locate them. Stealth aircraft would have a particular
advantage in finding them and destroying them at night. Some
normally accurate missiles would go astray. They would do
some unintended harm. Some aircraft would be lost, but
dominance of the air over Kuwait would permit an even more
precise application of force by the resistance, as well as
from the air.
   The third measure, to reduce reinforcement and supply for
Iraqi forces as a way of inducing them to leave, might be
achieved without Saddam compelling us to spread the harm to a
great many Iraqi and foreign civilians. With the worst will
in the world, Saddam would find it hard to keep live hostages
at all the points we might usefully attack and reattack on
the sparse, desert roadnet needed to resupply the huge army
he has concentrated in southeast Kuwait.
   That army is already reported to be troubled by dysentery,
cholera and other problems associated with sanitation and
food and water supply. Cutting its supply of fuel would
reduce its ability to fight a war. Cutting its supply of
water would make it difficult simply to stay there. We should
tighten the tourniquet as close as possible to the Iraqi
armed forces and as far away as feasible from the
concentration of population in the Al Kuwait metropolitan
area and the thin settlements along the coast. How to beat
Saddam in a contest in which we try to focus effects on
military forces in Kuwait, while he tries to make us hurt
civilians, is the right question to pose to the responsible

   If we're clear enough about the nature of this contest, we
should be able to enforce the reclaiming of Kuwaiti airspace,
even if Saddam challenges it -- and do that with air power
focused discriminately enough on Saddam's military forces to
maintain the coalition's resolve to get Saddam out of the
whole of Kuwait without rewarding his aggression. That would
accomplish part of the president's immediate objective. But
the president intends his immediate objectives to serve
larger interests and goals, which now need clarifying if the
domestic consensus is not to fall apart. The current muddled
debate in the media makes visible some of the potential
cracks.

   In Bid to Boost Value

   CHICAGO -- Bally Manufacturing Corp. said investor Arthur
M. Goldberg has bought a 5.4% stake in the company, and plans
to work with management to boost the value of the casino and
health-club company.
   Mr. Goldberg, who has bought 1,586,300 Bally common shares
for about $15 million through a family partnership, agreed to
limit any future purchases to no more than 15% of Bally's
stock. The Somerset, N.J., investor is chairman, president
and chief executive of Di Giorgio Corp., a food wholesaler
and building-products maker.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Goldberg, who has bought stakes in Bally in the past
and sold them at a profit, said that he invested in Bally
because he considers it undervalued. He wasn't immediately
available for further comment.
   Robert E. Mullane, Bally's chairman, said the company has
agreed to support Mr. Goldberg's election to the board. He
praised Mr. Goldberg's track record, and added that Mr.
Goldberg's partnership will file a 13-D statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Bally's stock, which had been sagging at around $6 a share
in recent weeks, jumped 37.5 cents yesterday, to close at
$7.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
company's stock has eroded substantially over the past year
as the market pummeled casino stocks, and investors feared
Bally's erratic earnings and hefty debt load of $1.8 billion.
   Bally operates four casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., and
Nevada and the nation's largest chain of health clubs. It is
also engaged in gaming equipment and systems, exercise
equipment and lottery products and services. Mr. Mullane had
recently announced plans to lighten Bally's debt load by
trying to sell or spin off the health clubs.
   Analysts said they were uncertain what Mr. Goldberg's role
would be with the company. "It's not clear why anyone would
want to buy into it," said Richard J. Byrne, a high-yield
analyst with Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith who has
been harshly critical of Bally's high leverage and other
problems.

   Collins Foods Agrees to Sell to PepsiCo
   U.S. Kentucky Fried Chicken Outlets

<LP>
   PepsiCo Inc. agreed to buy 209 Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurants from Collins Foods International Inc. in a $122
million stock swap. The move furthers PepsiCo's strategy of
increasing control over the laggard fast-food chain.
   Separately, Collins Foods said its remaining operations --
after the sale of the U.S. Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants
-- will make an exchange offer to Sizzler Restaurants
International Inc. holders to acquire the 34% stake in
Sizzler that Collins doesn't already own.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said the acquisition by Pepsi, which will boost
its Kentucky Fried Chicken unit's ownership of the U.S.
restaurants to 32% from 28%, will improve Pepsi's ability to
revitalize the chain. The purchase will also give the company
more leverage in dealing with sometimes-recalcitrant
franchisees, the analysts added.
   "The fewer franchisees, the better the control," said Roy
Burry, a beverage analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. He said
the move will simplify company plans to swiftly upgrade
restaurants and introduce products. The purchase will also
give the company a bigger operating base, allowing it to reap
greater benefits from national marketing programs.
   Pepsi, the soft-drink, snack-food and restaurant company
based in Purchase, N.Y., will issue about 4.9 million common
shares to Collins's shareholders in the tax-free exchange, at
a ratio of about 0.216 share of PepsiCo common for each
Collins share held.
   Collins, which is based in Los Angeles, said completion of
the transaction is subject to approval by a majority of
Collins holders and various regulatory approvals. Collins
will continue to own and operate 64 Kentucky Fried
restaurants in Queensland, Australia, and will operate or
subfranchise 32 Sizzler restaurants in Australia.
   Pepsi has been eager to shore up the performance of its
lackluster Kentucky Fried Chicken chain, which hasn't fared
nearly as well as the company's Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
operations. One way to have more say over operations is to
own them. While Kentucky Fried Chicken will hold 32% of its
U.S. restaurants, both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell dominate their
chains by owning more than 50% of the outlets.
   In the agreement with Collins, which includes certain real
estate, Kentucky Fried Chicken is buying restaurants in
California, Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Kentucky Fried
Chicken said that for the year ended in April, the Collins's
Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants had average sales of
$620,000 for each restaurant compared with an average of
$608,000 for calendar 1989 at Kentucky Fried Chicken USA.
   Some franchisees were concerned about the sale. "We view
it very cautiously," said Robert Peck, past president of the
chain's franchisees' association. "We're concerned about the
company increasing control over some franchisees if they own
a majority." Mr. Peck said franchisees, who are battling the
company in court over, among other things, proposed terms of
a new contract, worry Kentucky Fried Chicken aims to buy up
all the highly profitable urban restaurants and to leave them
the low-volume rural outlets.
   Christopher R. Thomas, Collins's chief financial officer,
said the Kentucky Fried Chicken operations hadn't been for
sale before Collins received "an extremely attractive offer,"
from Pepsi. Selling the operations also will enable Collins
to focus its human and financial resources on its
faster-growing Sizzler restaurants, Mr. Thomas said.
   Collins's domestic Kentucky Fried Chicken operations
contributed about 23% of the company's $560.7 million in
revenue in fiscal 1990. Sizzler restaurants contributed about
60% of revenue and were "slightly" more profitable than the
Kentucky Fried Chicken stores, Mr. Thomas said. In the year,
the company had net income of $31.5 million, or $1.39 a
share.
   Collins's offer to acquire the 34% stake in Sizzler that
it doesn't already own is contingent upon the completion of
Collins's swap of the Kentucky Fried Chicken operations for
Pepsi stock, among other things. Sizzler expects to offer
1.25 shares of the restructured Collins for each of about 5.5
million Sizzler shares in public hands.
   Mr. Thomas said he couldn't place any value on the Collins
exchange offer. "The idea is to provide (Sizzler
shareholders) with a chance to receive a modest premium to
continue to participate in the business they invested in and
to own a stock that pays a dividend." Collins Foods paid a
dividend of 20 cents a share last year, whereas Sizzler
doesn't pay any dividend.
   Collins is one of Kentucky Fried Chicken's largest and
oldest franchisees. Collins's founder and chairman, James A.
Collins, started serving Kentucky Fried Chicken in his
hamburger restaurants about 30 years ago after meeting the
fried-chicken chain's founder Colonel Harland Sanders.

   PITTSBURGH -- H.J. Heinz Co. said it expects fiscal 1991
net income to be about $2.10 a share, up about 11% over last
year's $1.90 a share but a smaller gain than seen in recent
years at the food company.
   Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, Heinz chairman, president and
chief executive officer, said at the annual meeting that the
company has felt pressure in recent months in its pet food
and Weight Watchers brand low-calorie foods.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Its 9-Lives cat food brand has been hit by more
competition following Alpo Petfoods Inc.'s entrance into the
category. Alpo has gained 10% of that market, Mr. O'Reilly
said.
   Heinz said it plans to boost its Weight Watchers business
with a test market of a weight-loss plan that offers personal
counseling instead of traditional group sessions.
   Mr. O'Reilly said international markets continue to
expand, with affiliates in Africa and the Pacific Rim showing
improved profits. Heinz plans to double the capacity at its
baby food plant in China in the next few months, he said.
   Heinz said it has seen only marginal improvement in its
domestic tuna market; increased harvests of tuna have pushed
retail prices down, despite earlier projections that buying
from new sources could increase costs. Heinz has launched a
new advertising campaign promoting the company's decision in
April to stop buying tuna captured along with dolphins, Mr.
O'Reilly said.
   Also, company shareholders approved a stock option plan
for key employees, including a provision that gives Mr.
O'Reilly options to buy four million shares of Heinz stock.
The stock plan was part of Mr. O'Reilly's new five-year
contract with Heinz.

   MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev forcefully
backed a sweeping plan to create a market economy within just
18 months, despite strong warnings from Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov that this would lead to a drastic fall in
living standards and soaring inflation.
   Mr. Gorbachev's remarks at a session of the Soviet
Parliament, after weeks of behind-the-scenes debate, seemed
to ensure that the radical proposals drafted by economist
Stanislav Shatalin have won out over Mr. Ryzhkov's more
cautious package.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gorbachev told Parliament that, "I am more impressed
by the Shatalin program. It brings together the republics on
the basis of what we need." Mr. Ryzhkov, who has faithfully
carried out most of Mr. Gorbachev's orders since he became
prime minister in 1985, appeared stunned.
   Although stopping short of criticizing the Soviet leader,
Mr. Ryzhkov told journalists that Mr. Gorbachev had never
told him so clearly about his preference for the rival plan.
"I heard this for the first time myself" at the Parliament
session, he said. He hinted strongly to journalists that he
would resign rather than preside over implementation of the
Shatalin plan.
   A few hours later, the Parliament of the Russian republic
overwhelmingly endorsed the so-called Shatalin proposals by a
213-1 vote, and urged other republics to follow suit. Most
seem likely to do so.
   Mr. Gorbachev initially hoped that elements of both the
Shatalin and Ryzhkov plans could be combined into one
coherent whole. But the man charged with fusing them,
economist Abel Aganbegyan, said yesterday that the two plans
are incompatible, and attempts to find a compromise have
failed.
   Mr. Ryzhkov and his government have worked on their
economic package for about a year, but their timid attempts
to introduce a market-oriented reform have caused growing
exasperation. Last month, Mr. Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin,
the president of the Russian republic, asked Mr. Shatalin to
head a committee charged with devising an alternative.
   Mr. Gorbachev is now expected to outline the definitive
draft version to Parliament today, and Mr. Shatalin says he
expects "it will be 99% my plan."
   A final decision on the reform package is due to be taken
by the Soviet Parliament later this month after the nation's
15 republics have discussed it. If approved, it is expected
to form the basis of a new union treaty between the republics
and Moscow, which Mr. Gorbachev hopes to finalize by the end
of this year.
   Both Mr. Ryzhkov and Mr. Shatalin agree that the Soviet
economy's rapid slide and shortages of basic goods can only
be halted by measures to end decades of central planning and
create a market economy.
   They both advocate an initial period of "stabilization,"
followed by large-scale measures to sell off state assets.
They also agree on the need to set up social protection
measures, such as unemployment insurance.
   But the two sets of proposals are far apart on several key
issues, both in concept and detail. Mr. Shatalin's package,
which would be implemented over 500 days, advocates strict
fiscal and monetary discipline, the introduction of private
ownership of property on a wide scale and the
decentralization of virtually all government functions.
   During a six-month stabilization program, it would seek to
mop up many of the billions of rubles in circulation and cut
the 60 billion ruble ($100 billion) budget deficit to zero
through public sales of land and housing. Then, over the
course of the following year, Mr. Shatalin would sell off
state assets, delegate responsibility for key economic
affairs such as taxation and foreign investment to the 15
republics, cut government subsidies and free up prices on all
but about 150 essential items.
   His concept would underlie the planned new union treaty by
establishing a committee of republican leaders, who would
decide what economic powers to give to central government.
The republics would have to allocate money for the functions
they delegate to the central government out of their own
budgets.
   Mr. Ryzhkov told Parliament yesterday that he has several
principal objections to such plans. Delegating all economic
responsibility to republics, particularly for taxes, budgets
and banking, would mean nothing short of the breakup of the
Soviet Union, he said. "Will there be a united state or not?
Now it is called the U.S.S.R. What will it be called in the
future?" the prime minister asked.
   He advocates keeping some central government control over
the economy, particularly during a difficult transition
period in which the budget deficit would be reduced, but not
wiped out. Companies would pay part of their taxes to a
central budget and the government would run some strategic
industries such as telecommunications, energy and heavy
industry as before, with continued planning by Moscow
bureaucrats. He would also keep tight government controls on
the nation's agricultural sector during an interim period,
and contends that Mr. Shatalin's plan would quickly bankrupt
one in four Soviet farms.
   On the key issue of prices, Mr. Ryzhkov rejects outright
Mr. Shatalin's proposals to allow most prices to be set by
supply and demand. Although he agrees the topsy-turvy Soviet
pricing system needs reform, he estimates Mr. Shatalin's
plans would cause a 30% drop in living standards and soaring
inflation such as that plaguing Yugoslavia.
   Mr. Ryzhkov and his advisers instead want to raise prices
on nonessential consumer goods next year to new
government-set levels. Starting in 1992, the Kremlin would
then gradually allow prices to float. But first, Mr. Ryzhkov
insists, some strict antitrust laws must be implemented that
would break up the nation's huge industrial monopolies, or at
least prevent them from raising prices at will. At the same
time, the government would pay some compensation to consumers
to offset the effects of price rises.
   "It's a dangerous thing to let go of prices," he said. "It
would lead to inflation that would be hard to stop."

   Business as Usual

   Salzburg, Austria -- It was business as usual at the 1990
Salzburg Festival, which came to an end last month. Conductor
Herbert von Karajan, who for three decades directed the
festival like an absolute monarch, died more than a year ago,
but his influence seems as omnipresent as ever -- at least
for now.
   When Karajan took over the festival in 1960, Salzburg had
long been the world's most prestigious musical showcase.
Thereafter it became in addition an obligatory part of the
international social whirl. After the conductor's death in
July 1989, word went out from the gossip columnists that
"nobody was going to Salzburg any longer." Nevertheless, this
year's festival was full of familiar types -- Austrian
nobles, German industrialists, French fashion designers.
There was even a sampling of affluent Americans, though the
depressed state of the dollar seemed to have thinned their
ranks somewhat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Money is an important consideration at Salzburg, where the
top price for opera tickets now is $330, and for orchestral
tickets $170. Jet-setters clearly find the expense
worthwhile. Even without the glamour conferred by Karajan's
presence, Salzburg continues to be one of the most
advantageous places in which to be seen, photographed and
gossipped about.
   Some music lovers also obviously find the place good value
-- since 1960 the festival has pitched its appeal to those
whose tastes run to standard works performed by brand-name
artists. Those seeking stimulation rather than reassurance no
doubt betake themselves to a different kind of festival.
   Not that the Salzburg program has ever been entirely
predictable. This year, for example, along with popular items
such as "Don Giovanni" and "Un Ballo in Maschera," the
schedule included a cycle of four concert-operas on the
subject of Orpheus by Monteverdi, Haydn, Ernst Krenek and
Gluck, only the last of which is a repertory work.
Nevertheless, most of the offerings were thrice familiar,
especially in the field of symphonic music. Had it not been
for the Kronos Quartet's brave concert featuring pieces by
contemporary composers, the chamber-music programs would have
been equally unchallenging.
   Every so often, of course, the familiar can prove
thrilling, especially in the hands of an artist more
dedicated to the composer than to self-advertisement. Take
the recital by Christa Ludwig. From a group of well-loved
songs by Schumann and Brahms, the mezzo soprano and her
sensitive accompanist, Charles Spencer, created a series of
memorable revelations about the diversity of human nature.
Fusing poetry and sound with a mastery equalled by no other
interpreter of lieder today, Ms. Ludwig was by turns
dramatic, witty, charming, dreamily introspective, soaringly
lyrical. At the age of 60, this great artist, who combines
profound interpretive insight with extraordinary vocal
warmth, is at the very peak of her powers, displaying a
spontaneity that renews the impact of everything she sings.
   For the most part, though, the musicmaking was less
searching. Sometimes, indeed, it was surprisingly slack and
sentimental, such as Claudio Abbado's performance of
Bruckner's Fourth Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic. More
often it was simply slick, such as Sir Georg Solti's reading
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the same orchestra.
Sentimentality is hardly a charge one could level against Sir
Georg. Neither is interpretive commitment. For many years
now, the conductor has evinced more interest in creating an
effect of high-powered nervous tension than in achieving
interpretive insight.
   In the latter respect, at any rate, he is the natural
successor to Karajan, whose astounding proficiency as a
master of orchestral sound was unaccompanied by any sense of
ulterior musical purpose. It's hardly surprising that when
Karajan died shortly before the opening of last year's
festival, Sir Georg agreed to save the day by assuming the
great man's obligations. A household name and a prolific
recording artist, Sir Georg has helped to perpetuate the
conviction that only a glamorous star conductor can ensure
the continued success of Salzburg.
   As he demonstrated by taking over Karajan's 1989
production of "Un Ballo in Maschera," he fits right into the
Salzburg mold. A typical Grammy Award winner, Sir Georg in
"Un Ballo in Maschera" alternated between blandness and
hysteria, the former allowing the audience to relax, the
latter -- which usually manifested itself at the end of a
scene -- to sit up and clap vociferously.
   Riccardo Muti, who took over Karajan's 1987 "Don
Giovanni," achieved more solid musical results than Karajan
had ever done. Though hindered by Michael Hampe's lifeless
production and by his own uncertain taste in singers, Mr.
Muti nonetheless interpreted the opera as a drama of weight
and substance, and not as a sequence of pretty numbers.
   That something more genuine can manifest itself in
Salzburg was demonstrated by the San Francisco Symphony,
which after a checkered history has recently achieved world
status under the Swedish-American conductor, Herbert
Blomstedt. In Bruckner's Fifth Symphony, Mr. Blomstedt
offered an instructive contrast to Mr. Abbado's reading of
the same composer's Fourth Symphony two days before. While
the Viennese emphasized emotionality at the expense of
accuracy and structure, the San Franciscan found an excellent
balance between precision and feeling. The American orchestra
may not be able to summon forth the sheer tonal beauty of its
Viennese counterpart, but it offered the more satisfying
artistic results.
   The changes that are imminent under the festival's
director-designate, Gerard Mortier, will in all likelihood
affect more than music. Salzburg, which has little or no art
of world quality to offer the festival public, may be one of
several venues to display selections from the collection of
New York's Guggenheim Museum. Plans still are tentative, but
Austrian architect Hans Hollein already has designed a
building which, like the two festival opera houses, would be
carved out of the mountain that dominates the city. Sketches,
plans, even a model, were on view at the Residenz Gallery
here, along with a group of 40 works from the Guggenheim by
Chagall, Delaunay, Kandinsky, Leger, Marc and Picasso. As
with all of the many brainchildren of Guggenheim director
Thomas Krens, sources of funding are still uncertain. But
even without a great art collection for its magic mountain,
Salzburg's music festival seems destined to pass through
profound change in short order.

   NEW YORK -- Nearly two-thirds of U.S. companies that
export are optimistic about gaining higher overseas sales in
the next 12 months, a survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. shows.
   In June, the financial data and services concern
interviewed 5,000 of the nation's largest export companies.
According to the survey, 64% of the firms expect their sales
to increase, 33% expect sales to remain unchanged and 3%
predict a decline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among the firms with high expectations, 71% said they
expect to increase exports to Western Europe, 52% to Japan
and almost 30% predicted that they plan to boost exports to
Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union.
   Joseph W. Duncan, D&amp;B corporate economist and chief
statistician, said it appears from the survey that the
increase will come only from companies that already are
exporting. That trend "implies that if the export boom is to
continue, long-term policies are needed to encourage
nonexporters to participate in international trade," he said.
   D&amp;B said an earlier survey accurately predicted that 1989
exports would be weak compared with 1988.

She, not Ruth Thorpe, must be the oldest.
   She has been an ACBL member for 35 years and became a Life

   New York Challenges RTC's Bid
   To Oust Renters at Seized Building

   New York's attorney general challenged an effort by the
federal thrift-bailout agency to evict eight renters from a
Manhattan condominium building seized by the government from
an insolvent savings and loan.
   In a strongly worded letter to Resolution Trust Corp.'s
executive director, David C. Cooke, state Attorney General
Robert Abrams said the tenants were entitled under the
state's rent control and stabilization laws to occupy the
apartments for as long as they wished.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The RTC said that the New York case is the first case in
which they have sought evictions, but that the agency was
prepared to do so whenever it was necessary to minimize
losses to U.S. taxpayers.
   The federal government is receiving roughly $9,000 per
month from the midtown apartments, while they are costing the
government about $27,000 per month, according to RTC
spokesman Stephen Katsanos.
   "Public protection shouldn't include throwing people out
of their homes," countered Richard Barr, a spokesman for the
attorney general.
   In August the RTC informed the eight tenants that the 1989
legislation creating the bailout agency gave the government
the right to repudiate their leases. The RTC then offered to
sell the apartments to the tenants.
   The apartments in question were foreclosed on by Nassau
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association when the developer who
converted them into condominiums defaulted on his loan. The
RTC was appointed receiver of the thrift last March.
   In his letter, Mr. Abrams said that New York's Martin Act
bars owners from evicting renters when buildings are
converted to condominiums.
   "RTC should not reap windfall profits by transforming
occupied residential apartments into more valuable vacant
apartments by the draconian measure of evicting the
longstanding tenants of those apartments in violation of New
York law," Abrams wrote.
   Although the attorney general suggested that government
should sell the condominiums as occupied units, the market
for such units was nearly wiped out by the Tax Reform Act of
1986.
   John Jeffries Jr., a professor of constitutional law at
Virginia School of Law, said that although federal law
overrides state law, it is arguable whether Congress intended
to give the RTC the right to take such action.
   Mr. Abrams's office said that it hopes to persuade the RTC
to reverse its action, but that it was up to the tenants
involved to challenge the action in court.
   "No judge in New York is going to allow this," predicted
Errol Brett of New York's Schwartzseld, Ganfer &amp; Shore, which
represents hundreds of tenants associations. "The {federal}
statute doesn't apply to such situations at all."

   INSURERS' TACTICS condemned by judge in toxic-waste
liability dispute.
   Investigators working on behalf of insurance companies
misled former employees of Monsanto Co. about the
investigators' identities and purposes, a state judge in
Delaware ruled.
   In the continuing litigation, the insurers argue that they
aren't liable for certain cleanup costs incurred by Monsanto,
a St. Louis chemicals company. The investigators were seeking
any information about Monsanto's operating practices that
might prove damaging to the company.
   Judge Vincent J. Poppiti ordered Travelers Corp., one of
Monsanto's primary insurers, based in Hartford, Conn., to
provide Monsanto with any former employees' statements
obtained by investigators. He said that evidence won't be
admissible at trial, scheduled to begin in September 1992.
Judge Poppiti didn't specifically blame Travelers for the
alleged misrepresentation.
   The judge also provided a script to be used by
investigators and lawyers when they initiate future
interviews of former Monsanto employees. Among other things,
the script requires the investigators to make clear that
Monsanto and the insurers are in litigation.
   Such high-stakes battles are increasingly common between
companies and their insurers over who should pay for the
burgeoning cost of cleaning up toxic waste allegedly released
by the companies. And insurers believe that interviews with
former employees can be effective in exposing wrongdoing by
the companies that might release the insurers from any
obligation to pay.
   In the Monsanto case, Judge Poppiti noted affidavits by
the former employees stating that, in some instances, the
investigators didn't disclose they represented the insurers.
For example, one former Monsanto employee was allegedly told
that an investigator "worked for a firm in New Orleans which
had been commissioned by the chemical industry to look into
which companies were polluting," according to the judge's
opinion. Two others were allegedly told that investigators
were "compiling a book" about a company plant, the judge
wrote.
   The judge acknowledged that some statements by the former
employees were contradicted by the affidavits of
investigators, but he still found evidence to conclude that
former employees were misled.
   The judge used strong language to condemn any dissembling.
"There is no vice that doth so cover a man with shame as to
be found false and perfidious," he wrote, quoting the
17th-century philosopher Francis Bacon.
   His order doesn't specify individual blame for
misrepresentation among the three dozen or so insurance
companies named by Monsanto as defendants, their outside
lawyers and independent investigators. It wasn't immediately
clear who, if anyone, coordinated the investigators' work.
   Travelers said in a statement that it didn't supervise the
investigators, nor did Travelers' outside lawyers supervise
them. Travelers also said it believes "parties to the case
will seek to clarify this point with the court."
   Judge Poppiti said the lawyers are accountable for the
investigators they retained, and he ordered the lawyers, not
their clients, to pay certain court costs of Monsanto.

   DRUG-CASE DEFENDANTS could lose federal benefits under new
rules.
   People convicted of drug-related crimes, including
possession, may be denied such federal benefits as student
financial aid and small-business loans under sentencing
regulations that took effect yesterday.
   The main purpose of the policy, which Congress mandated in
November 1988, is to provide judges with the authority to
impose sanctions less severe than incarceration in an effort
to deter illegal drug use. Inhibited by crowded prisons and
court dockets, judges rarely sentence people to jail for the
crime of possessing illegal drugs, as opposed to selling
them.
   The new authority applies to both federal and state
judges, who will have broad discretion to deny hundreds of
types of federal benefits. Other benefits that could be
withheld include Federal Communications Commission licenses
and access to various federally run training programs. A
number of major federal programs aren't covered by the
policy, including Social Security, health, disability and
veterans' benefits. The policy provides for eventual
restoration of denied benefits to people who successfully
complete drug-rehabilitation programs.
   Many of the benefits that judges may deny are enjoyed
primarily by people in middle- or upper-income brackets. But
the White House drug czar, William Bennett, noted at a news
conference in Washington that the federal government
subsidizes roughly three million student loans and said, "You
are talking about real impact here." A central thrust of Mr.
Bennett's anti-drug strategy is to toughen punishment of what
he calls "casual" drug use.
   Kevin Zeese, a drug-case defense lawyer in Virginia,
criticized the new form of punishment as "a policy based on
desperation . . . because the prisons and jails are so
overcrowded."
   The new sanctions apply to people convicted after Sept. 1,
1989, for crimes committed on or after Nov. 18, 1988.

   TOBACCO-LIABILITY RULINGS appealed by plaintiff in
American Tobacco case.
   In March, a federal jury in Boston cleared American
Tobacco Co. of liability in the death of Joanne Kotler's
husband, George, who had begun smoking at age 11 and died in
1986 at the age of 55. Stock analysts have said that the jury
verdict in that case helped lift the cloud of liability suits
from the tobacco industry.
   In her appeal, lawyers for Mrs. Kotler asked a federal
appeals court to overturn court rulings that eliminated two
other tobacco companies, Liggett Group Inc. and Philip Morris
Cos., from the original suit.
   They also asked the court to re-examine whether Congress
meant cigarette-pack warnings to protect tobacco companies
from product-liability lawsuits and whether a jury should be
allowed to determine whether cigarettes are a defective
product or present a risk that outweighs smoking's "social
utility."

   WASHINGTON -- Citing figures showing that taxpayer
subsidies to Dallas-based Bluebonnet Savings Bank are
considerably higher than the original estimate, Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) urged that the federal government
renegotiate its 1988 sale of the thrift.
   Sen. Metzenbaum said documents obtained from lawyers for
Bluebonnet show government payments to the savings and loan
association will total $573 million for this year. At the
time of the sale, federal regulators estimated that the
figure would be roughly $361 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1988, Arizona insurance executive James Fail purchased
15 insolvent thrifts held by the government and merged them
to create Bluebonnet. The deal has attracted considerable
attention because it included substantial federal subsidies
to the ailing thrifts and because Mr. Fail acquired the
thrifts with the help of Robert Thompson, a Washington
lobbyist with ties to the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   Mr. Thompson appeared yesterday before a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee headed by Sen. Metzenbaum. The lobbyist, who
served as a 1980 campaign aide to George Bush and
subsequently as a special assistant to President Reagan, was
sharply criticized for allegedly peddling access to
administration officials. He answered that his expertise was
in "the process" of government and charged, "One of the
reasons I'm here (before the subcommittee) is that I used to
work for George Bush."
   The hearing provided a vivid glimpse into the world of
Washington lobbying. Mr. Thompson testified that in addition
to a monthly retainer of $15,000 to $20,000, Mr. Fail agreed
to pay him, for assistance with federal regulators, a
$160,000 bonus and 2% of Mr. Fail's earnings from Bluebonnet.
Citing documents from Mr. Thompson and others, however, Sen.
Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) said it appeared that Mr. Thompson
had been promised 2% of the entire $96 million transaction,
or nearly $2 million.
   Thus far, Mr. Thompson has received only the monthly
retainer from Mr. Fail, according to his attorney, Stanley
Brand.
   At the hearing, Sen. Metzenbaum said that the subcommittee
originally placed the overall cost to the government of Mr.
Fail's purchase of Bluebonnet at $1.8 billion. Last month,
that figure was revised to $3 billion. And now, the senator
said, "All bets are off with respect to the ultimate federal
financing of the Bluebonnet fiasco."
   But according to Mary Creedon, associate director of
savings and loan insurance operations at the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., the new figure didn't necessarily mean that
Bluebonnet's cost to the government was growing. Rather, she
said, the second figure included accrued interest on the sum
and the first figure didn't.

   In the search by Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A.,
Spain's troubled state-owned truck maker, to find a foreign
partner, Spanish hopes are growing that Daimler-Benz AG of
West Germany will acquire an 80% stake in Enasa.
   Spanish officials said they are optimistic an accord with
Daimler can be announced soon. A previous plan for Daimler to
acquire Enasa jointly with MAN AG of West Germany foundered
on competition objections by Bonn's cartel office. People
familiar with the Daimler talks said West Germany has said it
wouldn't object to Enasa's takeover by Daimler alone.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the negotiations, points under discussion include
government aid to Enasa. Daimler has asked for subsidies of
more than 60 billion pesetas ($603 million) in return for
taking over Enasa, which so far this year has had losses of
about seven billion pesetas. Spain earlier rejected the
subsidy sum as too high, as well as Daimler proposals for
sharp cuts in Enasa's work force to about 4,700 from 5,700.
Spain hopes for a takeover pact guaranteeing no layoffs, to
win union agreement.

   Dollar Bounces Back Against the Yen
   As Traders Seek Arbitrage Opportunities

   NEW YORK -- The dollar bounced back against the yen,
partly on technical buying and partly because Japanese
investors eased up on their yen purchases.
   The dollar had fallen below 140 yen Monday on a big move
by Japanese institutions to convert their foreign-currency
profits into yen. The move was part of an attempt by the
institutions to dress up their balance sheets before their
fiscal first half closes Sept. 30.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But this pressure slackened yesterday, even as buying by
investors searching for arbitrage profits propped up the
dollar.
   The yen's fall allowed profit-takers to step into the yen
cross market in late North American trading to buy back
recently sold currencies, such as the mark and the pound.
   This cross trading gave the dollar an additional lift
against the yen but took back some of the greenback's earlier
gains against European currencies. Cross trading helps the
dollar because the U.S. currency often serves as a medium for
transactions in other currencies. For example, investors
trading marks for yen will often pass through dollars to take
advantage of the broader dollar market.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
140.30 yen, up from 139.55 yen late Monday in New York. The
currency was also changing hands at 1.5855 marks, up from
1.5820 marks in New York late Monday. Sterling was trading at
$1.8580, up from $1.8575.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 139.10 yen, down from 139.85 yen at the close there
Tuesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5900 marks, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.5828 marks.
   The mark rose to 88.489 yen from 88.211 yen previously,
while the pound gained to 260.68 yen from 259.21 yen.
   Receiving some of the strongest support from profit-takers
was the Canadian dollar, which climbed to 86.12 U.S. cents
from 85.71 cents.
   The technical buying that gave the dollar its initial lift
had its origins in the currency's New York close above 1.58
marks Monday, according to Jerry Egan, Bank of Boston's chief
dealer. Technicians had predicted that such a closing quote
would indicate enough positive sentiment to take the dollar
to 1.61 marks.
   Added to this was significant dollar buying by Kuwaitis
and Saudis, as well as Malaysia's Bank Negara, traders said.
   But there was a brief dollar sell-off in the late New York
morning that carved half a pfennig and half a yen from the
dollar. Many traders pointed to a report that ran across
newswires about 10 a.m. in New York, in which the U.S.
General Accounting Office warned Congress that "35 large
banks . . . are likely to fail or require assistance within
the next year."
   That, the congressional watchdog agency estimated, would
cost the already-strapped Bank Insurance Fund between $4.4
billion and $6.3 billion.
   But Mr. Egan said currency dealers soon realized that the
news headline gave a false impression of the seriousness of
the report. For one thing, the phrase, "35 large banks," was
misinterpreted as the 35 largest banks in the U.S.
   The dollar recovered its losses in little over an hour.
   Also providing an excuse to sell dollars before noon in
New York was a rumor, seemingly confined to U.S. markets,
that the Bundesbank would defend the dollar's 1.6 mark level
in order to hold down the price of imported oil, which is
denominated in dollars.
   But the mark came under pressure as Bonn agreed late
yesterday to pay about 12 billion marks to the Soviet Union
to help finance the move over the next four years of the
370,000 Soviet troops stationed in East Germany. That news
follows reports that the unification and reconstruction of
East Germany will require a total of some 1.2 trillion marks
over the next five years. On top of that are demands that
West Germany contribute to the multinational force in the
Middle East.
   In London, the dollar ended firm. However, it fell back
late in the day from its higher levels earlier, as traders
trimmed long-dollar positions.
   In Tokyo, the dollar ended higher Tuesday, boosted by a
correction against the yen. The U.S. currency closed at
139.85 yen, above 139.43 yen late Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $380.50 an ounce, up $1.90. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $382.55 an
ounce.

   Technology:
   Fujitsu Ltd. to Sell
   Fault-Tolerant
   Line of Computers

   TOKYO -- Japan's largest computer maker is jumping into a
small but growing market currently dominated by two American
companies.
   Fujitsu Ltd. announced it will start selling so-called
fault-tolerant computers, which keep running even if a part
fails. Such machines have spread rapidly among financial
firms, and are catching on for broader on-line systems, such
as airline-reservations networks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tadashi Sekizawa, Fujitsu's president, said at a news
conference that it's crucial for the company to enter this
market if it's to be a "total systems supplier."
   Although the company will initially target mainly Japan
and other Pacific Rim countries, the move has significance
for the American computer industry. The rapid growth in Japan
of Tandem Computers Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., and Stratus
Computer Inc. of Marlboro, Mass. -- the fault-tolerant
industry leaders -- is often cited as a rare illustration of
successful foreign penetration in a market that tends to
favor home-grown technologies.
   Tandem's annual Japanese revenue, for example, has grown
nearly sixfold in five years to 20 billion yen ($143.5
million) in the fiscal year ending this month. Its Japan
operations now make up just under 10% of the company's total
sales.
   Now that an established Japanese company is offering a
competing product, that growth could slow down. "Fujitsu
maintains big customers in key industries such as banking,
distribution, and manufacturing," said Yuji Ogino, managing
director of International Data Corp.'s Tokyo office. "Fujitsu
will definitely grab the lion's share."
   Shares of both Tandem and Stratus were hard hit yesterday.
Tandem stock tumbled $2.125 to close at $11.50, while Stratus
fell $1 to close at $15.625, both in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
   Spokesmen for both Hitachi Ltd. and NEC Corp. -- Japan's
two largest mainframe computer companies -- said they are
also seriously considering offering competing products soon.
   The U.S. market is similarly getting more competitive,
with both Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
recently announcing entries.
   Tandem officials, for their part, say they aren't worried.
"This product will not make any impact on our market," Hajime
Takayanagi, president of Tandem's Japan subsidiary, said in
an interview, adding that he didn't think Fujitsu was aiming
for the same market segment. Besides, he said, "if the
Fujitsu customers will become aware of the needs of
fault-tolerant computers, it means this will create a market,
and that's very good for us."
   The Japanese market for such fail-safe computers hasn't
grown as quickly as the U.S.'s. The Japanese computer market
is considered less developed and slower to adopt innovations.
The market is also marked by deep discounting, so users often
resort to buying full backup computers, rather than the more
efficient fault-tolerant machines, which have redundant
parts.
   But Japanese companies are now catching on. Mr. Ogino
estimates the market will likely grow 20% to 30% annually in
the next few years. The world-wide market is estimated to be
about $2.5 billion, and expected to double in four years.

   Weighs Selling Shares
   In Bank of California

   TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., hungry for fresh capital,
is thinking of selling stock in its Bank of California
subsidiary.
   The giant Japanese bank -- the world's fourth biggest,
with $357 billion in assets -- is considering a private
placement of new shares in its wholly owned subsidiary as a
way of meeting stringent international capital-adequacy
requirements, according to Kyota Ohmori, general manager of
Mitsubishi's planning department.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It is one of the alternatives we are considering now,"
Mr. Ohmori said in an interview.
   San Francisco-based Bank of California has been owned by
Mitsubishi since 1984, when the Japanese bank bought it for
$284 million. It is the sixth-largest bank in the state,
Mitsubishi said, with assets of about $8 billion. It operates
in Oregon and Washington as well.
   Trying to raise capital by selling stock in Bank of
California would mark an intensification of the aggressive
competition for fresh money among Japanese banks. Under rules
drafted two years ago by the Bank for International
Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, major international banks
will be required by their governments to keep capital on hand
equivalent to roughly 8% of their assets. That means, for
every $100 a bank lends, it must keep $8 on hand.
   Until last year, Japan's huge banks assumed they could
easily meet the new capital-adequacy ratios, which come into
effect in early 1993. But they had counted on using as
capital some of their vast holdings of stock in client
companies. A collapse on Japan's stock market this year has
erased a third of share value, though, reducing those
holdings and making it difficult for banks to raise capital
more conventionally through the stock market. As a result,
banks are scrambling for other ways to find capital.
   Over the past two weeks, seven Japanese banks, including
Mitsubishi, have announced plans to raise capital by issuing
subordinated debt, which can be used as capital under the BIS
rules.
   Selling stock in Bank of California is another way to
increase the bank's dollar-denominated capital base, Mr.
Ohmori said. Because Bank of California is a subsidiary, its
capital counts as part of Mitsubishi Bank's consolidated
capital base. Even though Mr. Ohmori said the amount the bank
would raise might be small, "it's better than nothing."

   Compaq Computer Corp. reduced by up to 20% the suggested
retail prices for several of its desktop personal computers.
   The computer retailer, based in Houston, reduced the
suggested price of the Deskpro 386/25e Model 120 from $8,499
to $6,999, the 386s Model 1 from $2,799 to $2,499, and the
286n Model 40 from $2,599 to $2,399. Compaq also lowered
prices of more than a dozen other 386 models.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It said the reductions would allow it to take advantage of
fourth-quarter market growth and accelerated movement toward
386-based and 386sx-based personal computers.
   Compaq's president, Joseph R. Canion, noted that Compaq
needed to keep its prices in line with its major competitor,
International Business Machines Corp.
   Compaq was able to reduce prices because of price cuts in
such parts as microprocessors and disk drives.
   The company also reduced by about 25% the price of nine
memory options for its computers.

   To Back Bond Sale

   PHILADELPHIA -- Swiss Bank Corp. has agreed to guarantee
about $50 million of the $375 million in short-term bonds the
city of Philadelphia wants to sell to postpone its cash-flow
crisis.
   But without other banks backing a substantial portion of
the debt, the city will probably be forced to offer a premium
interest rate to investors if it prices the notes today as
scheduled, said City Controller Jonathan A. Saidel. "It could
be 9%," Mr. Saidel said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Worse, the city might not be able to sell the notes at
all, as was the case last month when the city first intended
to float the issue, originally for $450 million. With
Philadelphia facing a $206.4 million budget deficit for the
current fiscal year, investors were apparently concerned that
the city will not be able to repay the notes.
   If Philadelphia cannot sell the notes, officials say, it
will be able to stretch out its operating cash to December --
at best. Even with the note sale, the city says it will run
out of cash a month or two before the fiscal year ends June
30.
   A spokeswoman said that Mayor W. Wilson Goode and his
administration would not comment on the note sale, continuing
a pattern of reticence on the city's financial crisis.
   But Mr. Saidel, the city's elected chief auditor, said
that so far Swiss Bank, based in Basel, Switzerland, is the
only bank willing to guarantee part of the notes. Officials
are also talking with the Union Bank of Switzerland and
National Westminster Bank of London, he said.
   "The local banks all said no," Mr. Saidel said.
Philadelphia-based CoreStates Financial Corp. and
Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank Corp. declined to comment, but
Philadelphia-based Meridian Bancorp confirmed that it
declined to guarantee any of the notes.
   "We cannot reconcile the associated risk with our
responsibility to shareholders," a Meridian spokeswoman said.
   Merrill Lynch, lead underwriter of the offering, said that
the city would go ahead and sell the notes with or without
additional lines of credit. "The note sale is going to
proceed as planned," said William James, manager of municipal
trading operations at the brokerage firm. "The mix is part of
the marketing process."
   Mayor Goode told residents last month that he would seek
$150 million in emergency tax increases to alleviate the
crisis, but state legislators are balking at granting
Philadelphia permission to do so. The mayor is also
considering selling such city assets as parking garages and a
sports stadium.
   Mr. Saidel, an outspoken critic of the borrowing plan,
said he would prefer that city and state officials deal with
the problem now. "Eventually, they're going to wind up with
the same debt," he said. "I think they have to face their
responsibilities today." Although Mr. Saidel cannot block the
sale, his opposition may contribute to investor reluctance to
purchase the notes.
   According to preliminary offering documents, the
short-term bonds will be divided into two classes: unsecured
notes and notes secured by a bank's letter of credit.

   Food Prices Likely to Get a Double Dose
   Of Inflation From Gulf Crisis, U.S. Says

AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT (AGD)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department warned U.S.
consumers to brace themselves for a double jolt of food-price
inflation this year and next because of the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Energy-price increases stemming from war jitters and the
international embargo against Iraq already are beginning to
drive up costs of growing, processing and distributing food,
the department said. Most of the oil-price shock in the food
sector, however, is expected to be felt in the first half of
1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Department analysts said they expect food prices to
average 5% to 7% higher this year than in 1989, a two
percentage-point jump from the department's December 1989
prediction. The increase reflects not only the economic
repercussions of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait but also
unrelated double-digit price increases on fresh fruit, pork,
eggs and dairy products in the first half of 1990. Last year,
food prices climbed 5.8%, the sharpest increase since 1981.
   The food-inflation forecast for 1991 won't be issued until
November, but department analysts projected that oil prices
alone will boost food prices 1% to 2% next year, primarily
through higher transportation costs. However, they added that
a further economic slowdown would relieve some of the upward
pressure on food prices.
   At the same time, problems are brewing in the Farm Belt.
Department analysts project a $1.7 billion jump in farm
production costs if crude oil prices remain at $30 a barrel
through 1991, and a $2.6 billion jump if oil hits $40 a
barrel. Although farmers could find some savings by changing
their production practices, net farm income is likely to drop
in 1991, they said.
   The department hasn't yet issued its farm-income forecast
for next year. For this year, it is sticking with its
forecast that income will be between $47 billion and $52
billion, compared with $47 billion last year. So far, while
the Persian Gulf crisis has led to higher fuel costs, it
hasn't had much effect on the cost of fertilizers and other
chemicals used in agriculture.
   The department played down the impact of the trade embargo
against Iraq on global trade. "Iraq is a small enough country
that the embargo will have only a limited effect on world
trade and U.S. exports," the department said in a background
paper released yesterday. Although Iraq relied on imports for
75% of its food, its purchases accounted for only a small
fraction of the world's agricultural trade.
   Nonetheless, losing 1.4 million tons of Iraqi wheat
purchases -- more than 1% of the world market -- hurt the
wheat market, where prices already were depressed by the
prospect of bumper grain crops in the Northern Hemisphere and
reduced Soviet and Chinese demand for imported wheat.
   The Agriculture Department, under pressure from lawmakers
from wheat-producing states to shore up prices, said it has
been making full use of its export-subsidy and
credit-guarantee programs. Under the Export Enhancement
Program, exporters sell U.S. grain at world market prices and
collect so-called bonuses from the government to make up the
difference between U.S. prices and the lower world market
prices.
   In the past three months, the department has paid bonuses
covering 2.6 million tons of wheat, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said yesterday in a letter to Rep. Dan
Glickman (D., Kan.), who has faulted the administration for
not being aggressive enough with the program.
   "This is several times what we had done at this time a
year ago, notwithstanding abysmal buyer interest," Mr.
Yeutter said. "Recent bonuses are far higher than those of a
year ago."

it acquired a 5% interest in Hogan Systems Inc., a
Dallas-based maker of software for the banking industry.
   Details of the deal weren't disclosed.

   IBM said the acquisition fits a recent pattern in which
the computer giant has taken equity positions in many small
software concerns, bolstering companies it considers to
provide strategic products. Hogan makes mostly accounting
software for large banks and thrifts.
   IBM also said it extended through June 1995 an agreement
to market Hogan's software in the U.S., Canada and Puerto
Rico, and agreed to develop some projects jointly with Hogan.
The marketing agreement has been modified, however, so that
Hogan receives 50% of revenue from IBM's sales of its
products, rather than the previously fixed amount of $9.6
million a year.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Hogan
shares closed at $3.125, unchanged.

International Textile Products businesses. The printing
products unit makes polymer printing blankets and other
products used in the offset printing industry. It is based in

   BUSH DECLARED "Saddam Hussein will fail" in his occupation
of Kuwait.
   In a televised address to Congress, the president also
said a "new world order" will emerge from the Mideast crisis.
He used some of his bluntest language yet to express the U.S.
stance. Separately, members of the Senate Armed Services
panel criticized Bonn and Tokyo for failing to pay more for
Gulf military operations, and Defense Secretary Cheney said
those contributions may "well be inadequate." Washington said
Iraq announced it would permit American males born in Arab
countries to leave. Citing deteriorating conditions, five
nations said they were pulling their diplomats out of Kuwait.

   GORBACHEV BACKED a sweeping plan to create a Soviet market
economy.
   The president's statement of support to the Soviet
Parliament, in which he backed radical proposals calling for
a market economy within 18 months, came despite warnings from
Premier Ryzhkov that this would lead to a decline in living
standards. Gorbachev's remarks seemed to ensure that plans
drafted by economist Shatalin have won out over Ryzhkov's
more cautious package. The Russian republic's Parliament
later overwhelmingly endorsed the so-called Shatalin
proposals, and called upon the other republics to follow
suit.
   Ryzhkov, who appeared stunned by Gorbachev's remarks,
hinted that he would resign rather than preside over
implementation of the Shatalin plan.

   The U.S. and Soviets may drop provisions limiting troops
in Europe, a senior U.S. official said in Moscow, in an
effort to conclude a conventional forces treaty by year's
end. The official, traveling with Baker, said a prospective
ban on non-nuclear aircraft also may be dropped. A 35-nation
summit to sign the treaty is planned for November.

   Heavy fighting was reported in Monrovia as rebels hunted
troops loyal to Liberia's Doe -- reportedly slain in a
surprise attack Sunday -- while government forces bombarded
the insurgents from atop the president's mansion in Monrovia.
Doe's supporters asked an African peacekeeping force in
Liberia to help them leave the capital.

   Vietnam hailed an agreement among Cambodia's warring

   South Korea was lashed by its heaviest single-day rainfall
in 70 years, leaving at least 30 people dead and more than
25,000 homeless. In Seoul, which was hit by 15 inches of rain

   Rule of Law:
   The Only Question Worth Asking
   David Souter (and the Answer)

<LP>
   Sen. Joseph Biden got a possible Borking started yesterday
by attacking David Souter as an "interpretivist." Sen. Biden
referred to the "harshest" followers "under this common
banner," citing Judge Learned Hand and Justice Hugo Black. By
trying to smear these hitherto honored judges, Sen. Biden
apparently wants to push the "mainstream" far out enough to
exclude any nominee who cares at all what the Constitution
says.
   Indeed, even Justice William Brennan in the foreward to
Justice Black's 1986 memoirs said his place in the "pantheon
of great Justices of the Supreme Court grows more and more
secure with each passing year." Under Sen. Biden's radical
new litmus test, would even Justice Brennan be qualified to
replace Justice Brennan?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Biden's efforts aside, there probably won't be any
surprises along the way to Justice Souter. No one imagines he
would be a judicial activist eager to find shadows, penumbras
or emanations of the Constitution. What we don't know is how
seriously Judge Souter would take his obligation to uphold
the Constitution.
   That is, will his understanding of the original meaning of
the Constitution come first? Or will he feel obliged to
follow even illegitimate prior cases?
   This question of "stare decisis", or following precedent,
has never been so important. Many Supreme Court opinions now
on the books ignore the Constitution. To the extent these
cases offer rules (as opposed to vague five-prong tests and
multilayer balancing factors), these rules are of
questionable validity. With a new conservative majority, the
excesses of judicial activism will erode quickly or slowly,
depending on how bound the justices feel to the illegitimate
precedents of the past 30 years.
   The current ground rules are clear. Conservative judges
are supposed to adhere to precedent, which liberal judges are
free to ignore. Federal Appeals Judge Richard Posner explains
that many conservatives accept the argument that "a good
liberal judge gives little weight to precedents that are not
liberal, but a conservative judge gives great weight to all
precedents, liberal as well as conservative." This creates
what Judge Posner calls a "built-in ratchet" so that "the law
will necessarily grow more liberal."
   This double standard is no exaggeration. Any doubters
should consider the answer a judicial nominee gave when a
senator asked what he would do if clear prior law or cases
required a ruling that "offended your own conscience":
   "If I were faced with a situation like that, that ran
against my conscience, I would try to find a way to follow my
conscience and do what I perceive to be right and just. Not
that, I would hope not, it would mean I would act
arbitrarily. I was born and raised in this country, and I am
steeped in its traditions, its mores, its beliefs, and its
philosophies; and if I felt strongly in a situation like
that, I feel it would be the product of my very being and
upbringing. I would follow my conscience."
   This was the response by Harry Pregerson, now a federal
appeals judge in California, but it is typical of the views
of many liberals Jimmy Carter appointed who promised not to
let the Constitution get in the way. Imagine if Judge Souter
said any such thing.
   Judge Souter wasn't often confronted by this kind of
judicial activism when he was on the New Hampshire Supreme
Court, but a review of his some 200 opinions finds about a
dozen cases where the issue played a large role. There is no
liberal-conservative pattern, but he does show some
willingness to consider whether earlier cases were based on
any authority.
   For example, he overturned an earlier New Hampshire case
for which he could "perceive no intellectually realistic
basis." As a result, he raised the burden of proof in civil
proceedings for committing people to mental institutions up
to the level required in criminal proceedings. In another
case, he dissented from an opinion abolishing special fees
for probate court. Reading the state constitutional clause
"as it was understood when the framers proposed it and the
people ratified it" in 1784, he said, it was clear that the
prohibition against payments was to stop bribery of judges,
not to outlaw regular statutory fees.
   In a case that decided a later owner with no contract
could still sue a builder for latent defects, Judge Souter
issued a one-sentence dissent, "Because I am not satisfied
that there is an adequate justification to repudiate the
rationale unanimously adopted by this court a mere two years
ago." In another case, he enforced precedents on levels of
worker's compensation. "Our obligation is to construe the
statute, not to render its language meaninglessly protean,"
he wrote.
   It's important to remember that "stare decisis" is a
method, not a principle. That is, throughout Anglo-American
jurisprudence, judges have abided by the reasoning in earlier
cases as a way to thread cases into one predictable rule of
law. Indeed, until recently, the duty of "stare decisis" was
the best guarantee that judges would not make up the law
willy-nilly.
   Then liberal judges systematically rejected any obligation
to precedent. This helps explain the recent breakdown in tort
and contract law. Justice William Brennan refused to uphold
any death penalty. He knew he was making policy instead of
applying the Constitution, but said he found "flexibility
with respect to the call of `stare decisis'." Indeed, liberal
justices established the rule that a precedent can turn into
a pumpkin after 24 hours. On a Wednesday this past June, the
Supreme Court upheld the Arizona death penalty. On the
Thursday, the liberal minority took advantage of the fact
that two conservative justices had to recuse themselves, and
invalidated the same death-penalty law.
   There is one good reason to abandon "stare decisis" when
deciding a case. This is when the precedent itself is not
part of any seamless web of judicial interpretation, but
instead is pure judicial lawmaking. Why use a tool meant to
honor precedents to uphold a precedent that itself ignored
long lines of precedent?
   Justice Antonin Scalia made a similar point in a dissent
in a death-penalty case last year. Justice Scalia said he
opposed a two-year-old ruling that a jury can't take into
account a victim impact statement when deciding whether to
order the death penalty. "I think it would be a violation of
my oath to adhere to what I consider a plainly unjustified
instrusion upon the democratic process in order that the
court might save face," he wrote. Except for a few decisions
that "have become so embedded in our system of government,"
Justice Scalia said the court should not hesitate to excise
an unjustifiable precedent. "We provide far greater
reassurance of the rule of law by eliminating than by
retaining such a decision."
   When asked, Judge Souter might say that what counts is
that a precedent was a good-faith effort to apply the
Constitution, not a judge's "conscience" or his policy views.
If a judge in an earlier case ignored the Constitution, he
should expect no presumption of "stare decisis".

   Texas Instruments
   Seeking Big Fees
   From Japan Firms

<LP>
   TOKYO -- Texas Instruments Inc. is asking Japanese
semiconductor manufacturers to pay higher royalties on its
basic patent for the production of dynamic random access
memory chips, Toshiba Corp. said.
   Texas Instruments' share price skyrocketed in response to
a Japanese press report that the U.S. firm is demanding as
royalties 10% of wholesale value of products using the chip.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Japanese electronics company declined
to confirm the report. But he said that there have been
negotiations with Texas Instruments and that the U.S. concern
has been demanding "considerably higher royalty payments." He
said the fee varies from company to company but usually
ranges from 1% to 3% of the production value.
   Other major Japanese companies, such as Fujitsu Ltd. and
Mitsubishi Electric Corp., also confirmed that they have been
negotiating with Texas Instruments on the renewal of
cross-licensing agreements. But their spokesmen said the
companies haven't received requests for higher royalties yet.
   The Toshiba official wouldn't speculate on the outlook for
the talks. But he indicated that it won't be easy for Texas
Instruments to win huge royalties because Japanese concerns
could respond in kind. "We have some important patents that
have been licensed to (Texas Instruments) so we are going to
use them as a leverage in negotiations," he said.
   According to the press reports, Texas Instruments is also
demanding royalty payments totaling an estimated 100 billion
yen ($750 million) a year under a separate Japanese patent.
Known as the Kilby patent, it covers all integrated computer
circuit. So far, no Japanese chip maker is paying royalties
on the Kilby patent because it was granted only recently.
   If the chip manufacturers agree to pay the DRAM royalties
demanded by Texas Instruments, as well as the royalties under
the Kilby patent, these payments would cost Japanese industry
a total of 200 billion yen a year, according to the Japanese
business newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
   Texas Instruments officials in Tokyo refused to comment on
the details, and Japanese company officials said they
couldn't immediately confirm the report.

   Stocks Decline,

   NEW YORK -- It was a bad day for rumors. There weren't
any, which left precious little to guide investors in the
financial markets.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 2.97 points lower
on skimpy volume to 2612.62. Stocks generally moved in the
opposite direction of oil prices, though a late sell-off
pushed the October futures contract for crude oil down 54
cents by the close to $30.76 a barrel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bonds rose in quiet trading, with many investors awaiting
inflation data to be released Friday. The dollar strengthened
against most of the major foreign currencies.
   Kurt Schultz, senior stock-index analyst at Refco Group in
Chicago, said the stock market is nervously vulnerable
because of the Mideast situation, with much of the jitters
showing up first in stock-index futures trading. "Even
institutions have a trading mentality," he said, and
investors can either trade against one another or hover on
the sidelines. "Everyone is afraid to explore new territory.
Do you sell at new {intraday} lows? Do you buy at new highs?
Not likely."
   Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu
Economics, said Monday's 38-point swing in the Dow
industrials "was all rumor driven." Vague talk of Iraqi
military activity erased "a fairly decent gain and drubbed
the bond and stock markets." Yesterday, he said, stocks
failed to regain the upward momentum evident Monday before
the rumors sparked selling.
   "That indicates there's greater wariness about trying to
be too certain of developments with that black box of the
Mideast still out there," Mr. Fabbri said. Low volume also
indicated investors were waiting to hear President Bush's
comments last night on the Mideast crisis, he said.
   Bond investors said they are waiting for something
positive to come out of the budget talks in Washington and
for the producer price index, which is scheduled for release
Friday. The measure of inflation at the wholesale level
during August is expected to jump because of soaring oil
prices.
   The dollar was buoyed by the growing suspicion that the
Federal Reserve won't ease interest rates soon, a move that
would erode the return on dollar-denominated investments
compared with investments in countries where rates have been
rising.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 113.2 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues led
advancers, 835 to 609.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose nearly 3/8 of a point, or $3.75 for each
$1,000 of face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.92%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5855 marks and 140.30 yen, compared with
1.5820 marks and 139.55 yen Monday.

   WASHINGTON -- The proposed Iroquois natural-gas pipeline
won a favorable ruling from a Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission official, boosting the chances for the
commission's approval of the project.
   An FERC administrative law judge said that the gas to be
delivered by the project is needed and that the project's
proposed rate structure is reasonable. The 369-mile, $582.6
million Iroquois Gas Transmission System pipeline is designed
to bring Canadian gas to the northeastern U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission had been expected to approve the project in
July. Instead, faced with significant opposition from
domestic producers, it set up a hearing process to allow for
further examination of the need and rate issue. Now, each
side gets time to submit further briefs in the case, with a
final decision by the commission expected by Nov. 28.
   The Independent Petroleum Association of America said that
it was disappointed by the law judge's findings and that it
intends to file objections with the commission. "We are
hopeful that the commission will maintain an open mind on
these matters," Paul Hilliard, the association's chairman,
said in a statement. "We are not done yet."

   Riverside Church Endowed With Vision

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A19
</SO>
<LP>
   I have been president of the Riverside Church Board of
Trustees for three years and chair of the finance committee,
which oversees the investment portfolio, for six years. I am
an investment banker by profession. I probably know more
about Riverside's finances than any other single person. Your
Aug. 1 page-one article leaves a seriously misleading
impression of the church's finances. You certainly know the
difference between nominal and real dollars, between the
early and the late 1970s, and between deficits and debts. Yet
the article confuses these concepts and omits the most
salient facts of Riverside's financial life.
   The figure of $120 million in reference to our "endowment"
was evidently taken from a study prepared by Cambridge
Associates that presents the portfolio's value each year from
1972 to 1986 in 1986 constant dollars. In 1972, before the
bear markets that ravaged all U.S. equities in 1973 and 1974,
the portfolio would have been worth $120 million if stated in
1986 dollars; in 1972 dollars, it was worth $48 million. The
Cambridge study recommended establishing spending policies to
preserve the real purchasing power of the portfolio over the
long term. Riverside restructured its operations in 1988 to
enable it to do exactly that; the portfolio's annual cash
contribution to the operating budget is set at a level that
should preserve the portfolio's real -- i.e., constant dollar
-- value. I expect the audited results for the year ended
June 30, 1990, to show that the portfolio's current market
value is more than $73 million, its highest level ever.
("Endowment" inaccurately describes our portfolio; most of
our funds are not true endowment.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Riverside's annual spending from the portfolio is limited
to an economically sustainable level. The level allows us to
operate an expensive building and an extensive program,
although we must be frugal. It is true that our vision of the
Christian life leads us to want to do more than our current
resources allow. However, would it not be a much more serious
problem if our resources exceeded our vision?

   Philip Morris Taps Campbell to Succeed
   Houminer as Chief of U.S. Tobacco Unit

   William I. Campbell was named president and chief
executive officer of Philip Morris USA, Philip Morris Cos.'
domestic tobacco unit. The surprise move appeared to signal
unhappiness with the performance and management style of Ehud
Houminer, the current chief of the tobacco unit.
   Mr. Campbell, 46 years old, is currently senior vice
president of corporate planning.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Houminer becomes senior vice president of Philip
Morris Management Corp. In that capacity, he will work on
"special projects of a strategic nature," according to a
statement issued by the New York-based company.
   A spokesman wouldn't elaborate and the executives in
question couldn't be reached for comment. But the unexpected
naming of Mr. Houminer to his new post is a setback for the
48-year-old executive, who made his name at Philip Morris by
masterminding the acquisitions of Kraft Inc. and General
Foods Corp. and the divestiture of 7-Up.
   "There is a major fear that for the first time in recent
memory Philip Morris USA will fall short of its unit volume
projections, and the feeling is that Bill Campbell is a bit
more in tune with the ever-changing dynamics of the
business," said Scott Feit, director of marketing at
Core-Mark Distributors Inc., the nation's largest
distributor. Until now, in an era when U.S. tobacco
consumption is dropping 2% to 3% annually, Philip Morris has
been registering modest unit gains.
   According to industry insiders, top management was also
unhappy with Mr. Houminer's decision to rush the company into
discount brands, like Basic and Bristol, which in essence
helped fuel the growth of the bargain, or so-called sub
generic, category.
   Tobacco distributors said that over the years the tobacco
giant had developed some very powerful relationships with the
trade and was known for its responsiveness to customers. But
soon after his arrival in 1988, Mr. Houminer, who had no
background in the tobacco business, began to engender ill
will among distributors by his rigid approach to
decision-making in the areas of credit and pricing. One move
that especially angered distributors was his decision to
allocate tobacco shipments long in advance of the industry's
twice-a-year price increases.
   In addition, Mr. Houminer managed to alienate company
employees. In one small but particularly unpopular gesture,
he eliminated the Secretary's Day perk of sending each
secretary in the tobacco unit a dozen roses.
   Analysts said the naming of Mr. Campbell would appear to
signal no major shift in strategy at the tobacco unit, Philip
Morris's largest operating division. "This isn't a hugely
significant development in terms of the strategic direction
of the tobacco business, or the whole company for that
matter," said Marc Cohen, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
   Earlier this summer, Mr. Campbell was credited with
playing a key role in the $3.8 billion acquisition of Jacob
Suchard, the Swiss candy and coffee maker. His previous
accomplishments included helping to launch Philip Morris's
tobacco export business in the highly lucrative Asian market.
While Mr. Campbell was executive vice president of marketing
at the tobacco unit from 1983 to 1988, Philip Morris's
domestic tobacco brands registered strong gains in market
share.

   Telephone service, reliable and efficient, had always been
the least of Margaret Olt's problems. But last spring, the
arthritic, 83-year-old widow became another casualty of the
long-distance industry's battle for customers.
   A telemarketer called Mrs. Olt at home. All he wanted, he
said, was to save her some money on her long-distance phone
calls by switching her service to MCI Communications Corp.
from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Annoyed by yet "another salesman," Mrs. Olt says, she hung
up on him. But when her next phone bill arrived from New
Jersey Bell, it showed a $5 charge from "some outfit called
the MCI."
   In phone-industry parlance, Mrs. Olt had been "slammed."
   She thus joined tens of thousands of telephone customers
around the nation who claim their phone service has been
switched without their consent. Apparently the MCI salesman
had authorized New Jersey Bell, the local phone company that
controls the connection to her house, to route all her
long-distance calls through MCI's lines instead of AT&amp;T's.
   MCI denies that it would slam a customer, and it contends
that it received oral approval for service from Mrs. Olt. It
adds that her service has subsequently been switched back to
AT&amp;T. "It is not in our best business interests to slam
anybody," says John Worthington, MCI's chief counsel. He adds
that two months ago the company moved to clean up its
telemarketing by moving the people who verify customer orders
out of locations where sales calls are made and taking
supervisory responsibility for verifiers away from sales
managers.
   Last year, in any case, at least 100,000 phone customers
complained to local phone companies that their long-distance
carrier had been switched without authorization. Bell
Atlantic Corp., the regional Bell company that owns New
Jersey Bell, says slamming complaints that it received rose
74% from 1988 to 1989, to between 60,000 and 70,000. Bell
Atlantic says that these totals reflect only verified
incidents and that the figures don't include switches due to
clerical errors or some other misunderstanding.
   The Federal Communications Commission and consumer
watchdogs say the problem is getting worse. Untold thousands
more consumers have been slammed but don't even know it or
didn't complain, phone-company executives and consumer groups
say.
   "It's outrageous," says Richard M. Kessel, executive
director of New York State's Consumer Protection Board. "No
one should be switched without getting a full disclosure
beforehand and without signing a form that shows they agree
to the full terms and conditions of the change."
   Customers plagued with extra charges and aggravation
aren't the only ones paying for slamming. Local phone
companies, the first place most customers call when they have
a phone problem, are spending millions processing the
complaints. Those costs increase the pressure on local rates.
Moreover, AT&amp;T says slamming is costing it millions of
dollars, not only in lost revenue but also for processing
complaints from consumers who still think AT&amp;T runs the
nation's phone system.
   "It's been happening for the last couple of years, but it
reached a crisis stage in 1989," says Merrill Tutton, vice
president of consumer services at AT&amp;T. However, AT&amp;T's 70.4%
share of the long-distance market still far exceeds the 15.4%
for MCI and the 10.5% for US Sprint, a United
Telecommunications Inc. subsidiary.
   Mr. Tutton says the biggest culprits are AT&amp;T's longtime
rival, MCI, and companies that help sell its service. The FCC
agrees but says AT&amp;T isn't blameless.
   At the FCC, Kathie Kneff, chief of the informal-complaints
branch, says slamming complaints increasingly cite MCI, "but
we get complaints about other carriers, too, including AT&amp;T."
In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1989, slamming complaints
to the FCC were: Sprint, 154; MCI, 140, and AT&amp;T, 29. In the
current fiscal year, complaints so far total: MCI, 387;
Sprint, 194, and AT&amp;T, 22. However, most complaints don't go
to the agency.
   Sylvia Rosenthal, executive director of Washington-based
Tele-Consumer Hotline, says more than 90% of the slamming
complaints it receives involve MCI and other rivals of AT&amp;T.
"Once in a while, you'll get a complaint about AT&amp;T, but it's
mostly because of a clerical error," she says.
   MCI says it is capturing about 100,000 AT&amp;T customers a
week. But Mr. Tutton says that when AT&amp;T asks its former
customers why they left, more than 20% of those contacted say
they didn't know that they had given up AT&amp;T service.
   Last January, AT&amp;T sued several of its rivals, including
MCI and its 25%-owned telemarketer, Pioneer TeleTechnologies
Inc., demanding they stop slamming. AT&amp;T's complaint charged
MCI with fraud and deception, including telling AT&amp;T
customers that AT&amp;T was going out of business and that MCI
was a part of AT&amp;T. No trial date has been set in the suit,
which was filed in the federal district court in Newark,
N.J., and has been moved to the district court in Washington,
D.C.
   Both MCI and Pioneer, of Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, have denied
any wrongdoing, but a Pioneer spokesman says the company has
hired Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. to audit its verification
procedures.
   "It's true we're being blamed more than anyone else,"
MCI's Mr. Worthington says. "But we're making more
telemarketing calls than anyone else." AT&amp;T, he complains,
"is wrapping itself in consumer clothes. But all it's got at
heart is its own commercial interests."
   "What would you do if somebody was stealing your
customers?" Mr. Tutton replies.
   Consumer groups say slammers prey especially on the
elderly, the hard-of-hearing and people with language
problems. Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer
Action in San Francisco, says most of the complaints fielded
by his organization and its affiliates in California are from
the elderly and Mexican-Americans. James Thompson,
consumer-affairs director of the American Association of
Retired People, says he is "astounded by the number of people
that have been ripped off by this." Fielding a recent
inquiry, he counted 270 letters complaining of slamming then
sitting on his desk.
   "What this clearly shows is that MCI and others are
getting desperate in their battle with AT&amp;T for market
share," says Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
"These tactics could backfire" with customers.
   Slamming has become most acute in the past two years as
competition in the long-distance phone industry has heated up
and the players are consolidating. AT&amp;T, trying to stem
erosion of its market share, is spending tens of millions of
dollars on ads that tell customers to get promises of deep
discounts from its rivals in writing.
   US Sprint is counterattacking with ads that say, "Lighten
up, AT&amp;T." MCI is waging a telemarketing blitzkrieg; it says
it is calling some seven million prospective customers a
month.
   Long-distance phone companies needn't present the local
phone company with a customer's written authorization to turn
on service. The order is accepted by telephone with the
understanding that the long-distance company will produce a
signed form from the customer authorizing the change if a
customer disputes it.
   Like most phone customers, Mrs. Olt didn't know all this.
She says she still doesn't understand the changes stemming
from AT&amp;T's breakup in 1984.
   AT&amp;T's long-distance phone rivals deny that they switch
customers without permission. Some customers give oral
approval and then neglect to sign a form that the
long-distance carrier sends them to confirm their decision to
switch. Others say consumers' ignorance about how the
industry operates is causing confusion.
   "This is something we're extremely concerned about," says
John Hoffman, Sprint's senior vice president for regulatory
and legislative relations. "Our {slamming} numbers are
relatively low. The fact is long distance is very
competitive, and people don't expect this."
   After AT&amp;T's breakup, the FCC ordered local phone
companies such as New Jersey Bell to provide AT&amp;T's rivals
with equal connections to their local networks. This way,
customers wouldn't have to dial a cumbersome access code to
reach an AT&amp;T competitor. Under this "equal-access" program,
customers could tell their local phone company which
long-distance carrier they wanted. Now, more than 90% of U.S.
phone customers have equal access to all carriers.
   (Customers who didn't notify the local company of their
preference were put into a pool and automatically assigned to
a carrier based on the carrier's share of the regional
market. So, if MCI had 10% of the customers in the market,
10% of the pool was assigned to MCI. Some customers who had
ignored repeated bulletins from their phone companies about
the change were later surprised to find that they had been
assigned to another carrier.)
   Consumer watchdogs and regulators say the spread of equal
access has made it easier for AT&amp;T's rivals to use the
slamming techniques, while still playing on customer
confusion -- and apathy.
   Several big local phone companies, such as Bell Atlantic
and BellSouth Corp., were deluged with slamming complaints
last year. Thousands of businesses such as nightclubs and gas
stations have also been complaining that the long-distance
service they chose for their pay phones was switched without
authorization.
   The Baby Bells and other big phone companies, such as GTE
Corp., provide service to millions of customers. So, the
percentage of complaints relative to their overall businesses
seems small. Jan Peters, executive director of the carrier
services organization at U S West Communications, a
subsidiary of the U S West Inc. regional Bell company, says
that out of 100,000 long-distance-carrier switches the
company processes per month, only about 500 to 700 are
disputed.
   Since a service change normally costs as much as $5, most
of those customers paid a fee to their local phone company
for being switched if they couldn't prove that the change was
made without their consent. If they could prove a mistake had
been made, the local phone company, with FCC backing, made
the long-distance carrier pay the charge.
   To recover the costs of processing these complaints, Bell
Atlantic has raised its fees. It now is charging carriers
$23.45 for each unauthorized residential switch and $39.96
for each commercial pay-phone switch. Despite those fees, Mr.
Edwards says Bell Atlantic's phone companies still expect to
see about 43,000 slamming complaints this year. BellSouth has
established similar fees to cover its costs. Ameritech, the
Midwest Bell company, says it is reviewing its current
charges to decide whether they warrant an increase.
   The FCC is reviewing a request from AT&amp;T that would
require written authorizations from customers before any
service changes. AT&amp;T's Mr. Tutton notes that more than 30
groups have filed public comments supporting AT&amp;T's petition,
including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Office of Consumer
Advocate, the National Association of State Utility Consumer
Advocates, the U.S. Telephone Association and Southwestern
Bell Telephone Co.
   But AT&amp;T's rivals refuse to back the idea; they say such a
condition would favor AT&amp;T's dominant position. Mr.
Worthington adds that MCI asks its customers to sign a
confirmation letter and return it for the company's records,
but that of the letters sent out, "we get back 30%." Although
the FCC "requires" such letters as proof that the customer
agreed to switch, the only penalty for failure to have them
is the fee for switching the customer back.
   Although carriers are "responsible" for having the
letters, says Steven Spaeth, an attorney in the FCC's Common
Carrier Bureau, the FCC has "decided it's not a good idea to
force them." Mr. Spaeth indicates little sympathy for AT&amp;T.
"AT&amp;T seems to be concerned about a loss of revenues," he
says. "One, I don't think {AT&amp;T's petition} would reduce the
number of abuses, and, two, it would give AT&amp;T a firmer grasp
on market share than it has right now." Says Mr. Tutton: "He
seems to be a little cynical about this, as if AT&amp;T has only
its self-interest in mind."
   The local phone companies say requiring written
authorizations would drive up their processing costs.
   Perry Wade Lawson of Sneedville, Tenn., doesn't buy any of
these arguments. Mr. Lawson, a 63-year-old with two
artificial hips and heart trouble, says he was slammed by MCI
earlier this year (a charge MCI denies).
   "I told them I didn't want the service, and they switched
me anyway," Mr. Lawson complains. "I'm a businessman. I ran a
supermarket for 30 years, and I don't like the way MCI does
business."

   Workplace:
   As Cultural Diversity of Workers Grow,
   Experts Urge Appreciation of Differences

   At a workshop for American University lab assistants
recently, a hot topic was Saddam Hussein: What motivates the
Arab leader, and why doesn't he view negotiations the way
George Bush does?
   But the topic wasn't foreign relations; it was employee
relations. Saddam Hussein and Mr. Bush were being studied for
insights into conflicts among about 80 university lab
technicians, one-third of whom are foreign-born and many of
whom are Arab-American. Some of the same cultural issues
complicating the Mideast crisis have cropped up inside the
lab.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The workshop was one of hundreds around the U.S. that
focus on cultural differences affecting recent immigrants, as
well as blacks, women and people whose U.S. roots may stretch
back as far as the Mayflower.
   White male corporate culture is disappearing, and the
workplace is becoming less a melting pot than a mosaic. The
white male share of the labor force will drop to 39.4% by the
year 2000 from 48.9% in 1976, according to the U.S. Labor
Department, while the share of women and people of African,
Hispanic, Asian and Native American origin will rise. Even
now, because the work force is growing more slowly, employees
of different cultures are in a position to demand more
flexibility from management.
   In the past, conformity was the rule -- right down to
shirt color. Even now, the average manager may think: "To be
fair, I should assume everyone is the same and treat them
that way."
   But experts on diversity disagree. At the American
University lab, says Gary Weaver, the professor of
intercultural communications who conducted the workshop,
small disagreements have escalated into "real conflict, where
someone was going to get fired." A major reason, he says, is
cultural differences. When a manager from the dominant U.S.
culture saw two Arab-American employees arguing, he figured
he had better stay out of it. But the employees expected a
third party intermediary, or "wasta" in Arabic, and without
one the incident blew up.
   The expectation goes back to the Koran and Bedouin
tradition, says Prof. Weaver. While the dominant American
culture is likely to take an individualistic, win-lose
approach and emphasize privacy, Arab-Americans tend to value
a win-win result that preserves group harmony but often
requires mediation. The hope in cross-cultural communication,
he adds, is not to decide "who's rational and who's
irrational" but to understand both perspectives and become
comfortable with them.
   Cultural misunderstandings, usually far from overt, happen
every day. Consider these scenarios, offered by human
resource consultants:
   -- A female vice president says to a male vice president,
"Do you think we should invite X to this meeting?" The woman
really means, "I think we should invite X," but her colleague
thinks he has been asked a question. Many women have learned
to speak in tentative or questioning tones to avoid appearing
too aggressive.
   -- A Latino manager starts a budget-planning meeting by
chatting casually and checking with his new staff on whether
everyone can get together after work. His boss frets over the
delay and wonders why he doesn't get straight to the numbers.
Latino culture teaches that building relationships is often
critical to working together, while the dominant American
culture encourages "getting down to business."
   Ignoring such differences can hurt people and
productivity. Managers who don't understand what's motivating
a colleague or employee may provoke resistance or anger, says
Toby Thompkins, a consultant at Harbridge House Inc., a
Chicago-based human resources concern.
   But before people can change their approach, say
consultants, they have to reject a basic but wrongheaded
idea. Most assume that "their human nature is everyone's
human nature, and you're OK if you just get down to the
human," says Barbara Deane, editor of Training and Culture
Newsletter in Seattle.
   Because negative stereotyping is so damaging, adds Lewis
Griggs, a San Francisco-based producer of films on diversity,
"we are taught" that we should ignore differences, or at best
consider them irrelevant. But "real and relevant" differences
exist, he argues, reflecting genuine cultural habits and
values.
   Consultants coach managers and employees to look for and
talk about these differences, largely by presenting scenarios
drawn from real life. For the most part, they aren't blatant
cases of discrimination but the details of day-to-day life.
   One territory that's ripe for misunderstanding is body
language. Rules for eye contact, for example, differ among
cultures.
   "Say I'm interviewing an Asian woman, anywhere from first
generation to third generation," says Mr. Griggs. Deferring
to authority, she may keep her eyes down, rarely meeting his.
But this goes against everything traditionally taught to
American managers about interviewing. "Here I am," says Mr.
Griggs, "thinking, `She's not assertive, not strong enough,
maybe she's hiding something, or insecure.'" Meanwhile, he
adds, "she sees my persistent eye contact as domineering,
invasive, controlling. We don't trust each other."
   "First," Mr. Griggs says, "I have to understand that my
penetrating eye contact isn't God's gift, or the `right' way,
it's just Anglo male Midwestern {habit}." Then, he says, "I
can stay in neutral, be a little less judgmental" and meet
the other person half way.
   One danger in such discussions is that dissecting
differences may lead some people to adopt new stereotypes.
The fear was demonstrated at a manufacturing plant in Dallas,
when Bob Abramms, a consultant with ODT Inc. in Amherst,
Mass., showed one of Mr. Griggs's films.
   In one scene, portrayed by actors, a Native American woman
is binding together wires in an electronics plant. The boss
sees that she has come up with a better way to do the work,
and, over her protests, makes a big fuss. "Hey, everybody,
this is the kind of work I want to see]" he shouts to the
other workers on the floor.
   The boss, of course, thinks he was doing the woman a
favor. The dominant American culture sees public praise as
the best reward for a job well done. But in some cultures,
where the emphasis is on group harmony and cohesion, singling
someone out appears to threaten the group and causes the
individual to suffer a loss of face.
   In the next scene, the boss has learned his lesson. He
offers the employee a letter of praise for her personnel
file.
   But the film's conclusion got an angry reaction from one
viewer in the plant, another Native American. "She said, `I
don't know what tribe that woman is from, maybe Navaho, but
I'm Cherokee and I want public praise as much as the next
person,'" recounts Mr. Abramms.
   "No matter how much we learn about cultures," he adds, "we
have to be aware of differences" within a culture "and of
personal idiosyncrasies and preferences." It may turn out
that the person who wants private recognition is a blond
California woman who just happens to be shy. "The bottom
line," says Mr. Abramms, "is: Ask."
   In addition to discussing cultural differences,
consultants also bring up the reverse scenario: when someone
from a minority group displays behavior common to many
cultures but is scrutinized more closely than others would
be.
   "In a corporate setting, anything a person of color does
is exaggerated," says Mr. Thompkins of Harbridge House, who
is black. Especially at professional levels, he says,
"they're usually the only one in the room. So if I show up
late for a meeting once, it's noticed. If there are three
{white} guys from finance and one is late, it's not much of
an issue."
   A white man may pound the table and be seen by others as
emphatic or exuberant, adds Carmen Colin, a consultant at
ODT. But if a black man raises his voice or gestures, she
says, "it's immediately seen as a threat" by non-black
colleagues.
   Says a black manager at a cosmetics firm: "Do we face more
animosity if we are confrontational in a meeting? Yes." Once,
after a meeting where he vigorously argued his position, he
recalls that a white colleague told him casually, "I've never
met a black male who didn't have a chip on his shoulder."
   Often, the hardest part of such training is getting people
into it to begin with. Many people are frightened, say
consultants, about bringing tensions to the surface in an
organization that seems to be functioning well.
   Even when people acknowledge problems, they often see them
as someone else's affair. In preparation for a seminar on
diversity, Mr. Abramms recently mailed orientation packages
to about 200 executives of a large oil company.
   Along with the date, location and other practical details,
each kit included a reprint of a Harvard Business Review
article called "Black Managers: The Dream Deferred,"
describing black corporate experiences. Dozens of the
company's white middle managers, without reading the article,
sent their copies to the one black manager in the group,
thinking, with some good will, says Mr. Abramms, "`Oh, this
will interest Tom.'" When the group met, he chided them.
"You're the ones that need to read it," he said. "Tom knows
what it's like."
   People laughed sheepishly, he says. "You begin to see the
absurdity of it, and to realize that the best we'll ever be
is recovering sexists and recovering racists."

   LONDON -- Security Pacific Hoare Govett Group Ltd.
announced plans for its management and employees to buy 51%
of the British securities concern, as part of a
reorganization that would split the company in two.
   Under the plan, Hoare Govett would divide into a company
focusing on United Kingdom and continental European markets,
and another concentrating on Southeast Asia. Los
Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp., which owns 100% of
Hoare Govett, would retain a 49% stake in each of the new
firms. The transaction is expected to be completed early next
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Security Pacific took control of Hoare Govett in early
1986, when banks were snapping up British brokerage houses
before the deregulation of London's financial markets.
   The employee purchase would allow Hoare Govett to regain
its independence, yet retain links to "financially strong"
Security Pacific, said Peter S. Voss, Hoare Govett's chairman
and chief executive officer. "The local management and
employee teams, with their equity incentive, will enable us
to increase our market position" in Europe and southeast
Asia, he added.
   The European unit is to be capitalized at about #70
million (US$130 million) and the southeast Asia operation at
$45 million to $50 million, Mr. Voss said in an interview
yesterday. Equity in the concerns would total about #10
million and $10 million respectively.
   Both companies intend to continue concentrating on
research, institutional sales, market making and corporate
finance and advisory work.
   Peter R. Meinertzhagen, currently Hoare Govett's head of
corporate finance, will become chairman of the European unit.
Mr. Voss will be the unit's chief executive. Tony Lowrie and
Tim Kilpatrick, who now are respectively chairman and
managing director of Hoare Govett International, will lead
the southeast Asian unit. Their precise job titles haven't
yet been determined.
   In a statement, David Lovejoy, vice chairman of Security
Pacific, said Hoare Govett would "play a crucial role" in the
U.S. bank's "alliance of securities firms."

   On July 27, Potomac Watch columnist Paul A. Gigot, in what
he considered to be a "delicious anecdote," informed us of
"panic in the ranks of People for the American Way, the group
that paid Gregory Peck to smear Judge Bork."
   According to Mr. Gigot, the group had done its homework in
anticipation of the nomination of Judge Edith Jones of Texas,
but were unprepared for Judge David Souter. That is not much
of a delicious anecdote. It is pretty thin stuff, with a
careless statement thrown in: It is not true that I was paid
to speak the narration on the anti-Bork TV spot.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A little research by Mr. Gigot before he sideswiped me
would have disclosed that I have been speaking my piece for
racial and religious tolerance, for equal justice for
minority citizens for more than 40 years, on and off the
screen.
   Judge Bork opposed affirmative action. He expressed little
understanding of the deprived and underprivileged, no concern
for the hopelessness of their plight, the bleakness of their
lives. The superior intellect did not appear to be leavened
with human compassion.
   Did I smear Judge Bork? No. The TV spot was hardball
advocacy, to be sure. People for the American Way didn't
defeat him. Nor did the Senate Judiciary Committee. He
defeated himself.
   I expect that Judge Souter, on those hikes in the
mountains of New Hampshire, will have reminded himself that
while most Americans respect and admire intellectual
achievement, what they trust in a man is common sense, and a
touch of humility.

   Enron Corp. said agreements have been reached for power
sales, joint-venture operations and gas supply for its
proposed $1.1 billion power project in Teesside, England.
   The Houston-based energy concern said the 1,725-megawatt
facility will be at ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd.'s Wilton
Works plant in Teesside, in northeast England. ICI is a unit
of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The project is subject to a number of regulatory approvals
and would add roughly 3% to the power-generating capacity of
England and Wales. Sales agreements have been reached for all
1,725 megawatts of capacity.
   The power sales agreements have an initial term of 15
years beginning April 1, 1993, with options to extend. Enron
said four regional electricity companies are expected to
assume a 50% equity ownership, while it will retain the
remaining 50% stake. ICI has an option to purchase up to 10%
of Enron's equity in the facility after commercial operation
has begun. The company said it expects to realize income from
certain project development fees this year, but didn't
elaborate.

   Health-Care Level
   Tied to Insurance,

   Researchers have developed new evidence that people with
little or no health insurance may get lower-quality health
care.
   Scientists in Boston found that heart patients with
private health insurance are much more likely to receive
costly treatment, such as coronary bypass, than patients who
are uninsured or are covered by Medicaid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, researchers in New York found a marked
increase in the portion of hospital costs for AIDS patients
paid by state-federal Medicaid programs rather than private
insurance. The trend threatens patients' access to "promising
new care," the researchers say, and increases financial
pressures on already burdened inner-city public health
systems.
   Together, the reports, published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association, underscore growing concern
among policy makers and business leaders over the more than
31 million uninsured U.S. citizens and funding crises at many
state Medicaid programs. Indeed, both public and private
sectors are buckling under increasing health costs.
   "If we {want} a health care system in which insurance
status plays no part in whether a patient receives good care,
then we need to consider providing insurance for everyone,"
says Mark D. Wenneker, a physician and health-policy
researcher at the New England Medical Center, Boston.
   Other research has linked health-insurance coverage with
access to care. Dr. Wenneker, of the medical center's
Institute for the Improvement of Medical Care and Health, and
colleagues at Harvard Medical School say their study is the
first to show that the correlation extends to expensive heart
treatments. They studied records of 37,994 patients admitted
to Massachusetts hospitals with heart disease symptoms in
1985.
   Patients with private insurance were 80% more likely than
uninsured patients to have angiography, a diagnostic
procedure that enables doctors to see on X-ray films whether
coronary arteries are obstructed. Insured patients were 40%
more likely to undergo coronary bypass and 28% more likely to
have coronary angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped catheter
is threaded into the heart and inflated to open clogged
arteries. Rates were similar for Medicaid patients, though
the difference for angioplasty was even more pronounced.
   The researchers didn't find a reason for the differences.
Dr. Wenneker noted that hospitals and doctors have been under
financial pressures that could discourage them from offering
some services to low-paying or non-paying patients. In
addition, "patients who don't have insurance are much more
reticent about undergoing expensive treatments" for fear of
piling up huge bills, Dr. Wenneker added.
   The study also didn't establish whether privately insured
patients ultimately fared better than those in other groups.
Arnold M. Epstein and Joel S. Weissman, both at Harvard, were
co-authors of the study.
   In the AIDS report, Jesse Green, director of health policy
research at New York University School of Medicine, and Peter
Arno of the Einstein College of Medicine, New York, found
that Medicaid paid 54.6% of AIDS hospital costs in New York
City in 1988, up only slightly from the previous year, but up
from 39.7% in 1983. In San Francisco, Medicaid paid 30% of
the costs in 1987, up from 18.5% in 1983.
   The authors describe the trend as the "Medicaidization" of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Because Medicaid usually
reimburses doctors at much lower rates than private insurers,
the authors say primary-care doctors are reluctant to accept
Medicaid patients. Indeed, New York Medicaid pays $11 for an
office visit by a new patient, the researchers say, while a
private insurer pays $84.
   If new treatments that are prolonging the life of AIDS
patients are typically administered through primary-care
doctors, AIDS patients on Medicaid could be denied access to
them, the researchers say, and will increasingly seek
treatment at hospital emergency rooms.

   LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Raiders football franchise
has signed a 20-year agreement to remain in Los Angeles,
ending years of uncertainty for managing general partner Al
Davis, several California cities and exasperated fans.
   Under the terms of the agreement, the private management
of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will renovate the
67-year-old facility at a cost of about $145 million, which
will include the construction of 204 lucrative "luxury
boxes," a key demand of Mr. Davis and a perk he said he had
been promised when the team moved from Oakland in 1982.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since the Raiders left Oakland in 1982, the team has been
involved in litigation with the National Football League, the
city of Oakland and the Coliseum Commission. The Raiders
considered moving to the Los Angeles suburb of Irwindale,
were courted by Sacramento and earlier this year agreed to
return to Oakland when the city offered a package worth $602
million, which was later reduced, and then finally squelched
by community opposition. Meanwhile, Raiders attendance last
year dwindled to less than 50,000 per game in a stadium that
seats more than 90,000. The renovated Coliseum will seat
about 72,000.

   NEW YORK -- Yields on most certificates of deposit at
major banks and brokerage firms declined in the week ended
yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by
banks (also called "consumer" CDs) were down slightly,
according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service.
The average yield on a six-month consumer CD, for instance,
eased to 7.38% from 7.42%, Banxquote said. On a five-year
consumer CD, the average yield eased to 7.90% from 7.91%,
according to the survey of 18 banks.

   Average yields on CDs sold by leading broker-dealers fell
more. The greatest decline was for a six-month broker-sold
CD, which fell to an average of 7.75% from 7.92%, Banxquote
said. The average yield for a two-year broker-sold CD fell to
8.13% from 8.22%.
   Average yields for large-denomination CDs at major banks,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
flat to down slightly. The average yield on a one-year jumbo
CD remained at 7.72%, while the average for a five-year
maturity eased to 8.25% from 8.27%.

   Your Aug. 3 article "Florida Is Gaining Reputation as
Haven for Debtors Who Seek to Shelter Wealth" was informative
and well-researched. However, another bit of information is
crucial to anyone considering filing for bankruptcy.
   Although the article correctly stated that state laws
protect a homestead from the claims of creditors in
bankruptcy, with Texas and Florida having particularly
generous homestead exemptions, a homestead is not protected
from the IRS. Indeed, the Bankruptcy Code specifically
provides that the homestead exemption does not provide
protection from a properly filed tax lien. The IRS routinely
seizes and sells the homes of the delinquent taxpayers.

   OTTAWA -- A Canadian regulatory agency proposed removing a
ban on liquor advertising on television and radio.
   The only alcoholic beverages that can be advertised now on
television and radio are beer, some wine, coolers and other
beverages with less than 7% alcohol.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed change was requested by the Association of
Canadian Distillers. The industry group said the liquor
advertising ban is unconstitutional. It also has initiated a
legal challenge of the ban.
   The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission said it will make its final ruling on the proposed
change after assessing public comments on issues such as the
effect of various types of alcoholic beverages on driving
offenses, domestic violence and work absenteeism.
   Under the proposed amendments, the commission would
continue to clear all alcoholic beverages ads before they
were broadcast.

   DALLAS -- Oryx Energy Co. said it paid $968 million to buy
17% of its common shares outstanding from several trusts
controlled by the founding family of Sun Co.
   Oryx, an oil and gas exploration and production company,
also said it would convert an additional 7.3 million common
shares held by the Pew family trusts into a new issue of
non-voting preferred stock that a trustee is expected to sell
immediately, eliminating the Pew family's 27% stake in Oryx.
Oryx was spun off from Sun in 1988 as Sun Exploration &amp;
Production Co. and has since changed its name.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trustee for the family, Glenmede Trust Co. of
Philadelphia, couldn't be reached for comment. Oryx said the
transaction resulted after "it became apparent that
Glenmede's long-term objectives were incompatible with Oryx
Energy's strategic plans."
   Oryx said Glenmede had sought a higher yield on its
investment, pressing for an increase in the energy concern's
30-cent-a-share quarterly dividend. Robert P. Hauptfuhrer,
chairman and chief executive officer, said that because of
extensive cash needs for the company's exploration and
production activities, "it is not our intention to increase
our dividend."
   Oryx paid Glenmede $53.75 a share for the 18 million
common shares. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday, Oryx shares closed at $53.625, down 25
cents. The company announced the buy-back after the market
closed.
   Oryx, which currently has 105 million common shares
outstanding, said it will have about 87 million shares
outstanding after the buy-back is completed and the preferred
shares are converted back to common for new owners.
   Oryx said it will pay for the shares with debt it said it
will eventually eliminate through divestitures. The company
said it has signed letters of intent to sell about $150
million in oil and gas assets by year-end and expects to
divest another $600 million of assets by September 1991.
   Separately, the company adopted a shareholders rights plan
under which holders of Oryx common would be entitled to
purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a new Series A
preference stock at an exercise price of $150. The rights are
exercisable, among other things, when a 20% or more stake in
the company is acquired.

company had negotiated with various potential buyers and it
had reviewed one offer that exceeded the statutory value of
USI Re, but decided against selling the company. "We decided
the net proceeds (of this one offer) weren't enough because
we believe the inherent value of USI Re is greater than the
price we could obtain in today's market."

   AmBase said the decision not to sell USI Re would have no

   Last month, New York-based AmBase agreed to sell a 50.1%
stake in the company to an investor group shortly after it
had reached a separate agreement to sell Home Insurance to
Vik Brothers International. AmBase said it would proceed with
both offers until a definitive agreement is reached with one
or the other.

   In your Aug. 20 article "At Columbia, Comeback Is the Big

in a vintage movie poster from "You'll Never Get Rich"
(Columbia, 1940) as Ginger Rogers. In fact, Mr. Astaire's
co-star in "You'll Never Get Rich" was Rita Hayworth. Mr.
Astaire's classic musicals with Ginger Rogers in 1933-1939
were made at the RKO Radio Studios.
   "You'll Never Get Rich," however, is notable not only for
being one of only two movies Astaire and Hayworth made
together (the other, again for Columbia, was "You Were Never
Lovelier"), but also for the wonderful supporting performance
by Robert Benchley and the rare cameo appearance of the Delta
Rhythm Boys. It is also a fine example of an overlooked
minigenre: the Hollywood movies taking a lighthearted look at
military life that were made between the inception of the
peacetime draft in 1940 and the Pearl Harbor attack, which
abruptly sobered the nation's outlook.

   UPI spokesman Milt Capps confirmed published reports that
bureaus in New Mexico, Wyoming and Montana, many of them
operated by one person, would be closed. As part of the
restructuring, the news service has also given layoff notices
to one-person bureaus in Michigan and North Dakota, Mr. Capps
said.

   Mr. Capps wouldn't confirm the number of full-time
reporters or editors that have been or would be laid off. He
said that UPI at the same time is increasing its network of
stringers in those states and "exploring a number of joint
ventures at the state and regional level" with State News
Service and Financial World magazine.
   "Virtually every bureau in the system world-wide is
affected either by increases or decreases," Mr. Capps said.
The changes in the editorial operations began six weeks ago,
he said, and would "last a number of months."
   The news service is owned by Infotechnology Inc., which

   TOKYO -- U.S. and Japanese officials are moving against a
deadline to defuse a dispute over American access to Tokyo's
market for so-called amorphous metals.
   At stake is Allied-Signal Inc.'s future role as a supplier
of the metals for electrical transformers to Japanese
electric power companies. But also, an underlying problem
bedevils U.S. negotiators: What can the U.S. do when Japan
refuses to buy a proprietary American product even as
Japanese companies, with government support, scramble to
develop it themselves?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hints of an 11th-hour deal surfaced last week, when
Japanese and U.S. officials began huddling in an effort to
resolve the issue. The Japanese deny the allegations of
discriminatory behavior, but sources from both sides suggest
that a commercial agreement that guarantees market access for
Allied-Signal could provide a face-saving resolution to the
issue.
   Unless a deal is struck by Saturday, Allied is expected to
reinstate its complaint, filed in March under Section 301 of
the U.S. Trade Act, that the Japanese government and certain
companies colluded to block Allied's product from Japan's $90
million annual market for the metal cores used in
electric-power transformers.
   At Washington's request, Allied suspended its petition
earlier this year so the U.S. and Japan could work on a
solution. Reinstatement of the complaint would result in an
investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,
which could order retaliatory action against Japanese imports
to the U.S.
   A clash is likely to reignite concern that Japan's
targeting of economically strategic technologies robs the
U.S. of the commercial benefits of American scientific
research. That suspicion has been at the core of disputes
over Japanese policies on such sophisticated products as
supercomputers, satellites and telecommunications equipment.
   While Japanese bureaucrats often insist that their
influence over Japanese companies has ebbed as the companies
gained financial muscle, foreign economists and industry
officials say the bureaucrats still play an important role in
nurturing promising industries.
   "Japanese industrial policy is alive and well, and it's
increasingly focused on high-tech industries," says Edward
Lincoln, an economist at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. Japanese bureaucrats' response to foreign
criticism has been "not to stop doing what they're doing, but
to stop saying what they're doing," says Mr. Lincoln, author
of a recent book on Japan's foreign trade.
   Allied-Signal, based in Morristown, N.J., charges that the
unwillingness of Japanese utilities to install
amorphous-metal transformers, except for experimental
purposes, is a classic case of industrial targeting. Allied
says it poured $200 million over 20 years into developing the
material, and holds exclusive patents on it. But Japanese
companies have spurned the product, even as they make a major
effort, with government help, to make the product themselves,
Allied maintains.
   The company says it has collected evidence since the late
1970s: a Japanese government-sponsored research group on
amorphous metals; a subsidized loan to Japan's largest steel
maker to develop a manufacturing process for the material; a
Japanese agency's efforts to persuade Allied to license its
know-how to numerous Japanese manufacturers, despite Allied's
desire to negotiate only with selected companies; and,
according to the company, efforts by members of the research
consortium to impede Allied's patents.
   Amorphous metals, unlike conventional metals with their
crystalline molecular structure, have an irregular structure
similar to that of glass. The material's strength, hardness,
flexibility and unusual magnetic properties could ultimately
give it a range of industrial uses. But
electrical-transformer cores are by far its biggest market so
far.
   Japanese industry officials agree that amorphous metals
cut energy loss from transformer cores by about 70%. But they
say more research is needed to deal with other concerns --
such as the material's ability to withstand Japan's frequent
earthquakes and lightning storms, and possible extra costs to
install and maintain the units.
   Allied contends that studies in the U.S. and Japan have
already eliminated such concerns, and it says the utilities
are stalling. None of the estimated 50,000 transformers in
commercial use in the U.S. has failed, says David Hill,
senior vice president in charge of Allied's Metglas amorphous
metal division. Allied estimates that 5% of new transformers
in the U.S. use amorphous-metal cores, and expects a 50%
share by 1995.
   But ultimately, Allied's charge of exclusionary behavior
by the Japanese utilities rests on circumstantial evidence:
   -- Nippon Steel Corp., with backing from the
government-run Research Development Corp. of Japan, in 1987
developed a manufacturing technique for amorphous metals
based on work done at one of Japan's national universities.
Nippon Steel is Japan's largest supplier of silicon steel for
conventional transformers. The company is also one of the
largest users of electric power in the country.
   -- Ryusuke Hasegawa, a Japanese-educated scientist who
represented Allied's amorphous metals operation in Tokyo in
the late 1980s, says he received subtle hints from Japanese
transformer companies that utilities were delaying investment
in the material until Japanese steel makers could compete
with Allied.
   Officials from Japan's three largest utilities, Tokyo
Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric Power Co. and Chubu
Electric Power Co., all deny any suggestion of a concerted
boycott against Allied. Each company says it will base
purchase decisions on cost, quality and reliability of
supply, and that it won't consult with other utilities. Tokyo
Electric and Chubu Electric also say they won't begin
investing in amorphous-metal transformers on a large-scale
commercial basis until at least 1993 -- the year Allied's
basic patent expires.
   That timing, the companies say, is coincidence. Some note
that Allied's related patents have longer to run. Fumio
Kodama, general manager of Nippon Steel's intellectual
property division, says that even after the main patent's
expiration, his company couldn't manufacture amorphous metals
without know-how from Allied. Mr. Hill confirms that Nippon
Steel and Allied continue to negotiate a licensing agreement.
   Allied and U.S. government officials, however, say they
worry that Nippon Steel or other companies could find ways
around the process patent by 1993. "What we want to avoid is
a situation where there are hints and winks and nods {about
buying material from Allied} and suddenly in 1993 they say we
think we have found a way around the patents," says a U.S.
diplomatic source.
   Sources familiar with the governments' talks say that
solid commitments by one or more major Japanese utilities to
buy from Allied could provide a solution. But if one isn't
found, Allied wants the U.S. to slap a retaliatory tariff on
Japanese steel imports to the U.S. and exclude Japanese
amorphous metals indefinitely.

   Brooktree Corp. Wins
   Infringement Ruling
   Against Chip Maker

   SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal court jury in California ruled
that Advanced Micro Devices Inc. infringed on patents and
copyrights owned by Brooktree Corp., a small chip maker in
San Diego.
   Brooktree sued AMD in late 1988, charging that the
Sunnyvale, Calif., chip company illegally used three
Brooktree patents in computer chips called "color palettes,"
which control colors on personal-computer screens. Brooktree
also charged that AMD infringed on certain Brooktree "mask
work" rights, the rights to the layouts of circuits in a
semiconductor chip.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In ruling against AMD on mask rights the federal court in
San Diego became the first, Brooktree and AMD officials said,
to reach a verdict under the Semiconductor Chip Protection
Act, a law enacted in 1984 to protect unprotected chip masks.
AMD said it planned to appeal the ruling.
   The verdict is a big victory for Brooktree, a private
company that expects something over $60 million in revenue
this year. The company's sales were growing rapidly until
1988, when AMD started making its offending chips, said
Brooktree president James Bixby. The type of chip involved
comprises nearly 50% of Brooktree's revenue, said Mr. Bixby.
"We slammed into a brick wall when AMD came in" and began
competing with low-priced knock-offs, said Mr. Bixby in a
phone interview from a party celebrating the victory.
   An AMD spokesman said that the company didn't copy
Brooktree's chips and that any infringement on patents was
inadvertent. AMD invented color palette technology, the
spokesman said, and AMD's chips were on the market before the
Brooktree patents were granted. AMD has a patent-infringement
case pending against Brooktree, he added, and AMD's patents
are broader than Brooktree's.
   "We believe that the verdict is not supported by the facts
of the case," said Thomas Armstrong, AMD's general counsel,
in a written statement. AMD said that its color palette chips
involved in the case represented less than 1% of its $1.1
billion revenue in 1989.
   The jury is expected to decide later this month on
damages.

   To Major Banks
   Being Weighed

   Sources Say BankAmerica
   And Bank of New York
   Have Expressed Interest

<LP>
   HOUSTON -- First City Bancorp. of Texas, concerned about
its ability to compete in the rapidly consolidating banking
business, said it is considering seeking one or more
money-center banks as minority partners.
   Such a move would go against the grain of current banking
trends. While much of the current talk of consolidation in
U.S. banking circles revolves around possible mergers between
cross-town rivals to reduce overhead, A. Robert Abboud, First
City's chairman and chief executive officer, envisions a
"special relationship" with one or more major international
banks, possibly including foreign institutions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview, Mr. Abboud said he wants First City, a
relative lightweight with assets of less than $14 billion, to
be able to take advantage of opportunities presented by
Europe's economic integration and the decline of world
Communism.
   "What we're looking for is to be tied into a network that
would be world-wide," he said. He added that "a number of
international institutions" have expressed interest in First
City's plans.
   "The good news is we've got competition and we've got
interest," he said.
   Both Bank of New York Co. and BankAmerica Corp. have sent
teams to Texas to examine First City's loan portfolio in
recent weeks, according to people close to the situation.
Neither bank would comment.
   The move comes at a time when First City is struggling to
keep pace with some of its Texas competitors. Both NCNB Corp.
of Charlotte, N.C., and Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio,
have bought large Texas banking franchises with liberal doses
of federal assistance and have set about blanketing the state
with branches and billboards.
   First City, by contrast, has faltered a bit since it was
recapitalized in 1988 by an investor group led by Mr. Abboud.
Its federal assistance package wasn't as generous as some
competitors' packages, and it has been plagued recently by
reports of problems in its loan portfolio. First City says
such reports are overblown.
   The immediate reason for First City's urge to forge an
alliance stems from its need to refinance an expensive, $125
million issue of preferred stock, according to Mr. Abboud.
   When the preferred shares were first issued, First City's
investment bankers assumed holders would eventually convert
them into common stock. (The shares are convertible after
April 15 at a conversion rate of $27.22 a common share.) But
the company's stock price, after nearing $40 a share last
year, has tanked in recent months. In composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, First City shares
closed at $19.125, down 25 cents.
   If the stock doesn't recover sufficiently by April, First
City will either have to pay some $150 million to redeem the
preferred stock or begin paying an onerous dividend equal to
the prime rate of interest, the rate banks charge their best
customers, plus six percentage points. First City has
consistently said in the past that it plans to opt for
redemption.
   Mr. Abboud said First City, through its investment banker,
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., has begun
exploratory talks with several major banks about raising the
money needed to redeem the preferred stock. He added that
market conditions appear to be such that any new investor
would likely demand a common equity position in First City in
addition to any debt issue it might buy. He said the equity
might take the form of warrants or some other issue
convertible into common stock.
   The convertible preferred stock translates into 4.5
million shares of common stock. First City currently has 18.2
million shares outstanding.
   Mr. Abboud said he believes First City would make an
attractive partner because of its strong Texas franchise and
because he and other top officials have a great deal of
experience in international banking and in the oil business.
Mr. Abboud formerly served as chairman and chief executive of
First Chicago Corp. and president and chief operating officer
of Occidental Petroleum Corp., Los Angeles.
   He added that he has some leverage over how the
transaction proceeds. "The fact is I like this franchise. I
like being here and I have a big slug of stock. We're in the
unique position of controlling our destiny."
   People familiar with First City's plans say neither
BankAmerica nor Bank of New York is likely to be big enough
on its own to complete the sort of deal Mr. Abboud seeks.
   BankAmerica of San Francisco, with about $104 billion in
assets, is the second largest U.S. bank holding company,
after New York-based Citicorp. But on the world stage it
ranks around 50th, according to statistics compiled by the
American Banker, a trade publication, far behind the mammoth
Japanese and European banks that have come to dominate global
banking.
   New York-based Bank of New York's $49 billion in assets
rank it 13th in the U.S. and around 98th world-wide. And its
ability to make an investment in First City is suspect. Just
last month the Federal Reserve Board blocked a proposed
merger with Northeast Bancorp of New Haven, Conn., ruling
that such a move would harm Bank of New York's "ability to
maintain a strong capital position."
   Some banking sources suggested such constraints could lead
First City beyond U.S. borders in search of well-capitalized
partners. "It's hard to do" given the depressed share prices
and thin capital bases of most U.S. banks, said one
investment banker.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.

   The Campeau Corp. units filed for bankruptcy-court
protection on January 15.

   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. had already
extended the deadline to today.
   Once the so-called exclusivity period expires, Allied and
Federated's creditors may file their own reorganization plans
with the court.
   Federated and Allied told Judge Aug that they were not yet
ready to file the reorganization plan. But several creditor
committees filed responses and objections to the lengthy
extensions.
   Jay Indyke, a lawyer for the Allied creditors, said his
committee wanted the deadline extended only until Nov. 12.
"In spite of the fact that we've been told that the debtors
are moving toward {reorganization} plan negotiations . . .
were only seeing bits and pieces of it and we don't have a
complete picture of where they're going," he said.
   David Heiman, the lawyer who represents Allied and
Federated, could not be reached for comment.
   It is not unusual for the 120-day exclusivity period to be
extended several times in complex Chapter 11 proceedings.

   Travel:
   Eastern Plan
   Woos Fliers
   On Business

<LP>
   Eastern Airlines is making one more stab at attracting
business fliers: a chance to wallow in luxury and fool the
boss.
   The struggling carrier, scrapping for customers ever since
it went into bankruptcy proceedings 18 months ago, said it is
sharply increasing the number of first-class seats in its 157
aircraft, and will put travelers who typically pay full fare
into them for 15% to 35% less than the usual coach rate on
other carriers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And no one will ever have to know, Eastern indicated.
Tickets purchased under the plan will be for confirmed
first-class spots, but will be written as "Y" class tickets,
the standard designation for coach. The result: no clue that
the occupant sat in a wide leather seat, ate better food,
received priority luggage service, freshened-up with hot
towels or had an individual telephone.
   "We're very conscious of corporate travel policies that
say employees must buy a coach ticket and pay a coach price,"
said Martin R. Shugrue, the bankruptcy court-appointed
trustee currently running the carrier. He said the new
Eastern program would "allow business fliers to honor that
policy and stretch out and enjoy" fancier service.
   So far, Eastern has had difficulty in attracting regular
business fliers -- people who make last-minute travel plans
and pay the full rate for tickets. Those travelers tend to be
finicky but loyal and consistent customers.
   Eastern's much-publicized labor and financial difficulties
scared off such passengers, leaving it instead with leisure
fliers who buy deeply discounted seats far in advance.
Eastern will continue to offer cut-rate coach seats, but
needs a clientele of business travelers to return it to
profitability.
   The idea of offering such favored customers the chance to
fly first class isn't new, of course. Continental Airlines
allows full-fare coach passengers to move into first class on
certain flights when space is available. Most carriers let
frequent fliers cash in some of their mileage credits to
upgrade. Delta Air Lines, for example, says that more of its
frequent fliers cash in mileage for that purpose than save up
for free trips to far-off places.
   But Miami-based Eastern yesterday called its latest effort
to attract the much-sought-after business traveler
"revolutionary." And it needs some kind of dramatic measure,
industry officials agree. Just last week, Eastern was ranked
next to last among all U.S. and foreign carriers in the Zagat
annual survey of airlines, just ahead of the Soviet
state-owned carrier Aeroflot, never renowned for service.
   The perennially upbeat Mr. Shugrue insisted in an
interview that the lure of first class will put Eastern back
on track. "The seats are bigger, the food's better, the booze
is free -- what else can you ask for?" He said Eastern will
heavily promote, explain and sell the program. Once a
passenger tries it, he predicted, "we've got you; you're
ours."
   Eastern did its homework on the plan, Mr. Shugrue
maintained. It studied corporate travel policies and
interviewed chief financial officers at a number of major
corporations and also polled travel agents to determine what
business travelers are allowed. In most cases, "corporate
travel departments say to employees, `you must fly at the
lowest available economy fare.' That's what this fare is," he
said.
   By even slightly undercutting rivals' full coach fares,
Eastern would apparently satisfy such corporate directives.
While rivals could promptly match Eastern's lower rates and
wipe out that edge, they aren't likely to, industry experts
said.
   Eastern said its lowest full coach fare, 35% below rivals,
will be for a ticket purchased three days in advance. It said
its fare for same-day travel is 15% lower than rivals. The
new fares take effect Oct. 1. All tickets will be refundable
and carry no penalty for cancellation or change, continuing a
previous Eastern offer.
   Though it tailored prices to corporate travel rules,
Eastern still must win over those who do the traveling. "Once
you lose passengers, the only way to get them back is to do
something different -- something measurably more than other
airlines," said Phil Davidoff, president-elect of the
American Society of Travel Agents.
   Customer resistance "can be overcome, if the quality of
the product is good," added L. John Eichner, president of
Simat, Helliesen &amp; Eichner Inc., an aviation consultant. He
warned, however, other measures of service can't slip:
"People don't forgive late planes and canceled planes."
   Some in the industry believe that Eastern doesn't have
much time to pull off a turnaround, even if the idea does
catch hold. Eastern's bankruptcy-court creditors have been
patient so far, and Mr. Shugrue insists he has no deadline.
But he has been in charge more than four months since the
court took control of the carrier away from Continental
Airlines Holdings Inc., which still holds its equity. While
Eastern's losses have narrowed in that period, the carrier is
still operating in the red. Recently, an outside investor was
trying to interest creditors in a liquidation plan for the
carrier; Mr. Shugrue has said he will only consider a sale of
the entire carrier.
   "To become profitable, you've got to get a higher
percentage of travelers paying more than $200 a seat," said
Mr. Davidoff, the travel executive. To that end, Eastern is
adding 10 to 12 first-class seats on its planes at a total
cost of $8 million. That represents increases of 50% to 100%,
depending on type of plane. Eastern said it is also adding
flight attendants in the section, along with the leather
upholstery, telephones and other amenities.

   HOUSTON -- Tenneco Inc. said its packaging unit is taking
part in talks to buy mills and timberland from
Georgia-Pacific Corp. for about $740 million.
   The proposed purchase would be the most ambitious yet by
Tenneco's Packaging Corp. of America unit based in Evanston,
Ill. Already this year, Packaging Corp. has acquired a
corrugated products concern and a maker of specialty
paperboard trays. The unit, despite recent softness in some
of its profit margins, remains one of Tenneco's most
successful operations. The unit had net income of $200
million on sales of $1.3 billion in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Atlanta, a spokeswoman for Georgia-Pacific said the
negotiations with Tenneco are in line with its plans to sell
off certain assets to reduce some $4 billion in debt incurred
in its acquisition of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. But the
asset sales are strategic and not essential to handling its
debt load, a spokeswoman said.
   Georgia-Pacific, a forest-product concern, said it also is
continuing negotiations "with several interested parties" for
the possible sale of its huge paper mill in Toledo, Ore., as
well as box plants in Modesto, Calif. and Olympia, Wash.
   A Tenneco spokesman said GE Capital Corp., a finance unit
of General Electric Corp. of Fairfield, Conn., and other
major investors will supply a "substantial amount" of
investment capital for the acquisition, but wouldn't specify
the amount. GE Capital would purchase the paper mills in
Valdosta, Ga., and Tomahawk, Wis., and lease them to
Packaging Corp.
   Similarly, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. of
Boston and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, have
agreed in principle with Tenneco to acquire 540,000 acres of
Georgia-Pacific timberland in Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia
and Florida, and lease it to the Tenneco packaging unit.
Packaging Corp. currently manages more than 600,000 acres of
timberland. The potential transaction also includes the
purchase of 19 Georgia-Pacific box converting plants.
   A Tenneco spokesman said the company was "confident" it
would face no antitrust problems with the potential
acquisition.
   Packaging Corp. makes conventional brown boxes, as well as
specialty packaging such as foil delicatessen trays and foam
egg cartons. It operates more than 60 facilities world-wide.
   Tenneco has pared down its disparate holdings in recent
years, chiefly by selling its immense oil unit in 1988, but
it still has far-flung holdings, including a large
farm-equipment unit, a natural-gas distribution business, a
ship-building unit and operations in auto parts and
chemicals.

   Dofasco's Algoma,
   Amid Strike, Removes

   TORONTO -- Algoma Steel Corp. moved five big trucks past
picket lines early yesterday morning to retrieve dies used in
stamping out auto parts from its strike-ridden plants.
   Negotiations between Algoma and the steelworkers union
broke off on Aug. 24, and both sides said it is unlikely the
talks will resume anytime soon. The 6,000 Algoma steelworkers
have been on strike since their contract expired July 31.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move to retrieve the dies, an effort to honor a
contract with the General Motors of Canada Ltd. unit of
Detroit-based General Motors Corp., outraged union officials,
who resorted to calling Algoma "a bunch of liars." A union
official said the trucks' markings were covered up to prevent
identification. The company, a unit of Dofasco Inc., declined
to comment on that issue. Dofasco, Canada's largest
steelmaker, is based in Hamilton, Ontario.
   An Algoma spokesman said, "We've shipped these parts out
of the plants to ensure GM a continued supply of these
unfinished auto parts." Some of the parts go to GM directly,
while others are sent to third parties for finishing before
being sent on to GM, he said.
   The spokesman said Algoma has a longstanding
customer-supplier relationship with GM. "If we did nothing,
GM would manufacture new dies, which would be used by
Algoma's competitors, and Algoma would lose that business,
and that would result in lost jobs," he said.
   A GM official said that, while the company owns some of
the dies, its only role in the events is as a customer.
   Union officials said the company didn't have any right to
move in while the strike is under way. "We think that this is
a low blow," Doug Watt, vice president of Local 2251 of the
United Steelworkers of America, said. "The company isn't
winning any friends." He said that Algoma is the only
supplier of the parts to GM, and that this is "a major GM
contract."
   The Algoma spokesman wouldn't discuss the value of the
contract and wouldn't say where the 30 dies would be shipped,
though a person close to the company said some of the dies
would go to Dofasco plants.
   Meanwhile, talks between the United Steelworkers and
Stelco Inc., a Toronto-based steelmaker, continued with the
aid of a mediator. Officials on both sides refused to comment
on the talks. The union represents more than 10,000 Stelco
employees who have been on strike since July 31.

   Cliburn Competition Hits Wrong Notes
   ----

<LP>
   In June of 1989, a Soviet teenager arrived at the Fort
Worth, Texas, airport sporting an overgrown Beatles mop, a
feeble Charles Bronson mustache and a Bruce Lee button.
Within the next couple of weeks, Alexsei Sultanov exhausted
local video stores of their kung fu movies; cheerfully pulled
two black snakes out of the swimming pool belonging to his
frightened Texas host ("I don't afraid of snakes, no," he
said); and walked away with the gold medal from the Eighth
Van Cliburn International Piano Competition.
   Mr. Sultanov, now 20 years old, is an electric pianist,
and Fort Worth audiences adored him. But the rest of the
world has more easily resisted this pint-sized powerhouse,
who produces rare excitement in his kinetic hammering but who
seems far from ready for the kind of career the Cliburn
competition attempts to launch. He was not the best among the
more than 200 contestants from nearly 40 countries. And he is
only a minor character in Joseph Horowitz's unusual and
probing account of the competition, "The Ivory Trade: Music
and the Business of Music at the Van Cliburn International
Piano Competition" (Summit, 276 pages, $19.95).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is Mr. Horowitz's intention to discover what turned a
crude banger like Mr. Sultanov into an overnight sensation
with major concert engagements around the world and recording
opportunities. To do this, Mr. Horowitz, a former New York
Times critic, offers intriguing insights into nearly every
facet of musical life, the bizarre personality of the Cliburn
competition and Mr. Cliburn himself, while giving an
engrossing description of down-home Texans courting classical
music glamour on a grand, international scale. Mr. Horowitz
happens to view music competitions as a microcosm of "what
transforms and perplexes Western high culture in the late
20th century -- its popularization."
   This is not a new theme for Mr. Horowitz. His previous
book, "Understanding Toscanini," examined the connection
between the rise of the celebrated conductor's spectacular
American career with the increasing use of hype to popularize
classical music. "The Ivory Trade" continues the story,
beginning with Mr. Cliburn's stunning 1958 Tchaikovsky
Competition victory in Moscow, which made the lanky American
a national hero overnight.
   The Cliburn competition, born of a spontaneous notion at a
1958 Fort Worth banquet for Mr. Cliburn and held every four
years since 1962, attempts to re-create that kind of success.
In the process it has grown from a provincial mom-and-pop
operation to a slick, high-visibility, multimillion-dollar
operation. But it has not come close to finding another
Cliburn. Only two of its first-place winners, Radu Lupu
(1966) and Cristina Ortiz (1969), have gone on to have major
careers, and neither was made in the wake of the Cliburn
victory.
   The landscape of competitions -- and not just the Cliburn
competition -- is littered with sad stories. Mr. Horowitz
pays special attention to Steven De Groot, a South African
uncomfortable in the limelight, who could not adjust to his
1977 Cliburn victory. Depressed and disillusioned, he turned
to teaching in 1981, saying that the experience had so
wounded him spiritually he was no longer even capable of
falling in love. Tragically he died of organ failure just as
the 1989 Cliburn competition was beginning and just when it
seemed he was at last ready for a career.
   There are the bland winners who offend no one but who
impress no one either and return to obscurity. There are the
biased judges, promoting their countrymen; the incompetent
judges, minor piano teachers indulging in the luxurious
competition life. There are the wonderful talents too easily
weeded out in hasty, early preliminaries.
   And yet competitions have always been an inherent part of
performing. Handel and Scarlatti, Mozart and Clementi, Liszt
and Thalberg dueled in public keyboard battles. Orchestra
musicians compete in auditions for jobs. Some way, too, must
be found to weed out pianists, given that approximately 8,000
graduate from American colleges and conservatories every
spring.
   Love them or hate them, competitions also are riveting
dramas, which Mr. Horowitz describes vividly as he
investigates just how the Cliburn became such a mass-market
phenomenon. And in the course of his analytic investigations,
Mr. Horowitz -- cynical, big-city critic though he may be --
finds himself bewitched by Fort Worth, its democratic
audiences and its society. He even takes a surprising liking
for Mr. Cliburn, and offers captivating glimpses into the
weird home the pianist shares with his 90-year-old mother,
his many pianos and Christmas trees.
   Mr. Horowitz also becomes passionately involved in the
fortunes of the players he favors. His favorites are losers
-- the unpredictable Portuguese Pedro Burmester and the
intense Russian Alexander Shtarkman -- and Mr. Horowitz's
mission becomes to find a way so that such talent can thrive.
The process of ranking finalists is too arbitrary, he
suggests, and the exposure is too sudden. But Mr. Horowitz's
story doesn't stop there. He has arranged for Messrs.
Burmester and Shtarkman, along with another former Cliburn
loser, William Wolfram, to appear next month at New York's
92nd St. Y in a series called "Goldfingers." And in doing so,
he has perhaps demonstrated the greatest value of
competitions -- they get people involved.

   Budget Talks

   Accord Between Congress,
   Bush on Cutting Deficit
   Could Come Late Today

   WASHINGTON -- After four months of unproductive talks,
White House and congressional budget negotiators finally
narrowed their differences and say they could reach a
deficit-reduction compromise by late today or tomorrow
morning.
   "I have been pleased with recent progress, although it has
not always seemed so smooth," President Bush said in a
televised address to Congress last night.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "But with or without an agreement from the budget summit,
I ask both houses of Congress to allow a straight up-or-down
vote on a complete $500 billion deficit reduction package not
later than Sept. 28."
   The Republican and Democratic sides are converging on a
compromise that would raise taxes about $130 billion net over
the next five years -- including an energy tax of some sort,
a new tax on luxury goods and higher taxes on alcoholic
beverages.
   Defense spending would be cut between $170 billion and
$200 billion from projected levels, based on proposals
offered by the two sides. Domestic spending of all sorts
would be trimmed between $103 billion and $126 billion, with
both sides now proposing to make the elderly pay a bigger
share of the cost of the rapidly growing Medicare program.
Savings on interest costs would account for the balance of
the $500 billion package. Even if negotiators agree to cut
the deficit $50 billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
and the package is enacted, the federal deficit will still
approach $200 billion, the White House budget office
estimates. As a result, any pact will have to waive the $64
billion deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   Administration and Republican congressional negotiators
emerged more optimistic than previously from the fifth day of
talks at nearby Andrews Air Force Base. That optimism was
largely the result of Democratic plans offered Monday night
and yesterday that sharply reduced proposed increases in
domestic spending and increased planned cuts in federal
benefit programs.
   "We're going to make it," said negotiator Sen. Bob
Packwood (R., Ore.). "We need a day to finish the product and
let everybody look it."
   "We're about 60% through," said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski
(D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee.
   But others cautioned that the talks could still fall apart
over some sticky issues -- including Mr. Bush's insistence on
cutting the capital-gains tax rate, which he reiterated last
night, and the demands of Democrats to increase some domestic
spending programs.
   "Democrats can't resist the urge to spend more,"
complained Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.). Sen. Robert Byrd
(D., W.Va.) "entertains us daily with long discourses on the
subject." One Byrd speech accused White House Budget Director
Richard Darman and Chief of Staff John Sununu of being
"arrogant, insipid and almost obscene," other negotiators
said.
   After a long caucus, Democrats made a new proposal shortly
before the talks recessed yesterday. Republicans are expected
to respond when the talks resume today at the air base.
   In their new plan, Democrats call for people with incomes
above $500,000 year to pay a "temporary surtax" of 20%,
double the surtax they proposed initially, a summary of their
proposal showed. But they dropped their demand for an
increase to 35%, from the present 28%, in the marginal
income-tax rate levied on the highest-income Americans. The
temporary surtax, however, effectively would raise the top
tax rate to 33.6% for people who make more than $500,000 a
year. The Democrats also abandoned a proposal to increase the
alternative minimum tax -- paid by upper-income individuals
who would otherwise avoid taxes -- to 26% from the present
21%.
   But Democratic aides warn that if Republicans continue to
press for a cut in the capital-gains tax rate, Democrats will
revive their proposal to raise income-tax rates on
upper-income people. And Republicans vow to oppose any rate
increases. Mr. Bush said the package "must avoid any measure
that would threaten economic growth or turn us back toward
the days of punishing income-tax rates."
   Republicans continue to back a $10,000 limit on deductions
for state and local income taxes as a way to increase the tax
burden on the rich. But while Republicans aimed at a
deficit-reduction package that leaves the tax burden on the
rich and poor roughly the same as they are now, Democrats
want to hit the rich harder than the poor and middle class.
   "The working people who got almost nothing from the tax
cuts of the past must not be asked to pay most of the tax
increases of today," House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt
of Missouri said in his response to Mr. Bush's speech. The
Democrats' latest offer would substantially increase the
earned-income credit for the working poor and enlarge other
tax breaks for low-income taxpayers to compensate for other
tax increases.
   Democrats and Republicans are both proposing to make the
elderly pay a bigger share of the cost of Medicare. The 33
million Medicare beneficiaries currently pay a monthly
premium of $28.60 for Part B coverage, which pays for 80% of
"reasonable charges" for doctors' services after the first
$75.
   Republicans have advanced a plan to increase the monthly
premium for individuals earning more than $40,000 and couples
earning more than $51,200 and establish a new sliding scale,
according to people close to the talks. After a phase-in
period, the premium could exceed $100 for those with incomes
of $100,000 or more.
   One Democrat close to the talks said that Democrats were
prepared to accept that proposal but that Republicans were
backing away from it.
   The Democrats' proposal would instead raise the premium
for all beneficiaries to cover 30% of the costs of Medicare
Part B, up from the 25% level in current law, participants in
the talks say. Both sides also would extract additional
savings from doctors, an important move to avoid a firestorm
of protest from the vocal elderly lobby.
   At least so far, negotiators say there has been little
discussion of cutting back Social Security benefits in any
fashion.
   Although both sides are considering energy taxes, their
proposals differ. Democrats now are backing a broad-based 4%
levy, having abandoned their initial proposal to begin with a
2% tax and increase it to 4% in the second year, as well as a
seven-cent increase in the nine-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax.
So far, Republicans have proposed an increase of only one
cent a gallon on petroleum fuels of all kinds.
   As the talks wore on, Congress has continued to approve
spending bills for new fiscal year. The Senate yesterday
voted 93-6 to approve an estimated $20.7 billion measure
funding the Treasury and Postal Service.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Plane Passengers Will See Boom
   In Number of In-Flight TV Ads

   Brace yourself for more crowded skies when you fly.
   Crowded with a greater barrage of television commercials,
that is. Long in its infancy, in-flight advertising is
finally taking off -- whether captive passengers like it or
not.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Japan Air Lines recently introduced in-flight ads on its
screens for the first time, and Delta Air Lines soon may
follow suit. TWA is putting sponsored newscasts on additional
flights, while British Airways is permitting six minutes of
commercials per hour on its entertainment programs -- twice
as many as five years ago. Advertisers now spend roughly $15
million a year on in-flight TV ads, 50% more than in 1987,
industry executives estimate.
   An even bigger boom lies ahead. A number of airlines are
inaugurating in-seat personal video devices this fall. The
tiny TV monitors, in seat backs or armrests, will give
passengers a mix of movies, sports and business programs,
instructional tapes, comedies and music videos. Some systems
under development even feature video games, mail-order
catalogues, duty-free shopping and electronic poker.
   The individual screens also will come with a plethora of
advertising messages (except during first-run films), as
cash-strapped carriers scramble to pay for systems that can
cost $1 million per aircraft. First-class and business-class
passengers on JAL's New York-to-Tokyo run began watching
in-seat television last month, along with commercials that
included spots for Martell cognac. American Airlines will
install individual screens for first-class travelers starting
later this month. The carrier already has lined up sponsors
for several of its 15 different videotaped programs.
   Airvision, a U.S. unit of Dutch electronics giant Phillips
N.V., yesterday announced that Mexicana Airlines will install
Airvision's six-channel TV sets for all passengers starting
Dec. 15. Similar personal-video systems are planned by next
spring at KLM, British Airways and Northwest Airlines. "All
the main airlines will be flying something {like this} in
first class" within two to three years, says Mark Horton,
British Airways' media services manager.
   "If you think we have a lot of advertising now" on
airlines' wide movie screens, "just wait until the individual
video systems come on," predicts Robert Anderson, TWA's
in-flight marketing manger, who is trying to choose a
personal-TV system for TWA. "We will have a lot more," he
says. "There will be a lot more opportunities for advertisers
because there will be a lot more {program} choices."
   But how captive is a passenger who can switch video
channels or choose from dozens of videotapes rather than
being restricted to one giant overhead screen? The solution
may be for an advertiser to become a videotape's exclusive
sponsor or run identical spots simultaneously on every
channel. "I think we will ruin" demand from advertisers for
in-flight commercials "unless we offer ad coverage in all the
channels" at once, warns Ken Epstein, sales director for
Flight Level Video Inc., a New York firm that handles
in-flight programs and ads for Pan American World Airways and
TWA.
   Seat-back TV eventually should attract advertising from
the same sort of businesses now wooing affluent air travelers
through in-flight commercials on big screens. Among the
heaviest current users are long-distance phone carriers like
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, financial-service companies
like American Express, and hotel chains and makers of cars,
computers, luggage and cameras.
   Few advertisers are rushing to book air time on the new
flying TV sets, however. "It's another opportunity to use the
television screen on board the aircraft," says Ian
Stanborough, managing director of Optimedia International.
Optimedia, Publicis -- FCB's specialist international media
company in Europe, is the ad agency for Ballantine's scotch,
exclusive sponsor of video news broadcasts on long-distance
British Airways flights. "But whether we make it work and do
what we want it to do has yet to be decided," Mr. Stanborough
notes.
   Another question mark: Will passengers rebel against a
higher bombardment of TV commercials during their flights --
the way they have booed and hissed ones shown in movie
theaters?
   "I don't like advertisements on TV. Why would I want more
of them on the airplane?" asks Kevin Leo, a 26-year-old
computer programmer, as he waits by a Northwest reservation
desk in the lobby of New York's World Trade Center.
   To avoid a backlash, the airline industry is promoting
evidence that the flying public doesn't mind in-flight
commercials. That's one finding from a survey of 4,215
passsengers being released today at the World Airline
Entertainment Association's annual convention in Scottsdale,
Ariz. Of those polled by the trade group, 47% felt the amount
of TV advertising during flights was "about right" while 27%
"didn't notice" and 15% said it was "too much."
   Some carriers also are setting strict limits on how many
TV commercials they will allow. For Japan Air Lines, it's a
mere 220 seconds per flight. And American Airlines may impose
ad restrictions on its new personal-video system. "We are
very sensitive to commercialization on the airplane," says
Kathy Libonati, American's managing director of product
design. "We don't want the traveling public to think they are
a captive audience."

   A&amp;P CAMPAIGN: A new TV campaign for Great Atlantic &amp;
Pacific Tea, with the tag line "Look At Us Now," starts this
week in the New York metropolitan area and will soon move to
other markets. The ads, which replace A&amp;P's "Building a Proud
New Feeling" campaign, are the first created by Bozell, which
won the $20 million A&amp;P account in February. A&amp;P is a unit of
Tengelmann Warenhandels Gesellschaft.
                                                                                                       

   NETWORK TV ADS: The Network Television Association, an
umbrella group formed in April by NBC, CBS and ABC to promote
network TV, next week will launch in newspapers and trade
magazines a campaign targeting national marketers.
                                                                                                       

   TBWA Advertising, New York, produced the ads, which carry
the theme "Network TV: It Touches Everyone."
                                                                                                       

   PERSIAN GULF: A trade ad for Pelorus Film Co., a New York
commercial and film production firm, shows a map of the
Middle East with the tagline, "We believe there's one place
in the world where there should be no shooting." The ad,
which will run in advertising trade journals, was created by
Omon's New York office.

   President Calls
   For Tax Incentives
   To Boost Energy

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush called for tax incentives to
encourage domestic energy production, but many of his likely
proposals face a hard sell in Congress and probably wouldn't
produce much oil anytime soon.
   In a nationally televised speech focusing on the Persian
Gulf crisis, the president said, "The Congress should, this
month, enact measures to increase domestic energy production
and energy conservation in order to reduce dependence on
foreign oil." Listing "our energy dependence" among factors
determining "whether we can help our friends and stand up to
our foes," he vowed that "Americans must never again enter
any crisis -- economic or military -- with an excessive
dependence on foreign oil."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is expected to release this week a
series of specific proposals that were produced by the Energy
Department and approved by the White House economic policy
committee. Department officials have said the package will be
longer-term and more controversial than an earlier package,
which included calls for Americans to inflate their car tires
more fully and increase car-pooling, and was roundly
dismissed as inadequate by conservation groups.
   The new proposals drawn up by the department include a tax
credit designed to encourage efforts to recover hard-to-get
oil from existing fields, and an extension and reshaping of a
tax credit for investments in renewable energy projects such
as solar power. The administration also will repropose
various tax incentives for oil drilling that were included in
the president's budget proposal last January. These include
changes that would reduce the burden of the alternative
minimum tax on producers.
   Any of these revenue-losing measures, however, would face
an uphill battle in Congress at a time the lawmakers are
trying to rein in a budget deficit that is spiraling out of
control. The tax changes in the January budget were estimated
to cost $300 million in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   The president also may urge various federal agencies to
expedite the permitting process required for certain oil
drilling projects in the Beaufort Sea near Alaska and renew
his call for Congress to allow oil drilling in the Arctic
Natural Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. In his speech, the
president urged Congress "to accelerate the development of
Alaskan energy resources, without damage to wildlife."
Environmentalists are already vigorously attacking proposals
to open up the refuge, however.
   In addition, the administration may seek to speed up its
consideration of proposed pipeline projects designed to bring
natural gas into California for use in projects designed to
recover hard-to-get oil. Actual production from such projects
would be some time off, though, according to agency
officials.
   Among steps proposed by the Energy Department to encourage
conservation are calls for Americans to use gasoline with
lower-octane ratings. Octane measures the anti-knock capacity
of gasoline.
   The president also called for efforts to increase
fuel-switching. Higher oil prices are already persuading
industries with dual-fuel capacity to switch to natural gas
from oil. Energy Department officals have looked at ways to
remove barriers, such as transportation problems, that could
inhibit further switching.
   In addition, the president may issue an executive order
calling for increased energy efficiency and reduced energy
consumption in federal buildings, and the Bush administration
may urge people to tune up oil burners and replace them as
needed.

   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- CyCare Systems Inc. said it would buy
back as many as 500,000 shares, or about 9% of the shares
outstanding, from time to time on the open market.
   The company, which had about $3.3 million in cash on hand
for the second quarter ended June 30, said it was initiating
the buy-back because it feels the stock is undervalued. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, CyCare
stock closed at $5.625, up 12.5 cents, near its low for the
year. The stock's high for 1990 was $10.375.
</LP>

   CyCare said it would use the stock for employee stock
option and incentive plans. The buy-back follows last year's
program, when the company bought 420,000 shares, or 18% of
its shares, for $6 a share from Hospital Corp. of America.
   CyCare provides computerized processing, services and
systems to the health-care industry.

   Accounting Group May Soften Proposal
   That Would Make Bank Profits Fluctuate

SECURITIES (SCR)
</IN>
<LP>
   Under pressure from the banking and accounting industries,
an accounting standards body is close to scaling back a
proposal that would have made bank earnings more volatile.
   The Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is meeting
this week in Seattle to decide whether to issue a final draft
of a proposal meant to standardize the accounting for debt
securities held by financial institutions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed changes were also prompted by concern about
abuses of current guidelines. Critics say that under existing
practices, financial institutions can massage their financial
profile by selling securities in which they have a profit
while continuing to carry at cost a different batch of the
same securities in which they have a paper loss.
   But there has been concern that the proposed guidelines,
rather than giving investors a clearer picture of the value
of debt securities held, would create wide fluctuations in
bank earnings.
   John L. Kreischer, chairman of the executive committee,
said that the group is now leaning toward requiring
institutions to disclose unrealized losses, but not include
them in their income statement, as had been proposed.
   Mr. Kreischer also said that the committee is considering
eliminating a controversial paragraph that would have
required banks to forecast the interest rates at which they
would sell securities. The group might also eliminate or
change another controversial part of the proposal that would
create a new accounting category that would force management
to state how long it planned to hold a debt security.
   "We're concerned that it's very difficult for anyone to
examine intent to hold {a security} for the foreseeable
future," he said.
   Forcing banks to declare more pointedly their intentions
about security sales is controversial because those
intentions would determine how the securities are treated on
income statements. It involves using either historical cost
or market value as a measurement. Currently, debt securities
are classified either as long-term investments, which are
treated at historical cost, or as trading assets, which are
marked to market.
   The accounting group finds itself in a squeeze, however,
because aside from opposition to the proposed guidelines, it
faces pressure from regulators to go beyond current standards
and to establish more uniform rules within the financial
industry.
   Banks have insisted that the treatment of debt securities
under the proposal would cause sharp, unnecessary earnings
declines if more of the securities in a portfolio were
reclassified and valued at the lower of cost or market.
   Arthur Stoffel, a partner in the Chicago office of
accounting firm Grant Thornton, said the guidelines would
create "big gyrations" in banks' profitability, and make it
"more difficult for managements to make intelligent buy-sell
decisions."
   Bankers said the proposal's effect on banks would depend
upon each bank's securities position. Clearly, if a portfolio
of securities has declined in value since it was purchased,
the effect would be to decrease profits in the period in
which the securities values declined. Banks whose portfolios
had net gains in value wouldn't see much effect since the
securities would continue to be valued at their original
cost. Such unrealized gains might also be disclosed, Mr.
Kreischer said.
   Small banks, which often have a larger percentage of their
assets in debt securities due to soft loan demand or local
economic conditions, might be more adversely affected than
large banks.
   Bankers also contend that in current form the proposed
guidelines would be virtually unworkable -- and the
accounting panel seems to have come to agree with them. Not
only would it be difficult to audit implementation of the
proposal, the banks argue, but it would also limit banks'
flexibility in altering their asset and liability mix as
economic conditions change. In effect, banks would be forced
to make investment decisions based on accounting treatment
rather than economic factors, they say.

   DALLAS -- The Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, in an
effort to cut costs as the thrift industry constricts, is
selling its headquarters to a unit of GTE Corp. and moving to
less plush leased space.
   Neither party would disclose the sale price, but FHLB's
president, George Barclay, said investment of the proceeds,
combined with a reduction in other office expenses, "will
have a favorable impact on the bank's profitability."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Barclay is one of the presidents of the 12 Federal
Home Loan Banks who has sounded alarms about the declining
profitability of the banks. The banks' major source of
revenue is loans, or advances, to member thrifts. But demand
for advances has declined as thrifts have cut their
borrowings in efforts to shrink to meet stringent capital
standards.
   "Selling the headquarters and moving into leased office
space is in the best interests of the bank and our member
insititutions," Mr. Barclay said yesterday.
   The FHLB headquarters, comprising about 200,000 square
feet in two buildings, is being sold to GTE Southwest Inc.,
one of the four area operating companies of GTE Telephone
Operations.
   A spokeswoman for GTE Southwest said the company will move
about 585 employees into the buildings in late 1991, when the
company's current leases expire.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The former chief financial officer of
ZZZZBest Co., the scandal-wracked carpet-cleaning concern,
agreed to be banned from doing any public auditing work, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said.
   Bruce T. Anderson, a certified public accountant, agreed
to the premanent ban in a settlement of an administrative
action, without admitting or denying wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
   He is barred from auditing the books of companies
registered with the SEC or seeking SEC registration to sell

   In a civil suit by the SEC last month in California, Mr.
Anderson was accused of knowingly helping ZZZZBest file
allegedly fraudulent financial statements with the SEC, or
recklessly disregarding evidence that the documents might be
false.
   Mr. Anderson, ZZZZBest's financial chief from July 1986 to
July 1987, agreed to a permanent injunction barring him from
engaging in violations of securities laws.
   The company's founder, Barry Minkow, was convicted last
year on various counts in connection with a scheme to bilk
investors and banks of more than $100 million. He is serving
a 25-year sentence. Mr. Anderson was not a defendant in the
criminal proceedings.

   Deposit Insurance Fund Covering Banks
   Could Need Treasury Help, GAO Says
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- The banking industry's deposit insurance
fund could require Treasury assistance if a recession
strikes, according to the General Accounting Office,
prompting some lawmakers to urge another increase in bank
insurance premiums.
   Charles Bowsher, comptroller general of the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress, conjured up visions of a
crisis similar to the savings-and-loan debacle in testimony
before the Senate Banking Committee. He exhorted Congress to
avert a need for federal assistance by giving banking
regulators the authority to raise insurance premiums in the
Bank Insurance Fund higher than is currently planned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We could lose this fund, just like we lost the {savings
and loan} fund," he warned the committee, adding: "We have a
lot of situations out there that could wipe the fund out."
   The committee appeared eager to embrace any proposal that
would keep them from having to vote for a potential taxpayer
bailout down the road. "If action is necessary, let's take it
now," said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the
committee. No one opposed Mr. Bowsher's plan to pile another
bank insurance premium increase atop one scheduled to take
effect next year in order to stabilize the fund.
   Bankers generally have agreed that next year's scheduled
increase in assessments to 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits
from 12 cents per $100, is necessary, but that any increase
beyond that would be crippling.
   Many analysts don't believe that the banking industry is
in as severe financial straits as was the thrift industry
when a bailout law was passed last year. The industry as a
whole has a stronger capital position, which acts as a
cushion for the deposit insurance fund. Nonetheless, Mr.
Bowsher and the committee found disturbing similarities in
how the industry is increasing its exposure to risk at a time
that its taxpayer-backed insurance fund is withering.
   Mr. Bowsher cited, among other things, the insurance
fund's thinnest reserve ratio in its history, expected fund
losses for the third consecutive year, and a decline in the
value of the bank assets it holds. The fund balance has
dropped to $13.2 billion from $18.3 billion two years ago.
   Moreover, the fund is weakest at a time when the industry
has exposed itself to greater risks than in the past.
Real-estate lending has increased 12% in the Northeast, for
example, and the region's nonperforming category of
real-estate loans has more than doubled in the past year.
Banks continue to be exposed to highly leveraged transactions
and loans to Third World countries. While risk has increased,
Mr. Bowsher said, there has been no relative increase in
equity capital, the cushion to absorb losses, for individual
banks.
   William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which oversees both the bank and thrift insurance
funds, said that he agreed with the GAO's projection that
bank fund losses could reach $2 billion this year. Moreover,
if Congress gives the FDIC the authority to raise insurance
premiums higher, the FDIC would consider it, he said.
   He also hinted that the report may be a political reaction
to the S&amp;L mess. "If I were the GAO, I would cover my rear
end, too," he said.
   Kenneth Guenther, of the Independent Bankers Association
of America, said he thought the report was unnecessarily
bleak. "This is the darkest this kettle has ever been
painted. It doesn't do a lot for consumer confidence in the
financial system."
   But the GAO testimony joins a growing chorus of concerns
about the health of the banking industry from private
economists, including Daniel Brumbaugh of Stanford University
and Robert Litan of Brookings Institution. The Congressional
Budget Office is scheduled to testify on the bank insurance
fund today and is expected to warn of an insurance fund
stretched too far.
   Mr. Bowsher said that assessing the adequacy of the fund
is difficult because accounting rules are frequently used to
hide, rather than identify, problems. Of the 406 banks that
failed in 1988 and 1989, some 31 failed without ever
appearing on the problem-bank list or appearing for only one
quarter. The National Bank of Washington failed recently,
without ever appearing on the list.
   Mr. Bowsher advised regulators to do more on-site
examinations, rather than rely on potentially misleading
audits. "Problems are bigger than are being reported," he
said.
   Mr. Bowsher predicted that 35 banks -- each with assets of
more than $100 million -- would fail this year, including 15
that have already folded. He wouldn't identify them, but said
that the combined assets of the 35 banks totals $45.1
billion. The group was culled from a pool studied by the GAO
that included the 100 largest banks and 200 of the largest
problem banks. None of the 35 are among the 20 largest banks,
Mr. Bowsher added.
   Government policy is to maintain the fund at $1.25 per
$100 of deposits, but currently that figure has dropped to
about 70 cents.
   Yesterday's report provoked a flurry of proposals on
Capitol Hill by legislators reeling from the S&amp;L bailout,
which is expected to cost at least $130 billion. Sen. Robert
Dole (R., Kan.) proposed raising an immediate $1 billion for
the fund by assessing U.S. bank deposits held in foreign
countries.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.) said he will introduce
legislation today to require banks to pay higher premiums.
Some members of the Banking Committee supported Mr. Bowsher's
proposal to raise the insurance premiums before Congress
recesses next month.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush declared that "Saddam Hussein
will fail" in his occupation of Kuwait and that a new world
order will emerge from the crisis.
   In a nationally televised address to Congress, Mr. Bush
used some of his bluntest language yet in asserting that the
U.S. won't ever accept Iraq's occupation of Kuwait --
language that will make it tough for the U.S. to back away
from that stand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait," Mr. Bush
declared. "That's not a threat. That's not a boast. That's
just the way it's going to be."
   Mr. Bush offered no new plan or timetable for getting Iraq
out of Kuwait. He said the economic sanctions against Baghdad
"will take time to have their full intended effect." In the
meantime, he added, the U.S. will review "all options" -- a
phrase the administration uses to refer to possible military
attack.
   If Iraqi officials had hoped Mr. Bush might soften his
stand to pave the way for a negotiated settlement of the
crisis, the hopes must have been shattered by the speech, the
most important of his two-year-old presidency.
   He declared the U.S. won't let "one so ruthless" as Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein dominate the world oil market. And
he said Washington won't let Iraq deter U.S. policy by
holding hundreds of hostages in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   "America and the world must stand up to aggression, and we
will," Mr. Bush said. "And one thing more: In the pursuit of
these goals, America will not be intimidated."
   Mr. Bush's speech wasn't designed to offer any new
initiatives to resolve the crisis, but rather was part of a
campaign to maintain domestic support by regularly
reiterating his case for taking a tough stand. Mr. Bush also
pressed Congress to solve the U.S.'s chronic budget deficit,
saying that doing so is necessary if the U.S. wants to
continue leading the world.
   He called on Congress to pass four ambitious items this
month: legislation with "growth-oriented tax measures"; a
five-year plan to reduce the budget deficit; a new military
spending plan; and measures to increase domestic energy
independence.
   In their official response to the president, congressional
Democrats gave Mr. Bush unqualified support for his Persian
Gulf initiative, but they indicated some differences over his
domestic agenda.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said U.S.
troops are in the Persian Gulf "because it is right," and he
echoed Mr. Bush's uncompromising language toward Iraq. But
his remarks also suggested that other nations, especially
Germany and Japan, haven't done enough to support the effort.
He also emphasized his party's differences with Mr. Bush over
the budget talks, saying that just as wealthy nations should
shoulder part of the cost of the military action, wealthy
Americans should pay their "fair share" of the cost of
reducing the deficit.
   In his address, Mr. Bush repeated the four goals he set
after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait: unconditional Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait; restoration of Kuwait's ousted
government; security of other Persian Gulf countries, and
protection of Americans abroad.
   Mr. Bush also added a fifth goal: establishment of a "new
world order" in which East and West unite to prevent
aggression against smaller nations by larger and more
powerful ones.
   Speaking two days after a meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr. Bush said of the Iraqi invasion: "This
is the first assault on the new world that we seek, the first
test of our mettle. Had we not responded to this first
provocation with clarity of purpose, if we do not continue to
demonstrate our determination, it would be a signal to actual
and potential despots around the world."
   Mr. Bush said the 100,000 U.S. soldiers dispatched to
Saudi Arabia, as well as those sent by other nations, are in
the oil-rich kingdom to "deter and if need be, to defend
against attack" by Iraq.
   But he also seemed to expand goals beyond that by
asserting that part of the U.S. role in the Persian Gulf is
to "curb the proliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic
missile and, above all, nuclear technologies." Mr. Bush
hasn't said he might use the crisis as an opportunity to
destroy Iraq's chemical and nuclear weapons programs, but
some members of Congress have urged him to consider doing so.
   Mr. Bush also made one of his plainest declarations yet
that he won't let the plight of hostages affect policy
decisions.
   Speaking of the Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait, Mr.
Bush said: "Of course, our hearts go out to the hostages and
to their families. But our policy cannot change. And it will
not change. America and the world will not be blackmailed by
this ruthless policy."
   In an attempt to head off congressional criticism that
allies aren't bearing more of the burden of Mideast effort,
Mr. Bush declared that "most of our friends" have given a
"good" response to U.S. appeals that they foot more of the
bill for the dispatch of U.S. troops and give more aid to
nations hurt by the trade embargo.
   Mr. Gephardt singled out Germany and Japan for failing to
do enough to support the U.S. military effort, even though,
he said, they depend far more on Mideast oil than the U.S.
   "When Bangladesh is putting troops in harm's way, so
should our properous and powerful allies," said the Missouri
Democrat. He added that when Americans can stand on the front
lines "only miles from the threat of poison gas, the least
the Japanese and Germans can do is support us -- and not just
with words; they must respond to our potential sacrifice of
lives with at least a financial sacrifice of their own."
   Mr. Gephardt also argued that despite the Gulf action,
cuts in defense spending can be made, particularly for such
costly weapons as the B-2 "Stealth" bomber and the Strategic
Defense Initiative, or Star Wars.
   Mr. Gephardt's remarks reiterated a Democratic position
that could become controversial. "Star Wars, the B-2 bomber
and the MX missile are costly systems designed for a Cold War
that we have already won," he said. "We can and must reduce
the part of the Pentagon budget that is nothing more than
shadow boxing with the past."
   Mr. Bush avoided references to specific defense programs,
simply declaring that "this is no time to risk America's
capacity to protect her vital interests" by cutting defense
too deeply.
   Mr. Bush's use of the occasion to press for his domestic
agenda -- including a capital gains tax reduction -- angered
some people. "I thought the reference to capital gains was
particularly inappropriate at a time when working-class kids
have their butts on the line in Saudi Arabia," said Rep.
David Obey (D., Wis.).
   The reaction of the diplomatic corps to the speech was
restrained. The Iraqi ambassador to the U.S., Mohammed Sadiq
al-Mashat, showed little response.

   TAX SUMMIT could produce bill larded with breaks for
narrow interests.
   Both Democrats and Republicans are pushing for expanded
tax benefits for individual retirement accounts. Democrats
would give the incentives when money is put into the account;
Republicans would hold the breaks until money is withdrawn.
Citing the Persian Gulf crisis, both parties also are angling
to reinstate tax incentives for oil drilling like the ones
that were pared back in tax revision just four years ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Each side inches toward extending permanently a slew of
soon-to-expire tax breaks, though they each choose their own
favorites. Republicans press President Bush's research and
development credits and the 25% deduction for purchase of
health insurance by self-employed people. They leave out the
low-income housing credit, which they know is a priority of
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
   The Democrats' proposal includes a $1.2 billion fund to
pay for the members' special give-aways.
                                                                                                       

   SAGGING TAX REVENUES skew budget plans in most states.
   With weak economies, waning consumer confidence and
shrinking Federal assistance, "it's going to be a rough year
for states," says Ron Snell of the National Conference of
State Legislators. More than 30 states already are predicting
revenues this fiscal year will fall below projections, with
New England and Mid-Atlantic states among the hardest hit.
Virginia dourly contemplates a $1.4 billion revenue crunch
over two years. Florida revenue officials expect to come up
$500 million short this year. Maryland sees a $150 million
gap.
   Texas and other oil-producing states, though, could see
increased petrodollars flowing from tensions in the Middle
East. Though Texas crude is selling for $31 a barrel now, up
from $19 a year ago, "we aren't making any predictions yet,"
says the state comptroller's office. But Texas figures each
dollar increase in crude prices could bring in $50 million of
additional taxes a year.
                                                                                                       

   MASSACHUSETTS STRUGGLES to write rules for new 5% tax on
services.
   "It's going to get tricky," allows Revenue Commissioner
Stephen Kidder. With less than three months left before the
Dec. 1 effective date for most categories, "we're still not
too far down the road on a lot of collection issues," he
says. And new problems crop up almost daily. Just last week,
the Boston Ballet and Boston Garden came asking whether
customers who already have purchased tickets for next season
must now pay the levy. Forget it, they were told.
   Lawyers, accountants, architects and engineers -- who have
been protesting the tax as unenforceable since it became law
in August -- wish they could forget about it, too. The
state's revenue officials "don't have a clue about what goes
on inside a law or accounting firm," contends Ned Hines, a
Boston lawyer who is challenging the constitutionality of the
new tax. Joe Donovan of CPAs Coopers &amp; Lybrand complains that
state officials aren't even sure whether tax preparation and
consulting services should be taxed.
   Massachusetts' ability to resolve such issues could be a
litmus test for other states hungry for new revenue sources.
                                                                                                       

   TREASURY'S LONG-AWAITED report on eliminating double
taxation of corporate dividends will have to be awaited still
more. The deadline, first April or May, then Nov. 30, now
"might slip" again "toward the end of the year," a Treasury
official says.
                                                                                                       

   STAY HOME] The IRS, in a final version of a rule proposed
19 months ago, says it no longer will grant an automatic
two-month extension to taxpayers traveling outside the U.S.
on April 15. Military personnel overseas, though, still get
the break.
                                                                                                       

   SOAK THE RICH, but spare the champagne. Democrats exempt
sparkling wine in their proposal to lift taxes on other
booze. The apparent reason: Champagne, as the industry has
tirelessly pointed out, is already taxed at a much higher
rate than other alcoholic beverages.
                                                                                                       

   A DIVORCE SETTLEMENT doesn't cut a required IRA
distribution, the IRS says.
   A chap we'll call Chagrined turned 70 1/2 in 1988, so in
1989 he was required to make a minimum taxable withdrawal
from his individual retirement account based on his life
expectancy and the IRA's value as of Dec. 31, 1988. But
Chagrined got divorced in 1989 and, under the settlement
terms, he transferred half the value of his IRA that year to
his ex-wife. Hoping to save some tax dollars, he asked the
IRS to figure the 1989 minimum distribution on what he owned
after the divorce, not in 1988 before the decree.
   IRS private ruling 9011031 sends regrets. Chagrined was
still married in 1988, and that's the date that will have to
be used in valuing the IRA assets, the service holds,
contending there is no authority for recognizing changes
after the date set by the regulations. But all's not lost,
notes publisher Research Institute of America.
   Starting this year, Chagrined will be able to reduce his
payout to reflect the IRA's post-divorce worth.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: John Monaco, a 28-year veteran of the IRS, is
named director of the service's Coordinated Examination
Program, which audits returns of the nation's 1,500 largest
corporations. . . . Taxpayers eager to avoid IRS user fees
should delay filing ruling requests until after Sept. 29,
when the authority for the fees runs out. But not too long
after, because the charges are likely to be reimposed, CPAs
Laventhol &amp; Horwath suggests.

   Big Board Seeks $50 Million From Drexel

   Exchange Continues
   Probe of Individuals

   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange sought federal
bankruptcy-court permission to bring disciplinary proceedings
against Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. that could result
in a record Big Board fine of as much as $50 million.
   Lawyers for the Big Board said the exchange wants to
punish Drexel for the securities-law violations and fraud it
pleaded guilty to last September. But the exchange has been
stymied by Drexel's bankruptcy proceedings. Under bankruptcy
law, the exchange can't take any action against the company
without the court's approval.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a hearing in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan,
Michael Levin, an attorney for the exchange, also said that
the Big Board is continuing its investigation of individual
Drexel officials. The exchange doesn't need court permission
to pursue its case against the individuals, who are said to
include former Drexel Chief Executive Officer Frederick
Joseph.
   Mr. Levin said the exchange wants to impose a large fine
on Drexel to send a message to other firms. He said Drexel's
actions had an "extensive, seriously disruptive impact on the
financial markets of the U.S."
   The fine -- if approved after an exchange hearing -- would
become an unsecured claim against Drexel. Drexel filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code on Feb. 13.
   Both Drexel and its creditors committee opposed the Big
Board's request, claiming that it will unfairly penalize
creditors and stockholders. In a filing with U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Howard Buschman III, Drexel said it had already been
adequately punished financially: the firm agreed to pay fines
and penalties totaling $650 million to the Securities and
Exchange Commission for the same wrongdoing at issue in the
Big Board's case.
   "What is at issue here is an effort to obtain a windfall
from {Drexel}," said Lawrence P. Gottesman, an attorney for
the creditors' committee. He said the proceeding would waste
the debtor's resources by requiring it to litigate the same
issues that were settled by Drexel's guilty plea and SEC
agreement last year.
   Richard Krasnow, an attorney for Drexel, said, "Censure
isn't the focus. . . . What they are seeking is simply to
extract a fine, to add their numbers to the $650 million that
is already being sought" by the SEC.
   Roy Regozin, another attorney for Drexel, said the company
will strongly contest the exchange's charges because of the
huge fine that is being sought. The proposed fine -- $25
million each for the parent company and the brokerage unit --
would be the largest that the Big Board has ever imposed on a
securities firm. In the previous record, E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.
was fined $400,000 in 1985 after pleading guilty to felonies
in a check-kiting scheme.
   According to bankruptcy court filings, the Big Board first
brought administrative charges against Drexel last November.
The exchange charged that by pleading guilty last year,
Drexel also was admitting that it had "engaged in acts
detrimental to the interest or welfare of the exchange."
   The exchange, in its filing with Judge Buschman, said
Drexel had made a settlement offer to the Big Board, but that
the amount was too low. The exchange said it responded on
March 7 by telling Drexel it would accept nothing less than
$25 million and a censure of the firm to settle the charges.
   When Drexel didn't respond to the exchange's deadlines for
settlement talks, a hearing was set for May 31, despite
Drexel's objections. Two days before the hearing, Drexel's
brokerage unit filed for bankruptcy-law protection --
triggering the automatic bankruptcy-law stay that halted the
proceedings. Although the parent company had filed for
bankruptcy protection in February, the exchange could still
proceed as long as the brokerage unit hadn't filed.
   Judge Buschman said he would rule on the Big Board's
request within a month. During the hearing, Judge Buschman
said he was inclined to allow the exchange to continue with
efforts to censure or suspend Drexel, but that he might delay
efforts to seek a fine.
   Meanwhile, according to individuals familiar with the
ongoing investigation, Big Board attorneys have subpoenaed
former Drexel employees to testify to determine whether Mr.
Joseph and others failed to properly supervise Michael
Milken, the former Drexel junk-bond chief who pleaded guilty
to charges relating to illegal trading. The Big Board has
indicated that it may seek fines against Mr. Joseph and
others. Mr. Joseph hasn't been charged with any crime.
   A Drexel spokesman issued the following statement
yesterday: "We believe the stock exchange, once it completes
its study, will recognize that the transgressions involved
verbal agreements that were not disclosed to the firm and
which could not have been otherwise detected by any firm."

   PHILADELPHIA -- Sam Karlin says his grandmother killed her
husband and her children, and then took her own life. She did
it with a knife -- a butter knife.
   Today, determined to avoid the same death by cholesterol,
Mr. Karlin and his family have made their home a fort in the
war on fat. In the basement they keep a stockroom of canned,
defatted chicken broth and packaged rice cakes. From another
room, filled with anti-fat propaganda, they run a support
group for 200 other dieters of the fat-free persuasion. Mr.
Karlin, a science teacher who sells insurance on the side,
has written a poem for the group that reads, in part:

   Our sex life got better (if you know what I mean),
   `Cause it's better in bed when your arteries are clean]
                                                                                                       

   For the Karlins and others, the fat-free diet is more than
an ideal: It is a sacred mission.
   It is also, many doctors say, a mission impossible: People
can't reduce the percentage of calories provided by fat in
their diet much below 10% for a prolonged period, and if they
could, it could cause serious health problems or even death.
   Still, the dedicated keep trying. While many
health-conscious Americans have reduced their consumption of
fatty foods, the fat-free purists strive to avoid fat
entirely. "People say you should do everything in
moderation," says Sam Karlin's wife, Judy. "But moderation
doesn't work."
   True believers in fat-free diets even reject some
vegetables. "I'm good 98% of the time," says fat fighter
Janet Abrams of Palm Desert, Calif. But in the other 2%, she
says, "I cheat." Her transgression: an occasional olive or
avocado. Treason, say others. "Fat is the enemy," asserts Jay
Reifer, another fat-free convert in suburban Philadelphia.
"This isn't a diet; it's a way of life."
   It's not an easy life. Sam Karlin's brother, Harvey, says
Sam nearly came to blows with a waiter after finding traces
of Bernaise sauce on his chicken at a family dinner in a
restaurant. Friends think the Karlins are nuts. Triglycerides
and bowel movements make less than engaging table talk over
hors d'oeuvres (not that the Karlins would touch canapes,
anyway.) The Karlins, who ran with a social dinner crowd, say
they don't get as many invitations any more. "We lost
friends," Mrs. Karlin says.
   "Things are not the same as they were," observes Diane
Boss, who was the maid of honor at Mrs. Karlin's wedding. The
Karlins' diet, she says, "definitely affects the
relationship." Another friend, Sandee Silverstein, who has
seen the Karlins through their lean times, adds: "When
somebody says I'm not going to eat anything at your affair,
for some people, that's very aggravating."
   The Karlins hauled their own low-fat turkeyburgers to a
friend's barbecue. On another occasion they brought a carob
mousse to a host's house. He took one bite and set it on the
floor for his dog.
   Finding fat-free food away from home is a problem for many
other dieters, too. Chris Copetas, an assistant district
attorney in Pittsburgh, moved a refrigerator and a microwave
oven into his courthouse office to prepare his own fat-free
lunches. William van Arsdale, treasurer of Gettysburg College
in Pennsylvania, telephones ahead to restaurants to order
steamed vegetables, salad without dressing and baked potatoes
without sour cream or butter, and whole-grain bread.
   Mr. van Arsdale is another dieter who occasionally slips.
He says he often exceeds his daily limit of six pieces of
fruit and eats as many as eight or nine. Mr. Karlin owns up
to lustfully looking into a South Street cheese-steak shop.
But, he says, he didn't succumb. Mentally visualizing "what
such food would do to my coronary artery," he says, helps him
put the devil behind him and stick to such healthy fare as a
plate of garbanzo beans washed down with diluted fruit juice.
Afterward, he says, "I get up from the table and feel good. I
see the clear artery."
   Once connoisseurs of Big Macs and peanut butter, the
Karlins now carry oil-free dressing and non-fat dry milk
wherever they go. (Mortified by the brown paper bag they
carried everywhere with their special milk, dressing and
other items, brother Harvey bought them a camera bag so they
could be more discreet.) They spend their weekends devising
new uses for dry-curd cottage cheese.
   Sunday brunch in their home in northern Philadelphia
includes whole-wheat crepes filled with their cottage cheese,
egg white omelettes, and a coffee substitute made from
barley.
   "Some of this stuff is awful," concedes Mr. Karlin, 44. He
says a fat-free pumpkin bread turned out so mushy that the
family drank it. The Karlins' cheesecake, made of their
no-fat cottage cheese, looks great garnished with strawberry
and kiwi. But it tastes like this newspaper.
   Even Mrs. Karlin, 41, has an occasional doubt. "Am I
brainwashed?" she wonders, covering her toast with imitation
cream cheese she made by straining non-fat yogurt.
   "They're absolutely crazy," cookbook author Julia Child
says of fat-free dieters in general. "Why torture yourself?"
She says studies show that chimpanzees with super-lean diets
are more vicious and angry than their fat-feasting peers.
Some research also suggests that lowering cholesterol in
humans is associated with increased assertiveness and
violence. "If you don't have fun you're not going to last
long," Ms. Child says. "Life isn't worth living that way."
   The wiry though not underfed Karlins disagree. They are
proud of their frenetic energy. Mrs. Karlin credits her rosy
complexion to the diet, and son Joseph, 18, claims it spared
him teen-age acne.
   The Karlins have resorted to subterfuge to avoid fat.
Visiting Disney World, they lied that they had health
problems so they could get a refrigerator in their room for
their non-fat delicacies. When an unenlightened client handed
Mr. Karlin a Coke recently, he excused himself to the
bathroom, flushed it down, and returned.
   Nutritionists aren't sure that low-fat diets will yield
longer lives than more moderate eating. The American Heart
Association recommends a diet with a caloric intake provided
30% by fat. (One gram of fat has nine calories; a gram of
protein or carbohydrate has four.)
   Extremely low-fat diets are "a pretty risky concept," says
Dr. Burton Kallman of the American Dietetic Association. Some
fatty acids are essential to health. And too little fat can
impair the body's ability to utilize some vitamins. "Fat does
a lot of positive things," says Jeanne Goldberg, professor at
the Tufts University nutrition school. "It adds to a feeling
of fullness and it carries flavor."
   Many doctors say the health benefits of ultra-low-fat
diets remain uncertain. One study last month reported that
reducing caloric fat intake could shrink arterial deposits,
but doctors generally agree that the evidence is
inconclusive. "You can't prove that if you eat a 20% fat diet
you'll live longer than if you ate 30%," says Dr. Neil Stone
of Northwestern University's medical school, a member of the
heart association's nutrition committee. In any case, he
says, few people can stick with extremely low-fat diets.
   Even among militants the attrition rate is high. Dr.
Stephen Inkeles of the Pritikin Longevity Center, in Santa
Monica, Calif., says only a quarter of those without previous
medical problems who take part in the center's diet stay on
the diet fully. Half abandon it entirely.
   Despite all their problems, the Karlins say they're happy
with their diet. They accept that they need some fat to live
and don't believe that they are getting too little because,
Mr. Karlin says, they look good and feel good. Says Mr.
Karlin, quoting from his ode:
                                                                                                       

   So when friends criticize and say, "Your eating's
bizarre,"
   Don't be upset, you'll outlive them by far.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- In an unusual four-way deal, ASK
Computer Systems Inc. said it agreed to acquire software
maker Ingres Corp. using, in part, funds gained from stock
ASK will sell to Hewlett-Packard Co. and EDS Corp.
   ASK, a producer of management systems for manufacturing
companies, said it will pay about $123 million in cash and
debt repayments for Ingres, an Alameda, Calif., maker of
database software. ASK said it will sell a 30% stake to H-P
and EDS, a General Motors Corp. unit, for $60 million to help
generate funds for the acquisition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move is something of a coup for ASK Chief Executive
Officer Sandra Kurtzig, an ASK founder who rejoined the
company last year after a four-year absence, because the
three new partners pull in components that are crucial to the
company's success.
   ASK already uses Ingres software in its programs, which
link companies' manufacturing and accounting departments to
the same database. H-P is already a big supplier of
workstations to ASK, which sells the machines with its
software packages. And the link with H-P and EDS, both of
which are big suppliers of systems to manufacturers, could
help ASK in marketing its products to a broader range of
manufacturers. ASK said it expects to announce further
agreements with EDS and H-P in the near future that could
include marketing pacts.
   "Getting the EDS seal of approval on their software is a
very nice feather in their cap," said analyst Charles Taylor
of Prudential-Bache Securities, who said he had never seen
anything like ASK's four-way deal before.
   The pact provides a savior for Ingres, which has been
troubled by falling net income, which dropped to $76,000 in
the year ended June 30 from $6.2 million a year earlier. Last
May, Ingres agreed to sell a minority stake to Digital
Equipment Corp. but the deal fell through when the two
couldn't agree on terms. ASK, which had been in discussions
with Ingres before the Digital deal, then offered to acquire
Ingres, Ms. Kurtzig said.
   Although the deal doesn't represent a very large
investment for H-P or EDS, the ASK connection gives them a
link with a strong company in an important niche in the
rapidly growing field of computer-integrated manufacturing.
"ASK is one of the very few leading companies in the
manufacturing-software business and possibly the only one
available to make an investment in," said Mr. Taylor, the
Prudential-Bache analyst.
   While ASK's Ms. Kurtzig calls the acquisition "a home
run," analysts such as Mr. Taylor say ASK could be in for
rough times. The database market is sluggish already, a
plight illustrated by the once-highflying Oracle Systems
Corp.'s announcement last week that it expected to report a
quarterly loss. What's more, ASK has seen profits slide over
the past several quarters as it prepares new products. The
merger "combines Ask's mediocre results with
less-than-mediocre results from Ingres," said analyst David
Bayer of Montgomery Securities. "The transition period could
be fraught with peril."
   Under the agreement, ASK will pay $9.25 a share, or about
$110 million, for Ingres' stock and will also pay off the $12
million to $15 million debt on Ingres's books. H-P and EDS
will pay $10.78 a share for ASK stock, H-P buying a 10% stake
for about $20 million and EDS buying a 20% stake for $40
million. ASK said that Chase Manhattan Bank agreed to provide
$20 million in financing for the offer.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Ingres's stock
closed at $9, up $3.625, while ASK's stock closed at $8,
unchanged.

   Lotus Trims Goals

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. said it has
lowered its growth and profitability goals, reflecting what
it calls a "maturation" of the software market.
   Jim P. Manzi, chairman and president of the software
maker, said, however, that growth and profit trends should
become more predictable than they have been. Lotus is aiming
for long-term revenue growth in the 20% to 25% annual range,
eased from a previous 25% target. Last year, revenue grew 19%
to $556 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Manzi said the company also has scaled back its goal
of 25% pretax profit margins. But he noted that the new
target of a 20% to 25% range would represent an improvement
over the company's actual margins of 15% last year and 17% in
1988.
   Lotus's stock fell sharply yesterday in the wake of
reports that the targets had been cut to 20%. Lotus said the
report was incorrect, and the stock rebounded from a low of
$15.25 a share but still closed at $16.50, down $1.50, in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Mr. Manzi also said that the company is raising its target
for return on equity to a range of 25% to 30% from 25%.
   He said the lower growth goal reflects slower growth in
sales of personal computers. However, he said that because
Lotus will be getting more of its revenue from recurring
software maintenance fees and product upgrades rather than
from PC sales, the revenue will be more predictable than it
has been.
   "This isn't rocket science," he said. "There is a
long-term dynamic going on in the entire industry." He
declined to make predictions for specific periods. Lotus
earlier disappointed investors by forecasting an earnings
downturn for the third quarter.

   Dividend Drought Is Ominous Sign for Stocks

   Slowdown Suggests
   Fall in Profit Growth

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- There's a dividend drought in the stock
market.
   Dividend increases this year are down 21.7% through
August, setting the stage for one of the leanest years of
dividend growth since 1971, according to Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., which follows dividend practices of 7,000 companies.
Moreover, dividend cuts are up 42% through August, S&amp;P says,
and dividend omissions, while a relatively small number, are
up 86.5%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dividend trends reflect corporate managements' outlook for
profits, and they currently point to a broad slowing of
corporate profit growth. That's bad news for the stock
market, particularly with "growth stocks" -- shares of
companies producing steady, above-average earnings increases
-- in vogue. As third quarter earnings reports come gushing
out in about a month, investors may be surprised to discover
that the profit slowdown has spread even to the reliable
growth companies, some analysts warn.
   "We are in a dividend recession," says Arnold Kaufman,
editor of S&amp;P's "Outlook" newsletter and follower of dividend
trends. "There are too few profits, and there's too much
debt."
   Dividends are how companies distribute a portion of their
earnings to shareholders. They are one of two ways investors
make money in stocks. Though price appreciation can deliver
potentially far larger payoffs, waning dividend growth can
substantially hurt long-term investors.
   Through August, S&amp;P says 904 companies of the 7,000 it
follows increased dividends, down from 1,155 last year. But
even this number of increases may be deceptive about the
overall trend. "Most of the increases are carryovers from
late in 1989," says George Boyd III, director of quantitative
research at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., "so the rate of dividend
increase next year will be minimal."
   The dividend drought is hitting small companies the
hardest, Mr. Kaufman says. That is one reason why small
stocks have performed much worse than large stocks this year.
   Many big companies whose stocks are in the S&amp;P 500 index
are still increasing dividends. S&amp;P expects the 500 stocks in
its index to collectively pay out $12 in dividends this year
compared with $11.05 last year, an increase of 8.6%. In 1989,
dividends grew 14% for the year, the highest growth rate
since 1977. Average annual dividend growth for the 500
companies is 6%.
   But Steven Einhorn, chief strategist at Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co., is alarmed at the slowing rate of dividend growth. "In
1991, we think dividend growth will be at about 5% on the S&amp;P
500," he says. Measured against Goldman's inflation forecast
of 5.5%, inflation-adjusted dividend "growth" will be -0.5%
in 1991. That would be the first time since 1984 that "real"
dividend growth turned negative. (Stocks were lackluster
investments in 1984: The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost
3.74%; the S&amp;P 500 index rose 1.4%.)
   "If we're right, the powerful dividend thrust of the
market is about to disappear," says Mr. Einhorn. That's one
reason he's bearish on stocks, he says.
   Dividends grew rapidly at the end of the 1980s. Companies
fending off corporate raiders courted shareholders with huge
one-time payouts. Also, robust business conditions allowed
dozens of companies to divide abundant cash to stockholders.
Now, takeovers are history and corporate profits are sagging.
   "Companies are going to be more tightfisted in sending
cash out while the future of the economy is uncertain," says
Geraldine Weiss, author of a book about an investment
strategy based on dividends called "Dividends Don't Lie."
Even so, Ms. Weiss says the stock market's recent fall has
enhanced the appeal of many stocks with histories of steadily
higher dividends.
   Among her recent favorites is American Business Products,
an office supplies company. In a recent newsletter, Ms. Weiss
notes that last year the company had a record profit and its
51st consecutive year of sales growth. Long-term debt is only
9.9% of total capital, Ms. Weiss points out, and the company
has increased dividends for 33 consecutive years at an
average annual rate of 15%. The stock has a relatively low
ratio of price to per-share earnings of about 10 compared
with 15 on the S&amp;P 500.
   Most important, Ms. Weiss says, the stock's dividend yield
is about 4.5%. Dividend yield is an expression of the current
annual dividend as a percentage of a stock's price. High
dividend yield means that a company is trading cheaply
compared to the amount it is paying out to shareholders. It's
an important measure of value in the stock market.
   Among other undervalued, high-yielding stocks Ms. Weiss
likes are Security Pacific Corp. (yielding 9.2%); business --
form printer John H. Harland Co. (yielding 3.6%); and Diebold
Inc. (yielding 3.9%), a maker of automated tellers and
security systems.
   Peter L. Bernstein, an economist and one of Wall Street's
foremost dividend watchers, has two warnings for investors
about the current dividend climate.
   When corporations protect dividends even though earnings
are weakening, retained earnings (net earnings minus dividend
payments) can tumble. "Retained earnings are going to jump
around a lot," Mr. Bernstein says. "And the volatility of
stock prices has a close relationship to the volatility of
retained earnings."
   And when earnings aren't zagging stock prices, expect a
zig from the bond market, Mr. Bernstein cautions. As dividend
growth stagnates, stocks become more like bonds and therefore
more sensitive to changes in interest rates.
   "Dividend growth is clearly a very important determinant
to what happens to the stock market," Mr. Bernstein says.
"And the case for dividend growth is a weak one."

   Quarter's Net Was Flat
   On 9% Rise in Revenue

   ATLANTA -- Courier Dispatch Group Inc. expects to report
that revenue for its fourth quarter and year ended June 30
rose about 9% and 8%, respectively, from year-earlier
periods, Paul R. Dean, president and chief executive officer,
said.
   Mr. Dean said in an interview that earnings for the fourth
quarter were flat because of large expenditures to improve
operations. He projected that earnings in the current quarter
"will be up sharply" from the $101,000, or four cents a
share, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, 1989.

   Courier, which provides air and ground delivery services,
primarily in New England, the Southeast and upper Midwest,
expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of between $160,000
and $190,000, or between six cents and eight cents a share,
Mr. Dean said. A year ago, net income was $189,000, or seven
cents a share. Fourth-quarter revenue could be as much as $14
million, he said, compared with $12.3 million a year ago.
   A major acquisition in Alabama in April, expanded
operations in New England and Florida and efforts to replace
current vehicles with more fuel-efficient ones are
contributing to improved performance, he said.
   Mr. Dean said that for the year Courier's net fell to
between $400,000 and $600,000, or between 16 cents and 19
cents a share, from $723,000, or 28 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue was between $49 million and $51 million,
compared with $47.1 million a year earlier.
   Courier has added a temporary fuel surcharge -- about 2%
-- to its services because of the Mideast crisis, Mr. Dean
said. The increase hasn't cost the company any customers.
Courier expects to remove the surcharge, "as soon as we see
some relief in fuel prices," he said.

   Senators Assail West Germany, Japan
   For Providing `Token Aid' in Mideast

   WASHINGTON -- Several senators criticized West Germany and
Japan for failing to shoulder a larger portion of the cost of
military operations in the Middle East amid signs the crisis
is likely to last at least several months.
   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in their
first public examination of the issue in detail, rebuked the
two allies for providing what they contend is token
assistance. Testifying before the panel, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney acknowleged that promised contributions "may well
be inadequate," and he indicated the administration is
determined to increase pressure for substantially greater
assistance from European and other nations.

   The tone of the comments by senators, coming on the heels
of administration announcements of significant allied
financial support, underscores increasing congressional
concern over the escalating cost and duration of the
deployment of U.S. troops, ships and planes in the Mideast.
Some Army planners, for instance, are operating under the
assumption that a major contingent of U.S. ground forces may
have to remain in Saudi Arabia for as long as two years, with
fresh troops coming into the nation every six months.
   While Secretary Cheney didn't give a specific timetable,
both his comments and the testimony of Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggest U.S.
commanders are convinced Iraq won't withdraw from Kuwait
soon. Responding to a question about whether Iraq might
attack as its economy deteriorates, Secretary Cheney said,
"We'll be able to answer that question a lot better a year
from now. . . . I don't know ultimately how it's going to be
resolved."
   Gen. Powell told the panel that the Pentagon will continue
to build up forces in the Middle East but that "we haven't
come down firmly on six months" as the time to replace
troops.
   U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia include more than 75,000
troops and nearly 1,000 helicopters, according to Pentagon
officials, with some 100 U.S. cargo vessels and Navy ships
participating in the operation. For the next few weeks or
months, Mr. Cheney said, U.S. forces will focus on thwarting
any attack by Iraq. "Certainly I have not been given any
instructions to carry out offensive action," he said. The
U.S. role "may well involve a longer term commitment than we
expected" before the deployment was well under way, he said.
   In his most specific projection so far, Secretary Cheney
said he expects contributions from Arab nations and other
allies to cover about half of the roughly $15 billion annual
cost of maintaining U.S. troops, planes and ships in Saudi
Arabia and nearby waters. "The response to date has been more
than we have ever gotten before" from allies, Mr. Cheney
said, "but it may well be inadequate."
   Last week, other administration officials indicated that
contributions from Arab states would be enough to cover most
of the extra costs.
   Members of the committee were eager to criticize the level
of foreign assistance, even as many of them maneuvered to
garner credit for providing free mailing privileges, imminent
danger pay, income-tax waivers and other benefits to the
troops in Saudi Arabia. Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), the main
sponsor of one such bill, said it would add an estimated $700
million to the overall annual cost of the operation.
   Noting that West Germany has agreed to provide as much as
$8 billion to subsidize Soviet troops remaining in East
Germany, Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine) accused Bonn of
offering "little more than pocket-change" to help refugees
and resolve the crisis in the Middle East. Sen. John McCain
(R., Ariz.) called promises of West German contributions
"almost an insult," which he warned could "dramatically erode
the very strong relationship" between Washington and Bonn.
   The Japanese government, which previously pledged $1
billion to help the effort against Iraq and is now
considering giving another $2 billion to Egypt, Turkey and
Jordan -- the nations hit hardest by the economic sanctions
against Iraq -- also was attacked. Referring to Tokyo's claim
that it is legally barred from providing substantial
assistance to U.S. forces in the Middle East, Sen. McCain
said, "They have proved once again that they have the world's
most flexible constitution."
   Mr. Cheney sketched a scenario in which the embargo will
soon begin to hurt the Iraqi economy badly. "We're confident
that we've been able to close off (Iraq's) ability to export
oil," he said.
   Mr. Cheney said the Pentagon was "taking measures" to
enhance protection of U.S. troops and civilians overseas and
at home because "terrorism is potentially a significant
weapon in the Iraqi arsenal." He said U.S. officials "have
received bomb threats, death threats, and verbal warnings
from international terrorist organizations."
   Meanwhile, the State Department announced that Iraq said
it would permit U.S. males born in Iraq, Kuwait or other Arab
nations to leave, along with the women and children Baghdad
has been permitting to depart. State Department Spokesman
Richard Boucher said the announcement was "an important
development. It's news that we welcome." But he added, "As we
have seen in the past, there are sometimes wrinkles inserted"
by Iraq in such offers.
   Mr. Boucher also said the U.S. is arranging for two more
charter flights to evacuate U.S. citizens from Kuwait and
Iraq, tentatively scheduled to leave Baghdad today and
Friday.
   He said about 600 Americans have been evacuated from
Kuwait and Iraq so far and estimated that about 1,700 U.S.
citizens remained in Kuwait and about 100 in Iraq.
