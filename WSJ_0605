   Japanese Banks
   Put Aside Plans
   To Enter Taiwan

   HONG KONG -- Under pressure from China, several Japanese
banks in recent days have shelved plans to enter the Taiwan
market.
   As many as eight Japanese banks had been expected to
follow Bank of Tokyo after it announced plans in May to open
a representative office in Taiwan. But after criticism of
those plans by People's Bank of China late last week, the
other Japanese banks got the message "not to go to Taiwan
now," according to the managing director of a large Japanese
bank in Hong Kong.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Bank of Tokyo spokesman said the bank still intends to
open a Taipei office. But he said that the issue is "very
sensitive" and that bank officials are conferring this week
on those plans and China's reaction.
   A Bank of Tokyo official in Hong Kong said the bank hopes
the controversy dies down so the Taipei office can quietly
open in July as planned, but he conceded that some executives
in Tokyo want to reconsider the move.
   Bank of Tokyo's move into Taiwan surprised banking
analysts. Though Japanese banks long ago recognized the
island's economic potential, relations with China had always
been considered too sensitive to risk establishing direct
commercial ties with Taiwan, which China continues to claim
is part of its territory. Many Japanese banks have used Hong
Kong subsidiaries to do business with Taiwan.
   If Bank of Tokyo goes ahead, it would be the first
Japanese bank to enter Taiwan since Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank set
up an office in 1960. Dai-Ichi Kangyo's ties to Taiwan have
kept it barred from doing any substantial business with China
in the past three decades.
   Still, Japanese authorities apparently thought the time
might be right for a change in policy. Japanese banks have
done little business with China in the past year because of a
government curb on new loans since the Chinese government's
massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last June.
Meanwhile, Taiwan's economy has remained robust, and economic
relations between China and Taiwan appeared to be improving.
   In addition, some large Japanese securities companies had
received clearance from Tokyo to buy into Taipei brokerage
firms. But unlike the banks, which have extensive loans
outstanding to China and hope eventually to resume
substantial lending, the securities firms have little
business with China and so can't be as easily pressured, a
Japanese banker in Hong Kong said.
   However, the Japanese banks haven't given up on Taiwan, he
said. They are merely waiting "for a more appropriate time."
A spokesman for Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
going into Taiwan is a "private decision for the banks to
make."

   Digital Tape
   Decks in U.S.

   CHICAGO -- Sony Corp. said it will begin shipping this
month in the U.S. a tape deck called the digital audio tape,
or DAT, recorder. DAT machines record and play music with
almost no distortion.
   Sony is the first major Japanese electronics concern to
announce a firm price and shipping date for DAT recorders in
the U.S. While DAT machines have a small following in Japan,
most Japanese companies haven't sold the decks in the U.S.
because of opposition from the recording industry, which
argues that the decks will inspire pirating.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sony's entry could change that sheepishness. Japan's
electronics companies typically are quick to follow the lead
of companies such as Sony into new markets.
   Sony said it will begin shipping later this month two DAT
models, the $900 DTC-700 and the $950 DTC-75ES. The decks,
which can record digital music directly from compact disks,
contain circuitry meant to prevent rampant copying. Called
the Serial Copy Management System, the circuitry allows the
user to make only one digital copy from a digital music
source, such as a compact disk, that contains a special
copy-prevention signal.
   The machine is too highly priced to be accepted by the
mass of U.S. consumers, who tend to put off purchases of
electronic equipment until prices fall below $500. And there
is little music that is pre-recorded on DAT cartridges, which
are slightly smaller than conventional audio cassette tapes.
Industry executives say there must be a critical mass of
thousands of tapes available before sales of the decks take
off.
   But Sony said its machines will sell for a street price of
under $800 and that future machines would come down in price
rapidly.
   "Once recording companies see DAT as a viable format,
they'll come to the party," said Martin Homlish, president of
Sony Audio Component System Co., the Sony Unit that sells
audio equipment in the U.S. "It just may take a little time,
as it did with the compact disk, which is now the
bread-and-butter of the record industry."
   Mr. Homlish said Sony expects Americans to buy about
100,000 DAT players over the next 12 months. In contrast,
about 4.5 million compact-disk players are sold in the U.S.
every year, he said.
   Sony said its Sony Classical unit this month will
distribute 10 prerecorded $19.95 DAT cassettes featuring such
musicians as Vladimir Horowitz, Isaac Stern, Zubin Mehta and
Yo-Yo Ma. Sony said its Sony Magnetic Products Co. unit will
sell blank DAT cartridges for $12 to $18.
   Sony's announcement wasn't unexpected: Last January it
said it would begin selling the machines this summer, but
didn't give a firm date or prices. Rival Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. also said in January that it would sell a DAT
machine this year. Other audio heavyweights, such as Pioneer
Electronic Corp., said this month that they don't plan to
sell DAT machines until the prospects of their use are more
certain.

   Elusive Subs -- Believed
   To be Soviet -- Rile Navy

   STOCKHOLM -- In the fading light of May 15, the Royal
Swedish Navy faced a familiar problem: Sonar signals showed
an unidentified submarine lurking underneath a major Swedish
naval exercise in the Baltic Sea near here.
   First noisemakers, a kind of underwater firecracker, were
dropped to warn the sub it was prowling in Swedish waters.
When the sub didn't move, the Swedes dropped Elmas,
grenade-like weapons designed to burn small holes in a sub's
hull -- not big enough to sink it, but big enough to make it
surface. They apparently missed. In the confusion of the
exploding grenades, sonar contact with the sub was lost.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Excitement and frustration come with the job when you are
a Swedish anti-submarine officer. While the tensions of the
Cold War are winding down elsewhere, the Swedes worry that
continuing Soviet submarine patrols in their waters are
somehow related to Soviet contingency planning for World War
III.
   "They continue to come. They are using new patterns and
they are more careful," says Gen. Bengt Gustafsson,
commander-in-chief of Sweden's armed forces. In February, he
says, the Swedish navy spent a week tracking a small sub
patrolling inside a mine field meant to stop submarines from
entering Stockholm's harbor.
   The navy triggered three of the mines, to no effect.
Later, a Swedish helicopter got sonar contact with a
submarine-shaped object and dumped a load of Elmas on it. It
turned out to be an old artillery target that had been sunk
years ago.
   "As long as you don't have the ultimate evidence, you can
do nothing about it politically," says Gen. Gustafsson, who
adds he has no hard proof of the nationality of the recent
intruders. Nonetheless, he is convinced their presence
relates to some kind of "operational preparedness" on the
part of the Soviets.
   Operational preparedness for what? That question bothers
many Swedes. A current best seller here is "Operation Garbo,"
a Tom Clancy-like thriller explaining how Soviet subs would
be used to disrupt Swedish mobilization plans on the eve of a
Soviet invasion.
   "They {the Soviets} do it because they have done it for a
very long time and there is no risk associated with it," says
Carl Bildt, leader of the Moderate Party in the Swedish
parliament and a critic of what he considers Sweden's lagging
defense budgets. He says he believes the subs are part of a
plan to give the Soviets control of the Baltic in case of
war.
   "It is very difficult for us to find them. It will also be
very difficult for intruders to continue forever like this
without being hit," says Anders Thunborg, Sweden's ambassador
to the U.S. and a former head of Sweden's Defense Ministry.
"That's why it's a very dangerous situation for them {the
Soviets} if they are doing it."
   Ambassador Thunborg gives the Swedish government's
official estimate of submarine incidents -- about two a year.
Officials in Sweden's Defense Ministry say privately that
provable intrusions are closer to 10 a year. A recent report
by the U.S. Rand Corp. estimates there are as many as 30
submarine intrusions a year.
   The Rand report suggests that with the demise of the
Soviet Union's Warsaw Pact in Central Europe, Moscow's
military strategies may rely more heavily on the north. In
any crisis, the Soviets must protect their nuclear-submarine
force based on the Kola peninsula, and they may feel the need
to seize Sweden and Norway to control the sea lanes in the
Baltic and North Atlantic.
   The Rand report, entitled "Stranger Than Fiction," cites a
string of incidents since 1981, when a Soviet Whisky class
submarine ran aground near a Swedish naval base. (Russian
officials said that was a navigational error and continue to
insist that no Soviet submarines are operating in Swedish
waters.)
   There have been incidents involving as many as six
unidentified submarines and repeated use of Soviet frogmen,
who, according to the Rand report, severed and carried off
one of the new Swedish anti-submarine mines in 1983.
   "Swedish officials still insist that they have finally
gotten serious about sinking the next Soviet submarine found
in Sweden's inner waterways," the report continues, but it
concludes: "While this might well be true, it is nevertheless
difficult to believe." The report argues that Sweden
continues to pull its punches to avoid embarrassing its
superpower neighbor.
   Swedes take umbrage at that suggestion. Rear Adm. Claes
Tornberg, commander of the Swedish navy, says that in two
more years he will have the nation's first complete
anti-submarine task force afloat. "We didn't have any
anti-submarine capability before, so we were starting at
zero," he says.
   Still, even with sub-hunting equipment, finding submarines
in the shallow waters of the Baltic and amid the 24,000
islands of Stockholm's archipelago is tricky; sonars often
are unable to detect submarines sitting on the bottom and
homing torpedoes often confuse big rocks with submarines.
   Nonetheless, Adm. Tornberg's ships surprised a submarine
stalking a naval exercise in Sweden's inner waters in 1988.
After they dropped depth charges on it, the sub belched a
large bubble of air and escaped. Since then, the admiral
says, fewer subs have been spotted close to shore.
   "We have got him to change his pattern and that is
something," he concludes.

   PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia -- "KDE DOMOV MUJ?" reads the
banner hanging over the Prague museum entrance -- "Where Is
My Country," the first line of the Czech national anthem.
   It is also a question being pondered across Hybernska
Street by Josef Tosovsky, president of the State Bank of
Czechoslovakia. At age 39, he took office less than six
months ago and now stands at the vortex of attempts to
transform Czechoslovakia's stumbling, centrally planned,
pollution-belching economy into an efficient, market-oriented
one.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Six months ago, Czechoslovakia threw off 51 years of
one-party Communist rule. Two weeks ago, a new government
approved a reform package with many free-market elements.
   But the government that did all this could be out of
office within six weeks. General elections are set for this
Friday, and there are 22 political parties competing for
votes. Almost all of them have their own ideas about what
sort of an economy the country should adopt.
   "It is said that the average Eskimo can recognize 50 types
of snow," says Mr. Tosovsky. "We in central Europe can
recognize 50 types of {economic structures}."
   Regardless, the tall, shy economist holds fast to his
belief that Czechoslovakia must "reintegrate into the world
economy." With others, Mr. Tosovsky is pushing to privatize
Czechoslovakia's extensive state-owned industries, promote
foreign investment and shape up the Czech currency so it can
be freely exchanged for dollars, marks and yen. Currently,
the koruna, or crown, is worthless outside Czechoslovakia.
   Mr. Tosovsky's first job out of college, in the central
bank's foreign exchange payments department, gave him his
initial taste of the way financial markets work. Two later
stints with a small Czech bank in London solidified his
belief that market-driven economies work much better than
state-controlled ones.
   Now his life is changing as quickly as the Czech political
scene. Last Dec. 28, while working in London, he was
appointed head of the State Bank by President Vaclav Havel.
By New Year's Eve, Mr. Tosovsky, his wife and two daughters
were back in Prague.
   His challenge is to transform a sleepy, highly politicized
institution into an independent, apolitical central bank. He
seeks for his bank the respect of similar institutions around
the world, and the strength to act as the guarantor of a new
Czechoslovak financial system.
   Surrounded by leftovers from the old system who are
seeking to hold onto their jobs, and politicians declaring
they want to get from A to Z but don't know how, Mr. Tosovsky
is perceived increasingly as someone who can get the job
done.
   "Tosovsky is down-to-earth and practical," says Samuel L.
Milbank, director in charge of central bank relations for
Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York, who has worked closely
with the State Bank. "People believe in him; he comes across
as being a realist with a plan, a vision."
   In five months, Mr. Tosovsky has decentralized
decision-making at the bank and, in an institution not known
for its resourcefulness, promoted people with initiative. He
is surrounding himself with people, some of whom he dragged
out of retirement, who hold similar free-market beliefs.
   Some view Mr. Tosovsky as just another "apparatchik" whose
star rose during years of Communist rule. When asked if he
had been a Communist, Mr. Tosovsky replies: "We normally
don't write about that in the press."
   But as Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
International, explains, "A lot of people were Communists; it
was a way to survive. There's a difference between the
believers and the nonbelievers. When you talk to the Czechs,
they seem to know who were the good guys and who were the bad
guys." Mr. Tosovsky, he adds, "is a very able, very
professional, knowledgeable guy."
   He is also an optimist. He rattles off Czechoslovakia's
advantages: a relatively stable economy, strong industrial
potential, well-educated and skilled workers, relatively
small foreign debt and a 3.4% year-to-year inflation rate
that many major industrialized nations would envy. What's
more, the country last year ran a $974 million hard-currency
trade surplus.
   At the end of 1989, Czechoslovakia owed foreign creditors
$7.9 billion in hard currency. But after subtracting money
owed the Czechs by others plus the country's reserves, its
net debt position is near zero, contends Mr. Tosovsky.
   Still, he and other Czech officials concede that some of
those loans, particularly ones to Syria and Iraq, aren't
worth much.
   Mr. Tosovsky likes to point out that some economists
estimate Czechoslovakia, a nation of 15.5 million people, has
the industrial potential for a country of 30 million. Indeed,
between the two world wars, Czechoslovakia possessed a strong
economy and several internationally respected industrial
companies.
   The central banker's viewpoint isn't unrealistic. "I'm
very positive" about Czechoslovakia's chances for economic
reform, says Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs. "But investment
isn't simply going to go there out of sentiment. They've got
to embark on a bold economic reform plan. It is the {East
bloc} country where the government ownership is the most
pervasive," But he agrees that Czechoslovakia "isn't a poor
country; it's just been poorly managed for 50 years."
   On that score, Mr. Tosovsky recognizes the hurdles. For
example, he concedes that refitting obsolete factories and
ameliorating the country's choking pollution problem -- in
part by reducing dependence on energy-gobbling heavy
industries -- will cost a lot of money.
   His fellow Czechoslovaks constitute another uncertainty.
"The new political system will change completely the life of
society. It is very difficult to know how people will react
to the bankruptcy of factories and unemployment; these will
be here," says Mr. Tosovsky. "We may have to slow down. We
shall see if the people are prepared to tighten their belts."
   These concerns don't appear to deter commercial and
investment bankers from the U.S., Europe and Japan, who have
been beating a path to the State Bank's drab, unimpressive
gray building.
   Mr. Tosovsky opens his desk drawer and flips through a
stack of business cards to recall the names of foreign
bankers who come by to offer advice, seek counsel or just
generally get a feel for what's happening in Czechoslovakia.
"One day, we had 11 foreign banks in," he says. "The
representative offices of foreign banks is growing every
day."
   So far, they are mostly European banks. But Citicorp's
Citibank is considering retail banking here, and A.W.
Clausen, chairman of BankAmerica Corp. has paid a visit. To
help cement relations with Mr. Tosovsky and his bank, Salomon
Brothers two weeks ago staged a seminar for its central bank
clients in Prague.
   Mr. Tosovsky and the firm are mum on what the Salomon Inc.
unit might do for the State Bank, but he says he expects to
do business with the securities firm. Some investment bankers
predict that Salomon will underwrite Czech government or
corporate bonds and help the central bank gain higher returns
from its roughly $1.75 billion in gold and foreign reserves.
   At a recent news conference in Prague, Salomon Chairman
John H. Gutfreund said: "When one looks ahead for
Czechoslovakia, one can assume there will be a government
bond market and companies and banks, both private and public,
which will sell debt and equity. And our basic role is to
make markets: to have capital come and go from other major
markets around the world."
   All this, if it comes, is years ahead, Mr. Tosovsky
acknowledges. "Our basic problem is an inefficient economic
system. Because of the close relationship with the political
system, we lost many tens of years," he says. "It isn't
possible to change the situation from one day to another. It
will take a long time, but we are ready to take radical
steps."

   Franchisers
   See a Future
   In East Bloc

   Eastern Europe is shaping up as a new frontier for Western
franchisers.
   "We're looking at deals in the entire Eastern bloc," says
a spokesman for Carlson Cos., Minneapolis, which oversees the
Radisson Hotels International chain and owns a Radisson hotel
in a joint venture in Budapest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For now, joint ventures are more common than
American-style franchises. McDonald's Corp., which scored a
hit with its nonfranchised Moscow restaurant, is spreading
the golden arches through joint ventures in Hungary and
Yugoslavia and is training some prospective Eastern bloc
franchisees.
   But many franchisers see joint ventures as a way to get
established. Baskin-Robbins Inc., which is entering the
Soviet Union through a joint venture with the Russian
republic, says the arrangement might lead to franchising in
the Eastern bloc within five years.
   Western businesses of all types are exploring
opportunities as Eastern bloc countries move to spur economic
development. But franchise operations especially think they
stand to play a major role in the creation of a new class of
Eastern European entrepreneurs.
   "Nothing better suits the start-up of a free-market
economy than franchising," says David J. Kaufmann, a
franchising lawyer in New York. "Franchisees are immediately
given backing, know-how and marketing prowess that otherwise
would take decades to obtain."
   It might also take a long time for a Western franchiser to
make much money in Eastern Europe. Hard currencies are in
short supply there, and repatriating earnings to the U.S. can
be a problem because of both nonconvertible currencies and
currency controls. Moreover, much of the infrastructure
needed by business -- such as an effective telephone network
-- doesn't exist yet in the region.
   "We're taking a very long-term view," says James
Cantalupo, president of McDonald's international arm. "If
anybody is looking for a quick buck, these aren't the
countries to go to."
   But if a buck is to be made, it might come faster through
franchising. Zenox Inc., an Atlanta company with interests in
manufacturing, nursing homes and other areas, says it has
agreed to pay $180,000 plus royalties for the rights to
franchise Payless Rent-a-Car System outlets and Mister Donut
shops in Hungary and the Soviet Union. It's also seeking to
franchise a New England pizza chain in the same countries.
   "We don't have to reinvent the wheel," says Richard G.
English, president of Zenox. "I don't mind paying royalties
to somebody who already has a working system." By the same
token, he says, many Eastern Europeans won't mind paying
royalties to the joint ventures that Zenox aims to set up
with Soviet and Hungarian partners to sell franchises.
   More common, at least for now, are joint ventures. The
McDonald's outlets in Hungary and Yugoslavia are owned
directly by McDonald's and its local joint-venture partners.
Similarly, the 700-seat McDonald's restaurant in Moscow is
part of a joint venture between McDonald's Canadian
subsidiary and Moscow city authorities.
   But franchising to Eastern European individuals isn't far
off. Mr. Cantalupo of McDonald's says three prospective
franchisees are in training in Yugoslavia, and one in
Hungary. "One thing you're looking for is an entrepreneurial
track record, and in these countries, it's hard to find
that," Mr. Cantalupo says. "But I suspect we'll have more
people available than we have opportunities, eventually."
   The potential franchises, though, may not suit many
Eastern Europeans. Well-heeled McDonald's can afford to take
little cash up front for franchises. But smaller American
franchisers tend to be less flexible. "The problem will be
finding people who can afford to buy a franchise," says
Patrick J. Boroian, president of Francorp Inc., an Olympia
Fields, Ill., franchise-development firm. "People in these
countries are broke."
   To succeed, franchisers may also have to lay out millions
of dollars to solve supply problems that normally don't arise
in the U.S. and other advanced economies. McDonald's, for
example, says it had to build a bakery and a meat plant to
ensure satisfactory supplies for the Hungarian restaurants.
Mr. Cantalupo says it takes three to five years -- more than
twice as long as in the U.S. -- to start a franchise
operation in Eastern Europe.
   Though relatively few Eastern European franchising deals
have been announced so far, many are in the works, says Mr.
Kaufmann, the franchising lawyer. "A lot of this is hush-hush
because everybody wants to be the first entrant in his
category," Mr. Kaufmann says. "Nobody is tipping his hand."
But he says a dozen of his clients -- in such sectors as fast
food, lodging and business services -- are looking at Eastern
Europe.
   Franchisers' ventures in the Soviet Union should feed
interest in the Eastern bloc. Baskin-Robbins, a unit of
Britain's Allied-Lyons PLC, has formed a joint venture with
the Russian republic to produce ice cream -- including a new
flavor, Gorba Chocolate -- in a $30 million plant due to
start up in 1992. "We will now begin to take a much more
active interest in getting involved in other Eastern bloc
countries," says Michael H. Cohn, president of
Baskin-Robbins's international arm.
   McDonald's success in Moscow whets the appetite of many
franchisers. The 700-seat restaurant has been mobbed since it
opened in January, with many people waiting hours to get in.
The English-language edition of Glasnost magazine comments:
"The waiting line winds along busy Pushkin Square for well
over 500 yards, easily eclipsing the procession of people
before Lenin's mausoleum."
   Franchisers' interest in Eastern Europe will continue to
grow, says Philip F. Zeidman, a Washington lawyer involved in
East-Europe-Law, a venture that aims to help franchisers
establish themselves in the region. Clients looking to enter
the market include a fast-food chain and a personal-computer
retailer, Mr. Zeidman says. "There are going to be some
people who foul this up and lose some money," he says. "But a
lot more of these ventures are going to be established."

   NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence was essentially unchanged
in May, as the index compiled by the Conference Board
declined to 106.7 from April's revised 107.3.
   The monthly survey, conducted for the Board by National
Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, found consumers slightly
less positive about conditions in May, but buying plans
perked up a bit. The survey uses the year 1985 as a base of
100 points and covers 5,000 households throughout the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Appraisal of current business conditions and availability
of jobs are slightly less positive than in April, and the
outlook for the next six months is almost the same as April.
About 23% say business conditions are "good," and close to
20% say they are "bad." More than 18% expect improvement but
10% fear conditions will be worse.
   Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference
Board's Consumer Research Center, said "although consumer
confidence has been running well below the levels registered
late last year, there is still no indication that the economy
is moving into recession." The consumer-confidence index for
May 1990 trails May 1989 by 10 points.
   The report showed slight improvements in home-buying
plans, with 3.9% planning to buy a home within the next six
months, up from 2.9% in April. Those with car-buying plans
rose to 8.2% from 6.2%. However, those planning to buy major
appliances fell to 29.3% in May from 31.3% in April.

   Campeau's Allied,
   Federated Units
   Post Wider Losses

   Campeau Corp.'s retailing units, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., reported widened losses
for April compared with March, but the units said the losses
were lower than expected.
   In documents filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Cincinnati, Federated said it had a net loss of $12.7 million
in the four weeks ended May 5, while Allied said it had a net
loss of $11.8 million. The results don't include expenses
related to the units' Chapter 11 bankruptcy status.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Federated and Allied had net losses of $8.9 million and
$9.1 million, respectively, in the five weeks ended April 7.
Comparable figures for the year-earlier periods weren't
provided, making it difficult for analysts to gauge the
retailers' financial progress since seeking protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on
Jan. 15.
   "This is tough to read," said Janet Mangano, analyst at
Josephthal and Co. of New York. "It is hard to make a
determination of whether there has been an improvement or
deterioration in operations if the numbers aren't compared on
a year-to-year basis," she said.
   In a statement, Allen Questrom, chairman and chief
executive officer of Federated and Allied, said sales and
operating earnings in the combined March-April period were as
high as management expected.
   "I think any weakness in the business that we currently
are experiencing is related more to the general retail
climate than to Federated and Allied in particular," he said.
   "I agree with that statement. It is certainly true," said
Kurt Barnard, publisher of Retail Marketing Report, a New
York-based newsletter.
   Mr. Barnard said retailers of moderately priced clothing
had markedly better sales growth during this year's Easter
season than last year, but many department store concerns
actually showed lower sales. Federated and Allied were hit
harder because they sell higher-priced clothing, he said.
   "Federated and Allied did not do better and probably did
not do much worse than the rest of the department store
industry," Mr. Barnard said.
   Federated's sales in April were $325.8 million, down 20%
from $405.3 million in March. Allied had April sales of
$190.2 million, down 19% from March sales of $234.4 million.
   In the combined March-April period, Federated had
operating cash flow of $61.6 million, while Allied generated
$32.1 million. Federated and Allied said operating cash flow,
defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and costs related to their bankruptcy-law
status, is the most accurate measure of their business under
Chapter 11.
   Separately, Ralphs Grocery Co., a Southern California
supermarket chain indirectly owned by Campeau, a
Toronto-based real estate and retailing concern, released its
first-quarter results. In the three months ended April 22,
the firm's net loss narrowed to $4 million from $7 million a
year earlier. Sales improved 8.5% to $620.9 million from
$572.5 million.
   Ralphs hasn't filed for protection under Chapter 11. But
it is owned by Allied and Federated Holdings III, another
Campeau unit that is in Chapter 11.
   Meanwhile, National Bank of Canada said it extended a
deadline under which Robert Campeau, Campeau's chairman and
chief executive officer, can pay 40 million Canadian dollars
(US$34.1 million) to reclaim Campeau securities seized by the
bank. Mr. Campeau missed the May 31 deadline for the
transaction. National Bank didn't disclose the date of the
new deadline.
   National Bank seized Campeau common shares, preference
stock and convertible debentures in January when it claimed
Mr. Campeau defaulted on about C$153 million of personal
loans. The seizure lowered Mr. Campeau's fully diluted stake
in the company that bears his name to 21% from 43%. He will
regain control of Campeau if he buys the shares back.

   MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. -- Warner-Lambert Co. said it filed an
application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to
market the experimental drug, THA, for treating Alzheimer's
disease.
   The pharmaceutical and health-care products company has
been testing the drug, also known as tacrine, in
collaboration with the National Institute of Aging for about
three years. If approved, the drug would be the first
treatment available for use against the degenerative brain
disorder.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Warner-Lambert said it sought FDA approval based on data
from two human studies -- one it funded and administered in
the U.S., and another was funded by a British company, Shire
Pharmaceuticals. The U.S. data is from an ongoing test of 150
patients; this study is expected to eventually enroll 300
people. In recent weeks, Warner-Lambert said the data it has
compiled suggests that about 40% of patients given the drug
showed some improvement.
   Some independent tests of the drug indicate that, at best,
the drug may alleviate some of the disease's symptoms, but it
doesn't interfere with Alzheimer's underlying cause. The drug
is controversial. Several independent studies published of
late have produced conflicting findings.
   Warner-Lambert had said earlier this year that it expected
to file its application with the FDA by July.

   Financial Issues Take the Spotlight
   As Stocks Rise Broadly to Records

   NEW YORK -- Financial issues took center stage as the
stock market posted a broad-based advance that resulted in
yet another series of records.
   Expectations that interest rates would continue to fall in
the aftermath of Friday's weak report on May employment led
to brisk activity among financial stocks, which have lagged
the market through much of the year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The broad market showed little direction through
midafternoon, when the buying interest in the financial
sector and futures-related buy programs combined to ignite a
rally that broke the Dow Jones Industrial Average from a
trading range on either side of 2900.
   The average, which finished last week just above that
level, posted its fourth record close in the past five
sessions and its 10th since May 14 by surging 34.22 to
2935.19.
   At the same time, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index became the latest market measure to establish a record
by rallying 2.18 to 200.21. The prior high was 199.34, set
last Oct. 9.
   Among other broad measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index climbed 4.24 to 367.40 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index rose 4.15 to 341.98 -- both records.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,105 to 477 on
the Big Board, where trading remained fairly active. About
175,520,000 shares changed hands on the Big Board, compared
with 187,860,000 shares Friday.
   Investors looking to shift assets out of cash and into
stocks "are gradually deciding that they can't wait any
longer" before they start doing some buying, said John D.
Connolly, chairman of the investment committee at Dean Witter
Reynolds. "That's what markets like this do -- they just
freeze out anyone who has cash."
   Traders cited the bond market's ability to build on its
sharp gains Friday in response to the jobs data as a chief
factor behind the latest surge in stocks. Long-term Treasury
bonds added 1/4 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount, after
surging about 1 1/2 points Friday.
   Also, a round of program buying stemming from stock-index
arbitrage that surfaced just after 2 p.m. EDT served as a
catalyst for the rally. Buy programs, involving the purchase
of baskets of stocks and the sale of index-futures contracts
to profit from the price differential between them, boosted
stocks in the final hour of trading as well.
   Mr. Connolly noted that the financial sector's surge was
in line with its relative strength in the past four weeks.
Financial issues that he tracks have gained an average of
9.9% during that period, compared with a 7.8% rise among the
top 1,000 issues in terms of their market capitalization.
   With concerns about problem loans and other issues having
weighed on the group so far this year, "what we're seeing is
a feeling that the negativity was overdone on financial
stocks and that we're going to see an improving situation
from here," he said.
   Financial stocks dominated the list of most active issues
on the Big Board. One of them was First Interstate Bancorp,
which rallied 4 7/8 to 44 7/8 as dividend-related activity
and takeover speculation combined to produce composite volume
of 1.9 million shares. The bank issue carries a 7% dividend
yield and went ex-dividend yesterday; separately, Security
Pacific has expressed an interest in the company in the past.
First Interstate said it couldn't account for the activity in
its stock.
   Other actively traded stocks in the group included
American Express, which went up 1 7/8 to 31 5/8 as 2.1
million shares changed hands; Travelers, up 1 1/8 to 31 7/8
on 1.5 million shares; Federal National Mortgage Association,
up 2 to 43 5/8 on 1.9 million shares; J.P. Morgan, up 5/8 to
39 1/2 on 1.7 million shares, and Citicorp, up 5/8 to 24 5/8
on 1.6 million shares.
   Optimism about interest rates also led to interest of
utility stocks, giving the Dow Jones Utilities Average its
first back-to-back advance since mid-May. The average rose
3.71 to 215.42 after a gain of 0.32 Friday.
   Among the utilities average's component issues, American
Electric Power gained 5/8 to 29 7/8, Columbia Gas System went
up 3/4 to 45 3/4, Commonwealth Edison rose 3/4 to 32 7/8,
Detroit Edison added 5/8 to 27 3/8 and Houston Industries
gained 1 to 33 1/4. Elsewhere in the sector, Dominion
Resources climbed 1 to 44 7/8, Northern States Power rose 3/4
to 36 5/8 and Pacific Enterprises added 5/8 to 44 1/4.
   A number of important technology stocks resumed their
recent advance following a pause Friday. International
Business Machines gained 7/8 to 120 3/8, Compaq Computer
soared 5 3/8 to 124 3/4, Hewlett-Packard gained 1 to 48 3/4
and Cray Research rose 1 7/8 to 50 3/8. But Digital Equipment
fell 1/4 to 91 1/2.
   Precious-metals stocks were left out of the market's rise
as the price of gold extended its recent retreat. Placer Dome
dropped 3/8 to 15, Homestake Mining dropped 3/8 to 18 1/8,
Battle Mountain Gold slid 3/8 to 12 1/8 and ASA Ltd. fell 1
1/2 to 46 1/8.
   Corroon &amp; Black tumbled 2 1/4 to 34 1/4 after agreeing to
merge with Willis Faber, a British insurance broker, in a
stock swap. The accord calls for the company's shareholders
to receive 7.8 common shares of Willis Faber for each of
their shares.
   Wal-Mart Stores climbed 2 1/4 to 60 5/8 on two million
shares. Chairman Sam M. Walton told the annual meeting he
believes the company could quintuple its sales to about $125
billion by the year 2000, while doubling the number of
Wal-Mart stores to about 3,000.
   Upjohn rose 3/4 to 40 7/8 on unusually heavy volume of 1.6
million shares. The company said no material news is pending,
but attributed the trading to an article in the latest issue
of Business Week that speculates Upjohn might be the next
pharmaceutical maker to strike a merger agreement. The
company is interested in "strategic alliances," a spokesman
said, but isn't particularly interested in being acquired.
   Tenneco rose 1 3/4 to 69 after the company's J.I. Case
unit reached a tentative agreement with the United Auto
Workers on a 40-month contract. Separately, a venture in
which Tenneco holds a 40% interest reached preliminary
contract agreements for a proposed gas pipeline linking
Canada and California.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich added 1/4 to 3 1/4. British
publisher Robert Maxwell told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report that he remains interested in a takeover of the
company, which has struggled with a heavy debt load since
recapitalizing in response to a bid from Mr. Maxwell in 1988.
   Sealed Air climbed 1 1/2 to 26 3/4. Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
repeated a buy recommendation on the stock after hosting a
meeting between the company's management and institutional
analysts.
   Russ Togs added 3/8 to 9 1/4. Industrial Equity (Pacific),
which has an 18.77% stake in the company, said it would
"strongly consider" providing financing for a management
buy-out.
   De Soto added 1 1/2 to 44 1/4. Shufro, Rose &amp; Ehrman said
it raised its stake in the company to 14.59%.
   Convex Computer dropped 3/4 to 18 1/8 after filing for an
offering of two million common shares. The company has about
18.8 million shares outstanding.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.57
to 364.40. Amex volume totaled 12,701,100 shares, compared
with 14,651,370 shares Friday. There were 319 issues
advancing, 280 declining and 219 were unchanged.
   Frederick's of Hollywood rose 1 1/8 to 18 1/2 following
the death of its founder and largest shareholder, Frederick
Mellinger, over the weekend.
   Met-Pro climbed 2 3/8 to 22 5/8. In an interview with
Barron's magazine, Stephen A. Lieber of Evergreen Limited
Market Fund selected the stock as his favorite.
   Cohu advanced 1 to 12 3/8. Charles Neuhauser, a
small-stock analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker, Baltimore,
told Barron's the stock is among his favorites. Others that
Mr. Neuhauser cited included two Big Board issues: Scotsman
Industries, which rose 1/4 to 8 5/8, and Park
Electrochemical, which added 7/8 to 15 1/4.

   In your May 14 editorials you describe our ABC News
broadcast, "Peter Jennings Reporting: From the Killing
Fields," as "the centerpiece of the controversy" surrounding
U.S. policy toward Cambodia. Everything I read suggests the
real centerpiece of the controversy is the policy itself, not
our reporting of it. That aside, a couple of corrections are
in order.
   We reported on the U.S. policy of support for a coalition
of forces fighting to regain control of Cambodia, a coalition
whose most powerful member is the genocidal communist Khmer
Rouge. At the heart of your criticism is the contention that
we oversimplified, turning a complicated dilemma into a
"melodrama" with good guys and bad guys. However, you excuse
us for what you see as our failings by condemning all TV
news. You say the fault lies in "the nature of television,
which to tell the news needs black hats and white hats." It
seems to me it is you who reduce something complicated to
something simple. For example, in the Cambodia you describe,
the Vietnamese wear the blackest hats because (a) they are
communist, (b) they are colonialist, and (c) they are
Vietnamese. We portrayed the Vietnamese role in Cambodia as
complicated: They got rid of the Khmer Rouge, but they also
installed a repressive communist regime.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   You made only two specific criticisms of our broadcast.
The first was that the interview with the State Department
official explaining U.S. policy did not look sufficiently
neutral. You manage to ignore what he actually said. You also
accuse us of neglecting to point out that President Nixon
ordered the invasion of Cambodia in 1970 to, in your words,
"keep the Khmer Rouge from prevailing." We don't make that
point because it's not true. Both former President Nixon and
Henry Kissinger have always said the purpose of the invasion
was to wipe out North Vietnamese supply lines and
sanctuaries. The Khmer Rouge were never mentioned. The facts
on this point are not in dispute.
   Meanwhile, in your letters column, Stephen J. Morris again
has the facts wrong. His letter was hard to make much sense
of, except for his continuing attack on Leslie Cockburn, the
program's producer. Ad hominem attacks are irrelevant to an
assessment of our reporting. The work should be judged on its
own merits. Nonetheless, in an attempt to substantiate his
accusations of political bias, he claims evidence of
"leftist" ideology can be found in "Ms. Cockburn's 1987 PBS
documentary `Murder on the Rio San Juan.'" Ms. Cockburn's
list of credits is extensive. It does not, however, contain
this particular work. Ms. Cockburn was not involved in any
way. It is hard to take anything Mr. Morris has to say
seriously when he has such trouble with the most basic facts.
   Amid all the discussion of television technique and the
alleged politics of the program's producer, it is worth
noting that no one is criticizing the actual substance of our
reporting. It's also worth remembering that the basic issue
is the origin and effect of American policy in Cambodia.

   (While Ms. Cockburn's book presents much of the same
material as the PBS documentary, it was an error to attribute
the program to her -- Ed.)
   ---
   In his May 1 letter, Mr. Jennings takes Mr. Morris to task
for referring to Leslie Cockburn as a "committed left
ideologue." In an obvious reference to McCarthyism, he says
this charge is "straight out of the '50s," and claims Mr.
Morris's charge "seems an anachronism."
   This is typical of the media's inability to look at itself
with objectivity. Anybody familiar with Ms. Cockburn or her
work knows she is just what Mr. Morris said she is. Indeed,
Mr. Jennings never denies she is a committed leftist; he just
thinks it is obviously bad manners to point it out.

   In his April 26 editorial-page piece, Mr. Morris states
that I "substantiate{d} the . . . bald assertion that the
Vietnamese have withdrawn from Cambodia" and contends in an
ad hominem remark that I have not read recent newspaper
reports that "elite Vietnamese troops" were reinjected there.
   I decided to await the ABC broadcast before responding. In
it, I note that I said the Vietnamese forces had
"essentially" withdrawn, which I think was a reasonable
reflection of what I said on camera, including whatever may
have been cut from what I may have added about the fact that
some Vietnamese advisers, special forces, etc., may have
returned. Your writer's cheap shot that I was not aware of
news reports that they had done so I reject entirely, and
believe my word "essentially" recognized and accepted this
fact, and is more accurate than his suggestion that the major
Vietnamese presence that earlier existed was still in place.
   I do not stand as an apologist for the Phnom Penh regime.
But I do insist that the most important objective of any
policy should be prevention of a return of the Khmer Rouge.
Early elections, under any structure, could best produce an
authority that would be representative of the Cambodian
people, supplanting the various self-appointees now
contesting for power. Let us not delay this process.

   ABC did not detail the actual political alliances in
Cambodia, but chose instead to deceive viewers with cheap,
amateurish devices, such as close-ups of "culpable" parties,
followed by photographs of crying, malnourished children.
   Jeffrey James Whitehead

   ---
   If my interpretation of recent articles and letters on the
Khmer Rouge is correct, I am confused. ABC speaking through
Mr. Jennings claims the desire to encourage U.S. action to
prevent a Khmer Rouge return to power. Well and good -- but
are not these the same people who (among others) so vocally
opposed U.S. action during the Vietnam War era to prevent the
original Khmer Rouge takeover?
   My Air Force service in Thailand 1973-74 provides me with
such a recollection. Had the various networks and print media
opposed the Khmer Rouge as strongly in the '60s and '70s as
they now claim, perhaps we could have saved the lives of
several million Cambodians lost in the killing fields.
   Philip L. King
   Prescott, Ariz.
   ---
   What ABC News left out of its documentary is why the once
decimated and demoralized Khmer Rouge are now "capable of
rolling over the PRK {Phnom Penh regime}," as Mr. Jennings
claims. The Khmer Rouge have been able to replenish their
forces with recruits among young Cambodians, who join because
of nationalism and a wish to fight the Vietnamese directing
the Hun Sen regime and to rid Cambodia of the one million
Vietnamese colonizing their homeland.
   Although he admitted to Hun Sen's past as a Khmer Rouge
commander, Mr. Jennings failed to report two other facts: (1)
Under Pol Pot, Khmer Rouge commanders either killed as
ordered or were killed themselves, and Hun Sen and his
cohorts didn't flee to Vietnam until the Cambodian genocide
was well into its third year; (2) the rest of Hun Sen's
cohorts, who really wield the power in Phnom Penh, are also
unrepentant former Khmer Rouge leaders. Two Khmer Rouge
factions are fighting each other for control of Cambodia.
They include: Communist Party leader Heng Samrin, former
division commander under Pol Pot; Deputy Prime Minister Hor
Man Hong, reportedly former commander of a Khmer Rouge camp
where at least nine of Prince Sihanouk's officials perished
along with their families; and National Assembly leader Chea
Sim, who was a member of Pol Pot's National Assembly, and as
such helped determine the Khmer Rouge's genocide policy.
   To impress visiting dignitaries such as Mr. Jennings, Hun
Sen takes them to Tuol Sleng, the infamous Khmer Rouge
torture center, where thousand of Cambodians were brutally
murdered. Unknown to Mr. Jennings, only 3.1 miles north, at
Tuol Kok, Hun Sen has his own private chamber of horrors,
much smaller in scale but just as deadly. There are 52 of
these centers in Phnom Penh alone, according to informants
inside the Hun Sen government. In his letter, Mr. Jennings
boasts of Hun Sen's improved human-rights record by saying
that only "430 people were detained for political reasons in
1988 . . . 430 too many, but an improvement over thousands."
Not so, according to recent defectors, high-ranking officials
from the Hun Sen regime and students -- sons and daughters of
communist officials in Cambodia]
   Defector Vandy Kaon states: "During the past few years,
the leadership promoted the destruction of the country and
the killing of all the nationalists who dared to speak out
for the interest of the country." Mr. Kaon was a member of
the Phnom Penh controlled State Council, chairman of the
National Assembly's Legislative Commission and chairman of
the Cambodian-Vietnamese Friendship Association. His
statement was confirmed by two other high-ranking defectors,
one of whom was the PRK's former ambassador to Hanoi, Sieng
Saran. Recently, 67 Cambodians studying in East Germany
defected to the West and stated, "The Hun Sen-Heng Samrin
regime grossly violates human rights, forces Cambodians to
wage war against all nationalists, and imprisons and kills
any Cambodian who expresses sentiments for peace in
Cambodia."

   In 1987, Tom Wolfe wrote a novel about an affluent,
powerful white man who suddenly finds himself ensnared in a
corrupt legal system and menaced by the prospect of a long
stay in prison for a crime he did not commit. In 1987, Scott
Turow wrote a novel about an affluent, powerful white man who
suddenly finds himself ensnared in a corrupt legal system and
menaced by the prospect of a long stay in prison for a crime
he did not commit. Both of these vastly praised, much
discussed, indispensable beach companions became huge best
sellers by tapping into this primal Caucasian fear of the
slammer. Meanwhile, back in the real world, poor blacks and
Hispanics keep going to jail, while people like Charles
Keating keep going on Ted Koppel's show. Messrs. Wolfe and
Turow need to get out more.
   Penal implausibilities notwithstanding, there's no denying
that Mr. Turow's first novel, "Presumed Innocent," was a
pretty good one. A high-class whodunit with more twists and
turns than an M.C. Escher drawing, the novel told the story
of a jaded prosecutor in a fictional Illinois town who
suddenly finds himself accused of murdering a female
colleague, who also happened to be his ex-lover. Actually,
she also happened to be everyone in town's ex-lover, which
made it look like Rusty Sabich was being set up by jealous
rivals, one of whom may also have been the deceased's

   Unrelentingly misogynistic -- Mr. Turow's women are either
dolls or dumplings -- but snappily written, "Presumed
Innocent" did pull off the Herculean task of making a
39-year-old lawyer seem sympathetic. All in all, the book was
a fine police procedural, a genuine page turner, and a damn
good read.
   But that's all it was. Despite Mr. Turow's obvious gifts
and his publisher's stage-managing of his image -- Former
Justice Department Prosecutor Who Used to Teach Creative
Writing at Stanford Tells All -- "Presumed Innocent" was not
and is not a literary masterpiece that transcends the
thriller genre a la Simenon, Conan Doyle or Poe. In its use
of elaborate gimmicks to throw the reader off the trail, it
is a direct descendant of such ingenious detective novels as
Agatha Christie's "Easy to Kill," "The Murder of Roger
Ackroyd," and "Curtain." (Dame Agatha did not have sexy
females stripped, hog-tied and raped, but, unlike Mr. Turow,
she never worked out of Chicago.)
   Throughout "Presumed Innocent," Mr. Turow toys with the
reader, relentlessly withholding pertinent pieces of
information. This allows the author to spring a nasty
surprise in the last 20 pages, but it makes everything that
has gone before seem like one, gigantic con job. Which is why
"Presumed Innocent" cannot be put in the same class as Joseph
Wambaugh's remarkable first novels, "The New Centurions" and
"The Choir Boys." In those searing tales of corruption and
betrayal, there was no shuck and no jive.
   There's just about nothing but shuck and jive in Mr.
Turow's interminable second novel, "Burden of Proof" (Farrar,
Straus &amp; Giroux, 515 pages, $22.95). Twice as long as it
needs to be, the novel tells the story of Sabich's attorney,
Alejandro Stern, who arrives home one day to find that his
wife of 30 years has committed suicide. He soon discovers
that his wife had herpes, that she recently had withdrawn
$850,000 from her savings account for an unknown purpose, and
that she may have been having an affair with Stern's
brother-in-law, a sleazy commodities trader who is being
investigated by the federal government for defrauding
customers. Stern just happens to be his lawyer, and the
stooge who handled the trades the feds are looking at just
happens to be Stern's son-in-law, whose wife needs an
abortion, though her brother -- who may or may not be a gay
FBI informer, but who is definitely a physician -- is not the
one who's going to be doing it.
   This is one hell of a family.
   Wracked with grief at his wife's demise, Stern consoles
himself by sleeping with one of his wife's old friends,
trying to seduce his next-door neighbor, before setting his
sights on the young attorney prosecuting his brother-in-law
-- whom he falls in love with during a hot tub session that
takes place while her husband, a postal worker, is miles
away, writing poetry.
   Stern also suspects that his wife's doctor may have been
the one who gave her herpes. This doesn't stop him from
trying to feel up the doctor's wife, a tacky thing to do to a
woman who's just found a videotape of her husband having oral
sex with his nurse. It won't spoil the story to tell you that
the pesky brother-in-law ultimately winds up in bed with one
of Stern's girlfriends, because the story is so nutty you'll
never remember any of this anyway. With its endless plot
twists, red herrings, smoke screens, windy philosophizing and
bed hopping, "Burden of Proof" reads like a collaboration
between Dashiell Hammett and John O'Hara: The Maltese Falcon
Goes to Peyton Place.
   Oh yeah, the deeper meaning. Like "Presumed Innocent,"
"Burden of Proof" is an attack on the American
jurisprudential system, which Mr. Turow depicts as being
corrupted by overzealous federal prosecutors who will do just
about anything to advance their careers. "Burden of Proof"
will therefore appeal to libertarian whodunit fans who don't
mind all this stuff about herpes, abortion, knocking off your
sister-in-law and defrauding investors, so long as the writer
makes it clear that it's all the government's fault. Well,
maybe not the herpes.

   WARSAW -- The parasites crawled in first. At labor offices
each day now, they slump on benches side by side,
recuperating from their latest binges. Every few minutes, a
bureaucrat's door opens, and out weaves another addition to
Poland's lengthening register of the unemployed.
   "The Communists destroyed my health," one says, unsteadily
easing down the steps. He has a yellowing bruise below his
left eye. "I had to steal. I became a bandit. The Communists
did it."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Before Solidarity took over and rewrote the rule book,
Poles who didn't have bona fide jobs -- not only bums but
illegal moneychangers and underground novelists -- had to
pretend they did. Unemployment was a capitalist sin. In
January, Solidarity's sinfully capitalist new government
legalized it and started to pay jobless benefits. So the
parasites who used to pretend they had jobs showed up at the
labor offices pretending they didn't.
   That was the first wave. Then, one by one, came those who
did have jobs but only pretended to work. Solidarity had also
restored the boss's right to fire individuals -- with one
month's notice, for almost any reason, and with just five
days for the worker to protest. By mid-February, 107,000 of
the freshly axed, among them tradesmen who couldn't hold
their own, had limped into the labor offices to register as
unemployed. By mid-April this was up to 318,000, and by the
end of May 443,000. Now, two more waves are about to break.
   When school lets out, 300,000 high-school graduates will
want jobs. Every one of last year's graduates went straight
to work, as did every graduate of the past four decades. This
year, only half will.
   Mass layoffs will come by summer, after three months'
notice and the unions' futile foot-dragging. At least 200,000
layoffs are in the pipeline already at 6,000 failing
factories, not to mention 38 people at the National Center
for the Methodology of Political Studies and 500 at the
Enterprise for Industrial Automation. As many as two million
could be on the dole by year end.
   Solidarity hasn't blinked. Brazenly, compared with
governments in the West that try to paper over capitalism's
usual ups and downs, this one advertises unemployment as
central to its economic plan. A healthy percentage of people
without jobs, it posits, will thin the bloated work force and
create a new market, not just for goods but for labor. A
wildcat strike suspended last week at Lech Walesa's urging
has only hardened its resolve. While the Soviet Union's
economists still tremble when they think of the jolt that
unemployment could bring, Poland's extol it.
   "There is greater appreciation among people now of their
jobs, and product quality has already improved," Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz boasts in his first-quarter
report. "A certain marginal unemployment is a natural element
of any market economy." Adds his adviser, Jacek Rostowski:
"There has to be a feeling that jobs are no longer
guaranteed."
   In theory, the people understand. Since January, they have
seen the economy's output fall 25% as a Solidarity-made
recession closed over the country. Their buying power has
collapsed. But they have also watched the shops fill up with
goods and January's 80% inflation fade to below 5%. For all
of communism's teachings, they accept as a fact that
unemployment, and the threat of it, can be a good thing.
   That's the theory. Now for the experience.
   "They aren't too depressed yet," says Irena Jasinka,
standing in the hallway of the special labor office for
white-collar workers on the ground floor of a scruffy Warsaw
apartment block. She has been a clerk here 35 years.
"Benefits are new. A novelty. Once they get used to this,
they'll start complaining."
   A few yards down the hall, a group of first-timers gathers
at a notice headed, "What every unemployed person should
know." Some are young, some gray, all neatly dressed. They
read quietly.
   "It shocks me to see them here," Mrs. Jasinka says. "We
used to get a different sort -- capricious, looking for
something better, demanding everything. We spoiled them. Now,
they'll take anything so someone else won't snatch it away."
   The walls of the main room are hung with glass cases, job
offers on index cards tacked inside: "Accountant with
knowledge of foreign trade. English and German required."
"Telex operator. Must speak German." "Engineer. Good
knowledge of English, foreign experience; knowledge of
IBM-AT."
   Slim pickings. In Polish, "white-collar worker" translates
as "a person who works with his mind," but the Poles know
them better as "professional tea drinkers." They are the
first to go, and nobody wants them back. Last October,
500,000 jobs went begging in Poland. Now, 29,000 are on
offer, and just 4,000 for tea drinkers, including people who
can speak Gaelic and run supercomputers. As they scan the
index cards, depression sets in.
   "I was fired," says Robert Borzecki, turning away from the
cards. A stringy man of 25 in a jacket of many zippers, he
worked until April in the map department of Poland's
geological survey. "Too many people were employed. There was
nothing I could do about it."
   His wife, Ewa, stands beside him. She is 24, wears a jeans
suit and has painted her fingernails green. She made up the
menus at the Central Planning Office canteen until she, too,
was fired.
   "We don't want to go back to the old way, where you got a
job no matter what," she says.
   "We should have unemployment," says Mr. Borzecki, putting
an arm around her. "It's something new, something that proved
itself in the West. But here a man is still a name on a
payroll and nothing else. The old are corrupted. They just
want to survive. Young people who could change things are the
ones who get fired.
   "They're afraid a young person with initiative will force
them out. We won't find anything. The woman in there told me.
For people like us, there are no offers."
   Poland has set aside $280 million to pay unemployment
benefits this year. (The Borzeckis will get perhaps $50 a
month; today, $20 a month will buy their black bread.) Labor
offices have doubled their staff of 2,000 and put in a new
mind-set. Teresa Popiel, who as the Warsaw region's chief
used to "follow and persecute parasites who were avoiding
work," went to Brussels for three weeks of re-education.
   "I saw an office there that employs 300 people and had 11
computer specialists," she says. "I almost had a heart attack
when I saw the building. They had this organized for years
and years, and we only started on Jan. 2."
   Now, her officers spend their days phoning company after
company in search of job openings. One branch never knows
what the next comes up with. They have no computers. If they
did, the phone lines wouldn't be good enough to pass on the
details anyway. It's hardly a labor market. Then again, it
wouldn't be even with computers. State-owned companies are
laying people off. They won't be hiring soon.
   Solidarity is no fan of those commercial wrecks anyhow. It
lays its bets for new jobs on the same force it relies on to
salvage the country: private enterprise. So far this year,
110,000 small shops have shut, temporarily or for good, yet
many others hung on and 65,000 new ones opened. With easy
loans and Western aid, Solidarity hopes to steer its jobless
toward them. Whether they seize the opportunity will depend,
it seems, on how much nerve is left in them after years of
communism.
   Among the index cards at the labor office, someone has
taped up a notice, typed on the multicolored stationery of a
private firm called Meritum: "We employ tradesmen of all
kinds. Please come see us." Jerzy Wasilewski, electrical
engineer, reads it and lights up.
   He worked for the state until he hit 40 two years ago,
then left to try his luck as a private electrician. He did
all right until the recession finished him in February.
   "I've been here six times," he says, jotting down
Meritum's address. "I'll have to find a job myself. Now,
here's some company looking for tradesmen. I've got my car.
I'll get right over there."
   He finds Meritum's offices at the end of a long corridor
in a fourth-rate hotel. It is a seat-of-the-pants
conglomerate: house building, cranberries, steel, computers,
copy shops. Two men sit at facing desks in a room with a pile
of Vietnamese basketry in one corner. Mr. Wasilewski pulls up
a chair for his interview.
   "I used to be an electrician," he tells them. "Now, not
much is going on. The labor office has nothing for me."
   "Everywhere it sounds bad," one of the men says. "Here
anyone can come and work." Meritum, he explains, will locate
supplies, pay for them, advertise, hunt for contracts -- all
in return for 70% of Mr. Wasilewski's earnings. "You're
qualified. You can do a lot."
   Mr. Wasilewski looks amazed. "This is the first
proposition that sounds optimistic," he says.
   "You can manage a group of electricians employed by us,"
says the second man. "You hire the people."
   "I could create a group like that]"
   "Please think about it. Electrical things are always
breaking down. It's not that difficult."
   Mr. Wasilewski agrees to round up a team of electricians
and leaves, walking on air.
   The risk doesn't faze him; he knows the rewards of
breaking the state's embrace. But Marx didn't teach ambition.
Most of Poland's dazed rejects, raised to believe communism
owed them a living, won't be so eager to start climbing from
capitalism's bottom rung.
   "There's a special psychology to Poles seeking a job,"
says Krzysztof Herbst, a sociologist who is setting up a bank
to help the unemployed go into business. "It doesn't have to
be a good job, but stable. That's the important thing. It's
got to be permanent."
   Back home from the labor office on a weekday evening,
Robert and Ewa Borzecki are going over the want ads in
Warsaw's morning paper. They share a cramped room in his
mother's apartment with a big dog.
   "I'd like to find a job as a secretary," she says, sitting
in the only chair. "Some ordinary office work. There's an ad
in the paper more or less of this kind. Some foreign
company."
   "It's responsible," Mr. Borzecki says. He sits on the
floor, leaning against the cupboard. "You have to handle
money. Big sums. If you make the smallest mistake, you'll
lose several months' pay."
   "It's more than eight hours a day. No overtime," she says.
Her husband sneers: "Volunteer work." "I called," she says.
"I'm supposed to go tomorrow. . . ."
   The new extension on Sonpol's suburban headquarters is
getting a coat of stucco late the next morning. A shipment of
plastic shampoo bottles stands outside the front entrance.
Clerks at numerous desks inside answer numerous telephones.
Another micro-conglomerate, owned by a Swede, Sonpol makes
toiletries and packs meat. It's branching out now and needs
an extra person in the purchasing department. Four candidates
have come and gone. Mrs. Borzecki is due at noon.
   In his carpeted office, Tadeusz Kaminski waits.
   "Areas that were exclusively the state's will be given
up," says the owner's representative. "A vacuum must be
filled." So Sonpol is moving into milk processing,
fertilizer, opening a travel agency. "Of course, we can't
absorb the whole work force laid off by the state, but we'll
employ several dozen more people."
   He checks his watch. It's 12:45.
   "My rule is talk to everyone, consider everything. Maybe
this young woman only took our ad into account. It was a
minimum offer. If she has my conviction -- talk to everyone,
consider everything -- she will come. If I see she has
potential, we can negotiate."
   But Mrs. Borzecki doesn't seize her opportunity. At 1
o'clock, she still hasn't turned up, and Mr. Kaminski goes
out to lunch.

   An Impartial Jury, Not an Ignorant One

   Jury selection in the drug and perjury trial of Washington
Mayor Marion Barry began yesterday. Can Mayor Barry get a
fair trial in Washington in the face of intensive pre-trial
publicity? Yes, as long as the court fulfills its
constitutional duty to empanel an impartial, not ignorant,
jury.
   The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution requires that
criminal defendants be tried by an "impartial jury of the
State and district wherein the crime shall have been
committed." Many judges, however, equate "impartial" with
uninformed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The problem is not a new one. In 1871, Mark Twain
described the system by which jurors are selected as putting
"a ban upon intelligence and honesty, and a premium upon
ignorance, stupidity, and perjury." Twain's concern was that
judges were responding to the dramatic expansion of the media
-- in 1871, "telegraph and newspapers" -- by banning informed
citizens from juries.
   Today technology, combined with an insatiable public
curiosity, has led to an explosion in news coverage and
dramatic re-enactments of crimes. The average hours of TV
usage by household is 7.2 hours a day; average radio usage is
almost three hours a day. And more than 64% of American
households read newspapers.
   It is next to impossible for a citizen to be unaware of
major crimes in his community. Even on the national level,
Manuel Noriega, Lt. Col. Oliver North, Exxon Valdez tanker
captain Joseph Hazelwood, billionaire Leona Helmsley, as well
as Mayor Barry, are household names.
   Some judges dismiss potential jurors merely because they
are media-literate. Other judges, concerned about the
possibility of not being able to seat a jury in
media-intensive trials, go the opposite way and -- running
roughshod over the Sixth Amendment -- ignore suggestions of
deep bias from potential jurors. The apparent majority,
however, take a middle road and attempt to inquire about
possibly biasing media exposure and to determine whether that
exposure will affect the ability of jurors to be impartial.
   The primary means through which they do this is voir dire.
Through a series of questions, the judge (and/or, in many
courts, attorneys) questions potential jurors in an effort to
determine whether they can be impartial. Many critics argue
that voir dire fails to elicit accurate or honest responses
from potential jurors. Who is going to admit publicly to
being a bigot? In fact, some attorneys believe that potential
jurors admit prejudice only as a convenient means of avoiding
jury duty.
   Many jurors underestimate their exposure, but with
follow-up questions demonstrate considerable knowledge about
the case. For instance, in the State v. Copeland trial, in
which a black defendant was tried in Medart, Fla., for the
brutal 1978 murder of a 19-year-old white woman, one juror
denied having any knowledge of the case, but admitted upon
further questioning to having "read it and discussed it and
read it in the newspapers."
   Even when the voir dire is conducted in the judge's
chambers away from public and press scrutiny, the procedure
is rife with impediments to identifying jurors most likely to
be impartial. For instance, judges and lawyers often indicate
the answers they want.
   In Copeland the judge asked: "You haven't read about it
{the case} or heard it on television or anything or discussed
it with anybody whereby you might have formed an opinion
about the case?" And, "well, from what you're telling me,
then, you could sit here and be fair and impartial and listen
to the evidence as it comes to you, as it is presented in
this courtroom and based solely on that evidence?"
   Effective voir dire questions are difficult to frame.
Vague, open-ended queries frequently fail to elicit
information about possible bias. Jurors may not understand
what information is prejudicial or improper, or may not even
be aware that they have been exposed to prejudicial
publicity. Specific questions, on the other hand, may give
the potential juror exactly the information the attorney
wants to be certain the juror does not have.
   But the ineffectiveness of existing techniques for
identifying and minimizing the impact of bias does not mean
that Mayor Barry cannot get a fair trial. The key lies in
defining an impartial juror. Jurors are not value free and
juries are not blank slates. Nor were they intended to be.
   The Supreme Court has identified a number of essential
roles for juries. The most important, according to the court,
is to protect citizens against "arbitrary law enforcement,"
"the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor," and "the compliant,
biased, or eccentric judge." Juries, the court has written,
"interpos{e} between the accused and his accuser . . . the
common-sense judgment of a group of laymen."
   If it is to safeguard liberty, protect against official
malfeasance, and represent the community -- as well as
determine the guilt or innocence of the accused -- the jury
must be composed of members with diverse backgrounds,
experience and views. This is why cases are decided by juries
and not individual jurors. The jurors should also be active,
informed members of the community. In fact, the skills of
discernment that most citizens exercise and refine daily in
evaluating the barrage of news, advertising and rhetoric
presented by the media may help jurors to be both impartial
and capable.
   As the Supreme Court wrote almost 30 years ago: "It is
sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or
opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented
in court."
   The role of courts, then, is not to eliminate all
potential jurors who are media-literate, ignore all evidence
of possible media-induced bias, or rely blindly on
ineffective, ill-targeted methods for controlling bias.
Rather, courts must inquire specifically as to what each
potential juror knows about the case, whether he holds
opinions about the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and
whether those opinions can be laid aside and a verdict
rendered based on the facts admitted into evidence.
   This will help the court judge potential jurors'
credibility and the likelihood they can render a decision
based on the evidence. Perhaps more important, it will help
potential jurors consider their own ability to live up to the
constitutional requirement of impartiality and help them
guard against improper bias throughout the trial.
   As Mark Twain said: "In this age, when a gentleman of high
social standing, intelligence, and probity swears that
testimony given under solemn oath will outweigh, with him,
street talk and newspaper reports based upon mere hearsay, he
is worth a hundred jurymen who will swear to their own
ignorance and stupidity, and justice would be far safer in
his hands than in theirs. Why could not the jury law be so
altered as to give men of brains and honesty an equal chance
with fools and miscreants?"

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   We've poured a lot of ink on the activist judiciary these
past few years, but the time has come to say a few good
words. A brace of Supreme Court decisions yesterday showed
common sense prevailing over legal abstractions.
   The court upheld the constitutionality of Bible reading
clubs in public schools. It ruled that undercover police
agents do not need to warn suspects that they have a right to
a lawyer. And it held that when police with a search warrant
find incriminating evidence in plain sight they can seize it
even if the warrant didn't specifically mention it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is a commentary on past rulings that such self-evident
outcomes constitute progress, but you have to start
somewhere. And it is impressive that two of the rulings
commanded 8-1 majorities, while the third drew only two
dissents. Even some of the more liberal members of the court,
it seems, are starting to sense that the court risks losing
public support if it operates in some hypertechnical and
incomprehensible netherworld.
   The rules of evidence, for example, bewilder almost any
onlooker. The fundamental problem is the exclusionary rule,
which makes the test of "evidence" not truth but the manner
in which it was seized. At the time this rule was propounded,
Justice Cardozo remarked on its essential silliness, "Because
the constable has blundered, the criminal shall go free." In
addition, the rule gave the Supreme Court the quixotic task
of finding the precise line police may not cross.
   Terry Brice Horton, for example, was convicted of holding
up the treasurer of a San Jose coin club, stunning him with
an electrical device and taking cash and coins worth $30,000.
The victim said he recognized Horton's voice, and police got
a warrant to search his apartment. They failed to find the
loot, but did find two stun guns. Their warrant listed coins
but not the guns. Was it constitutional to tell the jury
about the stun guns? Yes, the court said, with Justices
Brennan and Marshall dissenting.
   Lloyd Perkins was convicted of a murder he confessed,
while jailed on an unrelated charge, to an undercover
narcotics agent. The agent was introduced into his cell after
another inmate said Perkins had talked of the killing, and
the Miranda warning was not read until after the confession.
Was it constitutional to tell the jury what Perkins said to
the agent? Yes, the court ruled, with even Justice Brennan
joining the majority, leaving Justice Marshall to dissent
alone.
   When it comes to religion in the public schools, the court
gets to count angels on pinheads. A moment of silence is an
unconstitutional prayer, it has divined. This set of rulings
has also bewildered onlookers and left much of the public
suspicious and resentful at what it saw as an attempt to
expel religion from public life. Indeed, public school
officials in Omaha might be forgiven for believing they were
obligated to refuse an application for a Christian Bible
study club as an extracurricular activity. But in 1984
Congress passed a law saying public high schools accepting
federal aid must not discriminate against groups based on
"the religious, political, philosophical or other content of
the speech at such meetings." Despite opposition from groups
such as the National School Boards Association, the Court
held that the law was within Congress's right, and meant what
it said. Justice Stevens dissented.
   Surely there are other ways to keep students from being
coerced into prayer against their own beliefs, and
authorities other than the Supreme Court who can see the
right thing to do. There even are other ways to discipline
police excesses, especially now that segregationist Southern
sheriffs are no longer the rule. The Supreme Court invites
endless agony and erodes its own standing when it invokes the
Constitution to decide every detail of public life, and it's
comforting to see the court back away.

   If He Does Confirm Your Fears,
   Hang Up and Call Dial-a-Prayer

   Northern Californians don't have to just wait and wonder
when the next big quake will strike. Now they can simply make
a toll call -- or count stray dogs.
   Jim Berkland, the Santa Clara, Calif., County geologist,
predicts earthquakes via a 900 toll-call phone service called
"Quakeline." It gives folks a service "more complete and
timely than provided by the government," says Mr. Berkland,
who claims to have predicted quakes since 1974 with an
accuracy rate of more than 80%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His unique system is based on the position of the sun and
moon, tidal and geyser activity, and the number of pet
animals advertised as missing in local newspapers. Critters,
he claims, can sense something amiss in nature and flee
before a quake strikes.
   Business has been "marginal as 900 lines go," says Ryan
Wood, president of Quakeline. Still, he plans to expand to
Southern California and other earthquake "hot spots."
   Most seismologists, however, don't buy Quakeline's
methods. "It's bull," says Ed Bortugno, a senior geologist
with the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. Though he
calls Mr. Berkland a "very good geologist," he says selling
predictions is "very upsetting." He adds: "People are scared
enough. . . . In science, we know we don't know enough {to
predict big quakes} and we admit it."
   "We've known this guy throughout his professional life,
and he's distinguished himself by being a clown the entire
time," says Jerry Eaton, a seismologist at the U.S.
Geological Survey. Mr. Berkland's ideas, he says, are
"Reader's Digest science . . . these marvelous animals,
deprived of being human, are given other sensibilities. It's
pure hokum."
   Counters Mr. Berkland: "I am a scientist. I observe what
goes on in the real world." He has collected prequake
accounts of people who get bad sinus headaches, whales that
beach and homing pigeons that can't find their way home.
Once, an organic gardener told him that before a quake she
saw earthworms crawl out of the ground and die.
   When he saw ads for 27 missing cats and 58 missing dogs in
local papers last October, he called the Dispatch, a
newspaper in Gilroy, Calif., to predict the quake that struck
four days later on Oct. 17.
   But the science establishment says "it sounds too simple,"
says Mr. Berkland. "All I want is a fair shake."

   The Tea Boor Returns: Oolong, It's Been Good to Know You

<LP>
   New York -- A curious set of circumstances brought me to
afternoon tea at the aptly named Gold Room in the Helmsley
Palace Hotel here last week. You doubtless remember that in
March of this year I reported to you about my churlish
ineptitude during a tea-taking in London. In a letter
responding to that article, Lisa Sample of Iselin, N.J.,
noted that it was hardly necessary for me to trek all the way
to Mayfair to distinguish myself as a tea boor. There were,
she said, a number of perfectly good opportunities for me to
dribble all over myself right here at home. She mentioned two
New York hotels; I selected the one that seemed the sillier.
And so, Ms. Sample -- as the old television show used to say
-- You Asked for It]
   To please my correspondent, I really tried to do something
distinctively gauche. But at the Helmsley, it's practically
impossible to perpetrate a piece of social bumbling so
singular as to make one stand out from the crowd of people
paying $18.50 a piece for the privilege of drowning in
Lapsang Souchong and Devonshire cream. Throughout the room,
when faced with the decision as to which crustless sandwich
or piece of pastry to have, perfumed dowagers were asking the
waiter, "Can I try them all?" A vacationing family behind me
decided to let the world know they were leaving because
they'd discovered that there were no hamburgers on the bill
of fare. Voracious, cholesterol-deprived businesspeople were
using random utensils and/or bodily appendages to sample the
Devon cream.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the waiter presented me with the menu, I asked him if
I could keep it. I felt that, for purposes of this article,
it might be handy to have it at home with me later,
particularly if I were to decide that the reader had anything
to gain by being given a precise count of its curlicues. The
gentleman's pat reply -- and by his mechanical recital of it
I could tell that mine was hardly the first such request --
was to inform me that, no, I couldn't just make off with the
Helmsley's property, but I could, if I so chose, buy it for
five bucks. I demurred. Later, though, the waiter walked by
my table, pointed to the menu, and whispered, "If you're bad,
you can take that. I don't care." I was bad. There are 13
curlicues in the text. You read it here first.
   I ordered Formosa Oolong, which the menu claims is "An
Original Tea with Exquisite Flavour Reminiscent of Fresh
Peaches." This description may well be true if the peaches in
question were left overnight to soak in Grandma's
SweeTouch-Nee, but I found that my beverage had a taste that
I could classify only as tea-ish. Nonetheless, I did manage
to get authentic Oriental leaves in a pot of water, unlike my
companion, whose cinnamon tea was infused through a bag that
bore a label stating "blended by Ford Tea Co., Poughkeepsie,
N.Y." Poughkeepsie is, of course, where all the really great
tea blends come from. Ask any Englishman.
   A young woman in her early 20s sat at the next table with
her jewel-encrusted grandmother and asked question after
question in an incessant interrogation that sounded like a
bad dream about "Jeopardy." Did Nanna think the English
really eat all this food every day? Do they actually have
whole wheat bread in London? How sinful was it to have
seconds on the cream puff with the caramelized topping?
Wouldn't it be a good idea to collect all the missing crusts
and give them to the homeless?
   This vision of my garrulous neighbor giving her leftover
crumbs to the city's starving masses as if they were giant
pigeons was too much for my companion and me. We dipped our
pinkies into the raspberry preserves jar for the last time,
called for our check, and made a quick exit out of the hotel
and back into the real New York of rush-hour Madison Avenue.
   On the street, a wizened old woman with a thick Eastern
European accent stopped us. "Speak English?" she asked. We
nodded. "Be careful," she whispered from somewhere under her
babushka, and hooked her thumb in the direction of the
Palace.
   She was halfway down the block before we could figure out
what she meant, but it was a true Dickensian moment, and, as
such, the only thing even remotely British about our entire
afternoon.

   LOS ANGELES -- The Charles Schwab discount brokerage
office is buzzing as grizzled stock watchers and retirees
stare intently at stock prices flashing by on the electronic
display board overhead. Younger men in their 30s, dressed
casually in slacks and sport shirts, cluster around Quotron
machines.
   Then Angel Tompkins, a blond actress in trim white slacks
and peach T-shirt, sashays up to a Quotron machine to check
out some stocks.

<TEXT>
   Could this be an indicator? According to ancient market
wisdom, when the likes of film stars and taxi drivers become
buyers of stocks, it's time to think about becoming a seller.
The non-professionals, the reasoning goes, have a habit of
relying on hot tips and buying frothy stocks -- thus helping
create the kind of market euphoria that leads inexorably to a
plunge.
   But not this one. Even though Ms. Tompkins played a
negligee-clad bimbo in "Amazon Women on the Moon," a 1986
spoof of late-night television, she is no lightweight. She
says that since 1972, she has turned a credit-card debt of
$62,000 into a $100,000 portfolio of six carefully selected
stocks. Her research includes daily tracking of 215 stocks.
   "I am not a gambler," Ms. Tompkins says. Her main
criterion in stock selection: "Is the company merely
promising satisfaction to its customers, or do they really
deliver it?"
   The scene here at Schwab's office in the Century City
section of Los Angeles appears to be a microcosm of what
small investors around the U.S. have been doing. Even though
the Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied 10.5% over the
past five weeks -- it surged 34.22 points yesterday to a
record 2935.19 -- small investors by and large aren't chasing
blindly after untested stocks with high-tech names. Most of
those in Schwab's office are cautiously following blue chips
such as General Electric, IBM and McDonald's.
   "Individuals' activity is up, but they are still
skeptical. So far, they are doing more selling of individual
stocks than buying," says Robert Farrell, the chief technical
analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. At Schwab, individuals have
recently started to buy more than they sell, though just
barely.
   What small investors want more of is stock mutual funds.
So far this year, buyers of stock funds have outstripped
sellers at a rate of $1.9 billion a month. Their net
purchases total $7.8 billion, up from $5.8 billion in all
last year.
   Vanguard Group has opened 168,089 accounts this year,
compared with 65,149 for the comparable period two years ago.
In May, fund groups such as Fidelity Investments,
Massachusetts Financial Services and New England Securities
reported the strongest monthly inflows into stock funds since
1987. The number of telephone calls received by T. Rowe Price
Associates rose 17% from a year earlier.
   For Eric Kobren, publisher of Fidelity Insight, an
independent newsletter on Fidelity, the market's rise is a
boon. His subscribers now total 30,000, up from 12,000 after
the October 1987 crash and well ahead of the 23,000 just
before it. "Isn't it crazy?" he says. "With my marketing hat
on, I'm saying, `Let's go, let's go.' But with my investing
hat on, I'm much more cautious."
   Thomas Quick, president of Quick &amp; Reilly Inc., says that
52% of the customers at his discount brokerage firm have been
selling stocks lately but that his business has picked up.
"We are hearing from people we haven't heard from in a couple
of years," he adds. However, he says his customers' activity
is a long way from the euphoria just before the crash.
   Ever since then, individual investors have sold into
market rallies and bought on price weakness, according to
Philip J. Roth, chief technical analyst at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. Says Merrill Lynch's Mr. Farrell: "They've
gotten the right rhythm."
   That's not, however, what a lot of fund managers,
securities analysts and other market professionals think. One
veteran surveyor of household opinion, Albert Sindlinger of
Wallingford, Pa., says small investors are merely "putting
their money where their hopes are." His firm, which surveys
800 households a week, finds that their short-term plans to
buy stock have increased, to 9% of those questioned on May 28
from only 3% a month earlier.
   "A bunch of foolish people are convinced that interest
rates will decline with no recession and inflation under
control," Mr. Sindlinger warns. But in his opinion, "this
can't happen. We've got too many debts." He views the current
rally as "a bear-market trap for suckers" -- a brief upsurge
preceding a sharp decline.
   In any event, the heavy stock-buying these days isn't the
work of individuals but of mutual funds, pension funds and
other institutions. "Large investors over the past couple of
weeks have been putting money back into the stock market,"
says Peter VandenBerg, a senior vice president and block
trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "Interest rates are
falling, making stocks more attractive, and there is a better
feeling about corporate profits." He adds that whenever stock
prices slide a bit, big institutions are ready to step in and
buy.
   And with the public buying stock mutual funds, Dean
Witter's Mr. Roth says, "performance pressures are forcing
the pros to buy stocks" even though many of them have been
bearish for a long time.
   Moreover, some analysts say, stocks in general are fairly
valued by most measures. Many strategists think interest
rates are headed lower -- a plus for stocks -- and many
analysts have been raising their earnings estimates for the
second half and 1991.
   Polls of investment advisers, futures players and investor
organizations such as the American Association of Individual
Investors indicate "bullishness, but none of them show
excessive bullishness," Mr. Roth says. Analysts see the small
investors' caution as a good sign. When too many people are
enthusiastic, analysts fear that crowd psychology has lifted
stock prices beyond their true worth and has used up the
supply of buyers, setting up conditions for a severe
correction.
   So far this is "the quiet bull market," says George A.
Froley III, a managing director of Froley Revy Investment
Co., of Los Angeles. "It has featured no big excesses. Any
stock that's frothy comes back down. But the big stocks keep
chugging up. When the Dow gets to 3000, people are going to
say: `Why am I not in it?'"
   John Markese, executive vice president of the American
Association of Individual Investors, says surveys show his
members increasingly believe that any bad news probably is
already out. "They are looking six to nine months down the
line, and declining short-term and long-term interest rates
are making stocks look better," he says.
   The regulars at Schwab's Century City office are buying
stocks they know and understand. Howard Caplan, a retired
70-year-old from Encino, Calif., who is wearing a maroon
jogging suit and white captain's hat, says the U.S. has
"plenty of unfinished business -- the savings and loan mess
and the budget deficit" -- but he's still bullish. "Real
estate is crashing and gold stinks, so people will turn to
Procter &amp; Gamble, General Motors and General Electric," he
says. "It's a selective market. I like the blue chips." He
already owns Chevron, GM, Exxon, Citicorp and Allied-Signal.
   Ms. Tompkins, who has been in several movies, knows show
biz, so that's where she puts much of her money. Her big
holdings are in Sony, which owns Columbia Pictures, and News
Corp., the Australian concern that owns TV stations,
newspapers and Twentieth Century Fox Film. She says most
investors don't "have any notion of the profit potential" of
the film libraries owned by the two companies. "They are
continual revenue makers," she says.
   Small investors around the country seem to be following
the same big-company script. Tom Collins, 47-year-old owner
of a mobile-home business in Athens, Ga., who buys and sells
stocks via his personal computer, has purchased shares of
Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Reebok International. Melvin Kagan, a
59-year-old retired airline pilot in Honolulu, is adding to
his position in Boeing. "They have a fabulous backlog, and
they have their costs under control," he figures. "There's
still a lot more growth left in that stock."
   Young investors also like the big stocks. Mark Wurth is a
17-year-old senior at St. Mary's High School in Paducah, Ky.,
where the nuns are continually telling him to put away his
Wall Street Journal, and he has been investing since age 15
with money borrowed from his parents. "There is still money
to be made in the blue-chip stocks," he declares. He adds
that he would like to borrow more money to buy Coca-Cola and
Walt Disney because he thinks both stocks will climb, split
and climb further.
   Companies that may play a role in the economic development
of Eastern Europe are also in vogue with many small
investors. Mary Jane Jarvis, a 57-year-old in Westport,
Conn., says she has bought U.S. stocks with significant
investments going into Europe. Among them are McDonald's,
PepsiCo and Coke. "We'll have to be patient, but, over the
decade, these stocks will do well because of the developing
European markets," she says.
   In a similar vein, international stock funds have been the
hottest seller among mutual funds this year. In April,
American Fund Group's Smallcap World Fund racked up sales of
$662 million in its initial offering -- the second-largest
initial stock mutual fund offering on record.
   The popularity of international funds is a bit surprising.
Such funds are risky because they put investors at the mercy
of fluctuating currencies as well as volatile foreign stock
markets. And it contrasts sharply with the first four months
of last year, when the only types of stock funds racking up
net inflows of new money were the relatively staid
equity-income funds and growth-and-income funds.
   However, a sizable number of small investors remain
skeptical enough to sit this rally out. John K. Byerlein, a
63-year-old industrial-products sales manager in Newport
Beach, Calif., watches stocks' price momentum and compares it
with their historical price patterns and the price patterns
of the entire market. If the market drops below certain
volume figures and if the numbers of advancing and declining
stocks indicate weakness, Mr. Byerlein stays out. So far, he
has been keeping his money in short-term bonds and cash.
   "I'm disappointed to miss the run-up in the favored 50
stocks," he says, but adds: "So far, the rally hasn't been
broad enough. My advance/decline indicators aren't positive
enough for me to take a position."
   The overall economy also troubles him. "The national debt,
the trade deficit, slowing in the housing market, a recession
ahead, declines in auto sales -- all these disturb me." A
possible "market decline of 700 points" in the Dow Jones
industrials keeps him on the sidelines, he says.
   Maybe such a plunge is looming, but you can't prove it by
the regulars of Schwab's Century City office, veterans of a
lot of stock-market history.
   Oscar Markowitz of Beverly Hills, an 82-year-old retired
owner of specialty clothing stores who has been through good
times and bad, says he has no fear of the current market.
"Good securities will always be good," he says. "I don't buy
cheap stocks. If I lose, I don't have time to make my money
back."
   Recently, he has purchased shares in General Electric and
Westinghouse Electric. Among his other holdings: Philip
Morris and Ford.
   "Everything in the market is patience," advises Dorothy
Caplan, Howard Caplan's wife. "These young people think they
can make a killing with puts and calls. You can't predict the
market day by day, week by week. But you can over the long
term. It takes patience, patience, patience."

   Junk Bonds of 3 Trump Casinos Plunge
   On News Developer Faces Cash Crunch

BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The high-yield junk bonds of Trump Taj Mahal
and two other casinos operated by Donald Trump tumbled
sharply yesterday on news that the developer is facing a cash
crunch.
   Trump's casino bonds, already hammered by weakness in the
Atlantic City, N.J., gambling market, dived as much as nine
points, or $90 for bonds with a $1,000 face amount.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bonds recovered slightly later in the day but still
wound up with heavy losses, especially for the bonds of
Trump's costly new Taj Mahal casino.
   While the prices of the bonds should not directly affect
Mr. Trump's continuing negotiations with his bankers, they
are an indication of the public's declining confidence in his
ability to stay solvent.
   The price decline is likely, however, to cause bondholders
to put pressure on Mr. Trump to make sure that they receive
their interest payments. In the past, companies have used
their own depressed bond prices as a rationale for a
restructuring whereby bondholders would receive less than par
for their bonds.
   The sell-off followed an article in this newspaper
disclosing that Mr. Trump's bankers, who are owed $2 billion,
are seeking a restructuring of the developer's assets that
could force him to give up a chunk of his empire. The bankers
fear some Trump properties aren't generating enough cash. As
part of the negotiations, the bankers are opposing his making
a mid-June payment of a relatively minor $30 million on
certain casino bonds.
   In a statement yesterday, Mr. Trump's principal holding
company, Trump Organization, said the company is currently
"meeting with major banks and . . . having cooperative and
constructive discussions. Based upon the excellent asset
values and their long-term earnings potential, we are
confident we will arrive at a mutually beneficial solution."
   Hardest-hit yesterday were the bonds of Mr. Trump's giant
new Trump Taj Mahal, which is considered the weakest among
the developer's three casino hotels because it is the newest
and has the heaviest debt load. The Taj Mahal, which opened
in April, requires $1.3 million in revenue a day to break
even. Trump Taj Mahal Funding 14% bonds due in 1998 plunged
eight points, or $80 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, to
close at a price of 57 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Trump Plaza Funding's 12 7/8% bonds due in 1998 fell four
points to close at a price of 81. Trump Castle Funding's 13
3/4% bonds due in 1997 fell eight points to end at 61.
   David Feinman, a junk-bond trader at Los Angeles-based
Jefferies &amp; Co., said investors dumped Trump bonds for fear
they would continue to erode on any further news of financial
strains for Mr. Trump. "When approaching any troubled
situation, people would rather sell now" and cut their
losses, he said, "rather than wake up two days from now" and
find prices even lower. "This market is very sensitive to
negative press."
   Mr. Feinman said trading volume in Trump bonds yesterday
wasn't especially heavy. He said the thin trading may have
exacerbated the decline. Overall, the developer's interests
have more than $1 billion in bond debt outstanding, in
addition to the bank loans. The Wall Street Journal reported
that bankers have been resisting the payment of roughly $30
million in interest due in mid-June to bondholders of the
Trump Castle casino. The bankers were said to be opposed to
Mr. Trump's making the payment until steps can be taken to
ensure that payments due them will also be made.
   Trump has a $50 million bank loan outstanding on the Trump
Castle property to finance expansion of the site, analysts
say.
   Some high-yield junk analysts are skeptical that banks
could prevent Donald Trump from making the approaching
interest payments on the Trump Castle bonds.
   "It's like Visa telling you not to make your home mortgage
payment because you have a loan" on your charge card, says
one high-yield analyst. "The only recourse the banks have is
that they can put the obligation back to Donald personally."
   Ann Lorsung, an analyst at McCarthy Crisanti &amp; Maffei
Inc., said the Trump Taj Mahal bonds were slammed the hardest
because "it looks like the casino's requirements for external
financing are greater than expected." The three casinos'
bonds aren't personally guaranteed by Mr. Trump.
   Mr. Trump declined to comment through a spokesman.

   DALLAS -- National Income Realty Trust said it sold the

million.

   Chicago Retailers' `Sting' Aims to Put
   Shoplifting Professionals Out of Business

   CHICAGO -- The nation's retailers continue to lose the war
against shoplifting, which is the fastest-growing larceny
crime and now amounts to a $9 billion-a-year problem.
   To try to turn the tide, several of this city's biggest
retailers have gone to unusual lengths to corral shoplifting
pros. For two years, they bankrolled a suburban thrift shop
as a front. Five Cook County sheriff's deputies played store
clerks to legitimate customers in the front of the J&amp;O
Clothing store while acting as "fences" for stolen apparel in
the back office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The undercover cops paid top dollar for Perry Ellis suits,
Liz Claiborne dresses and other designer clothes snitched
from the stores by professional shoplifters. And they
videotaped the illicit deals with a hidden camera.
   Now the sheriff's department is seeking indictments
against 36 people suspected of shoplifting merchandise worth
$152,000 from familiar stores like Marshall Field's,
Neiman-Marcus, Lord &amp; Taylor and Carson Pirie Scott. Those
stores, along with Evans Inc., a fur-and-clothing-store
chain, put up the initial cash for the operation.
   The retailers consider the "sting" operation a success and
expect it to be tried elsewhere in the country. But it's much
too early to claim victory. If the past is any guide, few of
the accused shoplifters will get the maximum five-year
sentence, or any jail term at all. Since jails already are
crowded with more dangerous criminals, many shoplifters get
probation -- and resume their lives of crime.
   Professional thieves these days thwart anti-theft tags by
stuffing merchandise into bags lined with aluminum foil. Or
they smuggle untagged goods out in oversized girdles.
Closed-circuit TV cameras don't stop them either. Even hiding
store security guards in portable pillars with two-way
mirrors, called Trojan Horses, hasn't prevented shoplifting
from escalating.
   "The only thing that can prevent {shoplifters} from coming
back is if they croak," declares Mary Mattimore, loss
prevention manager at Marshall Field's biggest store.
   The Chicago retailers, nevertheless, say the sting helped
them identify the city's most active thieves. The retailers
intend to post pictures of convicted shoplifters in their
store offices, alerting security people to toss them out.
   Still, the operation started with agonizing slowness.
After the store opened in August 1988, two months passed
before the deputies made their first buy from a thief -- a
brown mink jacket.
   For more than a year, the deputies primarily were
salesclerks, serving a mix of factory and office workers,
travel agents and young mothers who stopped by the shabby
$1,000-a-month storefront tucked between a travel agency and
a Baptist church in the suburb of Niles just north of
Chicago.
   In a typical month, the undercover police waited on just
15 or 20 legitimate customers and collected only about $800
in sales. Hours -- sometimes days -- passed without any
visitors at all. Last July, the deputies rang up a pitiful
$77.16 in sales. They passed the time sipping soft drinks and
watching everything from Geraldo Rivera to the Flintstones on
a small black-and-white television set.
   Some of the retailers started to worry. Burnett Donoho,
president of Marshall Field's, turned to Lewis Shealy, his
head of loss prevention and the architect of the plan, one
day last year and asked: "Did we buy a pig in a poke here?"
   The big hurdle proved to be getting the word out to
shoplifters. William Maloney, the deputy who supervised the
operation for the sheriff, was willing to pay 30% of the
ticketed price for stolen clothes -- a premium over the going
rate of 25 cents on the dollar paid by other fences. He
couldn't exactly advertise. Instead, he paid informants $100
or $150 to tell their friends.
   Marshall Field's security people tried to help by
suggesting to suspected shoplifters that J&amp;O was in the
fencing business. While interrogating suspects in store
detention rooms, they would pick up a J&amp;O business card from
the floor and ask: "Did this drop out of your pocket? Is this
your fence?"
   Shoplifters finally started favoring J&amp;O during last
year's Christmas season. The break came after an undercover
cop was assigned to spread the word about J&amp;O's fencing
operation. Thieves started offering the deputies clothes from
more stores.
   On March 26, a well-dressed woman who called herself
"Urina" strolled in with the operation's largest haul -- nine
men's suits ranging in price from $680 to $825 and nine
women's outfits priced from $236 to $315. The suits came from
Marshall Field's and the women's outfits from Lord &amp; Taylor.
One of the deputies handed her $2,735 in cash. Another,
hiding in a narrow hallway behind the office with a shotgun
at his side, videotaped the deal through a hole in a pegboard
on the wall.
   "Urina" also spread the word about J&amp;O, telling a woman
who called herself "GiGi." She showed up one recent
afternoon, wearing a heart-shaped stud through her nose and a
short-sleeve blouse that revealed a tattoo on her right arm.
Her haul: three Liz Claiborne dresses from Carson Pirie. "I
think I'm going to ease around to the men's department," she
told the deputies. "I'm going to call y'all as soon as I get
finished." After collecting $110 in cash, she added: "I want
you to know: I am a thief."
   With the shop's illicit business picking up this spring,
the retailers decided to wrap up the operation. By then, many
of the stores -- which anted up a total of $17,500 at the
outset and supplemented it with more than $34,000 to buy back
the stolen goods -- had learned which stores were being hit
hardest and had stepped up security there. "It served its
purpose," says Ronald Kravitz, Evans's security chief.

   In East Europe, Only Poland Makes Hard Decisions

   WARSAW -- If, as an Italian Communist Party leader once
said, "there are many roads to socialism," these days there
are at least as many roads back from it. All of them are full
of potholes and other pitfalls.
   Every country in East Europe has now embarked on such a
journey -- or is at least discussing what bags to pack. The
desired destination in each case is some nebulous mix of
democratic institutions, the alluring but confusing benefits
of capitalism, and the social safety net to which they've all
become accustomed during more than 40 years of Marxist
stagnation. They start, however, from very different stages
of political sophistication and economic development and have
significantly different chances of success.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Recent travel in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland leads
to the perhaps surprising conclusion that it is Poland -- the
country starting from farthest behind and traveling the
rockiest road -- that stands the best chance of actually
making the transition to genuine capitalism. Poland already
has packed its bags and set off while its wealthier neighbors
are still planning their voyage.
   In any analysis of East Europe these days, one must set
aside East Germany. Though it shares the past miseries of
Marxism, it has a unique future as an integral part of an
enlarged German nation. At the other extreme, Bulgaria and
Romania, despite recent and enormous change, start from so
far back that they are destined to remain laggards. Thus, the
focus on problems and potential for Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Poland.
   Clearly there are commonalities. All three have the
burdensome legacy of ossified, uncompetitive economies. All
three have also been chained to the rigid Soviet economy. To
a degree generally overlooked by Americans, all three still
count the Soviets as their largest trading "partner." The
Lilliputians in this case remain tightly tied down by
Gulliver. There simply isn't any quick way out of dependency
on Soviet raw materials, nor an immediate alternative to the
Soviet market, which, unlike the West, is willing to barter
for frequently shoddy goods made by unmotivated workers in
antiquated factories.
   "We trade our stray dog for their blind cat," says Peter
Bod, a youthful, market-oriented economic adviser to
Hungary's new prime minister.
   The three countries also share officials mostly new to
government and overwhelmed by the challenge of creating
capitalism. A visit to the finance ministry in Czechoslovakia
is typical. "Czechoslovakia is a madhouse," says Dusan
Triska, a frantic, fortyish economist with an Einstein-like
coiffure. He is responsible for privatization programs. "We
are trying to do everything at once. New laws are being
introduced every day; we can't keep up with it all."
   All three countries covet German markets and money. Yet,
on the one hand, they fear it won't materialize as German
resources pour into East Germany; on the other hand, they
fear becoming German economic satellites.
   Also, to a degree that ought to concern Americans,
officials in all three countries are surprisingly reconciled
to the general irrelevance of America to their immediate
economic futures. They may look to America as a source of
inspiration, but they have reluctantly concluded that it
isn't going to supply much practical financial support. The
surprising thing to an American visitor is how infrequently
America is even mentioned in the offices or coffee houses of
Eastern Europe.
   If such similarities cut across all three ex-satellites,
there also are significant differences in atmospherics and
substance.
   Czechoslovakia, which statistically enjoys a per-capita
standard of living well beyond Poland's $1,100, still is so
desperate for foreign currency that all visitors are forced
upon arrival to exchange $16 for every day they will be in
the country. While Poland is coping with the consequences of
last January's sudden conversion to market, rather than
centrally administered, prices, Czechoslovakia's officials
continue to meet weekly to debate what economic reforms to
pursue. Its president seems more interested in making peace
between Arabs and Israelis than in resolving economic policy
disputes among his own ministers. Debate drags on in
government while Parliament busies itself changing street
names and discussing whether the name Czechoslovakia should
be hyphenated -- or whether Czechs and Slovaks should inhabit
the same nation at all.
   Some Czechs already are suggesting that perhaps socialist
economics, absent Soviet overlords, isn't so bad after all.
Since the Czechs have more to start with, they fear they have
more to lose. With a degree of comfort has come a higher
degree of complacency.
   The Czechs are searching for a route to risk-free
capitalism. For example, they continue to debate a national
voucher system whereby citizens each would receive a paper
"right" to buy equity in various state enterprises. Among the
problems with this paper privatization, however, is that
vouchers couldn't be freely traded, meaning that both
vouchers and enterprises will lack real market value. What
should happen to uneconomic enterprises in which no Czech
chooses to invest vouchers? "We can sell those to the
Japanese," says Mr. Triska.
   Vladimir Dlouhy, Czechoslovakia's new minister of
planning, who really would like to become the country's
minister of unplanning, sits in Prague's largest bastion of
bureaucracy, and says with a smile, "welcome to the heartbeat
of communist planning."
   Increasingly frustrated by political indecisiveness, Mr.
Dlouhy says, "We know what steps we have to take, but the
politicians aren't ready to take them." Optimists here
believe Czechoslovakia's direction will be set following
national elections Friday. But it's far from clear that much
will really change.
   At this point, Czechoslovakia, with its prewar industrial
base, its artistic and intellectual tradition and its
telegenic president, is quite clearly the world's darling.
But the world's darling risks ending up one of the world's
economic orphans if it continues to delay hard decisions.
   In Hungary's capital of Budapest a different kind of
disillusionment is setting in. Hungary over the last decade
managed to move significantly further toward a mix of Marxism
and market economics than any other state in East Europe. It
operated on a looser leash from Moscow, established more
trade with Western Europe, and built a reputation with
Western banks.
   Hungary is perplexed by several paradoxes. Precisely
because they managed to advance under communism, external
expectations these days are higher for the Hungarians.
Westerners arrive expecting a functioning market economy.
Hungary, however, was never a highly industrialized nation
and it never was willing or able genuinely to privatize its
economy. Hungarians are reluctant to yield elements of their
socialist safety net for the risks of greater economic
freedom.
   Frustrations exist in daily Hungarian life, like a
six-year wait to take title to an automobile. But the
frustrations aren't so great as to prompt strong public
demand for sharp change. The winners of this spring's
divisive election pledged to move the country
"compassionately" toward capitalism. The party promising more
economic pain en route decisively lost.
   "We've gone halfway on economic reform for 20 years and it
hasn't worked," says Ferenc Bartha, chairman of the Hungarian
National Bank.
   Indeed, if complacency is the problem in Czechoslovakia,
gradualism is the difficulty in Hungary. "I warn against the
philosophy of gradualism," says a senior executive of
Germany's Deutsche Bank. "Gradualism nourishes the illusion
you can avoid pain."
   Prime Minister Jozsef Antall recently sought to reassure
Western bankers who have financed Hungary's $20 billion
foreign debt. "Our mandate of election means we have the
moral trust to make the public accept hard decisions." But,
he added, "Harsh measures can be executed only in parallel
with the creation of a social safety net."
   It's not surprising that Hungarian officials want it both
ways. Genuine economic change would require harsh measures
for which there could be a political price. Any political
instability would scare off creditors and investors, leaving
Hungary bereft of external private support. One further
complication: Hungarians are engaged in divisive politics
over minorities in neighboring countries. To foreigners
looking in on East Europe, there are a number of distinct
countries with defined borders. But to many in East Europe,
there are rather a number of distinct nationalities who
transcend post-war borders. The issue of Romanian treatment
of Hungarian minorities dominates Hungarian politics more
than issues of socialism and capitalism.
   While the Czechs and Hungarians are seeking painless paths
to prosperity, the Poles are accepting genuine economic
sacrifice.
   In January, Poland's new Solidarity government launched
what it calls its "leap to the market." The government
slashed the budget, including a wide range of subsidies. It
tightened the money supply. It radically devalued the zloty.
It largely decontrolled prices, though not -- yet -- wages.
It encouraged foreign competition at the risk of bankrupting
state enterprises.
   The effects were predictably quick and traumatic. Costs of
such basic necessities as electricity rose by more than 300%
within a matter of weeks, and even the price of a bottle of
vodka doubled. Inflation soared -- to 80% in January -- but
has subsided since to roughly 5% a month. Wages, deindexed
from price increases, dropped sharply in real terms. Polish
unemployment rose to roughly 300,000 (still less than 2%) and
is predicted to rise to one million by year-end; by contrast,
the Hungarians fret about 4,000 jobless.
   As the money supply shrank, the monthly interest rate shot
to 40% in January -- though it, too, has since fallen to 8%
in April and 5.5% in May. The zloty was devalued 35% but the
result is a freely convertible currency that enables Poland's
economy to engage in internationally competitive commerce.
Indeed, few Poles any longer demand payment in dollars, as
the zloty is readily redeemable by any citizen at a local
bank for hard currency. Six months ago a hotel maitre d'
would chase down patrons offering to tear up the zloty
equivalent of a $50 dinner check in exchange for a $10 bill.
   The immediate downside of this high-stakes program has
been a significant decline in industrial production and fears
of a major recession. "We expected a drop of production,"
says Wojciech Misiag, deputy finance minister and an
architect of the economic reform plan. "Once you create a
real market, a lot of production here isn't salable; some
Polish products are too costly to produce." Industrial
production fell 30% in January and February but has
stabilized, and Mr. Misiag believes the downward trend is
reversing.
   The signs of robust commerce on Warsaw's main streets seem
to support Mr. Misiag's optimism. If some old enterprises are
foundering in the newly competitive marketplace, new
entrepreneurial activity is flourishing. This city now teems
with sidewalk sellers offering everything from formerly
unattainable fresh fruit to fashionable Italian footwear.
   Typical is Jan Kulibab, a sidewalk shoe salesman, peddling
his total inventory of two dozen pairs of Italian shoes from
behind a table on a Warsaw street corner. Mr. Kulibab is
selling the shoes for $19 a pair; he buys them at $16 a pair
from a wholesaler who travels back and forth by bus to
Germany, where he buys the shoes for $12 a pair. Mr. Kulibab,
however, doesn't intend to remain a sidewalk shoe salesman.
His ambition is to save enough zlotys to rent a vacant
sausage shop where he can display a wider range of shoes and
undercut the shoddy merchandise at the state-owned department
store down the street. "Last month I made an 800,000 zloty
profit {about $80} but with a shop I could do much better,"
he says.
   In addition to the enterprise of its Kulibabs, Poland also
benefits from a degree of political unity still unknown
elsewhere in East Europe. In Hungary and Czechoslovakia --
and even more so in Romania and Bulgaria -- the "new"
political leadership consists of at best a handful of former
opposition politicians who sit atop layer upon layer of
politicians and bureaucrats, who may have changed their party
affiliation but not necessarily their Marxist mentality. In
the rest of East Europe political reformation runs only skin
deep. But in Poland there is genuine political revolution.
   That revolution, of course, has been under way for nearly
a decade -- since Lech Walesa and his Solidarity movement
first challenged the monolithic power of the Polish Communist
Party. Here the pressure for political change has come from
below -- from shipyard workers rather than playwrights.
   Skeptics, and there are many, still argue that there is
little in Poland's long history of division to justify much
optimism about transition to long-term democracy and
prosperity. But the facts support some optimism. Few
outsiders believed back in the dark days of martial law
suppression of Solidarity that the movement could rise again
to challenge communist control. More recently, many doubted
whether the Solidarity government would have the guts to take
what amounts to a free fall into market economics. In each
case, Poles confounded skeptics.
   With all they've been through, Poles are not dreamers
about the future, but neither are they whiners or worriers
about the present. The clear impression is that they have
resolutely embarked on a rocky road back from communism and
that they mean to see the journey through.

   It doesn't seem to be very big news that the negotiations
in the Bush-Congress budget summit are about to resume. Who
can blame the public or even the media for losing interest?
Farmers and Social Security recipients probably are the only
segments of the American electorate who have any clear idea
of what the federal budget does anymore. It's like a massive,
exploding star of gas and dust, which now measures $1.2
trillion in diameter. Maybe it's a threat to real life, but
how would you know? Many people still keep telescopes trained
on Washington because there is talk of raising their taxes to
close the distance between the budget's revenues and outlays
at the edge of the universe. The summit astronomers say
spending this money to shorten the measurements of the
deficit will produce a prosperous new civilization.
   Let's come down to Earth. Let's visit New Jersey.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unlike life with the federal government, the people of New
Jersey more or less know what is going on around them. One
might say the same about the people of New York, Connecticut
and Massachusetts. All these jurisdictions have one thing in
common with the federal government -- a big hole in their
budgets. And all are now in the process of attempting to
figure out what taxes to increase.
   The accompanying table on per-capita spending over six
recent years by these and other states offers a clear idea of
why some states are struggling with their budgets. But
something more important is reflected in this data than the
fact that they've spent more than was prudent, and this is no
more evident than in the case of New Jersey.
   New Jersey's new Democratic Governor, former Congressman
Jim Florio, has added a unique twist to the familiar
belt-tightening, tax-raising scenario. Governor Florio, an
unabashed liberal, has proposed to reorganize the way New
Jersey pays for public education. It is a complex formula,
which may be altered by the legislature, but its goal is to
take about $150 million of the state's share of school
budgets away from so-called "wealthy" school districts and
transfer it primarily to inner-city systems, such as Camden's
and Newark's.
   The Governor expects the districts losing money to make up
some of the shortfall by raising their property taxes. Also,
Mr. Florio would transfer down to the local level
responsibility for the teachers' pension and Social Security
costs. Moreover, the Florio fiscal package includes, besides
some program cuts, increasing sales taxes and doubling the
top marginal income-tax rate (and using some of this to lower
some property taxes.)
   Governor Florio has been attracting some national
attention as a liberal Robin Hood who's willing to transform
the Garden State into Sherwood Forest. If the state's economy
doesn't relocate to Pennsylvania or the citizens don't drive
the legislature's Democrats from office, his national star
will rise, at least in the Democratic firmament. But all this
is New Jersey's peculiar problem.
   We're inclined to think that Mr. Florio has done American
politics in general a large favor. Unintentionally, his
proposal will force a lot of people to finally come to grips
with the cost and purpose of the public sector.
   The plight of the school districts he plans to cut off
mirrors that of the federal budget and many other state
budgets. Local Jersey school systems say their hands are tied
by the fact that most of their budget outlays are "mandated"
or "untouchable" in the form of teachers' salaries and
benefits, and so most of the cuts have to come out of
vulnerable and "worthwhile" programs. This, of course, is the
familiar Washington "entitlement spending" chorus. It is, in
short, the bullet the system has refused to bite for about 20
years.
   Now the choices, as with New Jersey's schools, are getting
pretty stark: Either take on the untouchables --
public-employee salary and benefit structures, the cost of
ever-increasing environmental "mandates" (for example,
asbestos abatement), and federal entitlements -- or watch
those things that are most valued slowly crumble.
   The Jim Florios of the world, who are found at all levels
of government, assume that in the crunch voters will again
swallow new taxes to prop up the public sector. Our reading
is that this process has about run its course, and that in
places such as New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and
Washington, it's time to start searching for alternatives to
the "untouchable" status quo.

   Your Money Matters -- Investment Dartboard:
   Pros Win Match in May, With 11% Gain

   May was a good month for the stock market, but the gain
chalked up by four investment pros in this column's
stock-picking contest was even better.
   While the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.3% for the
month, the contestants' picks gained 11%, on average. That
was a couple of percentage points better than the 8.9% gain
on four stocks picked by a toss of darts at the New York
Stock Exchange listings. As a result, the pros notched their
fourth consecutive victory over the darts, and their 15th in
20 outings.

<TEXT>
   Lawrence Cisneros, president of San Juan Asset Management
Inc. in Huntington Beach, Calif., was the month's big winner.
His May selection turned out to be right on the mark: Service
Corp. International, a funeral-home and cemetery chain, rose
nearly 17%.
   For the next one to six months, Mr. Cisneros recommends
Dexter Corp., a specialty-chemicals producer in Windsor
Locks, Conn. He likes the way the company picks its niches,
and thinks it has been wise to deemphasize commodity
chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride in order to concentrate
on items with higher profit margins. Among its products are
powders used in making computer chips, and special paint for
airplanes. Dexter also has interests in electronics, food
packaging and medical research.
   The stock isn't high-priced compared with the company's
earnings. It closed yesterday at $23.875 a share, and
earnings last year were $1.73 per share. (This year, analysts
look for earnings of about $1.85.) So the shares are selling
at about 13 times earnings -- below average in today's pricey
market.
   Dexter owns 62% of Life Technologies Inc., a biotechnology
and cancer-research firm. Including this stake, Mr. Cisneros
reckons that Dexter's "breakup value" (the total price the
company would bring if its various operations were broken up
and sold off) is around $50 a share. He would buy at any
price to a maximum $28, which is the stock's 52-week high.
   Small-stock advocate Jonathan Steinberg won the contest in
March and April. The publisher of Individual Investor
magazine trailed in the one-month derby this time. But he
picked the biggest winner of the past six months, earning
himself a fourth consecutive appearance. In March, he
recommended American Film Technologies Inc., a leader in the
business of converting black-and-white films into color
films. The stock was selling then for $6 a share. By the end
of May, it had moved up to $11.25, for an 87% gain.
   Mr. Steinberg's latest pick is Financial News Network
Inc., which he says appears "to have beaten back {the}
attack" by rival cable network CNBC. "They are doing very
well in a sluggish advertising environment and a downturn for
the securities industry," he says.
   For the nine months ended in March, Financial News Network
earned $4.7 million, up from $1.9 million in the year-earlier
period. "They are plowing their money back into upgrading the
programming," says Mr. Steinberg. "They will be one of the
leading disseminators of business information into the next
century."
   FNN traded in the national over-the-counter market
yesterday at $9.125 a share. That's about 24 times the past
12 months' earnings, adjusted for certain statistical quirks.
Mr. Steinberg says he'd buy the shares at prices to a maximum
of $10.75.
   Two new players join the fun this month. Alan Bond is
equity portfolio manager at W.R. Lazard &amp; Co. in New York.
Heiko Thieme is manager of the American Heritage Fund and a
consulting strategist for Deutsche Bank of West Germany.
   Mr. Bond plumps for Syntex Corp., which he says is
successfully making the transition "from a single-product
company {Saprosyn, an anti-arthritis drug} to a diversified
drug company." He has high hopes for several products Syntex
expects to introduce soon, especially Ticlid, an anti-stroke
drug, and Synarel, a drug to treat endometriosis. And he's
impressed with Syntex's strong return on equity (about 40%).
   Earnings growth at Syntex has been about 15% a year, but
Mr. Bond thinks it may accelerate to as much as 20% through
1993. He would pay a maximum $65 a share for the stock, which
closed yesterday at $58.50. Mr. Thieme picks Citicorp, which
"nobody wants" because of the banking industry's problems
with real-estate loans and loans to third-world countries.
   Interest rates aren't helping much either. They're still
higher than banks would like. (Low rates help banks maintain
a wide percentage spread between the rates they pay on
deposits and the rates they charge on loans.) But Mr. Thieme
thinks rates (currently 8.6% on long-term Treasury bills)
will ease to 8% or less by year end.
   Anyway, the industry's troubles are fully reflected in
Citicorp's "beaten-down" stock price, Mr. Thieme says.
Yesterday's price was $24.625 a share; he says he'd buy the
stock at prices to a maximum $26. "On a six-month basis, I
have very little doubt that it could be a $30 stock."
   "The {dividend} yield of 7.7% shows that the management of
{Chairman and Chief Executive Officer} John Reed has
confidence in the outlook," Mr. Thieme says. "I share his
confidence."
   For June, the pros' selections are up against a dartboard
portfolio consisting of Callahan Mining Corp., Knogo Corp.,
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. and Sonat Inc.

   Trump's New Book

   LAS VEGAS -- Donald Trump's personal and financial
tribulations are giving him cold feet over a second trip to
the bookstore.
   "Trump: Surviving at the Top," is due for publication by
Random House in October, a sequel to the wildly successful
"Trump: The Art of the Deal," which sold between 900,000 and
one million copies in 1987. But speaking at a breakfast at
the American Booksellers Association convention here
yesterday, Mr. Trump said he called Random House associate
publisher Peter Osnos several days ago and "tried to put the
book off, postpone it for a year."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a jocular speech, Mr. Trump told the ABA crowd that he
was persuaded to go ahead in spite of his reservations by
Random House executives. But, he said, "We may have to end
certain chapters with a question mark. We may have to end the
whole book with a question mark."
   Mr. Trump, usually not shy about publicity, said he told
Random House's Mr. Osnos, "This really isn't good timing for
this book: There are so many unknowns. I'm getting the worst
press of my life. How can we bring this book out now? I mean,
the marriage, the this, the that. I named 10 other small
things" that are unresolved. Mr. Trump was referring to the
much-publicized rift with his wife, Ivana, and to reports of
concerns that he won't be able to meet interest payments due
in the next few months. Yesterday, Trump Organization said it
is "meeting with major banks and having cooperative and
constructive discussions" regarding the company's assets.
   Mr. Trump, who said he is still finishing "Surviving at
the Top," added that he still thinks it might be better to
postpone the book until everything is resolved. "Then I'll
know how the marriage turned out, whether my victory over
Merv Griffin was really devastating." Mr. Griffin's Resorts
International Inc. is under bankruptcy protection following a
well-publicized battle for control with Mr. Trump. "I told
him {Mr. Osnos} that Chapter 11 has to be the Merv Griffin
chapter," Mr. Trump joked at the booksellers meeting.
   Mr. Trump was persuaded to write a second book by his
friend S.I. Newhouse Jr., whose family's Advance Publications
Inc. owns Random House.
   While he didn't specifically comment on his financial
situation, Mr. Trump did read a paragraph from his new book
that could be taken as a response to those skeptical of his
chances. "Toughness is being a gracious winner and bouncing
back when you lose," he read. ". . . Some say I'm at the
beginning of the end, but I say this is just the beginning of
the beginning."

   Foreign Market Share
   For Semiconductors
   Levels Off in Japan

   TOKYO -- After a year of steady increases, foreign
semiconductor market share in Japan leveled off in the first
quarter, according to independent industry statistics.
   American officials said they were disappointed by the 13%
share, a 0.1 percentage point increase over the fourth
quarter of 1989. The five-year U.S.-Japan semiconductor
agreement expires a year from now, and Americans say the
Japanese promised to work for a 20% foreign share by the end
of the pact.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're pleased with the changes in attitudes and practices
of Japanese (semiconductor) users," said E. David Metz,
executive director of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry
Association's Japan office. "However, in light of the modest
increase in this most recent quarter, we still need greater
efforts."
   In the fourth quarter, foreign share grew by nearly one
percentage point over the previous three-month period,
according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS)
organization.
   Japanese industry and government officials, who deny ever
agreeing to a market share target, played down the
significance of the numbers, saying that a dip in the overall
semiconductor market in the first quarter made it difficult
for electronics companies to increase foreign share. They
added that foreign share will likely increase sharply again
in the current quarter ending June 30.
   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
which measures market share differently than WSTS, showed
foreign share increasing nearly one percentage point in the
quarter, to 17.2% from 16.3%. A MITI official said the agency
measures orders, while WSTS measures shipments.
   When the bilateral trade agreement was first negotiated in
1986, foreign share of the Japanese chip market hovered
around 9%. As the numbers remained stuck during the first
year of the agreement, the U.S. imposed sanctions on certain
Japanese imports using semiconductors.
   But in the past two years, companies from both countries
have started working more closely together, and the U.S. has
curbed its criticism.

   Mattel Again Is Heading the Toys Parade

   HAWTHORNE, Calif. -- Even as the Berlin Wall crumbled,
officials of Mattel Inc. rushed in to size up the Eastern
European market. But they were faced with a problem: How to
introduce Western-quality and Western-priced toys to a market
used to playthings that were generally simple and drab, but
cheap?
   The solution: Friendship Barbie, a basic blond version of
Mattel's long-running star that will be sold at cost, about
$6, to introduce millions of consumers to the joys of
U.S.-style shopping.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And where Barbie leads, can Hot Wheels and Mickey Mouse
toys be far behind? Mattel, given up for dead six years ago,
has steadily fought its way back by eschewing volume for net
income, coming up with endless variations of its longtime
staples, and pushing internationalization almost as a
religion.
   As the toy industry consolidates and once-hot companies
vanish like spent hula hoops, Mattel has rebounded to become
one of the fastest-growing and most fashionable toy companies
on Wall Street.
   Recently, the company drove home the point by reinstating
its dividend, announcing plans to pare debt and landing
toy-licensing rights to News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Inc.'s
hit television cartoon show "The Simpsons."
   Moreover, Mattel's stock is riding high on the New York
Stock Exchange and investors and analysts are looking for the
company to outperform the toy industry. Yesterday, in Big
Board composite trading Mattel closed at $25.875, up 62.5
cents; the stock's 52-week high is $26.375.
   It was spindly-legged Barbie that helped haul Mattel back
to profitability, ringing up $590 million in world-wide sales
in 1989; the doll, along with other basic toy lines,
accounted for more than 75% of Mattel's consolidated sales.
Mattel posted net of $68.7 million on sales of $1.2 billion
in 1989.
   John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, and his handpicked executives hawk Barbie
and her associates as if the toys were chewing gum or
scouring powder. That comes naturally to Mr. Amerman, a
veteran of Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Warner Lambert Co. who
became Mattel's chairman in 1987 after heading its
international operations for seven years.
   "The toy business is a seat-of-the-pants business," says
Robert Sansone, who came in to head Mattel USA in 1987 after
24 years with General Foods Corp. "But most of what we're
doing here is from Marketing 101."
   Mattel crash-landed in 1983, shot down by years of
unbridled diversification, sloppy management and a disastrous
plunge into electronic toys. Under former chairman Arthur
Spear, the company bailed out of electronics and
entertainment, but not before posting a staggering $394
million loss for fiscal 1984. The company continued to drift,
even as a flood of competitors' blockbusters took the market
by storm.
   Mattel also has had its share of trendy hits. Its He-Man
and Masters of the Universe action figure and vehicle line,
built around a Saturday morning cartoon series the company
paid for, rocketed to $400 million in sales by 1985. But when
the show's costs edged upward and viewership drifted down,
Mattel didn't cut back supply, so the toys languished on
retailers' shelves and profits evaporated. "Inventory is a
killer in this business," Mr. Amerman says.
   Chastened, Mattel has trotted out new versions of its
muscle-bound heroes and villains again. But now, Mattel won't
foot the bill for a new cartoon series scheduled for the
fall, and inventory will be kept lean. Mr. Amerman says
He-Man's domestic sales this year may double to about $20
million.
   Mr. Amerman streamlined Mattel's management ranks but has
stepped up the company's spending on consumer research,
trying to balance basic marketing with the gut instincts that
toymakers traditionally used to identify promising products.
   The company, which alienated some retailers before the
management shakeout with a hunger for volume at almost any
cost, now has senior managers working directly with important
customers. Mr. Amerman oversees the team handling the K mart
Corp. account, while Mr. Sansone works with top management of
Toys `R' Us Inc.
   "They treat us as a partner, and that wasn't so much the
case years ago," says Michael Goldstein, vice chairman of
Toys `R' Us, adding: "They've made tremendous strides."
   That relationship may stand Mattel in good stead as it
expands overseas. Toys `R' Us's ambitious plan to build a
170-store international chain by the end of 1992 could give
Mattel an extra boost, particularly in cracking difficult
markets such as Japan.
   While Mattel is the largest and most profitable
international toymaker with more than $1 billion in
international sales last year, that doesn't prevent some
flops and missteps here and overseas.
   Barbie, for example, doesn't stack up to Hot Wheels in
India because of the male-dominated culture. And the Japanese
craze for superfast battery-driven cars didn't translate to
the U.S., partly because Mattel and others misread the hobby
as an at-home toy.
   Still, Mattel's overseas business is growing. Lindsey
Williams, president of Mattel International, says the Disney
line should get a boost with the 1992 opening of Euro
Disneyland, and Mattel's network of international offices is
burgeoning. New offices have opened in East Berlin and
Budapest, with another slated for Warsaw by year end.
   Mr. Williams says the overseas markets are less volatile
than the U.S., with products slower to peak and slower to
decline. With the overseas appetite for basic products such
as miniature cars, infant toys and large dolls, he says,
Mattel intends "not to waste precious resources introducing
fads."
   Mattel and other big toymakers may be better served by the
bread-and-butter approach, analysts agree. "The company may
be losing a little sex appeal by focusing on what it does
well," says John G. Taylor, an analyst with L.H. Alton &amp; Co.
"But they've traded that in for stability and profitability,
and the possibility of sleeping better at night."
   Mattel executives use the Simpsons licensing agreement to
argue that the company can retain some sizzle and yet limit
its risk. But because of Mattel's conservative bent, some
industry experts say, it seems less likely that the next
Cabbage Patch or Teddy Ruxpin will wear the Mattel logo.
   That seems to be a trade-off Mattel is willing to make.
"You really have to be careful with the mega-hits," Mr.
Amerman says. David Leibowitz, an analyst with American
Securities, agrees. "A blockbuster is such a rare phenomenon,
you just can't plan for it," he says.
   Mr. Amerman doesn't rule out acquisitions, and says the
company will consider anything from board games to ride-on
toys and other lines. The company recently bought Corgi Toys
Inc. of Swansea, Wales, a maker of miniature die cast cars,
to bolster its position in Europe and supplement its core Hot
Wheels brand.
   Mr. Amerman thinks his best seller can become
"billion-dollar Barbie" by 1995. And the Disney line may be
extended beyond infant and preschool toys. Eventually, "the
Disney brand may do in the range of what Barbie does," Mr.
Amerman says.
   If not, there's always show business. Mr. Amerman, Mr.
Sansone and Mr. Williams recently brought down the house in
the company cafeteria with a soft-shoe tribute to Mattel
employees for last year's results. The "Toy Boys," decked out
in tuxedoes, glittery top hats and bow ties, sang and danced
up a storm to "There's No Business Like Toy Business" and
other ditties. The finale? A bonus of two weeks' pay to the
unsuspecting employees; that brought a standing ovation.

   THE AX FALLS FASTER than most expected on aerospace
workers.
   U.S.-Soviet detente and congressional budget-cutting
hasten pink slips for white-collar and hourly employees
alike. McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, GE, General Dynamics and
some small firms disclose plans to trim rolls. The Aerospace
Industries Association tracks 16,000 job-cut notices among
its 54 members in 1990, 28% ahead of its forecast. "This may
just be the beginning," warns AIA economist David Napier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The passenger-plane business, once viewed as a cushion,
doesn't help much: Boeing isn't ramping up new programs, so
it's laying off, too, and McDonnell Douglas's commercial unit
flounders. Firms search for new niches to keep employment
stable, but changing course is tough.
   "There will always be some growth areas," such as
electronics, says Karen Berk of the job-matching Aerospace
Human Resources Network.
                                                                                                       

   HANDLING HAZARDS lessen for use of aircraft "composites."
   As plane makers add more of the light, reinforced fibers
in their designs, they alert workers on how to better ply
toxic chemicals that strengthen and coat composites.
   Worker complaints decline with increased industry concern,
better training and new cautionary signs posted in plants,
the Machinists union says. A third of the cost of Lockheed's
new Palmdale, Calif., composites center is for proper
ventilation and other health controls.
   An Occupational Safety and Health Administration crackdown
last year at Boeing and Lockheed helped spur the effort. Now,
manufacturers push suppliers of advanced composites to set
specific exposure limits. "If we don't do it, they're not
going to buy from us," says David Forest, head of BASF
Structural Materials.
                                                                                                       

   PEACETIME "CONVERSION" moves ahead at federal and state
levels.
   House members prepare wording for the defense
authorization bill on the need to help defense workers brace
for the changeover. It would list worker qualifications for
relocation and other allowances when defense cuts hit. More
controversial ideas, such as requiring weapons makers to pay
for retraining and benefits, will be saved for floor debate.
   "We want to make sure at least something gets on the
table," says Rep. Nick Mavroules (D., Mass.), a member of a
bipartisan House-Senate task force on the issue. California
mulls a worker-retraining program; in Minnesota, stung by big
layoffs by Unisys, Honeywell and other defense firms, a new
0.1% payroll tax raises worker aid. Over 40 aerospace firms
met in Dayton, Ohio, last week to share tips on switching to
non-military work.
   One big challenge, says Ohio Gov. Celeste: meeting the
civilian sector's tougher delivery standards.
                                                                                                       

   LOWER YOUR WAGE RATES, the Pentagon tells Lockheed, Boeing
and other companies. They must bring pay in line with other
firms in their areas, or the government says it will find
other sources. The Defense Contract Audit Agency contests
$222 million in "unreasonable" labor charges. Unions grouse
that contractors are exploiting the issue at the bargaining
table.
                                                                                                       

   BLACK PROGRAMS, WHITE FACES: Asians, Hispanics and blacks
make up only 16% of workers in aerospace, with its often
secret, or "black," programs, lagging behind the overall
economy, the General Accounting Office finds. General
Dynamics's space division agrees to offer employment and
$270,000 in back wages to 21 minority engineers whom the
Labor Department says were wrongly denied jobs.
                                                                                                       

   BRAIN DRAIN: Of 30 companies surveyed by the AIA,
two-thirds say they're short of scientists and engineers, and
85% expect such problems in the future. So firms do more to
support education, with 40% of corporate contributions going
for aid, such as scholarships.
                                                                                                       

   OLD AEROSPACE WORKERS don't fade away -- they go back to
work.
   More cost-conscious jet makers take back retirees, for
quick, complex assignments. "We know what they're capable
of," says Vince DeBlaze, human resources director at
McDonnell Douglas's jet-fighter factory in St. Louis, which
employs about 200 of its retirees. While fast-food firms hire
many retirees for low-skill work, "we've shown you can do it
with high-tech," says ACS Management Group Inc.
   Bob Stein, a manager at Fairchild Controls, says a former
Hughes master scheduler he hired briefly for a new program to
build environmental controls for jet-fighter components "was
able to work faster and smarter -- and then press on."
   ACS's Graybeard division, a job shop for former aerospace
technicians, has 2,300 resumes.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Machinists at Lockheed's
soon-to-be-shuttered, 62-year-old factory in Burbank, Calif.,
staged a rally last weekend to keep their jobs. . . . Boeing
says that for each job created outside the U.S. by its
"foreign sourcing," 20 domestic jobs are spawned. . . .
Northrop holds job fairs to recruit workers for its B-2
Stealth bomber project, saying, "You just might wind up
making history."

   Market Ends Higher as Financial Stocks
   Spur Big Gains; Ohio Casualty Up 2 1/2

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks surged to their
highest levels so far this year, with financial stocks
leading the advance.
   Traders say investors turned to the long-dormant financial
sector in hopes that an easing interest-rate environment will
fatten profits there.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Weak non-farm employment growth in May, evident in the
Labor Department's report on Friday, and a subsequent spike
in bond prices has encouraged hopes that interest rates will
decline from current levels.
   "If rates are coming down then the financials are
certainly going to look more attractive," says Claudia Mott,
small-stock analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. She notes
that the stocks have performed miserably so far this year.
   Insurance stocks performed particularly well, sending the
Nasdaq Insurance Index up 7.72, or more than 1.5%, to 514.86.
As of Friday's close, the index was down about 7% for the
year.
   Mary-Alice Dennehy, OTC trader at insurance-stock
specialist Conning &amp; Co., says there may be some
follow-through in insurance stocks today.
   She notes that trading activity in St. Paul Cos., the OTC
market's largest insurance stock by market capitalization,
was strong both Friday and yesterday. The stock gained 3/4 to
59 1/2 on volume of about 594,000 shares, almost three times
its average daily volume.
   Insurance companies earn higher margins with lower
interest rates, and their bond investments surge in value
when rates come down.
   Among the OTC market's other big insurance stocks that
gained were Ohio Casualty, which rose 2 1/2 to 46 1/2, and
Safeco, which gained 1 5/8 to 39 1/4.
   The buying helped push the Nasdaq Financial Index up 6.25,
or 1.6%, to 398.65. The Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes the
OTC market's largest nonfinancial stocks, gained only about
1%.
   But the rotation into financial stocks allowed the OTC
market to extend its string of gains, with the Nasdaq
Composite Index adding 3.48, or 0.75%, to 465.61 -- its
highest level so far this year.
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, meanwhile,
hit a new all-time high, breaking above the 200 level with a
1.1% gain.
   OTC advancers led decliners, 1,082 to 907. National Market
System volume moderated to 107,262,500 shares from Friday's
robust 120,669,600 shares.
   Intel led the most-active list with a 1 point gain to 48
1/2. The company moved the expiration of its 1992 warrants up
to July 25. Each warrant entitles the holder to buy 1.5
shares of Intel for $45.
   Also on the list, Oracle Systems added 5/8 to 20 1/2.
Adobe Systems, however, fell 1 1/2 to 33 1/4.
   HEI added nearly 39%, up 1 5/32 to 4 1/8.
   Columbia Hospital has agreed to buy the company for $4.50
a share.
   Timberline Software has gained 2 to 12 1/2, after surging
16.7% on Friday. The company's executives tell Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report that a newsletter may be
responsible for the sudden interest in the stock. The
newsletter estimates that Timberline will earn 45 to 50 cents
a share in 1990. Timberline's chief financial officer called
the estimates "reasonable."
   Prospect Financial lost 1 to 2, after falling 20% on
Friday. The company announced Friday that it expects to
record a charge in the fourth quarter ended in April, and may
not be in compliance with certain regulatory capital
requirements as of July 1.
   Players International surged 1 5/8 to 8. The company began
test marketing 900-number telephone games based on the hit
television syndicated game shows "Jeopardy" and "Wheel of
Fortune."
   Acclaim Entertainment slid 1 1/8 to 13 1/8. Profit-taking
has hit the stock after it surged to a 52-week high last
week. Acclaim rose to 16 last Thursday, largely on the
prospects for its video game based on the television show
"The Simpsons."

   LOS ANGELES -- Medco Research Inc. said a shareholder
lawsuit filed against the company and its former director of
research and medical affairs was dismissed without prejudice
by the plaintiffs.
   The complaint had alleged that the former executive, Dr.
William C. Govier, had violated securities law when he sold
stock in the company in March, prior to the public
announcement in April that several prospective buyers weren't
interested in the company. Last month, Medco fired Dr.
Govier, but wouldn't say whether his dismissal was related to
the suit.

   The Queen of Kingswood Gets a Fabulous Makeover

   Bloomfield Hills, Mich. -- The hanging of the May Queen
and her attendants has brought much joy to the Cranbrook
Educational Community. It took a cherry picker, two 25-foot
ladders and a crew of strong men to string them up, but the
results were more than satisfying. Crime in the Midwest? No,
for the suspended females are the central figures in a woven
hanging designed by Loja and Eliel Saarinen and made by
Studio Loja Saarinen for the opening of Kingswood, the
secondary girls' school at Cranbrook, in 1932.
   "The Festival of the Queen of the May," a 16-by-18-foot
textile masterwork, has been the focal point of the dining
hall at Kingswood ever since, but the years had not been kind
to it. It desperately needed to be cleaned and to have its
fabric strengthened and repaired. The task was, for the world
of textile restoration, a major event, and by anybody's
standards, it was a huge, intricate, expensive and sometimes
filthy job.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The hanging has recently returned from an eight-month
sojourn in the Rochester, N.Y., conservation studio of Paul
Czubay, where more than a thousand hours were spent in its
cleaning and repair. To see it fresh and clean was a
wonderful thing, and for me, a kind of ratification of the
value of growing up.
   Like most of the girls who ate lunch with the May Queen
during their teen-age years (I was a student at Kingswood in
the 1950s), I knew that Loja Saarinen was one of the foremost
fiber artists of her day and that the hanging was among her
studio's most important works, but until I viewed the newly
cleaned hanging, it was little more than a memory of figures,
pink triangles and especially shoes. We envied the brocaded
figures because they got to wear heels, while school rules
shod us in sensible oxfords. So much for teen-age art
appreciation.
   There certainly was ample opportunity to appreciate art,
architecture and design at Cranbrook, for this complex of
suburban Detroit schools was begun in 1925 by the newspaper
publisher George G. Booth and the expatriate Finnish
architect Eliel Saarinen as a combination of school, atelier
and art colony. Every rug, curtain, chair, lamp and dish in
the Saarinen school buildings was designed at Cranbrook, and
most were made there. From these beginnings there developed
the Cranbrook Academy of Art, whose alumni include Charles
and Ray Eames, Florence Knoll, Jack Lenor Larsen and many
other noted designers, architects, weavers, painters,
sculptors and ceramicists.
   But creation is one thing, and care is another. For almost
half a century Cranbrook had neither the awareness nor the
funding to do much about the conservation needs of its art
objects. The May Queen, meanwhile, absorbed dirt like a
furnace filter (a table from which hot meals were served was
directly below the hanging), faded from exposure to
ultraviolet light, and suffered the indignity of being hit at
the lower border by a tomato. The turning point in awareness
came in the early 1980s, with a major exhibition about
Cranbrook from 1925 to 1950 at the Detroit Institute of Art
and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The turning
point in funding came in 1985 when the Evening News
Association was sold, and Cranbrook's holdings of what had
been a closely held and sleepy stock brought a jump in
endowment of $45 million. Art Academy President Roy Slade,
Curator of Collections Gregory Wittkopp, and Registrar Karen
Serota soon began implementing a comprehensive conservation
plan for all the Cranbrook institutions, funded by endowment
and by alumni contributions.
   All this activity was great news for the May Queen. Her
turn for conservation came in March 1989, when some $17,000
(raised by Kingswood alumnae) was set aside for her
treatment. Seven candidates vied for the project, and the
winner was Mr. Czubay, a professional conservator who
specializes in carpets and in woven objects made of
combinations of natural and early synthetic dyes. In his
usual working garb of white shirt, mod khaki pants, round
glasses and yellow Converse hi-tops, the curly headed fellow
looks about 25, though he's 39. At about 6 1/2 feet, he's
probably the world's tallest textile conservator, though
height is hardly his sole distinction (still, it helps to be
tall when you're working with a piece the size of the May
Queen). A prize-winning weaver who has worked professionally
in textile design, he also has done graduate study in polymer
chemistry, fiber structure and dye technology.
   For the past several years, in cooperation with Mary
Ballard, senior textile conservator at the Smithsonian's
Conservation Analytical Labs, Mr. Czubay has developed new
techniques in the matching and documenting of color, using a
Minolta Chromometer, so the first thing that happened to the
May Queen on arrival in Rochester was a measuring,
photographing, and mapping of the 73 colors in the piece.
After vacuuming (through a screen) to remove the loose dirt,
which took a week, the process of color measurement was
repeated, with dramatically different results.
   Now the real fun began. "The Festival of the Queen of the
May" is made of linen, wool and unknown synthetic fibers
colored with equally unknown synthetic dyes. So Mr. Czubay
had to test extensively for color-fastness and fiber
composition before the Queen could have her sponge bath. It
took 750 gallons of laboratory-grade, deionized water and
1,800 sheets of blotting paper to wash the hanging in an
18-hour marathon session. Mr. Czubay and his assistant, Wini
Steiner, had to keep the entire piece wet for the whole time
so that there wouldn't be watermarks. While they sponged and
blotted, two other assistants brought in detergent solution
and water and piled the blotting paper in the other room. By
bath's end, the pile of discarded blotting paper measured 20
feet by 6 feet and was 4 feet deep. The hanging was allowed
to dry, and then Mr. Czubay took color measurements again,
both to document the differences made by the bath and to
provide a baseline so that it will be a simple matter in the
future to monitor the hanging and see how fast it is fading
or getting dirty.
   Mr. Czubay spent the next six months in surgical gloves,
repairing and relining the tapestry. First he identified all
the deteriorated threads in the linen foundation and rewove
them one by one. Then he had to invent a method for backing
the hanging with cotton muslin. The May Queen is unlike most
tapestries in that it contains many different weights of
textiles, each with its own stretch factor and tensile
strength. To get some idea of the problems Mr. Czubay faced,
imagine bringing uniformity to a roof composed partly of
brick, partly of granite and partly of clay and wattles. He
finally lined up the hanging and the backing flat on the
ground, built a bridge on wheels across the hanging, and
spent three weeks sewing while kneeling with his head lower
than his knees. He and Ms. Steiner would stitch for 15
minutes at a time, using curved surgical needles and 20-foot
pieces of thread that could be adjusted individually as
needed. Then they attached Velcro to the top, hoisted the May
Queen to the ceiling, and let it hang for a week. Two of the
May Queen's attendants drooped, but Mr. Czubay and Ms.
Steiner pulled threads like super-delicate puppeteers and
evened them up. Then, for two months, they removed stitching
from the netted portions and then added stitching to the
brocading, passing a needle back and forth with the hanging
between them.
   During those two months, Mr. Czubay says, he and Ms.
Steiner spent a fair amount of time perched on ladders, and
he envied the physical stamina and discipline that Ms.
Steiner's background as a dancer gave her. She is a Juilliard
graduate who once worked in the corps de ballet at Radio City
Music Hall. An injury meant a new career in embroidery, and
she developed a high level of accomplishment in her new field
while working to create liturgical textiles for synagogues.
Ms. Steiner (like Mr. Czubay) also is known for being
close-mouthed, which is important when valuable pieces such
as the May Queen are in the conservation studio. Nobody knew
that the May Queen had been to Rochester until after the
hanging had returned to Michigan.
   The final problem was hanging the hanging. Because most of
its weight was in the bottom third, the May Queen had been
like a large-hipped woman hanging by her thumbs. Mr. Czubay's
job here amounted to putting a chair under her feet. He
devised a complex system of adjustable twill tapes and Velcro
strips that allowed him to hang the May Queen without putting
further stress on its fibers. Thus equipped, the May Queen
came home to Kingswood to reign in the dining hall, looking
far more glorious than anybody remembered. So many colors and
forms have been revealed by cleaning that you hardly notice
the shoes.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- Nova Corp. of Alberta said it agreed
to sell its valve-making subsidiary, Grove Italia S.p.A., to
an affiliate of one of Italy's biggest banks, for 121 billion
lire (US$96.8 million).
   The planned sale, to an investment group one-third owned
by Sanpaolo Finance S.p.A., a unit of Instituto Bancario San
Paolo di Torino, is expected to generate a net gain to Nova
of about 30 million Canadian dollars (US$25.6 million), or 10
cents a share. Nova had first-quarter net income of C$36
million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of C$1.2 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sale, the second announced by Nova in the past two
weeks, was greeted with enthusiasm by investors. In heavy
Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Nova closed at
C$9.125, up 50 cents on volume of about 6.8 million shares.
   Nova announced late last month a pact to sell its rubber
operations to Bayer AG of West Germany, for C$1.25 billion.
Proceeds from both transactions will be used to reduce Nova's
long-term non-utility debt, which swelled with its C$1.3
billion purchase of Polysar Energy &amp; Chemical Corp. in 1988.
   Nova, which has interests in pipelines, oil and gas, and
petrochemicals, expects long-term debt from its unregulated
businesses to fall to C$450 million to C$500 million once the
transactions are completed, down from C$2.01 billion at March
31. The shrunken debt figure includes the impact of debt and
other liabilities to be assumed by Bayer.
   "Nova would be very well capitalized" once the
transactions are completed, "and in a good position to grow
its polyethylene business" when prices for that commodity
rebound, said John McKimm, an analyst in Toronto with
Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd.
   Grove Italia is one of four non-core units that Nova put
up for sale nearly a year ago. It estimated the value of the
group at C$500 million. A spokesman said Nova is continuing
to pursue the sale of the other units, though he didn't offer
details.

   Morgan's Fogg
   Gets Investment
   Banking Post

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Joseph G. Fogg III, one of Wall Street's
best-known dealmakers, emerged as a major winner in the
latest management shuffle at Morgan Stanley Group Inc., the
big investment bank.
   Mr. Fogg, who saw his power clipped in 1985, although he
remained a powerful figure at Morgan Stanley, yesterday was
named head of the firm's investment banking division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The head of the firm's world-wide corporate finance
department since 1985, Mr. Fogg, 43 years old, now will
oversee the firm's entire investment banking operation,
including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions,
capital markets and real estate.
   The appointment helps fill the gap left when Robert
Greenhill -- former vice chairman and head of investment
banking -- was recently slated by Morgan Stanley management
to be president.
   But Mr. Fogg won't get to devour the entire loaf left by
Mr. Greenhill; as part of the reshuffling, Donald P. Brennan
was named to head a newly created merchant banking division,
which formerly had been folded into investment banking.
   Under Mr. Brennan, the firm's five-year-old merchant
banking operations have grown to be a major driver in the
success of Morgan Stanley. The upshot of the moves: Morgan
Stanley's investment banking division effectively will be
split into two. (Mr. Greenhill's vice chairmanship will be
left vacant.)
   The changes cap a management shift at one of Wall Street's
most successful investment banks. Three weeks ago, S. Parker
Gilbert, chairman for six years, said he would retire at year
end; Morgan Stanley's new chairman will be Richard Fisher,
who as president has played a major role in the firm's
strategic direction in recent years.
   Both Messrs. Fogg and Brennan will report to Messrs.
Gilbert, Fisher and Greenhill.
   By focusing on its international strengths and high-profit
areas such as merchant banking, mergers and acquisitions and
trading for its own account, Morgan Stanley has blossomed
into one of Wall Street's most profitable firms. Despite a
sharp downturn on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley's return on
equity currently stands at 27%, the highest among publicly
traded investment banks.
   Analysts said splitting up Morgan Stanley's
investment-banking division makes sense.
   "In merchant banking, you wind up becoming owner and
partial manager; in the investment banking business, you're
giving advice," says Alison Deans, an analyst for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "That requires different types of
relationships."
   For Mr. Fogg, the promotion is a homecoming of sorts. He
joined the firm nearly 20 years ago as one of the founding
members of Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitions
department. He headed that area for several years before
being shunted aside to head corporate finance, when Eric
Gleacher took over the top mergers post. Several months ago,
Mr. Gleacher left Morgan Stanley to form his own mergers and
acquisition firm.
   In an interview, Mr. Fogg said he was happy to "be able to
play more of a role back in M&amp;A." But he says he never really
left it. "Even while at corporate finance, the business I've
done separate from the administrative work very heavily
focuses on M&amp;A, particularly takeover defenses," he says.
   Mr. Fogg has represented Phillips Petroleum, CBS Inc.,
American Brands Inc., Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. and Avon
Products Inc., among others, in resisting unsolicited hostile
takeover attempts.
   So far this year amid a merger slump, Morgan Stanley ranks
No. 2 behind CS First Boston Group in advising on takeover
deals. Through yesterday, Morgan Stanley advised on 32 deals
totaling $15 billion, for a 13% market share, according to
Securities Data Co. In the year-earlier period, Morgan
Stanley advised on 83 deals, valued at $19.6 billion, for a
9.4% market share.
   Mr. Brennan's assignment reflects the increased importance
of merchant banking within the firm. Launched five years ago,
Morgan Stanley's merchant banking division, which invests
both the firm's and clients' money in deals, currently has
more than $20 billion in assets invested in about 20
companies. Morgan Stanley's investment represents about 15%
of the firm's equity capital.
   Mr. Brennan, 49, said in an interview that merchant
banking, despite its potential pitfalls, will be even a
bigger focus within Morgan Stanley. "We will be increasing by
both the addition of investments to our portfolio as well as
an appreciation of existing" investments, he said.
   Despite his new title, however, Mr. Brennan's
responsibilities largely will remain the same. As head of the
merchant banking operations, he will oversee activities such
as leveraged buy-outs, venture capital, the structuring of
high-yield junk bonds and the investment of equity capital
for the firm's own account.
   Mr. Brennan also will remain chairman and president of
Morgan Stanley's $2.25 billion leverage buy-out fund, which
is currently about 50% invested.

   Small Juries Don't Cut Costs, Study Says

   Efforts to cut trial costs by reducing the size of juries
are largely ineffective, according to a two-year study of
cases tried in Los Angeles.
   In addition, the study found, it's more than twice as
likely that at least one black person will serve on a
12-person jury as on an eight-person jury. About 20% of the
eight-person juries in the study included no blacks, and 31%
had no Hispanics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The National Center for State Courts conducted the study
of 133 civil trials in municipal court in Los Angeles for the
Judicial Council of California. The council will turn the
information over to the state legislature. State law in
California currently allows eight-person juries in civil
trials when both lawyers agree to the reduced size.
   Social scientists, judicial scholars and court
administrators have debated the merits of juries with fewer
than the traditional 12 members since the U.S. Supreme Court
held 20 years ago that the Sixth Amendment was not violated
by use of six-member juries. Six-person juries are now the
rule for federal civil cases, while criminal cases in federal
court still require 12 jurors. Only ten states require
12-person juries in civil actions. The rest allow for juries
ranging from six to 10 persons in civil cases.
   While smaller juries have been touted as a way to save
time and money in the increasingly overburdened court system,
the Los Angeles study found that there weren't significant
savings of either time or money. In addition, reducing the
number of jurors lessened the mathematical likelihood of
having at least one minority juror in a given case.
   Shari Diamond of the American Bar Foundation, an expert on
judicial administration, says the California study is "one
more piece of evidence" that the Supreme Court's decision to
allow six-member juries was "simply wrong."

   SIX-MONTH BAN on civil jury trials upheld by Vermont
Supreme Court.
   The moratorium was imposed by the high court itself in
January to avert a state deficit. The plaintiffs argued that
a jury trial delayed is equal to a jury trial denied. But the
court rejected the argument, reasoning the trials were not
being delayed an "unreasonably" long time.
   "Caseloads cannot be managed on the simplistic position
that everyone is entitled to an immediate trial whenever they
are ready for one. Vermont courts have long exercised the
power to adopt administrative rules having an incidental
effect on the availability of jury trials in some cases,"
writes retired Chief Justice Albert Barney, who was specially
assigned to write the decision.
   The moratorium was imposed after the Vermont legislature
ordered the courts to cut $300,000 from the current year
budget. The ban, scheduled to expire July 1, should save
$75,000, says Lee Suskin, director of trial court
administration.
   John Evers, secretary for the Vermont Trial Lawyers
Association, which filed the class-action lawsuit, says,
"It's a sad day in this state, or any state, when the highest
court -- which plays the role of highest protector of basic
constitutional rights -- becomes the body that takes those
rights away. That's what happened here. It makes us all a
little nervous."
   He says the association doesn't plan to appeal the
decision because it's not contrary to the U.S. Constitution.

   BEATING UP FLAG-BURNERS could earn a slap on the wrist
under proposed law.
   A bill passed by the Louisiana House of Representatives
would impose only a $25 fine for committing battery against
someone who is defacing the American flag. Currently, such an
act would come under much tougher general battery laws, which
carry a jail sentence of as much as six months and a $500
fine.
   Critics say the measure, now pending in the state Senate,
would encourage violence against flag-burners. "This is
government by vigilantes," says state Rep. Robert Adley, who
opposed the bill.
   State Rep. James David Cain, who sponsored the house bill,
says the proposal is an attempt to "send a message" to the
U.S. Supreme Court, which has ruled that flag-burning is a
protected form of free speech. There hasn't been much
flag-burning in Louisiana, the lawmaker acknowledges, but "it
just appalls me that someone could burn the American flag."
   Mr. Cain insists the proposed law "doesn't say you can go
grab somebody and beat him up." He says it would apply only
to "simple" battery, which he defines as using force without
a weapon. Flagburners still are protected by laws imposing
stiffer punishment for "aggravated" battery, and by the
protesters' right to file civil damage suits against anyone
who attacks them, he asserts.
   But others say such a law invites physical attacks.
Christopher Blakesley, a law professor at Louisiana State
University, says the state criminal code's definition of
"simple" battery seems to include taking a punch at someone.
   If the proposed law covers "simple" battery, "there's
certainly the possibility for doing more than just taking the
flag away," he says. "It certainly leaves room for a punch,
and possibly more than one punch."

   COMPANY TURNS TABLES on EPA and wins $199,158 in legal
costs.
   The unusual case involves a civil suit filed in 1984 by
the Environmental Protection Agency against Winchester
Municipal Utilities over alleged violations of the Clean
Water Act by the Kentucky city's newly built waste water
treatment plant. The EPA demanded that the defects be
corrected and sought up to $50 million in damages.
   Winchester, which contended that the defects were due to
the plant's engineers, ultimately agreed to pay a $10,000
civil penalty. But the EPA, in turn, extended the deadline
for building a new plant, relaxed interim effluent standards
and reduced penalties for violating those standards. The
agency also agreed that Winchester's violations were not
willful misconduct or the result of negligence.
   Winchester then sought payment for its attorney fees under
the Equal Access to Justice Act. The federal law permits
defendants sued by the government to recover their costs if
they prevail and if they can show that the government's
position was not "substantially justified."
   In this case, U.S. District Judge Henry R. Wilhoit Jr. in
Lexington, Ky., agreed with Winchester. The judge ruled that
the city prevailed because the final settlement was closer to
its original position than to the government's. Furthermore,
the judge found the EPA's demand for civil penalties was not
"substantially justified" because the plant's engineers, not
the city, were responsible for its defects.
   An EPA spokesman, calling the decision "absurd," says the
agency clearly won the case by exacting both a civil penalty
against Winchester and an agreement to build a new plant. The
agency plans to recommend that the government appeal.

   PLANNED MERGER between New York and Washington law firms
unravels.
   Rosenman &amp; Colin, New York, won't be merging its six-man
Washington office with Casson &amp; Harkins, a 24-lawyer firm
based in Washington. The merger plan was reported here
Thursday.
   Asked why the merger was scrubbed at the last minute,
Casson &amp; Harkins's Joseph Casson says, "As frequently
happens, you don't focus on some things till the very end."
He declines to elaborate. Spokespersons at Rosenman &amp; Colin
couldn't be reached for comment.
   But an individual close to Rosenman &amp; Colin says the
merger collapsed in part because of concerns by partners at
Rosenman that their compensation would be adversely affected
by the alliance. Mr. Casson denies that compensation or any
last-minute questions raised solely by Rosenman were factors
in the decision.
   Mr. Casson says his firm, which specializes in health
care, would continue to seek a merger with a New York-based
firm with expertise in tax and securities law.
   "They're nice guys, we're nice guys," says Mr. Casson.
"Sometimes deals don't happen."

courtroom Thursday and was taken to New York Hospital. She
was released from the hospital Sunday, and doctors said she
was suffering from a stomach ailment.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan, the federal judge
presiding over the case, says he decided to delay the trial
until next Tuesday after speaking to Mrs. Marcos's doctor.
The doctor "said she's okay, but a few days off would do her
good," according to the judge.
   Prosecutors are expected to finish presenting their case
against Mrs. Marcos and her alleged co-conspirator Adnan
Khashoggi shortly after the trial resumes. The defense is
expected to finish in time for the jury to begin
deliberations before the end of the month.

   SEATTLE -- Alaska Airlines, a unit of Alaska Air Group
Inc., said that its May traffic rose 14% to 340.4 million
revenue passenger miles from 299 million flown a year
earlier. A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger
flown one mile.
   The month's passenger load factor, or the percentage of
available seats occupied by fare-paying passengers, rose
slightly to 50.2% from 50.9% in May 1989.

   TOYOTA: MOST PROFITABLE

   Toyota Motor Corp. was the most profitable Japanese
company in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1990, according to
a study by Japan's Wako Economic Research Institute. Toyota
also was No. 1 last year.
   Toyota posted pretax profits of 569.8 billion yen ($3.75
billion), followed by Nomura Securities Co. with 488.8
billion yen and Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. with 484.7
billion yen.
   Among gainers in the ranking of 1,612 companies in terms
of unconsolidated pretax profits, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd. climbed to 20th place from 43rd place the year before
and Toshiba Corp. moved to 15th place from 24th.
   However, electric-power companies dropped below their
prior-year rankings, hurt by a fall in utility rates in April
1989.
   Tokyo Electric Power Co. fell to 16th place from ninth
place the year before while Chubu Electric Power Co. dropped
to 35th place from 22nd place.
                                                                                                       

   PHILIPPINE COMPANY UNDER FIRE
                                                                                                       

   The Philippine solicitor general's office asked a regional
court to cancel the franchise of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co. for allowing foreign investors to hold a major
portion of the company's common voting shares. While foreign
investors hold only 8.7% of the company's total capital
stock, they possess 58.85% of the voting shares; the
Philippine constitution allows foreign investors to control
only 40% of local companies. The company has an exclusive
franchise, expiring in the year 2003, to operate domestic and
international telephone service in the country.
                                                                                                       

   FOOD FOR EASTERN EUROPE
                                                                                                       

   The United Nations World Food Program said Eastern Europe
could receive as much as a fifth of global food aid this
year. James Ingram, executive director of the program, said
cereal deliveries to the region could total up to 2.5 million
tons in 1990. A program spokesman said the figure -- about
20% of global food-aid shipments -- was the first indication
of the magnitude of such help for Eastern Europe. Relief
workers have said they fear the West's scramble to support
East bloc reforms will worsen the plight of thousands facing
famine in the Third World.
                                                                                                       

   JAPANESE SPACE ROBOT
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese government will decide in August whether to
allocate $130 million to develop, build and launch the
nation's first space robot, said Kazuo Sato of the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry's Industrial Science and
Technology Agency. Several Japanese companies, including
Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries
Ltd., are contributing to the project, Mr. Sato said. The
robot would be used to repair machinery and perform other
tasks difficult for humans outside gravity.
                                                                                                       

   BEEF BAN CONTINUES
                                                                                                       

   France and West Germany ignored the European Community
Commission's instruction to lift their ban on imports of
British beef, a commission spokesman said. Paris and Bonn
last week imposed the embargo, claiming the deadly "mad cow"
virus that has been plaguing British cattle for months is a
health risk. The commission says there is no proof the
disease can harm humans.
                                                                                                       

   IN ITALY: HO-HUM
                                                                                                       

   Voter turnout in a national referendum on environmental
issues in Italy was so low the results of the referendum were
declared invalid. According to complete returns, just 43.4%
of voters cast ballots Sunday and yesterday. More than 50% of
the 46.8 million eligible voters had to participate for the
referendum to be valid. Voters were asked whether they wanted
to restrict hunting and the use of pesticides in food
production.
                                                                                                       

   CLEANING UP EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   East Germany wants to become a center for the development
of technology to repair environmental damage that has
occurred during the past 40 years in Eastern Europe, a top
economics official said.
   Martin Dube, vice secretary in East Germany's Ministry of
Economics, said it "makes sense" for East Germany to take on
that role because the country already is a center of high
technology in Eastern Europe. He said East Germany would also
have a comparative advantage in acquiring new technology
after its planned union with West Germany.
   Mr. Dube said East Germany's experience of the effects of
pollution, a result of the former Communist government's
industrialization policies, gives the country an added reason
to develop new methods to clean up the environment.
   The development of such an industry, Mr. Dube said, would
come after the unification process has brought East German
industry up to Western standards.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A wax figure of Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat, complete with his usual stubble beard and a
replica pistol, went on display at Madame Tussaud's museum in
London. The museum said the PLO leader himself provided the
suit and the holster; the three-day stubble is made of yak
hair. . . . Delegates from 167 nations gathered in Barcelona
to check the city's preparations for the 1992 summer Olympic
Games. Despite worries that building programs are behind
schedule, the Barcelona Olympic Organizing Committee has said
it will be able to house all the 40,000-strong "Olympic
family" of athletes and officials.

   A switch to the ABC network from CBS by the top TV station
in Louisville, Ky., and ABC's decision to drop its longtime
affiliate there may leave the two rejected partners with no
choice but to join forces.
   After 40 years of affiliation with New York-based CBS
Inc.'s network, WHAS, the No. 1 station in Louisville, last
week terminated that contract and signed on instead with
rival ABC, a unit of New York-based Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
ABC, in turn, is dropping its longtime affiliate, WLKY, a
unit of St. Louis-based Pulitzer Publishing Co.'s
broadcasting subsidiary.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both CBS and WLKY said the switch was unexpected. "We were
really surprised and hadn't expected this," said Lyn Stoyer,
general manager of WLKY. Although he said his station has had
no formal talks with CBS, the station hopes it can strike an
affiliation agreement with that network. CBS said in a
statement that it, too, was surprised by the switch, and that
its plans for Louisville are under consideration.
   Although stations rarely switch affiliations, the
last-place network is always at risk. Last-place CBS has lost
two affiliates in the past three years; Fairfield,
Conn.-based General Electric Co.'s NBC network lost some
affiliates a few years ago when it was in last place. The
three major broadcast networks each have about 200 affiliates
nationwide. Sydney, Australia-based News Corp.'s Fox
Broadcasting Co. network has about 127 affiliates.
   George Newi, executive vice president of affiliate
relations for ABC, said the company decided to make the
switch because WHAS is the top news station in the market and
has a greater viewership that will allow his network to
"significantly increase our audience." WHAS is owned by the
Providence Journal Broadcasting Corp. In a statement, Neil
Kuvin, president of the station, said the "local competitive
and business environment in Louisville is so challenging and
volatile that we feel it essential to seize every opportunity
available to move forward." Affiliating with ABC "represents
the boldest and potentially most productive enhancement of
our station imaginable," he added.

   Freiman Joins List

   Leaving Shearson

   NEW YORK -- Herbert S. Freiman, a vice chairman of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., is retiring later this year
after 16 years at the securities firm and its predecessors,
company officials said.
   The retirement of Mr. Freiman, who turned 60 years old a
few months ago, is the latest in a line of senior-level
departures from Shearson this year, although it apparently is
unrelated to the firm's recent troubles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Shearson, an American Express Co. unit, in recent months
has announced the resignations or retirements of its chairman
and chief executive officer, Peter Cohen; its president,
Jeffrey Lane; its head of public-brokerage business, Hardwick
Simmons; its chief administrative officer, Robert M. Raziano;
the chairman of Boston Co., a money-management unit, George
Phillips; the head of its Balcor Co. real-estate unit, Steven
Silverstein; and Vice Chairman Joel Margolies, a former head
of the domestic-branch network.
   Mr. Freiman, Shearson's trading and sales chief in the
early 1980s, had until late last year been head of Shearson's
capital markets division, before a management shuffle
announced by then-chairman Mr. Cohen, which gave the job to
Richard S. Fuld Jr. Since the shuffle, Mr. Freiman has been
chairman of Shearson's capital-commitment committees.
   Mr. Freiman this year had also taken on responsibility for
the money-management businesses, but that chore has since
been assumed by Jonathan S. Linen. Mr. Linen is a former
American Express official who joined Shearson this week to
head the firm's brokerage and money-management businesses, as
part of a planned reorganization of Shearson into separate
brokerage and investment banking halves.
   Howard L. Clark Jr., Shearson chairman since January, told
employees in an internal note that Mr. Freiman will remain a
Shearson adviser. Mr. Clark added that Mr. Freiman had
provided him with "invaluable assistance," and that his
"insights into an industry undergoing tremendous change have
helped to shape much of my own thinking about the Wall Street
of the 1990s."
   Mr. Freiman, who generally kept a low profile during his
years at Shearson, declined to comment on his retirement
plans.

   Accounting Body
   Effectively Clears
   Certain New Fees

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC)
</GV>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The major professional body for U.S.
accountants took a position that effectively allows its
members to accept contingent fees and commissions from
non-audit clients.
   The governing council of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, although it hasn't changed the
institute's rules of conduct, voted to enforce the proposed
changes to the ethics rules agreed to by the institute in
August 1988 in a consent order with the Federal Trade
Commission.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since agreeing to the FTC consent order, the institute has
deferred enforcing its rules on contingent fees and
commissions pending final approval of the consent order by
the commissioners of the FTC. The agency gave preliminary
approval to the order in March 1989, but has yet to give
final approval. The institute has said it would automatically
change its rules, which prohibit all commissions and most
contingent fees, once the commission gives final approval of
the proposed consent decree.
   "There's a lot of confusion among the members" about the
issue, said Donald J. Schneeman, general counsel for the
AICPA. "We felt there were members who don't have an
{auditing} relationship; and we wanted to remove that cloud"
of uncertainty; the change would allow them to accept
commissions and contingency fees from non-audit clients
without fear of an enforcement action by the institute, Mr.
Schneeman said.
   By the same token, the institute "wanted to send a clear
message" to those accountants who have an auditing
relationship with clients that the AICPA would enforce that
part of its ban on accepting such fees. Violation of the
institute's ethics rules can result in a member's suspension
from the institute.
   The profession's rules, for example, had prevented an
accountant from taking a commission for advising a client to
buy specific computer hardware, or taking an audit or
consulting job if the final fee is based on the benefit
derived by the client.
   A spokeswoman for the FTC said she couldn't comment on
when the commissioners might approve a final order or whether
they have considered it.
   It isn't clear how many accountants will be affected by
the changes. Although the AICPA has a membership of more than
296,000 CPAs in public practice, the institute noted that its
rules don't override state law or the rules of state CPA
societies. Five states, including Texas and Maryland, have
revoked prohibitions against commissions, the institute said.
Five other states, including California and Florida, have
prohibited accountants from accepting the commissions. "State
law would be paramount" wherever there is a discrepancy, Mr.
Schneeman said.
   The dispute over the contingent fees has been
controversial. The institute had long resisted efforts by the
FTC to eliminate the group's ban on the fees. The AICPA had
argued that the ban against contingent fees helped
accountants remain independent and objective.

   Noyce Death Casts Shadow Over Group
   Designed to Boost Semiconductor Firms

<LP>
   The death of Robert N. Noyce casts a shadow over Sematech,
the semiconductor group that Mr. Noyce, an advocate for U.S.
intervention in the semiconductor war with Japan, took over
two years ago.
   Mr. Noyce, co-founder of both Fairchild Semiconductor and
Intel Corp. and co-inventor of the integrated circuit, had
campaigned for "a new culture" in response to Japanese
semiconductor competition. For Mr. Noyce, that meant
increased cooperation among U.S. companies and greater
involvement by government, a position at odds with the Bush
administration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Industry observers said Mr. Noyce's death weakens such
lobbying efforts, which had found few supporters outside the
industry. "He carried an image that will be hard to replace,
no question about that," said Richard Skinner, president of
Integrated Circuit Engineering Corp., a consulting firm in
Arizona. "But as for impact, there won't be any -- nobody was
listening to him."
   Mr. Noyce conducted his campaign as chairman of Sematech,
an Austin, Texas, group of 14 technology companies including
International Business Machines Corp., American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Corp., Texas Instruments Inc. and Motorola Inc. The
research group, whose goal is to bring U.S. semiconductor
manufacturing methods into parity with the Japanese by 1992,
receives half of its $200 million annual budget from the
federal government.
   But the unprecedented private-public partnership provoked
criticism from companies that claimed Sematech was competing
unfairly against nonmembers, as well as from conservative
politicians. At times, it appeared that Sematech's strongest
claim to legitimacy was Mr. Noyce himself.
   More recently, Sematech officials say, Mr. Noyce, who took
the top job when the search committee he was heading couldn't
find a suitable chief executive, believed that the group had
weathered political challenges and could survive without him.
The research facility had been built, the plant had produced
its first wafers, and the Bush administration had reversed
its early opposition to continued funding of the effort.
Indeed, say Sematech officials, Mr. Bush has hailed the
effort as a leading example of U.S. competitiveness.
   At the April board meeting, Mr. Noyce requested that a
search committee be formed to find a new chief executive and
indicated that he would like to retire in the fall. A few
weeks later, he had a complete physical and received a clean
bill of health. He died Sunday of a heart attack at age 62.
   Charles Sporck, chairman of the Sematech board and
president and chief executive of National Semiconductor Inc.,
declined requests for interviews but issued a statement
acknowledging that a new chief executive must be found
"expeditiously." Company officials, meanwhile, say the office
of chief executive, which also included Turner Hasty, chief
operating officer, and Peter H. Mills, chief administrative
officer, continues to run the group.
   "Bob Noyce was a master team builder and a master
consensus builder," said Mr. Mills, contending that Sematech
can function indefinitely until a new chief executive is
named.

   Franklin Savings Bank said it applied to the Michigan

from its current status as a federally chartered savings
bank.
   The conversion is subject to shareholder and regulatory
approvals.

   Franklin, based in Southfield, Mich., was the first
savings institution to apply for a national commercial bank
charter after enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. However, Franklin
officials said they are now seeking the state charter because
of delays in promulgating the regulations and uncertainties
over the interpretation of such conversions under the federal
act.

   NEW YORK -- Few people doubt that the Clean Air Act will
pass: It's just a matter of time, and of ironing out the
final provisions. For investors who hope to profit, the rub
is that environmental stocks already have been strong for
months.
   Nevertheless, some money managers and analysts believe
they have identified stocks that will benefit heavily from
the new law, and that haven't already been bid up to the
moon.

   Team Inc. looks good to R. Jerry Falkner, director of
research at Southeast Research Partners in Boca Raton, Fla.,
a unit of Dominick &amp; Dominick. Listed on the American Stock
Exchange, the Alvin, Texas, company specializes in valve
maintenance and repair and monitoring of industrial plant
emissions. Those two specialties accounted for about 60% of
Team's fiscal 1990 revenue of $82 million and will be in keen
demand under the new law, Mr. Falkner says.
   Despite these hot specialties, Team stock sells for 12
times the past year's per-share earnings, a bit below average
in today's market. Mr. Falkner cites the company's erratic
earnings history: It had some big losses back in the days
when it was mainly an oil-region company transporting
drilling muds.
   Mr. Falkner thinks Team will earn at least $1.50 a share
in the fiscal year that started last week and runs through
next May. He figures that the market will reward Team with an
average price/earnings ratio (about 15) and that the stock is
on its way to 23 or 24. Yesterday it closed at 16 1/4.
   Dresser Industries caught the eye of James H. Morgan,
president of Morgan Investments in Greenville, S.C., which
holds some of the shares. Best known as an oil-service
company, Dresser also has a big engineering and construction
arm. "Along with Fluor, it will be a big participant in
reconfiguring refineries to meet the new standards," Mr.
Morgan says.
   Dresser, at 52 1/8 yesterday, already sells for more than
20 times trailing per-share earnings. But Mr. Morgan also has
a backdoor play that's cheaper. He recommends Norfolk
Southern, a railroad whose route structure, he says, puts it
in a position to carry heaps of the low-sulfur coal that
utilities increasingly will need. Norfolk Southern is at 41
5/8, less than 12 times the past 12 months' earnings.
   "I've always looked at {the Clean Air Act} as a natural
gas bill," says Craig Drill, who runs Craig Drill Capital in
New York. "The thing that wins on every count is natural gas.
President Bush has wanted to help the energy industry. And
since {the oil spill at} Valdez, it's been just impossible."
   The beneficiaries, Mr. Drill says, will be "the people who
have large reserves in natural gas {such as} Unocal, and the
people who are good at drilling for natural gas, such as
Parker Drilling." Unocal sells for about 22 times the past 12
months' earnings. Parker has been posting losses, though the
losses have been narrowing.
   Ron Barone, analyst at Kidder Peabody, prefers Tenneco
because its gas pipeline "serves the energy-hungry Northeast"
and the Midwest, where high-sulfur coal has traditionally
been used. He expects brownouts in the Northeast, perhaps as
soon as this summer. Besides producing less pollution than
other sorts of power plants, natural-gas fired plants can be
built quickly, he says. He considers Tenneco attractively
priced at 15 times recent earnings, or 69 yesterday, and
thinks the company may soon sweeten its 4.3% dividend yield.
   Richard Sweetnam, analyst at Kidder Peabody, says the
"biggest beneficiary" of the new law will be Air &amp; Water
Technologies. Based in Branchburg, N.J., and listed on the
American exchange, the company makes air-pollution control
equipment, scrubbers and monitoring equipment.
   When it comes to cleaning the air, says Mr. Sweetnam, Air
&amp; Water Technologies is "standing right in the middle of the
tracks." Competitors such as General Electric, Asea Brown
Boveri and Air Products &amp; Chemicals are big, diversified
companies, not pure plays, he says. Unfortunately, Air &amp;
Water Technologies stock sells for about 38 times the
earnings Mr. Sweetnam expects for this fiscal year (ending in
October) and 20 times the earnings he expects for 1991. Not
much of a bargain there.
   More down-to-earth are producers of low-sulfur coal.
Jordan Estra of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. recommends both Nerco and
Ashland Coal, which sell for 13 and 15 times recent earnings,
respectively. Coal producers overexpanded in the energy boom
a decade ago, Mr. Estra says, and they have been hurting ever
since.
   But a lot of excess capacity has been shut down. After
five years of falling prices (to a recent level of about $28
a ton), he expects a rebound to perhaps $30 or $31 a ton over
the next two years. Combine that with continued cost-cutting
and increased production, and patient investors could see a
nice profit increase, Mr. Estra says.

   American Express Drops Corporate-Card Car Insurance

<LP>
   American Express Co. has quietly yanked a once highly
vaunted perk of its corporate credit card: free car-rental
insurance.
   With no formal announcement, American Express in April
stopped offering excess car-rental insurance to corporate
card holders who work at major companies. The move came only
a year and a half after American Express first offered the
benefit and, according to corporate traveler managers, pushed
it heavily.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They throw in this perk and then suddenly take it away,"
says Rudolph Monteleone, president of the Association of
Corporate Travel Executives. "It's really upsetting."
   What's more, while the change probably won't affect most
companies' liability, it could mean that business travelers
at big companies who use the corporate card for personal use
will now be responsible for car-rental damage -- unless they
buy insurance from car-rental agencies or their own insurance
policies cover such damage.
   "There's no doubt this is going to hurt some people who
aren't careful," says Harold Seligman, president of
Management Alternatives Inc., a travel consultant in
Stamford, Conn. "People who think they're covered and turn
out to be wrong could be in for a huge surprise."
   For its part, American Express insists that the insurance
was dropped because most corporations already have similar
coverage, either with their insurance companies or through
contracts with car-rental agencies. It also points out that
the benefit still applies to corporate users at companies
with fewer than 10 card holders and to all individual holders
of American Express green, gold and platinum cards. "The
insurance wasn't turning out to be important for the large
companies," says a spokeswoman for American Express.
   But at least some competitors, including MasterCard, Visa
and Diners Club, say they will continue to offer the coverage
on their corporate cards. "We still find it's something
companies really like to have," says a spokesman for
MasterCard International.
   At least for individuals, free car-rental insurance may be
among the most coveted credit-card perk. Car-rental companies
charge as much as $12 a day for the so-called
collision-damage waiver, which is essentially an agreement
that the renter won't be held responsible for any damage. By
using a credit card, most travelers find they no longer need
to buy the waiver.
   When it first introduced the perk on its corporate card in
December 1988, American Express said it issued a news release
and ran several ads touting it. It has since heavily promoted
the benefit for members holding its green and gold cards, as
competition among credit-card companies has mounted.
   But corporate card holders got word of the latest change
through a recent billing insert -- and only in the fourth
paragraph. Even American Express officials concede that not
all card holders are aware of the change. "You could easily
have people out there operating on the wrong assumption that
the coverage still applies," says Dolly Bee, a committee
chairwoman for the National Business Travelers Association.
   And that could create a huge nightmare for some renters.
According to Ms. Bee, some companies allow employees to use
the corporate card for leisure trips -- or for trips that
combine business and leisure. But since companies don't pay
for damages that occur during vacations, employees must rely
on personal insurance for those trips. And only 40% of
personal automobile insurance covers car-rental damage.
   While American Express officials concede that such a
scenario is possible, they defend their notification process.
"There's nothing that's foolproof," says Steve McCurdy, vice
president, marketing, for a unit of American Express.
   Some travel-industry officials have speculated that
American Express dropped the insurance because it was too
costly. The company denies that the corporate-card program
has been too expensive, but concedes that it received far
more claims for car-rental damage from green-card holders
than anticipated. And in the process, many claims went unpaid
for months.
   The delays, which American Express says it has been
working on, haven't affected most card holders -- they simply
refuse to pay for any car-rental damage until American
Express handles their claims. But the delays have caused a
furor in the car-rental industry, because car-rental
companies are stuck waiting to get paid.
   One licensee for American International Rent A Car in
Florida says he stopped accepting American Express cards
because the credit-card company hasn't processed more than
$150,000 in claims. "It's just been a nightmare," says Ralph
Mizrani, chief executive officer of the licensee company.

   Sturm Ruger Files
   Anew With SEC
   For Stock Offer

   SOUTHPORT, Conn. -- Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., which withdrew a
planned secondary offering of shares in March because its
stock price was too low, registered a similar offering with
its shares down a bit more.
   The manufacturer of firearms filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to make a secondary offering of 1,830,000
shares. Sturm Ruger has more than 6.7 million shares
outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Selling the shares are Chairman William B. Ruger Sr., one
million shares; Joanna Sturm, daughter of founder Alexander
Sturm, 750,000 shares; J. Thompson Ruger, who is Mr. Ruger's
son, 40,000 shares; and Claudia Ruger, wife of the younger
Mr. Ruger, 40,000 shares.
   After the offering, the holding of the senior Mr. Ruger
will drop to 39% from 54% and that of Ms. Sturm to 4.6% from
nearly 16%. J. Thompson Ruger and his wife would hold about
0.8% each, compared with 1.4% each currently. William B.
Ruger Jr., who isn't selling shares in the offering, holds
nearly 3%.
   The company granted the underwriters, led by Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co., an option on a total 274,500 shares to cover
over-allotments. Those shares would be sold by the senior Mr.
Ruger and Ms. Sturm.
   In January, with its shares trading at around $28, Sturm
Ruger registered a secondary offering of 1,850,000 shares,
including one million shares offered by the senior Mr. Ruger.
The offering was to be underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   In mid-February, the company reported that earnings for
1989 jumped 43% to $18.1 million, or $2.70 a share, as sales
grew 19% to $133.7 million. But on March 8, with the shares
at around $24.50, the company announced it had withdrawn the
offering. A spokesman said then that the share price was too
low and market conditions made such an offering inadvisable.
   Yesterday, Sturm Ruger shares fell 50 cents to $23.50 in
national over-the-counter trading. In 1990, the company's
shares have traded as high as $29 and as low as $23.
   Christian F. Baiz, a Kidder vice president of corporate
finance who is handling the underwriting, said Sturm Ruger
"simply wanted to bring the offering back fresh," having
recently named a new president, Gary W. French, and boosted
the quarterly dividend 20%, to 30 cents a share from 25
cents.
   Separately, the company said its stock has been approved
for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
RGR. The exchange couldn't estimate when it would list the
shares.
   For the first quarter, Sturm Ruger reported that net
income dipped 4.3% to $6.2 million, or 92 cents a share, as
sales grew 11% to $42.7 million.

   AT&amp;T Unit Unveils
   Two Dozen Products
   At Computer Show

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s computer unit
unveiled two dozen products, including powerful Unix
software-based servers, personal computers and upgrades to
its existing products.
   Chief among the new products are so-called server systems,
which coordinate the flow of data and storage of information
on a network of personal computers. One, called the
StarServer E, uses the i486 microprocessor made by Intel
Corp. The other server is a fault-tolerant machine designed
by Cupertino, Calif.-based Tandem Computers Inc. and New
York-based AT&amp;T and is built by Tandem.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The StarServer E, which AT&amp;T will begin shipping next
month, is designed to use between one and four computer
processors. System performance starts at 25 million
instructions per second with one processor and increases by
25% each time a new processor is added for a total 106 MIPS,
according to AT&amp;T. The system's i486 chip runs one-third
faster than other i486 chips now in use.
   "No other machine in the market has that kind of
performance," said Richard A. McGuinn, president of AT&amp;T
Computer Systems. "It's hot." However, competitors such as
Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, and netFRAME Systems Inc.,
Milpitas, Calif., offer competing servers using Intel's 486.
But neither use the Unix software operating system designed
by AT&amp;T.
   "The Unix market is a little overcrowded right now," said
Enzo Torresi, netFRAME's president. "We're taking a different
approach, using Netware software, but by first quarter of
1991 we'll introduce a Unix-based system." Netware is a
competing software made by Novell Inc., Provo, Utah.
   The fault-tolerant machine, which AT&amp;T said is available
for shipments now, is designed for telecommunications and
other applications such as financial transaction services
that cannot afford a computer system failure. The Tandem
machine will diagnose itself when it has a problem,
automatically call a service center and the center will send
out a replacement part, which Mr. McGuinn said can be snapped
into place by "even a clerk."
   AT&amp;T made its product announcement at the COMDEX/Spring
'90 computer show in Atlanta. It said it would build the
StarServer E at its Little Rock, Ark., plant, which recently
began volume production of the personal computer that AT&amp;T
designed with Intel.
   AT&amp;T also unveiled new versions of its 6386 personal
computer and upgrades for its 3B2 line of minicomputers. One
6386 model can be upgraded to an i486-based system without
having to buy a new PC. Another unit, called the 6386SX, can
be bought without a disk and is used in large networks
controlled by server systems. The 3B2 upgrades include
enhanced Unix software and improved data-networking
functions.
   Rikki Kirzner, senior industry analyst at market
researcher Dataquest Inc., said AT&amp;T's new products "by
themselves are OK. They're nice middle-of-the-road
competitive products." What's impressive, she said, is how
they fit well with AT&amp;T's strategy to be a systems
integrator.
   "AT&amp;T wants to be the womb-to-tomb supplier in computer
systems just like they are in phone systems," she said. If
you look at the company's products and partnerships over the
last year, you're starting to see a very strong set of
{products} emerging."

   CHICAGO -- Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s plan to convert its
thinly traded common stock into separate voting and nonvoting
classes is under fire from a major shareholder, Industrial
Equity (Pacific) Ltd.
   The plan, announced last month by the publishing and
entertainment concern, would allow it to issue more shares
while preserving founder Hugh Hefner's control of the
company. The 64-year-old former chairman and chief executive,
who owns a 71% stake, could retain voting control of Playboy
while disposing of up to three-quarters of his holdings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Industrial Equity, an investment firm based in Hong
Kong, whose 7.6% stake makes it Playboy's second largest
holder, objects. In a May 31 letter to Playboy, IEP
Consultants (USA) Inc., an affiliate of Industrial Equity,
said the stock conversion proposal is unfair to holders who
have purchased their shares on a one-share, one-vote
structure.
   The letter, which was attached to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing, specifically objected to the idea
of Mr. Hefner retaining voting control if he sells his
majority interest.
   "The proposed plan gives all stockholders the same
proportionate voting rights and the same flexibility to
determine their continuing ownership of voting and nonvoting
stock," a Playboy spokesman said. "The plan contains an
unusual minority protection provision that is designed to
help ensure price parity between the two classes of stock,
and we plan to go forward with the plan as described in the
company's consent solicitation statement."
   Industrial Equity officials didn't return calls seeking
further comment.
   Dual-class arrangements aren't rare in the publishing
business: founding families of New York Times Co., Dow Jones
&amp; Co. and Washington Post Co., for example, all maintain
voting control through special classes of stock.
   Playboy's plan calls for it to carry out a 1-for-2 reverse
split of its current shares, reducing the number of common
shares outstanding to 4.7 million from 9.4 million. Those
shares will then be reclassified as Class A stock, each
having one vote. The Class A shares will then each pay a
dividend of three shares of nonvoting Class B Playboy shares,
which the company will seek to have traded on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Playboy has said the plan will provide management with
additional financial flexibility by permitting it to use
equity for possible future acquisitions, financings and
employee benefit plans -- without diluting Mr. Hefner's
control.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Playboy closed at $12.75, up 12.5 cents.

   Courts Rule Both Ways
   On `Pictures of Pain'

   USE of medical thermography is stirring a heated debate in
the courts.
   Controversy is intensifying over whether the technique
effectively diagnoses soft-tissue injuries and should be
admissible in court as proof of injury. Insurance companies,
particularly State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., and
Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., are
fighting the technique on two fronts: to bar its use as
evidence in personal-injury suits and to avoid paying policy
claims for the tests.
   The technique measures skin temperature using infrared
photography. Advocates say thermography takes "pictures of
pain," pinpointing muscle and ligament damage, as well as
nerve irritation that doesn't show up on other tests. "It is
one of the finest pieces of demonstrative evidence in court,"
says Harry Rein, a Florida physician and lawyer.
   Critics claim thermograms aren't reliable because they
often show signs of injury where none exists or fail to
detect an injury.
   Courts have ruled both ways on the issue. A Colorado
appeals court last summer upheld its use as evidence of
injury in a suit, saying the defense didn't effectively
challenge it, and a New Jersey judge has ordered insurers to
reimburse patients for physician-ordered thermography.
   But in March, a Maryland judge called the technique
"invalid" and said State Farm didn't have to pay for it under
the personal injury protection clauses of auto policies.
   Insurers, according to Dr. Thomas H. Ravin, a Denver
orthopedist who uses thermography, "have a great fear there
is something that can show people are hurt" who aren't
"smashed to smithereens."
                                                                                                       

   Sick of Legal Bills?
   Then Do It Yourself

   PEOPLE ATTEMPTING to handle legal affairs on their own are
finding a lot more tools at their disposal.
   Publishers and software makers are catering to the legal
do-it-yourselfer with books and computer programs that
explain how to manage simple legal matters such as an
uncontested divorce or preparing a will.
   "A lot of packages and kits are on the market that weren't
there five years ago," says George Milko of HALT, a legal
reform group. A key reason for the interest is the high cost
of lawyers. "Sometimes there's no choice," says Mr. Milko.
"For instance, a woman petitioning for increased child
support may not be able to afford a lawyer."
   "Our growth has been phenomenal," says a spokeswoman for
Nolo Press, a legal self-help publisher based in Berkeley,

   Doing Business Abroad
   With Fewer Restraints
                                                                                                       

   COMPANIES in the U.S. are breathing easier about their
dealings abroad as a result of 1988 changes in the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act.
   Amendments to the law, which covers business bribes,
sought to make the standards for U.S. companies doing
international business more workable and to rid the law of
ambiguities.
   "Corporate executives and corporations certainly feel more
comfortable about the law now," says Robert Craft, an
attorney with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in Washington. The Justice
Department has yet to issue new compliance guidelines, but
lawyers say they're getting far fewer inquiries from clients
worried about inadvertently breaking rules.
   Now, companies break the law only if they knowingly make
an illegal payment. Previously, companies broke the law if
they "had reason to know" a payment was illegal. "Grease
payments," formerly allowed only to low-level foreign
functionaries, are now permitted to facilitate a routine
matter, such as getting a visa or a permit, but not to get or
keep business. And it's proper to make payments allowed under
the written laws of a foreign country.
   But the changes have far from eliminated the competitive
disadvantage that U.S. companies sometimes face abroad. After
a European concern with Middle Eastern and Far Eastern units
was taken over by a U.S. company, its foreign managers were
stunned to learn that many of their common business practices
were taboo, says Marc K. Ritzmann, an attorney with
Kilpatrick &amp; Cody in Atlanta. "U.S. companies still often
find they can't engage in activities their local competitors
do every day," he says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   THE FLORIDA BAR says neglect by lawyers is the most common
gripe of unhappy clients. It said 23% of 7,175 complaints it
received in fiscal 1989 came from people who felt their
attorneys neglected them. An additional 10% were distressed
about fees, and 9% said attorneys showed improper personal
behavior. . . . Pennsylvania's Legislature is considering a
law to exempt manufacturers regulated by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration from punitive damages in
product-liability cases unless they fraudulently concealed
information from the FDA.

   Faber Agrees
   To Buy Corroon
   Via Stock Swap

   Value Put at $712.3 Million;
   Major Realignment Seen
   Of Insurance Brokerages

   Willis Faber PLC, Britain's second-largest insurance
broker, agreed in principle to acquire New York-based Corroon
&amp; Black Corp. in a stock swap valued at #424 million, or
about $712.3 million. The marriage would create the world's
fourth-largest insurance brokerage.
   The agreement could trigger a major realignment of
insurance brokerages in the United Kingdom and the U.S. and
stimulate more consolidation in the industry. An insurance
broker specializes in assisting primarily corporate clients
in seeking and arranging coverage with an insurance company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the engagement announcement itself was received coldly
by the London and New York stock markets. Faber's stock slid
9% in London on uncertainty over whether the deal would be
good for the British concern. The drop triggered a 7% decline
in Corroon shares in New York, quickly removing a small
premium for Corroon holders and sending the per-share
offering price below what Corroon shares closed at on Friday.
   The transaction, which is subject to approval by holders
of each company, is targeted for the end of September. Faber
said it would issue 7.8 of new ordinary shares for each of
20.5 million Corroon common, for a total of about 160 million
new shares. The package would be worth #20.67 (about $34.72),
based on Faber's closing price of 265 pence yesterday. The
package was worth #22.69 ($38.13) when it was announced at
the market's opening; Faber shares were trading then at 291
pence.
   Some industry observers believe the transaction could
prompt formation of a new set of alliances between major U.S.
and British brokers.
   "Everybody has to be reassessing their alliances right
now," said Russell Miller, who heads a San Franciso-based
investment-banking firm specializing in the insurance
industry. He also believes this acquisition could increase
consolidation among insurance brokerage firms that now feel
they must be larger to compete. "You now have a new
billion-dollar player on the scene," he said.
   A Faber-Corroon merger would undo Faber's century-old,
profitable relationship with Johnson &amp; Higgins, another major
U.S. broker. Moreover, the market uncertainty reflects
concern about whether Faber would be getting more from
Corroon than it would be giving up. Johnson &amp; Higgins, which
owns 5% of Willis Faber, contributed about 10% of Faber's
earnings last year, Roger Elliott, Faber's chairman, said.
   "It's quite a risky deal," said Julianne Jessup, insurance
brokerage analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd.
in London. Ms. Jessup also said there is market concern over
the share dilution that would result from the issuance of 160
million new Faber shares. "It's such a massive issue," she
said.
   Mr. Elliott acknowledged that Faber's ties with Johnson &amp;
Higgins would loosen. But he added: "We've been dealing with
Johnson &amp; Higgins for 100 years. People think everything will
be canceled overnight. That's rubbish. It will take three to
five years to cool down, and we still will be doing some
business with them."
   Robert Hatcher, chairman and chief executive officer of
Johnson &amp; Higgins, said the different strategies adopted by
J&amp;H and Willis Faber in recent years "caused some friction"
between the two companies. J&amp;H bought a London broker in
1988, which put the U.S. company, currently the
fourth-largest in the world, directly in the London market
and made it a licensed Lloyds of London broker.
   While Mr. Hatcher agreed that J&amp;H's working relationship
with Willis Faber won't wind down immediately, he said he
believes there will now be a conflict of interest because
Willis Faber will be the owner of one of J&amp;H's major U.S.
competitors.
   For the time being, J&amp;H plans to beef up existing London
operations by acquisitions of other small brokers and by
increasing staff there. Mr. Hatcher said J&amp;H doesn't know
what it will do with its 5% stake in Willis Faber. The
British broker hasn't offered to buy back its shares, he
said.
   Richard Miller, Corroon's chairman and chief executive
officer, noted that there might be some compensation for
Corroon shareholders because they will receive a 70% dividend
increase when the combined company begins a quarterly payout
early next year.
   The two companies would be merged into a new entity,
Willis Corroon PLC. Faber holders would own 60% of Willis
Corroon, and Corroon holders the rest. Mr. Miller would be
chief executive of the new company and Faber's Mr. Elliott
would be chairman. Both men are 57 years old.
   In an interview, Mr. Elliott said there isn't any thought
of renegotiating the deal in light of the stock price drops.
"A deal is a deal, and the deal's been done," he said,
adding: "It's been approved by the boards of both companies."
   Mr. Miller also said the two companies "signed a firm
contract" late Friday evening. "There will be no changes in
price."
   Both Corroon and Faber officials said the combination of
the companies ideally meets their individual strategies.
There's no overlap between the two companies and the
combination of the two operations won't require any physical
mergers, officials said. Prior to the transaction, Willis was
the fifth largest broker world-wide and Corroon was No. 6.
   Faber proposed a 10% increase in its dividend, to 13.2
pence a share, conditional on the Corroon deal going through.
Only Faber holders would get the first part of the payout --
9.9 pence a share payable in November. Holders of the
combined company would get a 3.3-pence-a-share dividend next
January.
   Faber said that Willis Corroon would apply to the Big
Board to have its shares traded as American depositary
receipts. An application for listing on London's stock
exchange also would be sought.
   In 1989, Faber earned #62.3 million pretax, up 15% from
#54.4 million in 1988. Corroon's net income fell 14% to $36
million last year. Corroon's earnings have declined during
the past two years because of the downturn in
property/casualty premium rates.

   WILLIS FABER PLC of Britain will merge with New York-based
Corroon &amp; Black Corp. in a stock swap valued at $712.3
million. Tuesday's edition described the transaction as an
acquisition of Corroon by Willis Faber.

   Creditors to Keep
   Him at Firm's Helm

   NEW YORK -- Interco Inc.'s chief executive officer,
Richard Loynd, told creditors they have the right to oust
him. But Mr. Loynd asked to stay on, saying he could fix the
ailing conglomerate's problems.
   Mr. Loynd spoke at a 2 1/2-hour, closed-door meeting with
bondholders. Interco, which is seeking to restructure its
$1.6 billion in debt, has said it may seek protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Interco has posted
heavy losses for more than a year. The company is known for
its Florsheim and Converse shoe brands, as well as its Lane
and Broyhill furniture divisions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday's meeting was closed to the press, but several
participants in both the bondholder and management camps
provided detailed accounts.
   "You guys own the company," Mr. Loynd reportedly told
bondholders. "We're working for you." As part of its
restructuring plan, Interco is offering bondholders a massive
debt-for-equity swap that would leave them with about 70%
ownership in the company.
   Mr. Loynd told bondholders "if you want to fire me, you
can," recalled Andrew Herenstein, a credit analyst for
Delaware Bay Co. "But he went on to say that he had operating
experience and was the right guy for the situation."
   Mr. Loynd took over as chief executive last spring. His
predecessor, Harvey Saligman, had overseen a recapitalization
of Interco in late 1988 that fought off a hostile raider but
left the company heavily in debt. Before taking the top job
at Interco, Mr. Loynd had been chief executive of Interco's
Converse division.
   Several bondholders yesterday urged Interco to consider
selling Converse, which has been the most erratic financial
performer of the major operating units. Mr. Loynd reiterated
Interco's desire to keep all four units. He also said
potential buyers haven't offered an attractive price for
Converse. But Mr. Loynd didn't rule out a Converse sale if
the right price were offered.
   Mr. Loynd also said Interco had looked at selling the
entire company, but couldn't find a buyer interested in all
four units. Liquidating the company piecemeal would create
more tax liabilities than would be desirable, he added.
   After the meeting, Interco's bondholders took steps to
form a formal creditors' committee, to be represented by
Rothschild Inc. Leading bondholders include Dickstein &amp; Co.,
Prudential Insurance Co., Gateway Investment Advisers Inc.,
Allen &amp; Co., Cypress Capital and CNA Insurance Co.
   Interco has said it will default on a June 15 interest
payment due on its 13 3/4% senior subordinated bonds. The
company is urging bondholders to accept a package of new
securities that offers mostly equity and little in the way of
cash-paying securities.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices jumped to record levels on brisk
volume, with investors snapping up issues that are sensitive
to the monthlong drop in interest rates.
   Bond prices rose slightly in slow trading, adding fuel to
the stock-market rally. Helping nudge bonds higher were
falling commodities prices, especially oil and gold, which
signal lower inflation. The dollar was mixed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 34.22 points to
close at a record 2935.19 in active trading. Records also
were set by Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and, for the
first time in this rally, by the New York Stock Exchange
composite index. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 367.40, up 4.24
points, and the Big Board composite closed at 200.21, up 2.18
points, breaking a record set Oct. 9. The Big Board index
measures all the more than 1,700 common stocks traded on the
exchange.
   "Money managers are really feeling the pressure," said
James Solloway, chief economist at Argus Research. "As of
April, we saw some of the highest cash levels ever recorded
-- even higher than in 1982. With that much cash, managers
are very vulnerable to underperforming the market."
   With each record high, money managers with cash on their
books become more nervous, traders said. Many institutional
stockholders are showing little inclination to sell, so money
managers are paying more for stocks they want to buy.
   "A lot of these funds are supposed to be 100% invested,
but they have some cash," says Dudley Eppel, head of equity
trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "They are trying to
buy intelligently, but there are no sellers."
   Mr. Eppel says money managers and asset allocators with
cash levels of 30% or more are "sitting there with sweaty
palms; they've turned ashen white."
   Anxious investors looking for cheap stocks to buy turned
to many financial issues, which have lagged the market much
of this year. These stocks are trading at much lower
multiples of their per-share earnings than the overall
market, making them attractive to many investors, especially
mutual-fund managers with large stockpiles of uninvested
cash. American Express, for example, which closed $1.875
higher at $31.625 a share, is trading at 12.5 times estimated
1990 earnings. Currently, the comparable price-earnings ratio
of the industrial average is 14.
   Other investors went after airline stocks, which also have
been trading at low price-earnings ratios and are benefiting
from the recent and continuing decline in oil prices. Their
buying spree pushed the Dow Jones Transportation Average
18.43 higher to close at 1207.85.
   Edward Shopkorn, director of Mabon Nugent's equity
department says: "The market acts incredibly well. People
want to buy stocks; any further downward movement in interest
rates and the Dow Jones Industrial Average could hit 3000."
   Ronald Sloan, executive vice president with Siebel Capital
Management Inc., said "the magnet of 3000 in the Dow
industrials is proving irresistible. It's like a flame and
the moths are drawn to it. I don't know what happens when we
get there, but obviously we are getting there."
   However, Mr. Sloan worries that the stock market may be
overvalued relative to bonds. "Earnings have to build the
story from here, and I have been disappointed by earnings so
far," he says.
   Investors are justified in expecting earnings growth in
certain sectors, said Mr. Solloway, "but the approach we're
seeing now is a bit indiscriminate."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices climbed in active trading, with 175.5 million
shares changing hands on the Big Board. Advancing issues
outnumbered decliners, 1,105 to 477.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose slightly. The benchmark 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond gained more than an eighth of a point, or more
than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount, in slow trading.
The yield was 8.42%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed, rising against the yen partly
because of the strong stock market. In late afternoon New
York trading, the currency was at 1.6855 marks and 152.40
yen, compared with 1.6980 marks and 151.85 yen Friday.

taxes, or 20 cents a share on a fully diluted basis. Analysts
had estimated earlier that the forest-products company's

from the first quarter of 1990, when the company reported
fully diluted earnings of 73 cents a share.
   Unanticipated complications with maintenance and repair at
several of its pulp and paper mills led to lost production
time and higher costs, a company spokesman said. The mills

   Columbia Hospital Corp. of Fort Worth, Texas, said it

   Columbia said it plans to begin by next Monday a tender

HEI's shares being tendered. In national over-the-counter
trading yesterday, HEI shares jumped $1.46875, to close at

   HEI, which owns three Texas hospitals, repeatedly rebuffed

finance the transaction, while Hospital Partners didn't have
financing.
   Columbia, founded in 1987 by Richard L. Scott and a former
Bass family adviser, Richard E. Rainwater, operates seven
hospitals in Texas and Florida. It recently became publicly
traded when it merged with Smith Laboratories Inc., a San

   Dress Barn Inc., Stamford, Conn., reported a 7% increase

   The operator of a chain of off-price women's apparel
retail stores said earnings for the quarter rose to $4
million, or 18 cents a share, from $3.7 million, or 17 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 18% to $70.6 million from
$59.8 million.

   For the nine months, earnings fell to $10.1 million, or 45
cents a share, from $13.7 million, or 61 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales rose 13% to $208.3 million from $183.6
million.
   Dress Barn said it believes the quarter's results "signify
the end of the promotional retail turmoil of the prior six
months." It said it expects a return to its traditional
growth pattern.
   Off-price apparel chains recently have been pressed as
department stores and other retailers undertook big
promotions and widespread discounting.
   Dress Barn said as of April 28 it had 456 stores
operating, a rise of 54 from a year earlier. It said it
planned to have 470 stores operating by the end of fiscal
1990.

   Trans World Music Corp., Albany, N.Y., settled a
trademark-infringement suit brought by rival record and tape
retailer Peaches Entertainment Corp. for $1.5 million.
   Trans World, which has been rapidly expanding its chain of
outlets, had taken a $2.5 million charge against earnings in
the first quarter of 1989 to cover the original $2 million
judgment in Peaches' favor and related expenses. Peaches is
based in Hialeah Gardens, Fla.

   However, Albany-based Trans World appealed the court
decision and late Friday the two companies settled for $1.5
million. Trans World expects the adjustment to boost its
second-quarter earnings by about $300,000 or three cents per
share.
   Meanwhile, at Trans World's annual meeting on Friday,
Chairman Robert J. Higgins predicted that the company's net
income in 1990 could top $18 million or about $2 per share, a
35% increase over 1989's $13.3 million or $1.48 per share,
and that revenues could hit $400 million, about a 28% rise
over 1989's $313 million.

cellular phones and pagers currently in the 212 area code in

   Currently, Manhattan and the Bronx share the 212 area

   In February, Builders Transport signed a non-binding
letter of intent to be acquired for $15 a share, or $73.6
million, by closely held Comcar, an Auburndale, Fla.,
trucking company.
   Yesterday, however, Builders Transport said that Comcar
isn't willing to proceed with the transaction and that the
letter of intent is "no longer operative."
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Builders
Transport closed at $10, down 75 cents.
   Builders Transport added that Trism, the Joplin, Mo.,
parent of trucking firm Tri-State Motor Transit Inc. of
Delaware, has completed its due diligence and is working to
secure financing. Trism has proposed to pay $14 cash plus $3
of preferred stock for each Builders Transport share.
   Builders Transport said it is still hopeful that a
transaction with Trism, Comcar or some other party may be
completed. But it said it is also considering other
alternatives, including an internal restructuring.
   Meanwhile, the company said its annual meeting will be
held on Sept. 18, adding that it had waited to set the date
so that all options could be considered at a single meeting.

   Earlier this year, the group's $18.50-a-share proposal to
acquire Justin was rejected. The group said last month it is
still interested in acquiring Justin and is continuing to
meet with financing sources.
   The group said in the SEC filing that the allegations are
without merit and that it plans to contest them.
   Justin, based in Fort Worth, makes building materials and
leather goods.

   Commodities:
   Soybean Futures Prices Slide as Brief Dry Spell
   Gives Farmers a Chance to Catch Up on Planting

   CHICAGO -- Soybean futures prices skidded as a break in
the season's persistent wet weather allowed farmers to make
some long-delayed progress in planting.
   Illinois and Iowa were expected to remain mostly dry
through tomorrow, with a chance of rain again Thursday and
Friday. Temperatures are expected to rise late this week,
which also would help the emerging crop.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A continuation of wet, cool weather would have meant a
reduction in the likely size of the soybean harvest. Wet
weather in May caused some analysts to trim their forecasts
for the corn crop.
   Soybeans for July delivery fell 9.25 cents a bushel
yesterday to settle at $5.9275. The July corn contract fell
two cents a bushel to $2.7375, but wheat for July delivery
rose 1.75 cents a bushel to $3.31.
   The soybean contract was down about 12 cents and the corn
contract off about four cents early in the session, but
prices recovered slightly before the close at the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Analysts said the decline in corn prices followed news
that the weather had improved just in time for many farmers
to meet the corn-planting deadline. It's a rule of thumb that
for maximum yields, most Midwest corn fields must be planted
by June 1.
   Soybeans can be planted later than corn, so farmers who
miss corn-planting deadlines tend to shift to soybeans.
   Planting in the Midwest soared last week because of the
dry weather. Iowa officials said that 65% of soybean acres
were planted as of Sunday, compared with 26% a week ago. Last
year at that time, however, 98% of planting was completed. In
Illinois, soybean fields were 46% planted, compared with 17%
a week ago and 81% last year.
   Corn planting was 94% complete in Iowa, compared with 87%
last week and 100% last year. Corn planting in Illinois was
79% complete as of Sunday, compared with 71% a week ago and
100% at the same time last year.
   Traders shrugged off developments at the summit meeting
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   "If anything, what happened at the summit was maybe a
little better than expected," said Mario Balletto, analyst
for Merrill Lynch, but "the summit really played no role in
these {price} drops."
   At the summit, Mr. Bush agreed to ease trade restrictions
on the Soviet Union, but congressional leaders are still
demanding that the improvement be made contingent on Moscow's
easing its stance on emigration of Soviet Jews and on
Lithuania's demands for independence.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices fell amid reports that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries hadn't
significantly reduced oil production in May. Market
participants view OPEC's ability to trim its output as
possibly the most crucial factor in the energy market this
summer because of the current huge buildup of crude-oil
supplies. West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery
ended at $17.14 a barrel, off 36 cents. Some traders said the
next technical floor for the July contract is $16.90 a
barrel, a level they said could be tested shortly. Gasoline
prices also fell, with unleaded for July delivery finishing
at 59.58 cents a gallon, down 1.20 cents. News of a fire at a
Kerr-McGee Corp. refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, didn't
affect prices, traders said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold future prices extended Friday's
declines with an across-the-board drop to life-of-contracts
lows. Silver edged higher, and platinum eased. Trading was
light. August gold ended with a loss of $1.10 an ounce at
$362.40 after trading at a new low of $359.60. London prices
eased in sympathy with Friday's losses in New York, and
London's weakness was then reflected again in New York,
analysts said. The market also continued to be affected by
Soviet sales and possible swaps of gold to try to obtain
foreign exchange, one analyst said. Another analyst, Greg
Klochkoff, vice president of Bank of Boston in Providence,
R.I., said traders appeared to waiting to see how much Soviet
gold the market could absorb. "I think there will be a
further slight dip and a good chance of some recovery later
in the week," Mr. Klochkoff said. July silver was up 0.2 cent
an ounce at $5.0820. "Silver prices have been at an extremely
low level in a vastly oversold market," said Peter Cardillo,
trading adviser at Josephthal &amp; Co., New York. At current
levels, with prices below production costs, the market may be
establishing a base from which to stage a rally, he said.
According to Mr. Cardillo, the same is true of gold, which he
also termed an oversold market in which a rebound couldn't be
counted out. July platinum was off $1.20 to $486.80 an ounce.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices fell, with the July contract ending
with a loss of $30 a metric ton at $1,317. At one point, the
contract traded as low as $1,283. The strong demand that was
generated in recent weeks by political turmoil in the Ivory
Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer, has been slacking
off as the political situation has stabilized, according to
analysts. While a quieter Ivory Coast has been the major
price depressant, the Soviet Union's foreign exchange
difficulties also have played a part, one analyst said.
Moscow's reported requests for credit extensions last week
raised the possibility that some of the cocoa the Soviets
have contracted to buy may be resold on the world market, the
analyst said. The Soviet Union accounts for about 7% of world
cocoa consumption, the analyst said.

   Greyhound Files
   For Chapter 11
   To Guard Assets

   DALLAS -- In a move aimed at heading off what it called a
"run on assets" by creditors, strike-battered Greyhound Lines
Inc. filed for creditor protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Several other units of Greyhound's parent company, GLI
Holding Co. were included in the bankruptcy petition. The
filing was made with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Texas in Brownsville, Texas, home of
Eagle Bus Manufacturing Co., one of GLI subsidiaries
involved.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition to missing a $9.8 million interest payment on
its 13% senior notes due in 1995, as of June 1, Greyhound was
behind on about $10 million in lease payments on certain
buses and properties.
   J. Michael Doyle, senior vice president and chief
financial officer, said the company filed for bankruptcy --
seeking protection from creditors while working out a plan to
repay debt -- because creditors involved in those leases were
threatening to take possession of a number of buses. Roughly
two-thirds of the company's 3,800 buses are leased, but Mr.
Doyle declined to say how many were in jeopardy.
   "The system has much more value to everybody as an
operating unit and we couldn't afford to let a lot of assets
get out of the system," Mr. Doyle said.
   Greyhound, which has sustained huge losses as a result of
a three-month-long strike by the Amalgamated Transit Union,
said the action was necessary to ensure that it will be able
to serve its full network during the busy summer travel
season. A company spokesman said that under Chapter 11,
Greyhound will continue to serve all locations on its
network.
   The company also said that the bankruptcy court late
yesterday gave it permission to honor tickets already
purchased for future travel.
   In a memo to employees, Greyhound Chairman Fred Currey
called the Chapter 11 filing "a result of a one-time bad
event."
   "That event was not the strike, but was the strike-related
violence, which was unlawful," Mr. Currey said. "It caused
your company to spend over $50 million out of pocket on
security forces to protect customers and employees, and for
lawyers to get court action to restrain the unlawful
activity.
   "Fortunately, most of those expenses are behind us," Mr.
Currey also said in the memo. "The Chapter 11 proceedings
will enable us to recapitalize so that we can fulfill the
objective of making Greyhound Lines into the growing
customer-focused business that it must be to fulfill its
potential."
   Mr. Doyle said Greyhound is already seeking
debtor-in-possession loans from several sources and "expects
to be successful" in that effort. He declined to say how much
additional capital Greyhound now is seeking but previously
the bus company had indicated that it needed about $35
million for working capital and other purposes.
   The Chapter 11 filing comes just two weeks after Greyhound
offered to redeem about $191 million in face amount of debt
for about $86 million in cash. Amid grumbling from holders of
the Greyhound notes, the company had yet to find a source to
finance the tender offer although Mr. Doyle said negotiations
had been progressing. He said he was uncertain of the status
of the tender offer as a result of the Chapter 11 filing.
   ATU officials, who recently asked Greyhound to discuss a
possible employee buy-out, were caught off-guard by the
Chapter 11 filing. Edward Strait, president of the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, the ATU's
bargaining unit, said the filing would make such a buy-out
more difficult.
   He denied the company's claims that strike violence had
forced it into bankruptcy. "We wanted people punished for the
violence," he said. "They negotiated us into a strike. I
think this has been planned. The company wants to get rid of
the union."
   Other union officials welcomed the company's action. "We
might get rid of Fred Currey and reorganize this thing," said
Edward Vezza, president of the ATU's Philadelphia local. "We
could have had a good contract for all the money he spent
trying to break this union."
   Mr. Currey led a group of Dallas investors that launched a
$270 million leveraged buy-out of Greyhound Lines in 1987
from its former parent company, the recently renamed
Greyhound Dial Corp. The group acquired the assets of its
major competitor, Trailways Corp., the same year for $80
million. At the end of 1989, the closely held concern still
had about $359 million in debt on its books, largely as a
result of those leveraged buy-outs.
   Although Mr. Currey attempted to rally employees behind
his plans to revamp Greyhound, his efforts crumbled amid
bitterness over the company's contract offer earlier this
year. The ATU strike began March 2 and was followed by
widespread violence as the company hired permanent
replacement drivers to replace strikers. Such violence
eventually tapered off but not before Greyhound recorded a
$55.8 million loss for the first quarter, compared with a
year-earlier $14.4 million loss.
   A regional office of the National Labor Relations Board
recently issued a complaint alleging that the strike is an
unfair labor practices walkout. If the finding is upheld, the
company says it could ultimately be forced to rehire union
drivers and be liable for as much $800 million in back pay to
strikers.
   Greyhound officials said the NLRB proceedings will
continue despite the Chapter 11 filing.

   Quarter Results to Include

   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. said in a filing that its
second-quarter results will include a $68 million, or 16
cent-a-share, after-tax charge related to a recent legal
settlement with USX Corp.
   Last month, San Francisco-based Pacific Gas paid USX $14
million to settle a dispute over the cause of a water conduit
rupture in 1982 that delayed the start-up of operations at
Pacific Gas's Helms hydroelectric power facility. USX's
predecessor company filed suit in 1983. Of the $68 million
charge, $8 million represents the after-tax cost of the
settlement. The remainder is a reserve related to costs for
the plant repairs, said a company spokesman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Pacific
Gas said the pact came after a jury finding that the conduit
failure was caused by Pacific Gas's negligence. In addition,
"the jury found that . . . {Pacific Gas's} conduct in bidding
the rebuild of the water conduit constituted a fraud on USX,
entitling USX to punitive damages." Pacific Gas said the pact
was a "compromise" and "does not constitute an admission of
liability by either company."

   Bush May Delay Drilling

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is expected to delay new oil
drilling off the coasts of California and Florida so that
additional environmental studies can be done, administration
officials said.
   While cautioning that the president hadn't made a final
decision, the officials said he was likely to seek different
delays for various tracts. Some parts of Florida were likely
to be removed even from consideration for development until
early in the next century.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The long-awaited announcement, which is expected next
week, will try to steer a middle course between
environmentalists, who have pushed for a permanent ban, and
the oil industry, which is eager to resume drilling.
   By delaying a decision, the president could remove some of
the political heat from the issue in the fall election
campaign. The Florida congressional delegation and GOP
gubernatorial candidates Sen. Pete Wilson in California and
Gov. Bob Martinez in Florida all oppose new drilling.
   In his public comments, the president has hinted that he
won't allow drilling in the foreseeable future off Florida
but has left California's fate more murky.
   Lisa Speer, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense
Council in New York, said, "A delay would have been a bold
stroke before the Exxon Valdez. But people aren't going to be
satisfied with it at this point."

   Street Starts Squeezing Deal-Making Colossus

   NEW YORK -- Wall Street is beginning to dismantle the huge
deal-making machinery that made so many investment bankers
and lawyers rich during the 1980s.
   With the takeover boom fizzling out, scores of high-priced
investment bankers are being shown the door at Wall Street
firms, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton
Holdings Inc., the First Boston Corp. unit of CS First Boston
Inc., and the Salomon Brothers Inc. unit of Salomon Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The deal slowdown also has produced pink slips at law
firms with big merger practices, such as Willkie Farr &amp;
Gallagher, Shearson's main outside law firm, and Cahill
Gordon &amp; Reindell. Cahill Gordon represents Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., the securities firm that used to do 50% of all
new junk-bond issues, which financed many takeovers; Drexel's
parent filed for bankruptcy-law protection from creditors in
February.
   Even lower-paid professionals at commercial banks are
feeling the slump. Some banks built huge groups with scores
of people to crank out loans for leveraged buyouts and other
deals. Last month, Bank of Boston Corp. disbanded a 16-member
team that specialized in buy-out loans.
   Many Wall Street dealmakers rode the 1980s takeover boom
to multimillion-dollar salaries. Now they are facing lower
pay or layoffs for the first time in years. The reason: too
many lawyers and investment bankers and not enough deals.
   According to Securities Data Co., the volume of announced
takeovers world-wide this year through May fell 45% from the
same period in 1988, and U.S. takeovers alone declined 61%.
In recent months, the slump has extended beyond highly
leveraged deals to include so-called strategic acquisitions,
hostile bids in which one corporation seeks to buy another in
the same industry.
   Even now, if the deal business doesn't rebound quickly --
something few professionals expect -- merger departments will
have to make even greater cutbacks. "There's probably two or
three times more {deal-making} capacity than needed at the
moment," says Martin Lipton, a well-known takeover defense
lawyer at Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz. His 105-lawyer firm
is less vulnerable to a downturn, because it didn't expand
wildly during the merger boom.
   Mr. Lipton says a lot of the capacity was built up to
handle "the type of transaction that's unlikely to reappear
-- a highly leveraged transaction, followed by the sale of
pieces" of the target company.
   Typically, he says, a hostile bidder obtained bank loans
and a temporary bridge loan from an investment bank,
refinanced the bridge by selling high-yielding junk bonds,
and auctioned half the target company's assets. Each of those
auctions often required bank loans and junk bonds, as well.
The whole sequence required a half-dozen investment banks,
four lead commercial banks and a dozen law firms.
   Though some takeover professionals see hope in the
still-healthy field of international takeovers, mainly in
Europe, many of them believe the boom times won't return
soon. "The last four or five years were the aberrations, not
1990," says Robert Friedman, co-administrative partner at
Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett. That law firm, like most other
large firms, plans to scale back its hiring of new lawyers
from the torrid pace of the late 1980s.
   The bloodiest cuts this year have come at Shearson Lehman,
where balance-sheet weakness required a financial overhaul by
its parent, American Express Co., in February. In the past
year, Shearson Lehman has cut 120 investment bankers,
including 40 in municipal bonds, from a force that totaled
876 a year ago.
   Merrill Lynch, which had laid claim to junk-bond
leadership since Drexel Burnham's demise, has reduced its
investment-banker population by 100, to 600, in the past
year, according to a person close to the firm.
   Jerome Kenney, Merrill Lynch's head of capital markets,
says: "The late 1980s had a soaring rise in the use of
leverage. That leverage has now gone too far," he says, and
as a result, "a lot of corporate America has to restructure."
Though Merrill Lynch and other Wall Street firms are trying
to redeploy investment bankers to do corporate
restructurings, Mr. Kenney acknowledges that restructurings
"will not replace the profits of the '88 and '89 deal
business, because those fees were so big."
   First Boston, which has hit snags on some bridge loans it
made to help clients complete takeovers, has just begun
cutting people to respond to the merger slowdown. Since
January 1989, a spokesman says, the firm has reduced its
investment banking professionals by 80, to 500. And Salomon
has trimmed its deal-maker population since February, cutting
its mergers head count to 90 from 100 and its investment
banking ranks to 410 from 420.
   Meanwhile, executives of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., two of Wall Street's top deal-makers, say they
are trimming their legions only slightly. Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively, behind
Drexel Burnham last year in junk-bond issues, with $78.3
million and $75.6 million in junk fees. So far this year,
Goldman Sachs has a $6.3 million fee for one issue, according
to Securities Data. In all last year, Wall Street firms
reaped a total of $807.7 million in junk-bond fees; so far
this year, the total is only $11 million.
   Speculation about cutbacks has swirled around Wasserstein,
Perella &amp; Co., a two-year-old merger firm created by Bruce
Wasserstein, an adviser who left First Boston with Joseph
Perella in 1988. The startup firm ranked third in 1989
takeover-deal volume, and a spokesman says it is still
expanding, particularly in Europe, growing from 110
professionals in February to 120 in May.
   The rapid Wasserstein Perella expansion has raised
questions about how the firm will manage its overhead. This
year, the firm can still live off fees that continue to come
in from big deals announced in 1989, such as the acquisition
of Warner Communications Inc. by Time Inc. and the hostile
takeover of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. by Georgia-Pacific
Corp. But it isn't clear how the firm will manage in 1991.
   While many people leaving investment banks are relatively
junior deal-makers, some more senior bankers are heading for
the hills voluntarily.
   Two of Shearson Lehman's merchant bankers, David Offensend
and Stephen Gruber, left this spring to become dealmakers at
Rosecliff Inc., which manages money and makes deals on behalf
of the Texas investor Robert M. Bass and several financial
institutions. And late last week, a Salomon Brothers
retailing dealmaker, Diane Price Baker, left to become chief
financial officer at R.H. Macy &amp; Co.
   While many investment bankers who entered the business in
the 1980s will be tempted to leave because this will be their
first year with less pay, they may find it difficult to
replicate their lavish compensation elsewhere.
   Most law firms say they don't have to respond as radically
to the changed climate, because their compensation wasn't as
volatile as that of investment bankers.
   But some law firms have been noticeably hard-hit. Willkie
Farr told 22 associates they had to leave by mid-1990, an
unusually large number; one reason is the deal slowdown at
Shearson Lehman, one of Willkie's biggest clients. "The
hostile-deal business is substantially dead," says a Willkie
Farr partner, Jack Nusbaum.
   But Mr. Nusbaum says that work keeps coming in from other
corporate clients, and that Willkie Farr's bankruptcy and
restructuring work is picking up. For example, Willkie Farr
is the debtor's counsel for Integrated Resources Inc., a
former Drexel Burnham client, which has filed for
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.
   Cahill Gordon, Drexel Burnham's main law firm, fired about
25 associates in February, around the same time Drexel
Burnham collapsed and its parent sought bankruptcy-law
protection. Roger Meltzer, co-administrative partner, said
the firings weren't connected to Drexel Burnham's demise or
the deal slowdown, because the firm has an "active and
diversified practice."
   But Mr. Meltzer acknowledges that Cahill Gordon is
"proceeding business-as-usual in a different world. That
world is a lower level of mergers and acquisitions activity
on Wall Street, and a lower level of securities transactions
as a whole. People are trying to reorient themselves, trying
to figure out what the 1990s hold for the law business in
relation to the investment banking business."
   While other law firms that are heavily dependent on deal
work may have avoided mass layoffs, many expect sharply lower
profits and reduced hiring of new lawyers.
   Much of the speculation about how the merger slowdown will
affect law firms has focused on Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp;
Flom, which became a 1,050-lawyer firm from the base of the
legal world's busiest mergers practice, led by partner Joseph
Flom.
   Executive partner Peter Mullen says Skadden Arps has
diversified, so that only 20% of its lawyers work on mergers.
Also, some merger lawyers have shifted into restructuring
work, an area that has grown to 75 lawyers from 25 in the
past year.
   Mr. Mullen says Skadden Arps has worked on about the same
number of deals as it did last year, but they are smaller,
and fewer get completed. And he acknowledges that Skadden
Arps's profit per partner is likely to decline in 1990 for
the first time in three or four years.
   Most big banks declined to comment on their leveraged-loan
staffing. A spokesman for Citicorp says the bank has cut the
number of bankers making senior-debt loans for takeover deals
by 25% since 1987. But the overall head count has remained
the same, the spokesman says, citing growth in venture
capital, international, and junk-bond activity.

   LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge here ruled that the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors violated the
constitutional rights of the area's large Hispanic population
when it drew voting boundaries in 1981.
   The suit was filed in 1988 by the U.S. Justice Department,
the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund. It alleged that the Board
of Supervisors illegally drew boundaries to separate the
county's Hispanic community in Central and East Los Angeles
into three separate supervisoral districts, thus diluting
Hispanic voting strength and maintaining an all-white
governing board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Federal Judge David Kenyon said in his ruling that the
County Board of Supervisors "knew that by adopting the 1981
redistricting plan, they were further impairing the ability
of Hispanics to gain representation on the board."
   Officials of the Board of Supervisors were in meetings
yesterday afternoon, and couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.
   It wasn't clear what effect the ruling would have on the
voting boundaries. Judge Kenyon called a hearing for Thursday
to discuss the ruling with the parties involved.

   Foreshadowing an adjustment of East Asian political and

   THE SUPREME COURT RULED that public schools must allow

   In an 8-1 decision, the justices said public schools
generally must give student religious groups the same access

activities. The ruling in a case from Omaha, Neb., where
officials refused to permit a high school Bible-reading club,
upheld a 1984 federal law aimed at allowing religious
organizations in public schools. The court said the statute
doesn't violate the separation of church and state.

   Dollar Falls to Mark Despite Failure
   To Reach Accord on Germany at Summit

   NEW YORK -- The mark rose broadly, defying earlier
predictions of a sell-off in the absence of a Bush-Gorbachev
agreement on the military status of a unified Germany.
   The dollar was lower against the West German currency, but
rose against the yen, participants said. The market was
thinned by a holiday in several European countries, including
West Germany.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Traders said the market's perception of the importance of
an accord on Germany shifted following the conclusion Sunday
of the four-day summit in Washington. A market consensus
developed that Soviet policy won't be as crucial a factor in
German integration as previously supposed.
   Participants concluded that any compromise on the issue of
German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
likely will be a drawn-out process, and as such won't
preclude the economic and social integration set for July 2
under the Germanys' recently signed treaty, traders said.
   News that U.S. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev directed their respective foreign ministers to hold
talks on the issue at meetings during the next several weeks
bolstered that view, dealers said.
   There was nervousness in the market last week that
continued Soviet opposition to Germany joining NATO could
delay unification, leading participants to predict a mark
fall if Messrs. Bush and Gorbachev couldn't reach a
compromise on the issue at the summit.
   In the absence of any great concern with the issue of
German NATO membership, market participants returned their
focus to economic fundamentals, bidding the mark higher on
the belief in an eventual raising of interest rates by the
West German Bundesbank, said Peter Iversen, a trader at
Shawmut Bank of Boston.
   The mark was helped against the U.S. currency by the
dollar's failure to push through important technical levels
above 1.70 marks during a rally earlier in the New York day,
a development that led participants to try selling the
dollar, Mr. Iversen and others said.
   The market was also wary of intervention on behalf of the
Bundesbank above 1.70 marks, leading to some trepidation at
bidding the dollar higher aggressively, said Baruch Deutsch,
a dealer at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York.
   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at
1.6855 marks, down from 1.6980 marks late Friday, and at
152.40 yen, up from 151.85 yen. Sterling was at $1.6810,
unchanged from late Friday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 152.20 yen soon
after opening at 152.36 yen and down from Monday's Tokyo
close of 152.42 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading
at about 1.6890 marks.
   But Mr. Deutsch and others said the dollar was prevented
from falling too far by a lack of news to push it
aggressively lower, especially in light of the market's
conviction that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will
maintain the Fed's current policy of steady interest rates.
   The U.S. received some support from the rise of stock
prices on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The industrial
average reached a record high of 2935.19, up 34.22 points on
the day. The previous record high was 2900.97, recorded
Friday.
   A round of three-day system-repurchase agreements executed
Monday by the Fed was dismissed as a technical adjustment of
the Federal Funds rate and not a signal that the central bank
might be preparing moves to lower interest rates, said John
Lynam, a vice president at Security Pacific International
Bank, New York.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said he is
"optimistic" a budget accord can be reached that would reduce
U.S. interest rates. The statement caused the dollar to slip
slightly.
   The yen fell against the West German and U.S. currencies,
beset by continuing market concern about what impact a fall
in real-estate prices might have on large Japanese financial
institutions with a large exposure to loans secured by
real-estate holdings, dealers said.
   Sterling fell against the dollar and mark as the
expectations of a quick entry of Britain into the Exchange
Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System continued to
deflate, said Mr. Lynam.
   In Europe, the dollar was mostly weaker, although activity
was thinned by European holidays. In Tokyo, the dollar was
higher as traders followed through on gains in the currency
last week.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold
settled at $358.60 an ounce, down 60 cents. Estimated volume
was a moderate 3.2 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $358.25 an ounce.

   NASHVILLE, N.C. -- A Washington, D.C., lawyer who drew
national attention last summer when his private plane crashed
into the Atlantic Ocean has been indicted on 455 counts of
securities fraud and related charges.
   A grand jury here returned a total of 2,695 counts of
securities fraud and other charges against Sonrise Management
Services of Columbus, Ga., Telemedia Inc. of Landover, Md.,
several officers and owners of the two firms and Thomas Root,
the Washington lawyer who allegedly provided legal services
for Sonrise clients.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Root, in a July flight from Washington to Rocky Mount,
N.C., reported blacking out in the cockpit of his
single-engine plane. The aircraft, followed by military
planes, eventually crashed in the Caribbean. Mr. Root
survived the crash, but was pulled from the water with a
gunshot wound in his stomach.
   The charges arise from Sonrise's claims that individuals
who invested in the company would receive help in applying
for licenses for radio stations from the Federal
Communications Commission. The district attorney in Nashville
said only a handful of Sonrise's more than 1,600 investors --
who put down more than $16 million -- ever received an FCC
license.
   Officials at Sonrise and Telemedia, an
engineering-consulting firm allegedly involved with Sonrise,
couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Root was also
unavailable for comment.

Montana, Alaska and Canada's western provinces,
representatives for the networks said. The details of the
merger will be worked out over the next 120 days, they said.

   NEW YORK -- A stronger dollar and falling commodity prices
helped bond prices post modest gains yesterday.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/4 point
yesterday, or about $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, eased to 8.42%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Traders said the prices started to firm as the value of
the dollar rose against the yen. The dollar ended at 152.40
yen, up from 151.85 yen late Friday. Meanwhile, the Commodity
Research Bureau's futures index, which comprises 21
commodities, fell 1.25 points to 239.23. The CRB index
includes crude oil futures, which fell 36 cents to settle at
$17.14 in the July contract.
   The dollar and commodities held center stage largely
because there is little else for players to focus on, the
analysts and traders say.
   "It's brutally quiet," said one dealer. The unusually
light calendar of economic releases this week is largely
responsible for the dull trading, which analysts say should
continue for the near term.
   "The dollar and lower commodity prices have helped out,
but we're pretty much biding time until next week's data,"
says Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Lynn Reaser, a vice president and senior economist at
First Interstate Bank Ltd. agrees: "The market is digesting
Friday's very large gains and waiting for more news on
economic growth and inflation." And "the fact that the market
has been able to retain the gains from Friday is positive,"
said Ms. Reaser. "There's been very little profit taking."
   Traders said that investors aren't cashing in on the
profits they reaped Friday when bond prices surged because
they expect prices to rise further when key reports on last
month's retail sales and producer and consumer prices are
issued next week.
   On Friday, bond prices rose as much as 1 1/2 points in
response to the May employment report, which suggested a more
sluggish economy than many had forecast.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading. The
benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 103 15/32 to yield
8.42% compared with 103 8/32 to yield 8.44% on Friday.
   The latest 10-year notes ended at 102 26/32 to yield 8.43%
compared with 102 22/32 to yield 8.45%.
   The government sold a total of $17.25 billion of
three-month and six-month Treasury bills yesterday at its
regular weekly auction.
   The average discount rate on the three-month bills was
7.69% while the average rate on six-month bills was 7.62%.
The rates were lower than at last week's auction when they
were 7.80% and 7.74%, respectively.
   The average rate on three-month bills was the lowest since
the average of 7.67% at the auction on May 14, 1990. The rate
on six-month bills was the lowest since the average of 7.58%
at the auction on Jan. 22, 1990.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of Trump Taj Funding and two other casinos
run by developer Donald Trump plunged yesterday on reports
that the developer is in the throes of a cash squeeze. The
report, which was in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, drove
Trump bonds down as much as 8 points.
   However, Trump casino bonds weren't the only junk bonds to
take a beating in yesterday's bond market.
   Although most junk bonds, or speculative-grade bonds with
low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended
modestly higher yesterday, the bonds of Charter Medical Corp.
sank.
   Charter's bonds weakened on news that the psychiatric-care
company will close about 25 outpatient counseling centers and
idle about 600 employees across the country. Bids for Charter
Medical's 14% senior subordinated debentures, due 2000, are
off about two points at 52.
   Meanwhile, the junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc. gained on a report that British publisher Robert Maxwell
is still interested in acquiring the U.S. publishing giant.
   Mr. Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer of
Maxwell Communication Corp., declined to comment on whether
he has been in talks with Harcourt regarding a possible
acquisition.
   Harcourt's 13% senior notes, due in 1997, advanced 1/2
point to close at 95 3/4, while the firm's 13.75% senior
subordinated debentures, maturing in 1999, also climbed 1/2
point to 81.
   The giant publisher's senior securities have tended to
advance whenever there is talk about a possible acquisition
of the company.
   Ben Bendre, a high-yield analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.,
attributes the run-up to the expectation that the 13% senior
notes would be bought back at par with proceeds from an asset
sale.
   According to covenants governing the 13% notes, proceeds
from an asset sale must be used to pay off bank debt first
and then for the buy-back of the company's senior bonds.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities were little changed after light
trading.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
June delivery ended at 97 1/32, unchanged; 9.5% issues were
at 99 11/32, down 1/32; 10% issues were at 101 3/4,
unchanged, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
securities stood at 98 3/4, up 1/32.
   In derivative markets, the Federal National Mortgage
Association issued two real estate mortgage investment
conduits totaling $500 million and Freddie Mac issued one
Remic for $300 million.
   Fannie Mae issued a $300 million issue backed by its 10.5%
mortgage securities through Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. and a $200
million issue backed by 9.5% 15-year securities through
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Freddie Mac issued the $300 million issue backed by 10%
securities through Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt bonds ended unchanged to 1/4 point higher in
quiet trading.
   Bond dealers said market participants are bracing for New
York State's annual spring borrowing, expected to consist of
$4.1 billion tax and revenue-anticipation notes via
negotiation on Thursday.
   The 1990 spring borrowing will be one of the state's
largest.
   Because of New York's recurring fiscal problems, market
participants expect that the state's short-term tax and
revenue-anticipation notes may receive a MIG-2 rating from
Moody's Investors Service Inc. -- one notch below the MIG-1
rating last year's spring borrowing received.
   They also expect Moody's to downgrade the state's
long-term debt rating, now at single-A-1. In addition, an
SP-1 rating -- below last year's level of SP-1-Plus -- is
expected from Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., several traders say.
Both agencies have the notes under review.
   With a rating cut in mind, traders said yields on the New
York bonds are expected to come in between 6.20% and 6.35%,
although some estimates are as high as 6.50%. Underwriting
officials declined to comment on price talk.
   Late Friday, New York State Comptroller Edward Regan
announced that he had certified the state's $49.8 billion
budget, clearing the way for the spring borrowing to take
place.
   Despite the possibility of a credit rating cut, traders
reported strong retail investor interest in the notes because
of the expected higher yield.
   "It's been sort of a blessing that it's taken so long" to
adopt the budget, one trader says. "We've got orders lined
up, a stack of them."
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds ended higher in quiet trading,
with activity muted due to the Whit Monday holiday that was
observed in most European countries.
   Traders said that British bonds, called gilts, firmed
during early trading in sympathy with Friday's rally in the
U.S. Treasury market. The British market then dipped on an
upward revision of U.K. retail sales data and drifted through
the remainder of the session.
   Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 15/32
to 101 3/8 to yield 11.54% while the 12% notes due in 1995
rose 5/32 to 99 14/32 to yield 12.17%.
   Friday's bond rally in the U.S. also bolstered Japanese
bonds yesterday. The price of the benchmark 10-year Japanese
government bond ended at 88.33 to yield 6.90%. (The yield is
calculated in local terms, but would be lower if calculated
by the semiannual compound measure that is used in the U.S.)
   West German financial markets were closed.

   L.A. Gear Inc. Is Hit
   With 15 Holder Suits
   Over Profit Estimate

   LOS ANGELES -- L.A. Gear Inc. was hit with a rash of
shareholder lawsuits in the wake of its announcement Friday
that it expects to post a sharp drop in net income for the
quarter ended May 31.
   A total of 15 lawsuits were filed in federal court here,
all alleging that the Marina del Rey, Calif., sneaker
company's officers and directors issued a series of false and
misleading statements to inflate the company's stock price
and conceal adverse information. L.A. Gear's stock has
plummeted nearly $20 a share in the past 1 1/2 weeks, from a
record high of $50.375 a share, when the company announced
late last month that it had signed singer Paula Abdul as a
celebrity endorser.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bulk of the stock drop came Friday, when L.A. Gear
announced that it would report second-quarter per-share net
income of between 50 cents and 60 cents, compared with 91
cents a year earlier. The company blamed the drop on its
product mix, with increased sales of lower-priced, less
profitable shoes that it had pushed to gain market share and
retail shelf space, coupled with increased sales of its
lower-margin apparel and international footwear.
   An L.A. Gear spokeswoman said the company hadn't been
served with the lawsuits and, therefore, couldn't comment.
   Fourteen of the lawsuits were identical in language and
were filed by the same local counsel on behalf of plaintiffs
and other attorneys around the country. They seek unspecified
damages, plus treble punitive damages under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The suits seek
class-action status on behalf of shareholders who bought L.A.
Gear stock between Sept. 29, 1989, and June 1.
   The other complaint, filed on behalf of investor Joseph
Scorese, is for a class of investors who bought L.A. Gear
shares between May 14 and June 1 this year. It also seeks
unspecified damages.
   The 14 suits charge that nine company officers grossed
almost $33 million by selling 1.1 million shares since last
fall while in possession of adverse inside information about
the company's business. The figures don't include stock sales
made last month, the complaints said. The suits also repeat
allegations from previous suits against the company that the
value of imports had been understated to avoid import duties
and that investors had been misled into believing that L.A.
Gear could diversify and adapt to fashion trends.

   In a decision written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the high
court ruled, 9-0, that federal laws regulating the nuclear
industry don't preclude so-called whistleblowers from suing
for the emotional distress caused by their employers'
treatment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling is a defeat for the nuclear industry, which now
faces lawsuits under disparate state personal-injury laws
instead of being held accountable under a single federal law.
   The decision reinstates a lawsuit against General Electric
Co. by Vera English, a former employee at the nuclearfuels
plant in Wilmington, N.C. According to GE, the suit asks for
about $1.5 million in compensatory damages and nearly $2.3
billion in punitive damages.
   Ms. English was fired in 1984 after she complained that
spills of radioactive materials weren't being properly
cleaned up by workers. To prove her point, she left a
radioactive work area uncleaned and showed her supervisor a
few days later that it hadn't been cleaned or even noticed.
   After her dismissal, she filed administrative claims under
federal labor law with the Labor Department, but they were
dismissed. So she sued the company for emotional distress.
   Both a federal district court in North Carolina and a
federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., dismissed the
lawsuit, ruling that federal law pre-empted her claims.
Yesterday, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court
decision.
   "As a result of the Supreme Court decision the case will
go back to the federal district court in North Carolina," a
GE spokesman said. "GE is confident it will prevail on the
merits of the state tort claim, which the Supreme Court said
was not pre-empted by the federal law." (English vs. General
Electric Co.)
                                                                                                       

   Lawyer Advertising
                                                                                                       

   The justices ruled, 5-4, that states can't prohibit
lawyers from truthfully advertising themselves as specialists
in certain areas. The high court ruled that although such
advertising may be regulated by states to determine whether
it is truthful, it is protected by the First Amendment and
can't be entirely barred.
   The high court ruled against Illinois officials for their
1989 censure of an Edwardsville, Ill., lawyer. The lawyer
noted on his stationery that he is certified as a specialist
in civil trials by the National Board of Trial Advocacy, a
lawyers group that sets standards and maintains lists of
those who have met them.
   Illinois officials censured him because the state
professional code for lawyers prohibits claims of
specialization. Similar bans are contained in the codes of
about 15 other states.
   But in an opinion written by Justice John Stevens, the
high court ruled that the letterhead is a form of advertising
that is protected by the First Amendment. Justice Stevens's
opinion only commanded four votes, but Justice Thurgood
Marshall provided a fifth vote, agreeing for separate reasons
that the Illinois ban was invalid.
   Justice Byron White dissented. Justice Sandra O'Connor
also dissented, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justice Antonin Scalia. (Peel vs. Attorney Disciplinary
Commission)
                                                                                                       

   State Bar Dues
                                                                                                       

   The high court ruled, 9-0, that the use of compulsory bar
association dues for lobbying and to support political causes
violates the First Amendment rights of lawyers who object to
the positions advocated.
   The decision, written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, was a
defeat for the State Bar of California. But it will affect
other states as well. In recent years, some 30 states have
had mandatory bar associations, those that lawyers are
required to join. Many of these bar associations use a
portion of their compulsory dues to become involved in local
political issues.
   In California, the state bar used dues to lobby for
legislation, file friend-of-the-court briefs, and adopt
resolutions supporting gun control and a nuclear freeze. In a
challenge by 21 lawyers, the California Supreme Court upheld
the bar's activities.
   Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed that ruling.
The court said that a state bar may spend dues to lobby on
issues directly related to the profession, such as
legislation on lawyers' ethics, but not for other, unrelated
matters.
   The decision subjects bar associations to the same limits
on dues that the court has imposed on labor unions, although
the American Bar Association had urged the high court to
grant more flexibility. (Keller vs. State Bar of California)
                                                                                                       

   Natural Gas Pricing
                                                                                                       

   The justices agreed to decide whether Congress gave the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the authority to revamp
the pricing for natural gas from wells that were in
production before November 1978. A federal appeals court in
New Orleans ruled in September 1989 that the commission
exceeded its authority in 1986 when it revamped the pricing
system for so-called old natural gas.
   If the justices uphold the appeals court ruling, the
commission may order producers to refund $100 million to
consumers, industry groups say.
   Old gas is gas produced from wells that were already in
operation when the federal Natural Gas Policy Act took effect
in November 1978. Congress set higher price ceilings for
so-called new gas, gas that would come from newer wells, and
lower ceilings for old gas. But the 1978 federal law also
preserved 15 different categories of old gas with varying
price ceilings, based on the age of the wells.
   In 1986, the FERC concluded that the ceilings for old gas
were so low that producers were abandoning old wells, leaving
huge untapped reserves and prompting greater reliance on
imports and on higher-priced new wells. The commission
consolidated old gas into one category, raised the price, and
required producers to renegotiate their contracts.
   Pipeline companies, consumers and distributors challenged
FERC's authority for the orders and won in appeals court.
   The case was appealed to the high court by the commission
and by two dozen natural gas producers. They said the appeals
court ruling will disrupt natural gas markets and 1,600
natural gas supply contracts that have been renegotiated.

   Airline Lawsuits
                                                                                                       

   The high court agreed to decide whether a treaty that
governs liability for international airline flights allows
passengers to sue for damages for emotional distress because
of near mishaps, even though there were no physical injuries.
The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Texas Air Corp.'s
Eastern Airlines Inc. unit.
   The case stems from 25 separate lawsuits filed against the
airline under Florida and federal laws by passengers who were
on an Eastern flight in 1983 from Miami to the Bahamas. Soon
after takeoff the engines shut down, and passengers were told
the plane would have to ditch in the Atlantic Ocean. The
pilots were able to restart one engine and return to Miami,
but not before the plane sharply lost altitude.
   Most international flights are subject to a treaty,
approved by the U.S. in 1934 and modified in 1966, that
limits airline liability for accidents to property and
individuals.
   Last year, a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled that
the treaty allows lawsuits for emotional distress, even when
there was no physical injury. A federal district court had
dismissed the lawsuits before trial. (Eastern Airlines Inc.
vs. Floyd)
                                                                                                       

   Alabama Business Tax
                                                                                                       

   The high court let stand an Alabama Supreme Court ruling
that the state's franchise tax for corporations doesn't
discriminate against companies located in other states. The
high court refused to hear appeals by General Motors Corp.
and Reynolds Metals Co. General Motors challenged the $6.3
million that it and several subsidiaries paid from 1983
through 1988. Reynolds objected to $1.2 million it paid in
1982 and 1983.
   The companies argued that the franchise tax, imposed on
all corporations doing business in Alabama, is calculated
differently for companies based in Alabama than for those
based in other states. The result, they argued, is a much
heavier tax on out-of-state corporations than on those based
in Alabama. But the Alabama Supreme Court concluded that the
tax doesn't violate either the 14th Amendment guarantee of
"equal protection of the laws" or the Constitution's
prohibition on interference with interstate commerce.

   TORONTO -- Corona Corp. said it agreed to make an improved
offer to acquire the joint owners of a new gold property in a
move to head off a takeover bid by Placer Dome Inc.
   Corona also said it raised its holdings in the two
concerns, Stikine Resources Ltd. and Prime Resources Group
Inc., both of Vancouver, British Columbia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Toronto-based Corona said it plans to merge the two
companies into a new subsidiary to be created through the
spinoff of Corona's gold assets. Corona will retain a 50.2%
interest in the new company, to be known as Corona Gold Corp.
Corona will remain as a holding company with interests in oil
and gas, industrial minerals, gold and financial services.
   Corona said it advanced its restructuring plans by as much
as 18 months in response to a takeover bid for Stikine by
Placer. The Vancouver-based mining concern has offered 67.50
Canadian dollars (US$57.50) a share, valuing all of Stikine
at 229.5 million Canadian dollars.
   The takeover battle is being fought over the Eskay Creek
gold deposit located in northwestern British Columbia. The
property's estimated reserves to date total about 4.8 million
ounces of gold or equivalent, valued at about US$1.71
billion.
   Ned Goodman, Corona's chairman, said the company last week
bought more shares in Prime Resources, raising its stake to
45% from 21%. He said Corona obtained an option from
Stikine's principal holders that would boost its stake there
to 45%.
   Corona will offer 6.5 of its shares and two shares of
Corona Gold for each Stikine share. Stikine holders will be
eligible to receive, for each Corona share, 0.38 share of
Corona Gold as part of a special dividend payment to be made
to Corona holders.
   For each Prime share, holders will be entitled to receive
one Corona Gold share and one share of a successor company to
be known as Prime Equities Inc., which will comprise Prime
Resources' holdings in junior exploration concerns.

   NEW YORK -- Robert Maxwell, chairman of Maxwell
Communication Corp. PLC, said he negotiating to buy a major
U.S. daily newspaper that he refused to identify.
   Mr. Maxwell, who owns newspapers in the Britain and who
recently bought three U.S. supermarket tabloids, said the
acquisition, could involve "hundreds of millions" of dollars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rumors of Mr. Maxwell's interest in a U.S. daily newspaper
have circulated in recent months. However, yesterday was the
first time he acknowledged that he is actively seeking a U.S.
paper.
   Industry executives say Mr. Maxwell has focused his
interest on the Chicago Sun-Times, the country's 11th largest
newspaper with daily circulation of 532,678. Mr. Maxwell said
yesterday he "wouldn't deny or confirm" that he is
negotiating for the Sun-Times.
   The Sun-Times is currently owned by an investment group
led by the New York investment firm of Adler &amp; Shaykin, which
bought the newspaper from Rupert Murdoch in 1986 for $145
million. Sun-Times Chairman Leonard P. Shaykin, a managing
partner of Adler &amp; Shaykin, said "we aren't in discussion
with Maxwell about the purchase of the Sun-Times." Mr.
Shaykin wouldn't comment on whether previous negotiations had
taken place.
   Mr. Maxwell also acknowledged he is interested in Tribune
Co.'s New York Daily News, currently in tough contract
negotiations with its union. Although Tribune executives say
it isn't for sale, Mr. Maxwell said yesterday, "We would be
very interested in the Daily News if the deadlock becomes
impossible. We would be a very competent party to buy it, as
a way out for the Tribune."

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- National Bancshares Corp. of Texas,
which continues to own three Texas banks after nine others
were declared insolvent, expects to seek protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in "the next day or
so," an attorney for the company said.
   The bank holding company said Friday it would file
immediately for bankruptcy-law protection; however, the
attorney said the company is still preparing papers for the
filing.

   Regulators declared the nine banks insolvent Friday and
sold their deposits and some assets to NCNB Texas National
Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp. The action left National
Bancshares with banks in Rockdale, Laredo and Eagle Pass.
   The attorney said that National Bancshares has an
estimated $8 million to $9 million in non-bank assets, such
as real estate, and that the three banks' combined asset
value is estimated at $9 million to $12 million. However, he
said, the company's true asset value could be $5 million to
$20 million, depending on regulators' claims.
   National Bancshares has estimated liabilities of $35
million to $40 million, the attorney said, including $25
million in convertible subordinated debentures and about $4.9
million in debt owed to Federal Asset Management Corp., a

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
South Korean President Roh Tae Woo said that their two
countries are moving toward establishing diplomatic
relations.
   Last night's announcement foreshadowed an adjustment of
East Asian political and economic relationships that could
potentially be as dramatic as the overhaul of Soviet society
that Mr. Gorbachev is struggling to nurture at home.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The Korean peninsula remains the last area of tension in
the Cold War," said President Roh. "The Cold War on the
Korean peninsula now begins to crack."
   Mr. Roh called his unusual meeting with Mr. Gorbachev --
the first between leaders of their two nations since the
division of the peninsula in 1948 -- in a San Francisco hotel
an "epic-making event" and "an important turning point."
While setting no timetable for normalizing relations, he said
it would provide a strong impetus for promoting a new Pacific
order and reducing tensions between the two Koreas. "We do
not want North Korea to remain isolated," he said.
   Both the South Koreans and the Soviets -- frosty
adversaries in four decades of mistrust -- now are hungry for
closer trade relations. But Soviet initiatives until now have
been stymied by the knowledge that any movement in that
direction would trouble the hard-line North Korean regime of
Kim Il Sung, who has maintained strong links with Moscow.
   Soviet-South Korean trade amounted to only $31 million in
1981, and bilateral relations were all but nonexistent as
recently as two years ago. They opened respective trade
offices only 14 months ago, and the Soviet consular office in
Seoul wasn't opened until April. But trade has been
increasing substantially, and before last night's
developments, the volume of trade was expected to reach $2
billion early in the 1990s.
   Mr. Gorbachev's meeting with the South Korean president
came at the end of a whirlwind, five-day U.S. tour that took
the Soviet leader to the White House, the Maryland mountains,
the plains of Minnesota and the Pacific coast. But when Mr.
Gorbachev returns to the Soviet Union with his trade,
environmental and defense pacts, he will be met with internal
political disputes, ethnic passions, food shortages and
economic distress.
   In his last day here, Mr. Gorbachev, who has pursued "new
structures" in his drive for perestroika at home, called on
Americans to join him in developing "new structures" in
international relations.
   The Soviet leader urged the U.S. and the Soviet Union to
move away from the "twin antipathies" of the West and East
blocs. "They divided countries and peoples much more than
they united them," he told students at Stanford University.
   His final day included tea and sympathy with former
President Reagan and Nancy Reagan, a stroll through Stanford,
a drive through the storied hills of San Francisco and more
of the impromptu sidewalk street seminars that have marked
the Soviet leader's U.S. journeys.
   Though the metaphor was mixed, the message that animated
almost every public moment of the Gorbachev tour was clear:
"The winds are now blowing," Mr. Gorbachev told members of
the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon,
"filling the sails of the process that places us on the path
of cooperation."
   Indeed, the thrust of Mr. Gorbachev's appeal yesterday was
to stress the challenges the Soviet Union faces in battling
"old thinking," to assert that he had "no illusions as to the
possibility of the faster rapprochement of our societies,"
and to argue that the Western alliance itself would have to
evolve to match changes that have occurred since the Iron
Curtain shredded across Europe.
   "Everyone must change," he said.
   But Mr. Gorbachev, who began his mission as a
commander-in-chief with geopolitics on his mind, concluded it
as a chief executive with investment on his mind -- and
revealed himself to be as shrewd a businessman as he is a
rhetorician.
   "We are now watching those who maybe are risking something
but willing to cooperate and watching those who sit on the
sidelines," he told the business executives. "Those who
cooperate with us will obtain many more opportunities in our
market. Those who stand on the side will stay there."
   Mr. Gorbachev said the Soviet Union is moving more rapidly
toward a convertible ruble and assured his audiences that, in
all sectors of society, "we are changing in a serious way and
not just sweeping the yard."
   Declaring that the Cold War "is now behind us," Mr.
Gorbachev told the Stanford students that setting aside the
"exhausting and dangerous confrontation" of the postwar era
would enable the Soviet Union to proceed down its new
economic path. "As Soviet-American relations improve," he
said, "military procurement and participation in the arms
race will become a thing of the past."
   Mr. Reagan emerged from his 45-minute meeting with the
Soviet president with the conclusion that there "have been
improvements" in U.S.-Soviet relations since Mr. Reagan left
office only 16 months ago. "I'm pleased with all that's taken
place," he said, expressing the hope that "it's going to
continue."
   As Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev -- one a doctrinaire
anti-Communist for most of his life, the other a doctrinaire
Marxist-Leninist for most of his -- spoke in the elegant
brick Soviet consulate in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of
San Francisco, their wives met separately.
   Mrs. Reagan said the meeting with Raisa Gorbachev -- who
was later pictured lingering at a display of bananas, oranges
and Snickers bars -- went well, and that she had an easy
rapport with the woman she once regarded as something of a
socialist ice queen. "There has been a great misunderstanding
about our relationship," she said.

   NEW YORK -- Americans increased charitable and
philanthropic contributions last year 10.4%, as individuals
continued to be the largest source of giving, said the Trust
for Philanthropy.
   Contributions by individuals rose 11.7% to more than $96.4
billion. Corporate contributions rose 4.2% to $5 billion.
Contributions by foundations rose 8.9% to $6.7 billion while
bequests of estates were flat at $6.57 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Total giving amounted to $114.7 billion. The 1988 total,
which is revised, was $103.87 billion. The trust said that
after adjusting for inflation, overall contributions still
rose 5.5% and individual giving rose by 6.7%, but corporate
giving fell 0.5% and bequests fell 4.5%. Foundation grants
increased an inflation-adjusted 4%.
   The trust, established by the American Association of Fund
Raising Counsel to track charitable and philanthropic giving,
attributed the growth in individual giving to several things:
a jump in personal income of nearly 9%, an average increase
of 21% in stock prices and growing public awareness of of
causes such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
homelessness and environmental crises. Individual giving has
outpaced inflation almost every year since 1955, when the
trust began monitoring such trends.
   Religion was the main beneficiary. About $54.3 billion, or
nearly half of the total contributions, went to religious
organizations or religious-affiliated social services, up
nearly 13% from 1988.

   NASD Mulls Plan
   To Require Brokers
   To Requalify in Test

   WASHINGTON -- The self-regulatory agency for the
over-the-counter market is considering a plan to require
securities brokers to requalify by examination every three
years.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers is calling
for public comment on the plan, which would exempt brokers
who already are registered when the program begins.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We don't envision this as a back-to-the-basics exam,"
said Ronald E. Buesinger, vice chairman of the NASD and
director of the securities firm A.G. Edwards Inc.'s division
that handles personnel and training. "This is kind of an
update test, focusing on new" rules, regulations, securities
products and tax laws.
   NASD has been working on the plan with the North American
Securities Administrators Association, which includes the
securities agencies of all 50 states. And the states have
been cracking down on incompetence and wrongdoing in the
securities field, particularly in the penny-stock industry.
   Lee Polson, executive director of the administrators
group, said that the states "have been increasingly
requiring" professionals "to demonstrate professional
competence." He says, "If it's good for the doctors and
lawyers, why isn't it good for the . . . broker-dealers" as
well.
   He noted that a number of states were developing their own
requirements specifically for the securities industry. "It
would be better to have a single across-the-board proposal,"
allowing for more-uniform measurement of competence, Mr.
Polson said.
   The plan proposes that if a broker fails a recertification
test four consecutive times, the broker's registration would
be revoked and he or she would have to pass the required
entry-level exams for new brokers.
   Mr. Buesinger said comments will be taken for 60 days. If
the NASD board and Securities and Exchange Commission approve
the plan, the agency hopes to implement the plan beginning
Jan. 1, 1991, he said. If that happens, the first exam would
be administered in calendar year 1993, he said.

   Adweek's New Parent a Threat to Ad Age

   Adweek magazine's purchase by Affiliated Publications,
which already owns a stable of entertainment and media
titles, could pose a threat to its hulking arch-competitor,
Advertising Age, industry executives say.
   Adweek's troubled parent, A/S/M Communications, agreed to
sell an 80% stake to Affiliated last week after months of
mounting financial woes. Terms weren't disclosed, but
industry executives say Affiliated paid about $17 million for
the stake, and took on about an equal amount of debt.
Affiliated is known as a savvy publisher whose properties
include the Boston Globe as well as Billboard, Backstage, and
the Hollywood Reporter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The purchase appears to put Adweek, which was well on its
way to becoming an also-ran, on far more even footing with
Advertising Age, one of several publications owned by Crain
Communications. The dueling ad trade magazines had been
fighting a particularly uneven battle in recent months. In an
overambitious expansion bid, A/S/M had loaded up on debt and
launched about half a dozen spinoffs of Adweek, stretching
the magazine's staff thin.
   The mounting debt prompted cash flow problems so severe
that paychecks were delayed once, and ultimately several
publications were shut down. The 12-year-old flagship
publication, which has always lagged behind Ad Age in ad
pages, appeared to be falling even further behind.
   The toll on the Adweek staff was evident in the magazine,
some industry executives contend. Adweek "has weakened"
editorially, asserts Martin Walker, a magazine analyst with
Periodical Studies Service. In recent weeks, the magazine saw
the resignation of its managing editor, Stewart Alter, and
the reshuffling of other staffers. But with Affiliated's cash
infusion and expertise, Adweek will be able to offer
"stronger competition for Ad Age," says Mr. Walker. "It will
prevent Ad Age from rolling over Adweek. It's a very good
move."
   Some changes are already in the works. For starters,
Affiliated executives say, they will make Adweek a part of
the company's fledgling entertainment newswire service, which
offers newspapers stories from Billboard, Backstage and
others. Adweek also hopes to explore other electronic media,
says Kenneth Fadner, an A/S/M co-founder who remains the
company's president and chief executive officer. Adweek and
the other publications could also share some stories, the way
Ad Age occasionally picks up news items from sister
publications such as Automotive News.
   Affiliated is known for its strong track record in
building circulation and in marketing, both of which should
help Adweek. Art Kingsbury, an Affiliated executive vice
president, adds that the firm's investment should help calm
distracted staffers and bolster fading morale. "There has
been a lot of uncertainty generated from the publicity of the
last six months," he says. "Hopefully this acquisition will
eliminate the uncertainty in terms of financial liability,
which will be good for the staff."
   Both publications still face an ad environment that is
nothing short of miserable. Advertising pages at both
magazines have been falling since 1985. The media companies
and magazines who are the ad trades' bread and butter have
severely curtailed or even stopped advertising in the trades.
Their exit, prompted by restructurings, mergers and their own
soft ad revenue, leaves Adweek and Ad Age fighting for a
share of a shrinking pie.
   Between 1985 and 1988, Advertising Age's ad pages slid
18%, according to Media Industry Newsletter. Adweek fared
even worse: Its ad pages dropped 30%. Last year, Adweek's
pages dropped 2%, to about 1,578, while Advertising Age's
pages dropped 8.8%, to about 2,477, according to Space
Analysis Systems. At its 1967 peak, Ad Age logged 4,200 ad
pages.
   At Affiliated, not surprisingly, senior executives are
betting that the slump will soon end. "Our view is that this
slowdown may continue on for another year or so, but that it
will come back like all cycles come back," says Mr.
Kingsbury.
   But some industry executives believe the slump is
permanent. Looking back at the trades' ad-filled pages of
years past, Lee Fredericks of Space Analysis says: "I
seriously doubt you'll ever see that again. There's more of a
mentality out there {among magazines} that you don't need to
advertise."
   Rance Crain, Ad Age's editor-in-chief, diplomatically says
he welcomes the tougher competition, and says Ad Age may even
learn a thing or two from watching Adweek's new foray into
electronic media.
   But he says that "neither of us will prosper unless the
entire advertising market is expanded," by wooing new
advertisers like computer software, travel or even consumer
products companies. "I don't think the way to make a buck in
the long range is to try to steal our business," he says. "In
the long range, the way to make a buck is to expand the pie."

   Joe Isuzu to Get Boot

   American Isuzu Motors is giving Joe Isuzu, that
pathological liar, the boot. Honest.
   The car maker said it will drop the humorous but sometimes
controversial pitchman this August, when it begins
introducing its 1991 model year cars.
   The four-year-old campaign, created by Della Femina,
McNamee WCRS, Los Angeles, was made popular by actor David
Leisure. The campaign made the guy a star, and the
commercials helped land him a role on "Empty Nest," an NBC
sitcom.
   The Joe Isuzu character sparked controversy among some
dealers who believed the ads undermined the credibility of
their salesmen in the showroom. Isuzu says it plans to focus
more on product specifications.
   "The intent with Joe Isuzu was to gain name recognition in
the marketplace," says Leon Rosen, Isuzu's national marketing
manager. "It did that successfully."

   Canada's Leaders
   Fail to Resolve
   Impasse on Plan

   OTTAWA -- Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the
ten provincial premiers will resume talks this morning in a
bid to resolve Canada's constitutional impasse after making
only limited progress yesterday.
   Mr. Mulroney said last night that a federal government
proposal designed to end the impasse "found a large measure
of acceptance." But two of the three provincial premiers who
have been blocking ratification of a package of amendments to
the Canadian constitution said the new federal plan didn't
satisfy their demands.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday evening's negotiations followed preliminary
discussions Sunday and yesterday morning during which the
provincial leaders set out their positions on the package of
amendments, known as the Meech Lake accord.
   Three provinces, Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Manitoba
refuse to ratify the Meech Lake accord as is. The accord is
supported by the other seven provinces and the federal
government.
   New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna said the new federal
proposal "in substance meets most or all of the concerns" of
his province. Mr. McKenna said that if a few details are
ironed out to his satisfaction New Brunswick is now prepared
to ratify the Meech Lake accord.
   But the two other holdout provinces didn't budge.
Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said "I'm quite unhappy
with" the federal plan. Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon said: "I
really didn't see any tangible progress."
   The constitutional deadlock has revived independence talk
in French-speaking Quebec. Many Quebeckers have taken as a
rebuff to their province the widespread opposition of
English-speaking Canadians to the Meech Lake accord, which
would recognize Quebec as a "distinct society" within Canada.
Such a designation would be used by the courts in
interpreting the constitution, but wouldn't give Quebec any
new legislative powers, federal officials said.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa reiterated last night that
he wouldn't accept any changes to the Meech Lake accord. But
he said the new federal proposal "wasn't controversial for
Quebec" and dealt mostly with matters to be discussed in
future rounds of constitutional negotiations once the Meech
Lake accord is ratified.
   The Meech Lake accord, which was negotiated three years
ago at Meech Lake, Quebec, has to be ratified by all
provincial legislatures by a legal deadline of June 23 if it
is to take effect.
   Besides the "distinct society" clause, Manitoba and
Newfoundland object to a measure that would give each
province a veto over reform of the federal Senate, an
appointed body. Newfoundland and Manitoba fear such a veto
would rule out their goal of smaller provinces, like
themselves, achieving greater influence over federal policies
through a reformed Senate.
   Mr. Bourassa reaffirmed yesterday that Senate reform
should require the unanimous approval of all provinces
because such reform would affect provincial powers.
Currently, Quebec and Ontario have the largest representation
in the Senate. Most reform proposals would give each province
equal representation in the Senate such as exists in the U.S.
Senate.
   Mr. Mulroney said the Meech Lake dispute now "centers
around the {Senate} amending formula." But several premiers
said the "distinct society" clause, the other major sticking
point, wasn't discussed yesterday, adding that it would
probably would be on the agenda today. Quebec officials
repeated that the clause is "untouchable."

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Use of Free-Enterprise Philosophy
   Is Urged for Reform of Public Schools
   ----
   By Kenneth H. Bacon
   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
</HL>

</SO>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- After a decade of costly and largely
unsuccessful efforts to improve schools, educational
reformers are beginning to push for fundamental -- and
politically difficult -- changes in the way public schools
are run.
   Liberals are joining conservatives in calling for an
infusion of free-enterprise philosophy that would shake up
the nation's school systems and provide more choices for
parents and students.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Conservatives contend that primary and secondary schools
are too paralyzed by bureaucracy to improve themselves. Only
market incentives to succeed and penalties for failure will
force the restructuring necessary to improve schools, they
argue. They say the best way to provide these incentives is
to give parents a choice among schools and a voucher system
that would enable them to send their children to the best
school they can find. Good schools would thrive while bad
schools would fail, they contend.
   Liberals, frustrated by efforts to improve schools, are
beginning to embrace market incentives as well. Albert
Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
has proposed giving schools new freedom to innovate by
releasing them from most regulations and then paying bonuses
to staff members in schools that show the most improvement
over five years. "Systems that have totally ignored financial
incentives haven't worked," he says.
   This week the Brookings Institution, a think tank here,
will issue a report that recommends abolishing the
distinction between public and private schools and giving
parents the right and the money to choose any school they
want for their children. In their report, "Politics, Markets
and America's Schools," political scientists John Chubb of
Brookings and Terry Moe of Stanford University propose "a new
system of public education that eliminates most political and
bureaucratic control over the schools and relies instead on
indirect control through markets and parental choice."
   Such a recommendation from Brookings, considered a liberal
redoubt, shows the changing politics of the education reform
movement. "It's going to have a tremendous impact on the
whole debate on education choice," says Jeanne Allen of the
conservative Heritage Foundation. Until now, she says, "the
movement for educational choice has been conveyed as
something that right-wing conservatives dreamed up."
   In the 1980s, most states set stricter graduation
requirements and poured money into schools to boost salaries
and improve teaching. But the results have been
disappointing. The dropout rate remains close to 30%, average
test scores haven't risen, and employers and colleges
complain that many high-school graduates aren't
well-educated.
   "Now it's becoming apparent that the very organization of
the school is a problem," says Thomas Kean, who became
president of Drew University this year after eight years of
leading the nation in education-reform efforts as governor of
New Jersey. Because educational bureaucracies resist change,
"you can't tinker at the edges," he says. "You have to go to
the center, and when you do that, some people are going to be
upset. You get into hard, difficult decisions" about the
powers of unions, school boards and legislatures.
   Increasingly, critics compare U.S. public schools to an
unresponsive socialist economy. "The public school is
America's collective farm," says Lewis Perelman of the Hudson
Institute, a conservative think tank. "Innovation and
productivity are lacking in American education for basically
the same reasons they are scarce in Soviet agriculture:
absence of competitive, market forces."
   Ted Sanders, President Bush's undersecretary of education,
says, "The whole notion that we can hold institutions
responsible by creating bureaucracies is irrational; it just
doesn't work." He predicts that "there are going to be major
shifts in power" away from politicians and bureaucrats as
teachers, principals and parents gain more control over how
schools are run.
   Only strong incentives for success and penalties for
failure will force schools to strive for the management
restructuring and renewal that many U.S. corporations had to
undertake to survive foreign competition in the 1980s, Mr.
Shanker argues.
   The Brookings study concentrates on expanding parental
choice to send children to any school they want. Each school,
public or private, would be able to determine its governing
structure and establish its admissions standards, curriculum
and operating philosophy.
   Choice has become a buzzword of the education reform
movement. Currently, eight states have enacted plans that
allow parents to send their children to any public school
they choose, but Mr. Chubb argues that these plans don't go
far enough.
   "Public-school choice, by the time it gets adopted, is
sort of Soviet-style choice," Mr. Chubb says, asserting that
although children can move from one school to another, all
the schools are basically the same. "Choice is politically
attractive when it is not designed to do much," Messrs. Chubb
and Moe write. "But when it's designed to get to the root of
the problem -- when it seeks to liberate the schools by means
of a thorough transformation of public institutions -- it
generates fierce opposition from every nook and cranny of the
educational establishment."
   This is what's happening in Wisconsin, which recently
enacted a novel law that will allow 1,000 children from
low-income families in Milwaukee to attend private schools
with as much as $2,500 a year in tuition assistance from the
state. Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and Polly Williams, a
Democratic legislator who managed Jesse Jackson's
presidential campaign in Wisconsin, pushed through the plan
to expand education choices for innercity students. But
Herbert Grover, the state superintendent of public
instruction, opposes the law, and education unions recently
went to court to block the plan.
   The Milwaukee program emerged from public outrage over the
quality of schools. Kentucky, by contrast, overhauled its
education system in response to a court order. The law passed
this year stresses incentives. Successful schools will get
more money, while the state will send in teams to upgrade
failing schools. In an effort to attack the nepotism that
permeated the Kentucky school system, the law requires all of
the approximately 800 employees of the state department of
education to resign on June 30, 1991, and imposes new rules
on local school boards.
   "You've got to have guts" to make such fundamental changes
in the way schools are run, says Chris Pipho of the Education
Commission of the States. "There are ticking time bombs all
over the state."
   But former Gov. Kean of New Jersey believes only
fundamental changes that make schools more responsive to
parents and students will make it possible for the U.S. to
meet the ambitious education goals, such as world leadership
in math and science, that President Bush and the governors
have set for the year 2000. "The second wave of education
reform is going to take even more courage than the first,"
Mr. Kean says.

   Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher in light trading,
helped by a minor rally in shipbuilding and construction
stocks, traders said.
   But dealers lacked incentive to push the market
aggressively, and institutions and individual investors were
unenthusiastic about trading stocks on the first section,
observers said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, London stocks were lifted off their intraday
lows at the close of quiet trading, with the market shadowing
the fortunes of Wall Street.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 34.25 points to
32925.37, after falling 239.68 points Friday.
   At midmorning Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index had
advanced 25.27 points to 32950.64.
   Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 650
million shares, down from 709.1 million shares Friday.
Advancers outnumbered losers 521 to 417, while 188 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section added 0.69 point, or 0.03%, to 2427.24. The
index fell 9.19 points Friday.
   The second section index rose 18.32 points, or 0.46%, to
3992.94, after advancing 36.34 points Friday. Volume was
estimated at slightly less than 20 million shares, down from
29.3 million shares Friday.
   Interest in the second section remains strong, one trader
at a foreign securities firm said, because recent earnings
results offered attractive growth opportunities.
   Moreover, prices on the second section are seen as easier
to urge higher, another trader at a Japanese firm said.
   With the exception of May 25 and May 28, the second
section index has risen since April 26. From the recent low
of 3313.92 points April 5, the index has recovered 20.5%.
   The rebound compares with a 17.6% recovery on the Nikkei
Index since its recent low of 28002.07 points April 2, and a
17.9% recovery on the Topix since its recent low of 2058.82
points April 5.
   Reduced commission tables, which became effective
yesterday, were one reason for fundamental softness in the
first section, as well as another explanation for the second
section index's strength, one trader pointed out.
   Dealers probably were chasing large-capital issues, such
as shipbuilding, construction and mining shares, in order to
improve volume, and conceivably to make up for the decrease
in their commissions, he said.
   On the other hand, institutions, who have just finished
reevaluating their book losses for the year ended March 31,
would only increase costs by participating in the first
section at current prices, the trader said.
   As a result, institutions have been selectively
participating in the higher-potential second section issues,
as well as in better-performing Osaka Stock Exchange second
section issues and over-the-counter shares, analysts said.
   Market reaction to U.S.-Soviet Union discussions
concerning a united Germany's possible membership in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been indecisive, as
should be expected because the talks likewise were
inconclusive, traders said.
   The dollar firmed against the yen, but foreign-exchange
market response to the talks was also limited, equity traders
indicated.
   Stock market participants are seeking a clearer move in
currency rates before they will establish speculative
positions on the U.S.-Soviet Union talks, traders said.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's scheduled East Asian
visit, meanwhile, is expected to stimulate a firmer response
from the stock market, the traders added.
   Despite some afternoon selling pressure, steel stocks
ended mostly higher.
   Daido Steel rose 26 yen to 989 yen (17 cents to $6.52),
Nisshin Steel added 10 yen to 990 yen and Tokyo Steel
advanced 200 yen to 4200 yen.
   Oil stocks slipped on profit-taking, as Showa Shell fell
30 yen to 1320 yen, and Teikoku Oil Co. dropped 10 yen to
1270 yen.
   In London, the slightly weaker pound kept the market under
pressure. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index
gained 7.6 points to 2379.
   Dealers said that London lost some of its recent steam, as
the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered slightly under the
psychologically important level of 2900 late in the London
afternoon.
   "We've had such an amazing run, we would expect to see a
period of consolidation," said one trader.
   Some investors were reportedly distrustful of the recent
sharp rally and weren't prepared to commit further funds to
the market. Yesterday's volumes were consequently depressed,
although start-of-the-week trading is typically slow.
   Volume was 430 million shares, slightly under the 499.3
million shares Friday.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 11 points to
1893.4, while in the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100
index contract ended at 2422, compared with Friday's close of
2411.
   The market was also slightly depressed by afternoon
suggestions that the food retail sector might start having
supply problems. One unidentified retailer reportedly
complained that its supplies were being disrupted, suggesting
that other large retailers Argyll, Sainsbury and Tesco, might
undergo similar difficulties.
   However, this situation couldn't be confirmed with the
individual companies. Argyll was off 6 pence to 234 pence (11
cents to $4.44), Sainsbury eased 4 pence to 290 pence, while
Tesco was off 6 pence at 223 pence.
   Among stocks to fall, Enterprise Oil posted the biggest
losses. It fell 17 pence to 648 pence as speculation fades
that Elf Aquitaine will mount a bid for the company.
   Boots was up 13 pence to 310 pence, with its earnings
later this week expected to include news that the company's
heart drug, Manoplax, is selling well.
   Meanwhile, markets were closed in Belgium, West Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden for Whit
Monday. Prices in Milan fell, while South African gold stocks
fell sharply.
   Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Sydney and Seoul; lower
in Singapore, Manila and Taipei; and mixed in Hong Kong.
Wellington was closed.

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)
CONGRESS (CNG)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Alfred C. Sikes expressed doubts that Hollywood's major
studios and the broadcast networks will be able to reach a
compromise on easing regulations that block the networks from
the lucrative rerun-sales business.
   The FCC chairman's comments signaled the increasing
likelihood that the panel will intervene and impose its own
solution in the battle over the so-called Financial Interest
and Syndication Rules. The 20-year-old regulations bar the
three major broadcast networks from the $3 billion-a-year
syndication business, largely dominated by the Hollywood
studios.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both sides have been locked in fruitless talks aimed at
crafting their own joint plan for lifting or weakening the
FCC regulations. But they remain far apart over even the
simplest of issues: whether the FCC should extend its own
June 14 deadline for reaching a settlement.
   Bob Daly, chairman of Warner Bros. studio, a Time Warner
Inc. unit, and the leader of the Hollywood negotiating team,
said some progress is being made and asked for a deadline
extension. FCC Chairman Sikes said he would grant one if both
sides requested it. But network negotiators balked at the
idea.
   "We see no need for an extension at this point," said Rick
Cotton, general counsel at National Broadcasting Co., a unit
of General Electric Co. "If the two parties can't agree on
even an extension, they're unlikely to agree on anything."
   "We don't want to take the pressure off them," said
Stephen A. Weiswasser, another network negotiator and the
general counsel of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. "There is time" to
reach a settlement, he added. "The question is one of will."
   The networks are still in bitter disagreement with
Hollywood producers, who supply most prime-time programs,
over such central issues as how the networks might be allowed
to acquire a partial ownership stake in the studios' shows;
and whether the networks might be allowed to enter the
foreign syndication business.
   Indeed, the two sides couldn't even concur yesterday on
how their talks are faring. Mr. Daly, flanked by other top
studio executives at a press conference here, said the
studios had made some key concessions including a new
willingness to sell the networks a partial ownership stake in
television series. Studio executives also said the issue of
foreign syndication of programs made overseas wasn't a
critical issue for their network rivals.
   "Baloney," countered Mr. Cotton of NBC in a news
conference later yesterday. He said foreign syndication
remains a crucial item on the networks' list of demands and
that they want the same freedom to do "what the Sonys and the
Time-Warners of the world can do now."
   Top brass from both sides of the rerun fight met with the
FCC chairman yesterday to review the talks. Mr. Sikes last
March had told them the FCC would take up the rerun
restrictions by June 14 unless they could reach a compromise
advising how the rules should be eased. He had banned all
lobbying of the FCC on the issue in the meantime, setting
yesterday as a one-day exception.
   The meeting made it clear there wasn't much to "make me
optimistic a resolution will be reached by June 14," though
11th-hour accords do occur, the FCC chairman said in a
statement.
   The latest clash came as NBC, hosting its annual
convention here for executives of 200-plus affiliated
stations, prepared for its broadest attack yet on the rerun
rules. Today, the station executives will descend on Capitol
Hill to meet with their local congressional delegations. They
will carry videotaped presentations and argue in favor of
lifting the rerun rules, a move that wouldn't provide any
extra money for the local stations they manage.
   Despite such high-profile assaults, some executives on
both sides of the rerun dispute maintain they could still
manage a last-minute compromise to forestall unilateral
action by the FCC.
   Mr. Weiswasser of ABC said the studios may be ready to
bend on some aspects of the rules, though any settlement must
be more far-reaching than the studios are proposing. Warner
Bros.' Mr. Daly said the two sides are making some headway on
basic concepts, such as new provisions that would block the
networks from demanding a share of rerun sales as the price
for picking one new series over another.

   Rate for First Period, Which
   Excludes Farm Workers,
   Is the Worst Since 1981

   WASHINGTON -- The productivity of U.S. business plummeted
in the first three months of this year at a far steeper rate
than the government initially reported. At the same time,
business costs escalated much faster.
   After reviewing new data, the Labor Department said
productivity, excluding that of farm workers, plunged at a
2.7% annual rate in the first quarter, not at the 1% rate the
department originally calculated. That marked the biggest
decline since the fourth quarter of 1981, when the country
was in a recession. In last year's fourth quarter non-farm
productivity edged up at a 0.5% annual rate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, the cost of producing a unit of output --
whether it was a television set or a financial service --
jumped at a 7% annual rate for nonagricultural businesses,
the department said. In an advance report, the agency had
calculated that unit labor costs rose at a 4.5% rate during
the period. These costs grew at a 5.5% annual rate in the
fourth quarter.
   The deep revisions disturbed economists, although they
have been worried for some time about the nation's inability
to make significant advances in productivity.
   "I thought it was a dismal report," said Allen Sinai,
chief economist at Boston Co. in New York.
   Gains in productivity -- or output per hour worked -- are
vital to continued economic growth. The more workers produce
per hour, the better businesses are able to compete across
the globe. Improving productivity is also critical to raising
the country's living standards because it allows businesses
to boost wages without forcing a corresponding increase in
prices or cut in profits.
   As they have for some time, the numbers showed that most
of the country's productivity problems are centered in the
economy's vast services sector. Manufacturing productivity,
which is far more precisely measured, actually improved even
more than the big jump the government calculated in its
advance report. It grew at a 4.9% annual rate instead of
4.1%, the department said. The fourth quarter rate of
increase was 3.1%
   Partly because of the big gains in output per hour, it
cost manufacturers less to produce their wares during the
period. Manufacturers' unit labor costs declined at a 1.3%
annual rate in the first quarter, a bigger drop than the 0.9%
rate the government initially calculated. Unit labor costs of
manufacturers rose at a 3.7% annual rate in the fourth
period.
   That, at least, pleased economists. "Manufacturing is
finally showing the benefits of a year of cost-cutting and
employee cutbacks," Mr. Sinai said. "The non-manufacturing,
non-farm sector, which largely includes services, is where
the dismal record lies both on productivity growth and unit
labor costs."
   Generally the deep downward revisions reflected the fact
that the gross national product -- the country's total output
of goods and services -- was smaller in the first quarter
than the government initially believed. The Commerce
Department regularly makes revisions to its estimate of the
GNP as it gathers more information. Based on new data the
department reported earlier this month that the GNP grew at a
1.3% annual rate in the first quarter after adjusting for
inflation, instead of 2.1%.
   Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association
of Manufacturers, said the overall first-quarter productivity
figures weren't consistent with the GNP report and called
them "suspiciously low." He said "it would be reasonable to
expect further revisions either in these productivity numbers
or in the first-quarter GNP estimate."
   The Labor Department figured that the output of non-farm
businesses grew only at a 1% annual rate in the first quarter
instead of 2.7%. At the same time it estimated that hours
logged by workers rose at a 3.9% annual rate instead of 3.6%.
   The department also released its initial measure of the
productivity of nonfinancial businesses in the first quarter,
a category that covers all corporations doing business in the
U.S. except banks, brokers and finance and insurance
agencies. The results there were grim as well: Output per
hour dropped at a 2.1% annual rate. The department will
revise those figures in the next few months. In the fourth
quarter, productivity of nonfinancial business fell at a 0.6%
annual rate.
   Including farms, which economists believe is a less
precise indicator of pressures in the economy, overall
business productivity tumbled at a 2.1% annual rate last
quarter, according to the new report, instead of the 0.5%
rate of decline originally calculated. In the fourth quarter
business productivity edged up 0.4%.
   All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.

   Justices Expand State Obligation to Give
   Retroactive Relief for Illegal Taxation

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court expanded the obligation of
states to provide retroactive relief to taxpayers who paid
state taxes that were later found to be unconstitutional.
   The justices ruled, 9-0, that when state taxes are found
to violate established legal principles, such as existing
federal laws or court precedents, a state must give taxpayers
retroactive relief. In such cases, the state should have
known its tax was unconstitutional, the court said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But in a second decision, a divided court ruled, 5-4, that
when a decision that a state tax is unconstitutional is based
on a change in the law, then the state's liability for
correcting the tax isn't retroactive.
   Even when retroactive relief is required, however, that
doesn't necessarily mean refunds, the court said. In the
unanimous ruling, the court said that when taxes discriminate
among different groups of taxpayers, a state must either
provide refunds or assess higher back taxes against those who
benefited from the illegal tax.
   The net effect of the two decisions is a defeat for the
states and may cost them billions of dollars if they decide
to pay refunds in a wide range of cases in which taxes were
declared unconstitutional. The precise impact won't be
determined until the states examine the rulings and until
additional court rulings in other cases apply the decisions
to other taxes.
   "The court has given very clear guidance with respect to
the obligations of states to give meaningful relief to
taxpayers," said Walter Hellerstein, a University of Georgia
Law School professor who was a lawyer for one of the parties
in yesterday's rulings.
   Prior to the rulings, the Multistate Tax Commission, a
group of state tax officials, warned last summer that the two
cases potentially could cost some 30 states where taxes have
been declared unconstitutional about $6.5 billion in refunds.
The actual figure is certain to be much lower, given the
limits the court placed on retroactivity. But there may still
be substantial refunds by the states because local lawmakers
may find refunds politically more palatable than increased
back taxes.
   In the unanimous decision, written by Justice William
Brennan, the court required the state of Florida to
retroactively remedy an unconstitutional liquor tax that was
challenged by McKesson Corp., a San Francisco distributor.
The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the tax interfered with
interstate commerce by favoring liquor made with Florida
products. But the Florida court declined to order retroactive
relief.
   In the second case, the high court refused to make
retroactive all decisions that invalidate state taxes that
are found to interfere with interstate commerce. The
decision, with no single majority opinion, was a victory for
five states in legal disputes with the American Trucking
Associations over highway taxes that discriminate against
out-of-state companies.
   Yesterday's ruling involved the Arkansas highway tax, but
other cases are pending in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New Jersey
and Vermont. The potential liability in the five states, if
the court had required retroactive refunds, was $630.9
million plus interest.
   In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, the
court said these states won't be liable for highway taxes
collected before June 1987, when the justices ruled that the
Pennsylvania tax discriminated in favor of trucking companies
based in the state. Before that date, the states had no
reason to know the taxes were unconstitutional, the court
said.
   The ruling means the five states aren't liable to remedy
the effects of the highway taxes collected before the 1987
decision. For four of the five states, that may eliminate
most of the liability because they stopped collecting their
taxes after Pennsylvania's tax was struck down. Only Arkansas
continued to collect its tax, placing the money in an escrow
account that is now likely to be refunded. Yesterday, the
American Trucking Associations said the ruling would still
entitle interstate truckers to $100 million in relief.
   The most closely watched tax dispute that may be affected
by yesterday's rulings involves an issue decided by the
Supreme Court last year. The high court ruled in March 1989
that Michigan unconstitutionally taxed the pensions of
retired federal employees while it exempted the pensions of
state workers. Lawsuits for refunds have been filed by former
federal workers in 24 states, with potential refunds totaling
$2 billion.
   Charles Rothfeld, who filed a brief for the State and
Local Legal Center representing a number of state and local
government groups, said, "It's not clear what the
implications of yesterday's rulings are" for the lawsuits
seeking refunds of taxes on federal pensions.
   Indeed, each state may reach its own decision about
whether to make the pensions ruling retroactive. But the high
court yesterday said the question of whether such rulings are
retroactive must be determined as a matter of federal law
not, as some states urged, based on the laws of individual
states.
   One indication of how those cases will come out may be
found in the separate opinions in the Arkansas highway tax
case yesterday. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurring
opinion saying he believes most court rulings should be fully
retroactive, although he wasn't willing to make the truckers'
refunds fully retroactive.
   Justice John Stevens dissented in the Arkansas highway tax
case, joined by Justices Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry
Blackmun. The dissenters said court decisions should be fully
retroactive to all cases filed within the state statute of
limitations period.
   If, as seems likely, the issue of whether the federal
pensions ruling should be applied retroactively comes back to
the high court, Justice Scalia and the four dissenters might
make up a majority to say that it should.

   Citicorp Will End
   Its Underwriting
   Of Municipal Issues

   NEW YORK -- In a further sign of Wall Street's ills,
Citicorp said it is ending its underwriting, distribution and
trading of municipal securities, a move that will cut 35 jobs
from its payroll.
   Instead, Citicorp will focus on offering so-called
derivative products -- instruments that enable issuers to
hedge interest-rate and other risks -- for bonds issued by
state and local governments.

   In an interview, Glen Sergeon, managing director for
Citicorp Securities Markets Inc., said: "To some extent, it
is an excess capacity issue. It's a marketplace where there
are a lot of players. We will focus on our strengths in
derivatives. It's the place where we have an advantage."
   Mr. Sergeon said the change won't affect various other
services offered to municipal issuers, including investment
agreements, short-term remarketing and distribution
agreements and various credit and liquidity services. He said
the company is attempting to place the 35 people in other
jobs.
   Citicorp is the latest big underwriter to defect from the
municipals market. In 1987, Salomon Brothers dropped its
municipals unit, amid complaints that the business's
profitability had deteriorated severely.
   The move also offers the latest evidence that Citicorp is
no longer attempting to be all things to all customers.
Instead, it is focusing on areas where it can make good
returns. So far, that has meant limiting its underwriting of
corporate debt securities, trimming its U.S. government bond
business, and emphasizing fee-generating activities in its
commercial real estate lending unit.
   The municipals market has been suffering from severe
competitive pressures since the passage of the 1986 tax act,
which placed a ceiling on the amount of tax-exempt bonds that
states can issue to support private activities, such as
housing developments.
   In 1986, the market's peak year, $222.2 billion in new
municipals went to market, and underwriters on average made
$20.95 for each thousand dollars of a bond's face value,
according to the Public Securities Association. By last year,
volume dwindled to $124.3 billion and the so-called spread
fell to $13.44 for each thousand dollars in face value.
   Citicorp last year ranked 16th in long-term municipal
underwritings. In 1987, Citicorp got permission from the
Federal Reserve Board to underwrite some types of municipal
securities that had previously been off-limits to commercial
banks.
   Andrew Nybo, a research analyst for the securities
association, estimated that 1990 issuance will rise to $135
billion for the industry. Longer term, he said, volume will
climb as state and municipalities rebuild aging public
facilities and federal revenue sharing tails off.
   Citicorp's announcement came after the market closed. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Citicorp
closed at $24.375, up 37.5 cents.

MASS TRANSIT, BUS LINES, SUBWAYS, HIGHWAYS (TRA)
RAILROADS (RAI)
</IN>
<LP>
   In six weeks the first inner-city rail line to serve Los
Angeles in half a century is to open. The 22-mile trolley
between downtown and Long Beach is only an $871 million
start. Tunnels for a far more costly subway are being dug in
the central business district. And if California voters so
choose today, mass transit will lay tracks all over the state
for years to come.
   Two bond issues on the primary ballot aim to provide
locomotion. One, Proposition 108 from the governor and
Legislature, is tied to the fate of Proposition 111, a
measure to double the gasoline tax, hike truck fees 55% and
raise the limit on state spending. The other is Proposition
116, a more ambitious ($2 billion vs. $1 billion for Prop.
108) plan drawn up by fervent citizen-opponents of the auto
culture.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Californians are promiscuous in agreeing to bond issues,
so there's a good chance they'll be working on some sort of
railroad starting tomorrow. Whatever happens, this
megastate's choices are likely to affect national trends.
   The rush to rail is still on in some American cities,
despite horrendous cost overruns of the newer systems and
continued grief with the older ones. All the lines are
government owned, and not one pays for itself. Congestion
relief is a hidden gain, but more of it per dollar can be had
from other transit schemes, such as greater use of buses,
jitneys and high-speed lanes for group vehicles. Yet the case
for rail systems is consistently overstated at the time they
are chosen over alternative modes, as the accompanying table
shows.
   Still, even in California, rail romances politicians, the
press and much of the public. It seduced the San Francisco
area into a partly underground system 20 years ago, San Diego
a trolley line 10 years ago and Sacramento some street tracks
more recently. And motorist resistance is down -- 25%
population growth in the 1980s brought traffic delays real
and exaggerated. (Periodic planning-agency surveys of commute
times may reflect only drivers' worst memories.)
   Prop. 108, to be supplemented by clones slated for the
1992 and 1994 ballots, is the first major concession to rail
by the state Republican Party. Gov. George Deukmejian is on
the hook for it, co-authoring a ballot argument that shouts
it "will pave the way for A NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY." He likely
did this to obtain bipartisan backing for Prop. 111, which is
basically for road money he badly wants and has failed to get
otherwise.
   One might think, given the additional gallons of gas
bought for all the new autos crowding the state's highways,
that a static levy would suffice. But that doesn't seem to be
true. More fuel-efficient cars are one reason. Escalating
costs of maintenance as a road ages are another. Lots of
money goes to build sound barriers and relocate residents in
harm's way. Who knows where the billions in new federal
highway dollars have gone?
   So the statehouse cabal asks for road relief with a rail
kicker. At least Prop. 108's projects -- as yet unspecified
-- would be situated mostly in high-congestion corridors.
Prop. 116 is more expansive, with more than half of its
proceeds designated for long-distance travel between the
state's metropolises. An Orange County monorail (not in
Disneyland) and bicycle-commuter lanes also are included.
Every major gubernatorial candidate has his or her name on
this one, and visionaries on the left tout it as a way to
convert the defense industry to peace in our time.
   More-practical steps to mitigate traffic and the pollution
that goes with it are receiving increasing attention outside
the glare of politics. The Southern California-based Reason
Foundation recently brought together players from the ranks
of regulation, academia and business to discuss
incentive-based ideas, such as peak-hour pricing and
unsubsidized parking, that could alleviate congestion while
actually supplanting taxpayer dollars.
   It's debatable whether the road improvements of Prop. 111
would hasten more efficient traffic management. Michael
McGill, director of a powerhouse San Francisco civic group
that has emerged as a voice for market-oriented
transportation policies, favors Prop. 111 because it would
fund group-vehicle lanes, ramp meters and other half steps to
pricing, as well as better engineering. However, some
libertarians, along with the Sierra Club's LA chapter, argue
that forcing a supply crunch by not building more roads is
the best way toward alternatives.
   Meanwhile, near the congestion capital of downtown Los
Angeles sits a professor who disputes the whole notion that
traffic tie-ups are getting worse. Peter Gordon, director of
research at the University of Southern California's Planning
Institute for urban and regional affairs, maintains that
development sprawl and the flexibility of the personal car
allow individuals and employers to find their way around
jams. He points to local and national data showing shorter
commute times where suburb-to-suburb drives replaced
mass-transit trips to the central city. Artificial creation
of high-density corridors will retard this, he says.
   The reality of metro transportation may matter less than
an impression of crisis as Californians decide. They truly
may be dying to hop a commuter special, or simply wish others
to "share the joys of rail," as the Los Angeles Times gushed
in one of its weekly editorials backing the ballot measures.
   Whichever, with the only real action in the Democratic
primary this time, tax-and-spend items will be favored with a
sympathetic turn out.
   If both rail items pass, $3 billion in bonds will be
authorized making California the engine that could pull along
the nation. On the other hand, the ballot triangle could work
against rail if voters choose the more moderate Prop. 108
over Prop. 116, but don't approve the Prop. 111 gas-tax
increase on which 108 depends. It all gets as complicated as
a schedule at Grand Central Terminal . . . except the polls
should close on time.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Hoops in June? Bring the Finals Outside]

   Auburn Hills, Mich. -- Yeah, I know, NBA basketball has
been fantastic since Julius Erving demonstrated that man
could fly without tickets, but as I walked through the
parking lot at The Palace here on a sunny, breezy Sunday
afternoon last, before the Detroit Pistons-Chicago Bulls
playoff finale, it occurred to me that one change wouldn't
hurt. If the league insists on playing in June, it ought to
take the game outdoors.
   Think of the possibilities. You could have wind and
calm-air shooting specialists, and, like tennis, move the
show periodically among grass, dirt and concrete. Think of
the great arguments: "Sure, the Knicks are good on concrete,
but can they beat the Lakers on grass?" It would add new
dimensions to the sport.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Come to think of it, though, maybe it is that way already
except for the sunshine, and that stuff on the floors of
league arenas only looks like wood. How else to explain the
home-court advantage that has come to dominate the current
playoffs?
   When the Pistons dispatched the Bulls, 93-74, on Sunday,
they completed a sweep of the seven-game Eastern Conference
final for the home teams. In the Western section of the
semis, hosts proved equally inhospitable through game five
before the Portland Trailblazers ended the string by
eclipsing the Phoenix Suns, 112-109, at Phoenix on Thursday
night. And the Blazers mightn't have managed that if Kevin
Johnson, the do-everything Suns guard, hadn't retired in the
second quarter with a hamstring pull.
   For the playoffs as a whole, home teams won 53 of 67
games, which ought to give the league pause. Is someone
squeezing the basket rims on the visitors' ends, or, perhaps,
raising them a tad? "I've heard that said," said Piston guard
Vinnie Johnson, with mock seriousness, after Sunday's fray.
"Sometimes, it's seemed that way to me."
   "The noise here today {from the 21,454 Pistomanics in
attendance} was a big, big factor," offered Chuck Daly, the
winners' coach. "I haven't heard that kind of crowd noise
since we moved to this building" at the start of last season.
   He added: "For awhile there, I thought this was Chicago
Stadium." He must've noticed the difference when he didn't
hear the ubiquitous road-cry "Laimbeer ---s," in honor of
Bill, the ever-popular Pistons center.
   Whatever, something was working for Detroit. The defending
NBA champs, who'd been jammed, 109-91, in Chicago just two
days before, emerged from a close-played first quarter to
blitz the Bulls in quarter two, and never looked back. They
outscored Chicago 23-6 during the last eight minutes of the
first half to take a 15-point lead, and the visitors never
again got closer than 10.
   The Bulls hit on only 28 of 90 field goal tries, or 31%,
compared with a 48% mark in Home Sweet Home on Friday, so
maybe somebody was fiddling with their rims. Their 74 points
will enter the Pistons' record book for fewest points allowed
in a playoff game, no small matter for such a
defense-oriented club.
   If it wasn't for his highness, Michael Jordan, the Bulls
might have come close to being shut out. Jordan scored 31
points, six below his playoff average, but 21 more than
anyone else on his team, and he shot a respectable 13 of 27
from the field.
   After the Pistons' second-quarter surge produced their
commanding lead, Jordan seemingly decided to take them on
alone. From the start of the second half until the game's
dying minutes, he either scored or assisted on 32 of the
Bulls' 37 points. Then, inevitably, he pooped out, and
Detroit stretched its advantage from 82-70 to the final
count.
   "I saw my job as trying to take some of the pressure off
my teammates, hoping they'd feed off me," Jordan said. The
Pistons ate their lunch instead.
   First in the chow line was Isiah Thomas, the veteran
Detroit guard. He darted through the visitors for 21 points,
and had 11 assists and eight rebounds to boot. Daly later
called it Thomas's best game of the playoffs, and maybe of
the whole season. Isiah said he thought it was his best game
of this series, anyway, but he smiled when he said it.
   The Pistons' defensive stalwart was John Salley, their
lean, 6-foot-11 front-court reserve. He blocked five Bulls'
shots in the game, four of them during the second-quarter
run. Daly had substituted Salley and 6-6 forward Mark Aguirre
for the bulkier starting duo of Laimbeer and James Edwards,
and a couple of the Salley blocks led to Aguirre layups past
flat-footed Bulls on the other end.
   "Everything clicked" during the spurt, recalled Aguirre.
"We have 10- or 12-point runs all the time, but this one went
on and on. Picked a good time for it, didn't we?"
   And so the NBA finals will open with Detroit facing
Portland tonight, and it might be interesting to imagine it
on the various outdoor surfaces. The Blazers' swifties --
Clyde Drexler and Jerome Kersey -- probably would match
Thomas and Aguirre well on fast tracks like grass or
concrete, and their Clydesdales -- Buck Williams and Kevin
Duckworth -- would balance out Laimbeer and Edwards on slower
clay. The other guards, Portland's Terry Porter and Detroit's
Joe Dumars, seem like all-around fellas, good no matter
what's under foot.
   Alas, the series will be indoors, on wood. It will start
in Detroit and end there if it goes the full seven games, by
virtue of the Pistons' divisional championship. And if the
future repeats the past, therein will lie the edge. Asked if
he was glad to be in a third-straight championship round with
his mates, the 7-foot-1 Edwards said he was mostly glad he
wouldn't have to play again in Chicago until next fall.
   Aguirre put the matter in further perspective by noting
that a coming trip or two to the Great Northwest wouldn't
faze him. "We don't have to beat them there as long as we
beat them here," said he.

   Credulous Crapshooters,
   Here's a School for You

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Barton Giles, beaming in his sunny
Hawaiian shirt, leans over the green felt blackjack table to
rake in the chips bet by the novices he has just taken to the
cleaners. "None of you are losers -- just nonwinners," he
says in his well-rehearsed patter.
   The 36-year-old former stockbroker and Bible salesman
teaches gambling with free chips at the huge Tropicana Resort
&amp; Casino here. His students aren't croupiers-in-training, but
credulous crapshooters who don't know how. Or benighted
baccarat players. He teaches these games -- and roulette, too
-- to hotel guests in five well-attended sessions per day.
His students, many of them yuppies who have neglected this
important part of their education, are working up the nerve
to play the games and part with their money, which Mr. Giles
implies they almost surely will do.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He, meanwhile, gets more and more practice at his song and
dance. With a different script, he could easily enough be a
guide on the Jungle Cruise or the Circle Line. "So? You had
fun," Mr. Giles tells his students. "You could have gone to
Disney World, but who ever won money there?"
   Instructors like Mr. Giles at maybe 20 casinos here are
the industry's way of wooing this new generation of customers
who really don't know baccarat from ball bearings. The
casinos post signs to advertise the classes, held at the
gaming tables during off hours.
   "The first thing you have to learn," Mr. Giles says, "is
how to pronounce it -- bah-cah-RAH. Like Chevrolet. You'd
embarrass yourself if you told friends you just bought a new
Che-vro-lette. Same thing."
   Baccarat is a card game in which the hand is dealt from a
box called a shoe. "How scary is that? Playing with a shoe
box," Mr. Giles quips. Each player is dealt two cards and may
request more. The game is won by the player with cards that
add up to nine, or come closest. Tens and face cards count as
zero.
   There's a lot at stake for the house in this curriculum.
Blackjack, for instance, typically has a profit margin of
about 17% for the casinos, in contrast to only about 8% for
slot machines. But slots are the rage with today's
know-nothing gamblers, who are a far cry from the casino
clientele of yesteryear. "Twenty years ago," Mr. Giles
observes, one-armed bandits "were just a necessary evil to a
lot of casinos. They were around for the nickel players, and
to provide entertainment for the wives of men at the craps
tables," he says.
   William Dayton, vice president of marketing at the
Tropicana, says the slot glut threatens to "take all the
personality out of the casinos."
   Younger gamblers are comfortable with TV, video games and
automated teller machines. So slots, with elements of all
three, have an obvious appeal. On the other hand, "the table
games can cause performance anxiety," says Terry Knapp, a
psychologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
   That more bettors are passing up the tables is reflected
in the industry's bottom line. Revenue from slot machines in
Nevada has nearly doubled in the past six years, to $2.8
billion in 1989. Growth from table games in the same period
was a more modest 34%, to $1.8 billion. Revenue from slot
machines in the state first exceeded that of table games in
1984, and slots still are king.
   Thus Mr. Giles discusses gambling tactics, etiquette and
the lore of the games to entice newcomers to the tables'
smoky mystique. He passes out practice chips, rule booklets
and directions to the Tropicana's waterfall-fed pool, where
guests can swim right up to blackjack tables. "Hey, we're a
classy joint," he says.
   Mr. Giles tells six students nearest the table to place
practice chips in its betting circles. One man is stingy with
his bets, pulling a single worthless chip out of a huge stack
provided, gratis, by Mr. Giles. "Sir, you aren't buying
certificates of deposit here. Live a little," says the tutor,
drawing laughs from all around.
   He keeps up the easy, reassuring banter. "Don't be afraid
of doing the wrong thing at the tables. The dealers will help
if you aren't sure what to do. But keep your chips close in
case the lights go out," he says.
   Laurie Williams, a housewife from Indianapolis, clutching
a black vinyl purse, pleads, "Show us how to win."
   "That's the one thing they won't let me demonstrate," Mr.
Giles replies. The only sure way to win, he confides, is "Be
lucky."
   The casinos have a big advantage in every game, he admits.
He points to the new, $1 million, stained-glass ceiling over
the Tropicana's main room. "Our customers built that."
   The neon of Las Vegas beckoned to Mr. Giles in 1979. A
finance major at Michigan State University (where he dropped
out), he later quit a job selling securities at Olde &amp; Co. in
Detroit to learn still other ways of risking money. Enrolling
in an academy for gambling dealers seemed a natural step.
And, two years ago, he became an instructor at the Lady Luck.
He moved to the larger Tropicana in February. His bosses
won't let him divulge his salary, but instructors are said to
earn as much as $50,000 a year. Croupiers can make that much
or more, including tips.
   "I'm like Wayne Newton -- performing is part of this job,"
he says, shaking a pair of dice at his craps class. Craps is
the most complicated casino game: Its aircraft-carrier-shaped
tabletop is a maze of squares and oddly shaped outlines in
which chips are stacked for 11 varieties of bets. The
croupier hurriedly taps a hooked stick before raking in
casino wins. And, for luck, gamblers customarily yell out the
numbers or names of their bets.
   Gesturing theatrically with the croupier's stick, Mr.
Giles passes out lists of the odds on each type of craps bet.
But he tears his copy up and tosses it in the air. "You won't
remember all this, and you only need to know the simplest
bets to start having fun," he says. He explains the most
basic bet: Pass -- you win if the dice total 7 or 11, and you
lose on 2, 3 or 12. Other numbers are a standoff.
   "Learn by watching other people. Don't do what the
nonwinners do. Hey, you might even win."
   At the roulette lesson, standing by the gold-trimmed wheel
with its red and black numbered nooks, Mr. Giles says, "You
may have seen a movie scene where the heroine puts all her
chips on the one number. It keeps coming up and she screams
at the big pile of money in front of her. In real life, it's
usually different."
   Betting on one roulette number is a 35-to-1 chance, the
worst odds at any table game, Mr. Giles says. The likelier
strategy is placing each chip partially on at least two or
more numbers. The winnings are smaller, but you improve your
odds. He also recommends such conservative wagers as merely
betting that the roulette ball will land on a number that's
even or odd, or in a red or black nook.
   `Of course I would like to bet one number like they do in
the movies, but I couldn't afford to play for long," he says.
   He insists that his straight-talk approach to the basics
of gambling reflects a fundamental change in the way casinos
treat guests. "Ten years ago, the attitude at a lot of places
was, `Never give a sucker an even break.'" Now the house
wants you to know what you are up against. Then you might
play, and you will probably lose anyway.
   As an employee, Mr. Giles isn't allowed to gamble for his
own account at the Tropicana; he would have to go to another
casino to do that. He says he once was a heavy gambler but
isn't anymore. He has a wife and child to consider now, he
says. In the old days, he says, his biggest win ever was
about $12,000 in one day at craps. His biggest loss -- also
at craps: $3,000 in an hour one morning. "I just figure
breakfast cost $3,000 that day," he says.

   MagiCan'ts: How Coca-Cola Stumbled

   Why did Coca-Cola Co. can its MagiCans promotion?
   Maybe it had something to do with the bomb squad in San
Francisco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Early last month, toward the end of a United Airlines
flight from Chicago to San Francisco, a flight attendant
popped open an ordinary-looking can of Coca-Cola Classic. But
the attendant became suspicious when she tried to pour it,
and nothing came out. By the weight of the can, she could
tell something was in there.
   As soon as the plane landed, the crew immediately rushed
all the passengers off. The Coca-Cola can was whisked to a
remote area. The bomb squad was called out. Surrounding the
Coke can, the bomb technicians opened it -- and found a $10
bill.
   Although the technicians determined they didn't have a
bomb on their hands, it soon became evident that the people
at Coke did. Last week, under the crush of bad publicity
about defective cans, Coca-Cola confirmed that it had halted
distribution of the MagiCans, prize-filled cans randomly
mixed with real ones.
   But even as the last cans disappear from store shelves,
the demise of MagiCans only three weeks after their launch
doesn't signal the end of such promotions. Marketing experts
predict that innovative, high-tech promotions such as
MagiCans, which eject cash when popped open, probably will
increase because they serve one important purpose: cutting
through a glut of advertising.
   "There's got to be a stopper," says Jesse Meyers,
publisher of trade newsletter, Beverage Digest. "The stopper
of today and tomorrow {in soft drinks} is technology." As a
direct result of MagiCans' problems -- some 70 consumers have
called Coke to complain that their cans were broken -- Mr.
Meyers believes testing periods for such technically oriented
promotions will be lengthened from several weeks to several
months.
   What might the next big promotion be? Would you believe
MagiCans? Coke is so enamored of MagiCans' potential that it
has already considered relaunching the program in the future
-- perhaps later this year -- according to people familiar
with the company's plans. Before any definite decision is
made, the company is pursuing an investigation into every
structural, chemical and marketing aspect of the MagiCan
program.
   With solid double-digit sales gains in the first three
weeks of the promotion, the sources said, Coke is convinced
it still has a winner -- only a temporarily broken one.
Therefore, pulling the promotion early on may allow Coke to
limit damage that could thwart a relaunch of MagiCans.
   Coke didn't have any immediate comment on its plans.
   Coke's adventure with MagiCans -- the malfunctions, the
bomb scare, the big launch and the quick retreat -- may serve
well as a promotional primer, illustrating both marketing
mastery and missteps.
   It seemed an easy-to-understand, sure-fire blockbuster.
Instant-win cans. A buyer pops the top, and cash or
certificates for prizes immediately eject. But what seemed so
simple and exciting in concept proved to be less so in
reality.
   For starters, test markets in Iowa and Illinois last fall
indicated there could be problems. As designed, the cans were
supposed to yield one thing when opened: a prize. Instead of
the Coke beverage, the cans were filled with water (which was
supposed to be sealed off and inaccessible) to give the
MagiCan the feel of the real thing.
   But last fall at least one curious person in a market test
of the MagiCans had broken into a can to look at the prize
contraption. Despite that sign of trouble, one former Coke
employee involved with MagiCans says, "drinking the liquid .
. . was deemed such a long shot that it was a risk not fully
taken into consideration."
   The long shot, however, came through right away. In the
first week of the promotion, an 11-year-old Massachusetts boy
popped open his can, and because of a defect, drank some of
the water. (The water is harmless but foul-tasting.) The
boy's story set off a flood of negative publicity nationwide.
   Broken cans aside, Coke quickly learned that the concept
was difficult for consumers to understand. After TV ads
launched the MagiCans promotion, some consumers thought the
cash coming out of the cans in the commercials was simply a
metaphor, not to be taken literally.
   One person involved in the promotional plans said there
was so much enthusiastic discussion about MagiCans that Coke
lost sight of the fact that the cans were so unusual that
they required thorough explanation for the man on the street.
"We were just too close to it," says the individual. So Coke
began rejiggering the television ads to stress that there
really was cash in cans.
   Failing to fully recognize some of the pitfalls in advance
is a classic example, some marketing experts say, of falling
head over heels for a creative idea. "Once they fall in love
with it, it develops a life of its own, and there's no
stopping it," says Gary M. Stibel, a principal with the New
England Consulting Group, Westport, Conn.
   As soft-drink companies vie for consumer attention,
promotions are becoming riskier. Last summer, PepsiCo Inc.
got burned with an ad featuring rock star Madonna. Pepsi
yanked the spot under pressure from religious groups, who
were offended by a rock video Madonna had made (in which she
dances around burning crosses), even though the video was
unrelated to the Pepsi commercial.
   But marketers say tinkering with the actual product or
packaging of a consumer good that can be ingested requires
extraordinary caution. Pepsi says it had considered a similar
prizes-in-cans promotion last year, but opted against it,
partly because of worries that people might drink something
from a Pepsi can that they weren't supposed to.
   "When you are dealing with a food or beverage product,
even one failure in a million is unacceptable," says John
Lister, chief executive officer of Lister Butler Inc., a
brand and corporate identity concern based in New York.
   In Atlanta last month, frustrated Coke marketers shook
their heads as they watched videotapes of the Massachusetts
boy appearing on a local news show, and worried that the
publicity might damage the image of its flagship brand,
Coca-Cola Classic.
   With more than a dozen reports of broken mechanisms on
hand by the third week of May, Coke set about a massive
research effort to find out how many of the cans were broken.
By simply shaking the cans and listening for rattles, the
company determined that fewer than 1% of the cans were
broken. The company issued a news release acknowledging a
"small number" of defects.
   Meanwhile, as internal debate raged about whether to
proceed with the promotion or pull it, Coke fired off
full-page newspaper ads to show consumers what a broken
MagiCan looks like compared with a working one. The ads
advised against drinking the water, and gave consumers a
toll-free number to phone in complaints.
   Marketing experts praised the openness of Coke's
disclosure, which signaled to the public that big corporate
Coke, which had suffered embarrassment five years ago over
the New Coke fiasco, could still own up to its mistakes. By
contrast, Perrier was criticized for not being aggressive
enough in informing consumers quickly about the contamination
of its bottled water earlier this year.
   Deciding it was pointless "to put out brushfires all
summer," as one insider says, the company called it quits
last week. The promotion was supposed to run until
mid-August. But Coke opted to put a positive spin on the
finale, with ads that stated: "The last MagiCans are out
there, but not for long . . ."
   Says John Margaritas, chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Public
Relations in New York, "Once you risk any damage to your
brand name, then you need to quickly do whatever you can to
save the brand."

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court upheld a federal law that
requires public schools to give student religious groups the
same access to scheduling and facilities that other
extracurricular activities have.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices ruled that a 1984 federal law
requires an Omaha, Neb., high school to accommodate a
Bible-reading club that students wanted to organize.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, the
court said the law treats extracurricular activities as part
of a public forum created by the school. The federal law, the
court said, means the school can't discriminate against use
of the public forum based on a club's religious, political or
philosophical views. This approach, Justice O'Connor said,
doesn't violate the First Amendment's separation of church
and state.
   The eight justices in the majority were split into three
opinions. Six of them, including Justice O'Connor, appeared
to believe that the federal law is constitutional in all
respects. Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia
differed on how to analyze freedom of religion issues under
the First Amendment, but not on the law's validity.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Justice William
Brennan, agreed that the law was constitutional as applied to
the Omaha school, but they warned that school officials must
be careful to disassociate themselves from the religious
message of the club.
   Justice John Stevens dissented.
   Officials at the Omaha school refused to allow the
religious club to meet, but a federal appeals court in St.
Louis ruled that the federal law required accommodation of
the club. The high court affirmed the appeals court ruling.

   WEST CHESTER, Pa. -- Commodore International Ltd.
introduced a system that combines the capabilities of a
personal computer and compact disk player.
   The Commodore system, called the CDTV player, consists of
an Amiga personal computer -- without keyboard or monitor --
and a CD player. The system is hooked up to a television to
display video and text.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The CDTV Player makes the personal computer maker an early
entrant into a market that many computer companies consider
to be vast. The companies think that the home market for
computers is finally about to pick up with the introduction
of multimedia machines. For instance, they expect people to
buy encyclopedias on computer disks with video and audio
capabilities, or instructional videos that they can interact
with through the computer.
   Commodore has also broken through a price barrier. Its
CDTV Player, whose shipment date wasn't specified, will cost
less than $1,000. Application disks will cost just $25 to
$60.
   Still, the market for such systems is very young and will
take time to develop. The various companies involved haven't
agreed on what technological standards they will follow, and
it usually takes the market quite some time to sort out those
issues. It's also not clear how people will use these
systems, and whether they will want reference books or just
more games. In any case, it may take a couple of years for
companies to produce enough application disks to make these
systems attractive.
   "Commodore has a history of producing great hardware, but
they don't have enough software available," said Greg
Drahuschak, a securities analyst at Wheat First/Butcher &amp;
Singer. "That is where Commodore has always fallen short."

   The stockbrokers at J.T. Moran &amp; Co.'s Garden City, N.Y.,
office had only to consult their scripts, taped to desks and
walls. The scripts supplied "power phrases," to be used on
people reached through cold calling. "This is going to come
back to us in a big way," was one such line. Another was,
"The perceived value is nowhere near the intrinsic value."
And, "We're gonna hit a home run with this situation."
   If a prospective client hesitated, the broker might get
pushy. "I understand you want to talk with your wife," he
might ask, "but does she go to work with you every day? Does
she make the decisions?"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More hesitation could elicit a tougher follow-up: "C'mon,
drop your pompons and get into the game with the varsity."
Or, "Take your backbone out of the closet." Or "Put your wife
on the phone; she's more of a man than you are."
   High-pressure sales tactics like this are plenty familiar
to Edward Modzelewski. Last month, the 50-year-old physical
therapist got a cold call from a stockbroker who asked him
whether he wanted some investment ideas. Mr. Modzelewski was
horrified. The caller, he says, was one of the same group of
brokers that he contends bilked him "through a pattern of
unscrupulous conduct and illegal stock-price manipulation."
   After filing a $2.9 million claim with the National
Association of Securities Dealers in New York against several
of them and the firms where they worked -- First Jersey
Securities, Sherwood Capital Inc. and J.T. Moran -- Mr.
Modzelewski assumed he would never hear from them again.
   Mr. Modzelewski and thousands of other investors
nationwide may be victims of what some prosecutors call "the
cockroach factor." Like roaches scurrying from the light,
brokers often flee firms accused of fraud to escape the glare
of government scrutiny -- then set up shop with a new name.
   The Moran case seems a prime example. The scripts used by
some of the Moran brokers in Garden City -- not all of them,
by any means -- came straight from the now-defunct First
Jersey Securities, where a number of the Moran brokers once
worked.
   Of course, a broker with a blemished compliance record or
experience at a scandal-ridden firm is not necessarily
unscrupulous. Nonetheless, some former Moran clients say they
wish that they had known about their brokers' questionable
pasts and especially about the connection between Moran's
Garden City branch and First Jersey, the target of a highly
publicized investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and grand-jury probes in New York and New Jersey.
   Although recent government crackdowns on illicit
activities in the over-the-counter and penny-stock markets
have netted many swindlers, a lot more slip through the
government's grasp. That is partly because of the huge number
of brokers state and federal regulators must watch. But it's
also because of the way the government prosecutes securities
firms.
   "It's a common choice in law enforcement -- whether you go
after the big guys or the small guys, whether you pursue the
street sellers of narcotics or the Colombian cartel," says
Charles Carberry, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan U.S.
Attorney's office. "And typically, because of resources, you
pursue the head of the operation -- in these cases, the guy
who's manipulating the stock and not the guys on the phones
selling it."
   As a result, says Richard Berry, the head of enforcement
for the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, "there is a
subculture that will continue on and on after the key players
are put in jail." The small fry, he says, "find a new home,
another firm that will take them in for dirt cheap and that
has an appearance of legitimacy. . . . Investors never know
the difference."
   J.T. Moran, one of the firms sued by Mr. Modzelewski, took
in some wayward brokers, although many of its 18 branches
remain untouched by controversy.
   Whether John T. Moran, who founded the firm in 1986, knew
he was buying into the "cockroach factor" isn't clear. He
declines to be interviewed. However, his lawyer, Martin
Karlinsky of New York, says: "Anybody who knew about First
Jersey would have to say they were aware there had been
problems, but those were First Jersey problems, encouraged by
First Jersey." Regarding the allegations against Moran, Mr.
Karlinsky says that "nothing has been proved" -- or will be
proved.
   In January, Moran, which specialized in making markets in
low-priced stocks, filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. In three years,
Moran had built up a sales force of nearly 1,000 brokers --
some of whom had checkered employment histories -- and became
one of the nation's 20 largest brokerage houses.
   In recent months, Moran's problems have attracted the
attention of investigators from the NASD, the SEC, the
Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
several state agencies. The investigators have been looking
into allegations of stock manipulation and fraudulent sales
practices at Moran as well as the financial ties between
Moran and the companies whose stock its brokers pushed.
   Meanwhile, some of Moran's nearly 90,000 customers have
filed claims against it with the NASD and in the federal
bankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y. They contend that they
were fleeced by Moran brokers who hyped stocks in small
companies with few assets and feeble prospects. Many of these
claims involve Moran brokers who once worked for First
Jersey.
   Several suits against Moran cite First Jersey veterans at
the Garden City branch, Moran's largest retail operation.
What happened there, say former brokers not involved in the
lawsuits, is that Moran inherited a legacy of high-pressure
sales techniques from First Jersey brokers, who then became
managers at Moran.
   Mr. Karlinsky says that in the spring of 1989, Mr. Moran
assigned to the Garden City office a "special officer to
assure compliance with rules and laws. This was the only
branch where Moran did this. It was the only branch that
needed it."
   There is ample evidence that the brokers who came to Moran
from First Jersey did invest clients' money recklessly. Five
former Moran brokers say in interviews that many of their
clients had losses of 50% to 80% of their investments and
that few walked away with a profit.
   Michael Magioncalda, a Long Island bagel-shop operator
with a $144,000 claim against the firm and two brokers, has
tape recordings on which one of the brokers guarantees that
Mr. Magioncalda would never lose a cent if he purchased stock
in Moran's parent firm at $1,000 per unit -- a violation of
SEC and NASD regulations. "Even if it went below $1,000, both
he {the broker} and J.T. Moran would guarantee that I would
suffer no losses," says Mr. Magioncalda in his claim, which,
along with transcripts of the tapes, is filed at the NASD in
New York City.
   The evolution from First Jersey to Moran went like this:
In the spring of 1974, the SEC accused Mayflower Securities
Co. of stock manipulation and fraud. Later that year,
Mayflower's then-26-year-old president, Robert Brennan, and
the SEC negotiated a settlement that included a 15-day
suspension of Mayflower's trading. In November 1974, a few
days before the suspension was to begin, Mayflower clients
got a letter saying their accounts had been purchased by
First Jersey. After changing little more than the name, Mr.
Brennan and Mayflower's top brokers had set up shop in
Mayflower's New York office.
   In November 1984, after a cat-and-mouse game with the SEC
that had already gone on for years, First Jersey agreed to
settle SEC charges alleging stock fraud. Subsequently, a
number of First Jersey managers were indicted. The
indictments out of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office
resulted in two acquittals, one reversed conviction and a
guilty plea to one misdemeanor count. Cases in which the U.S.
Attorney in Newark, N.J., alleged money-laundering against
three officials and two former brokers have ended so far in
three guilty pleas and one conviction. Some charges are still
pending.
   In February 1987, after an avalanche of bad publicity, Mr.
Brennan sold First Jersey's 33 branches, which by then had
1,100 brokers, to Sherwood Capital. "We were tainted,
destroyed, damaged goods," a former First Jersey broker says.
"We desperately needed a new name, a new face. It was all
very smooth."
   Sherwood, an over-the-counter market maker with only
institutional clients, wanted to develop a retail force, says
a lawyer familiar with the transaction. "This was a chance to
be a gigantic presence on the Street . . . a firm with
tremendous power to generate money but without the albatross
of a bad name."
   But the retail business posted huge losses, and, in the
spring of 1988, Sherwood decided to sell it. Two former First
Jersey brokers who went to work at Sherwood blame the
problems partly on high-pressure sales techniques that led to
sales cancellations and disgruntled customers.
   In May 1988, Moran announced it had acquired five Sherwood
offices, in Chicago, Hartford, Dallas, San Diego and
Huntington, N.Y. Moran agreed to pay $1.8 million plus a
warrant to purchase 400,000 common shares of Moran's parent,
Manhattan-based J.T. Moran Financial Corp. Moran acquired
about 250 brokers reputed to be Sherwood's top producers,
including 150 or so at Huntington.
   When Moran moved the Huntington office to Garden City last
year, about half the sales staff had once worked at First
Jersey. Gregory Hasho, First Jersey's top producer and later
manager of Sherwood's Huntington branch, stayed on as Moran's
branch manager.
   And when Moran filed for Chapter 11 in January, the
31-year-old Mr. Hasho and his troops landed at Vanderbilt
Securities, a small New York firm specializing in
over-the-counter stocks. As many as 150 brokers, including
some First Jersey alumni, are operating in Hauppauge, N.Y.,
in the old headquarters of Investors Center, a firm that
collapsed last year under SEC pressure. Mr. Modzelewski says
he was called from that office last month.
   Mr. Karlinsky, Mr. Moran's lawyer, says Moran checked the
brokers' compliance records and found no problems. He adds
that Sherwood agreed to indemnify Moran for any difficulties
resulting from brokers' practices after the purchase. "The
truth of the matter is we have been dragged into these
things," he says.
   But it wasn't just the First Jersey connection that Moran
was "dragged into." The troubled pasts of other acquisitions
caused problems. Some newly added brokers led investigators
to Moran's doorstep; others hobbled it because regulators
ruled out new branches.
   Moran's 1989 proxy statement lists Adnan Durrani as a
managing director and board member as well as a former senior
vice president at several big Wall Street firms, including
Shearson Lehman. But according to his lengthy NASD record of
compliance problems, the 30-year-old Mr. Durrani, who joined
Moran's Manhattan office in 1987, had been asked to resign
from Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in 1984 for allegedly unauthorized
transfers of customer accounts from his previous job at E.F.
Hutton Co.; fired from Shearson in 1986 for unauthorized
trades and other problems; and "permitted to resign" from
Philips, Appel &amp; Walden Inc. in August 1987 after a New York
Stock Exchange investigator apparently tipped the firm's top
officers to his problems at Shearson.
   Mr. Durrani couldn't be reached for comment. Speaking of
him, Mr. Karlinsky says: "His compliance history caused one
to stop and think about it. But we didn't think that,
standing alone, it was a reason not to bring him into J.T.
Moran. {Mr. Moran} had high regard for him and thought he was
an honest and forthright person; he gave reasons for his
compliance problems and he {Mr. Moran} believed him." Mr.
Karlinsky adds that no customers have complained about Mr.
Durrani's work at Moran.
   Last year Florida refused to allow Moran to open three new
branches. At Moran's Lauderhill, Fla., office, explains Don
Saxon, the director of Florida's Division of Securities,
"There were violations of our antifraud provisions, failure
to disclose a relationship between Moran and one of its
issues, among other things."
   Moran's Lauderhill office was staffed largely by brokers
who had left such firms as Greentree Securities and RLR
Securities Inc. In early 1988, Florida regulators barred
Greentree from the securities business for "having engaged in
dishonest or unethical practices," according to NASD records.
Says Mr. Karlinsky, "I'm aware of compliance problems with
RLR Securities. Moran screened out the brokers who caused the
problems."
   What former Moran brokers call the "legacy of First
Jersey" can best be described as boiler-room tactics: brokers
phoning unwary investors and urging, cajoling, even harassing
them into buying highly speculative securities.
   Deception pervaded the system, the brokers say. Even the
sound of a stock ticker that some clients heard in the
background was a sham; brokers were simply pounding on
staplers. Over and over, brokers told clients, "Give me 1% of
your trust, and I'll earn the other 99%."
   A common practice passed on from First Jersey was the
"three-call" system for landing new accounts. The first, the
"prospecting call," made initial contact with a potential
customer. The "qualifying call" was to find out how much
money the investor had and to titillate him or her with what
the broker called a hot prospect "coming up soon." In the
"sell call," the broker hyped a stock as a no-lose
proposition -- and never let the client hang up without a
commitment to buy, brokers say.
   In a $722,845 claim against First Jersey, Sherwood and
Moran on file with the NASD in New York, Mark Everett, who
co-owns a graphic-design firm on Long Island, says that "if
the client hung up, the account executive would call back
soon thereafter with another suggestion. . . . If all else
failed, account executives would buy stock for the customer's
account even though not authorized."
   A Connecticut investor, Theodore Vielenski, says in an
interview that he was "hounded a lot" while dealing with
Moran and Sherwood. The superintendent for a Wallingford
contractor complains, "There were times when you said no, you
didn't want to buy, and then you'd get a statement saying you
had bought some shares in some house stock. That, I'd say,
was a big ripoff." He was also bothered that his broker --
the same one at both firms -- wouldn't send him prospectuses
on the companies whose stock he was pushing.
   Scott Chopsky, a computer consultant in Bridgeport, Conn.,
says in an interview that he remembers his broker saying,
"This will go through the roof in the next couple of days"
and "You will triple your investment within two months." Mr.
Chopsky, who alleges he lost 80% of his investment, says he
got his first call in the early spring of 1987 when his
broker was at Sherwood. He kept dealing with the broker, at
Moran, through November 1989.
   The Garden City brokers would typically make 200 to 300
calls to clients each day. Peter Novrit, a plumber in
Bayonne, N.J., can attest to the phone frenzy. He says, "Even
when I already had an account with Moran, I still got half a
dozen calls to open an account."
   He even got one after Moran's bankruptcy filing. "A month
ago, I got a call. The guy said he was from Vanderbilt
Securities," Mr. Novrit says in an interview. "The first
question I asked: `Are you any affiliation of J.T. Moran?'
The guy said yes. I said no thanks." He adds that he lost
close to 90% of his investments at Sherwood and Moran, all
with one broker.
   Some former brokers admit routinely misleading clients.
The clients were never warned about the risks in a "house
stock," a stock in which Moran made a market. Former brokers
say clients also didn't know the price they paid for house
stocks included a hidden charge. Anywhere from 20% to 40% of
the price would go to the firm, and half of that to the
broker. Branch managers would get a cut of every sale in the
branch. But brokers often told customers there was no
commission, brokers say. Says Mr. Vielenski in Connecticut,
"They lied to me so much; there was no mention of
commissions."
   Known as the "chop," the brokers' cut was the carrot the
firm dangled before them. It encouraged them to sell house
stocks rather than mutual funds or Big Board securities. It
was on its 90 or so house stocks that Moran made most of its
money, say former brokers and clients, by selling and
reselling the shares to clients at constantly higher prices
after having bought them at very, very low prices.
   The most infuriating aspect of dealing with the firm, say
several former Moran clients, was the difficulty of selling
their Moran stocks. Former brokers say they were discouraged
from taking sell orders because the firm would lose money.
   When Mr. Novrit, the plumber, wanted to sell his 6,000
shares in Istec Industries &amp; Technologies, he says he called
his broker dozens of times but couldn't reach him. Mr. Novri
says his broker had told him in 1988 that Istec, a small
Israeli firm that, among other things, bred tropical fish,
would be "the deal of the century," but the stock began to
plummet in early 1989.
   "I wanted out, but they would put me on hold and never
come back. Or I would ask for my broker, and someone would
say he was not at his desk but he'll call you back. And then
he wouldn't," Mr. Novrit says. "Or they'd give me to another
broker and I would say `I want out. I want to sell.' This guy
would say he couldn't do that for me; I would have to talk to
my broker. Then they'd put me on hold. On and on. And the
price just kept dropping." Mr. Novrit finally sold the stock
through a broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   When Mr. Magioncalda, the bagel-shop owner, wanted to sell
his $100,000 stake in J.T. Moran Financial, he did reach his
broker. But the broker refused to sell. As the price kept
dropping, Mr. Magioncalda urged him to sell. In his claim,
filed with the NASD in New York, the investor says his
broker, in urging him to buy the units, had guaranteed that
if the stock price ever went below the purchase price, "there
would be an automatic sale order for me, which was never
done." He finally sold the stock through Josephthal &amp; Co. at
a loss of $43,437.50, according to the claim.
   Mr. Chopsky had a different problem. The computer
consultant says his broker sold stock out of his portfolio
without telling him and then used the proceeds to buy another
house stock. "I got a notice in the mail saying I owed him
money. He said he thought he was doing me a favor," Mr.
Chopsky says in an interview.
   Former Moran brokers at Garden City describe the
atmosphere as "cult-like." The drive to make money was the
ideology, and the leader was Mr. Hasho, the charismatic First
Jersey veteran. Until the second half of 1989, the average
Moran broker was taking home about $8,000 a month.
   There are few blemishes on Mr. Hasho's compliance record
other than the recent complaints filed by Mr. Everett and Mr.
Modzelewski. In November 1988, Sherwood Capital filed with
the NASD a disclosure saying 71 of its former brokers,
including Mr. Hasho, had been overpaid commissions at the
time the firm's retail operations folded.
   "Each was notified of the overpayment, as was the
broker-dealer they are currently associated with," it says.
"All efforts to resolve this issue, which may or may not have
been brought about willfully, have not succeeded in doing
so." The matter is still pending, NASD records show.
   Mr. Hasho, who declines to be interviewed, was a talented
motivator. His posh Long Island estate and $1 million-plus
income was inspiration enough for new brokers. Also inspiring
recruits were the BMWs, Porsches and Jaguars in Moran's
parking lot. To keep the adrenalin pumping, Mr. Hasho and his
supervisors called at least one pep rally a day. Attention
was lavished on the top producers. Laggards were labeled
"negs."
   Sometimes, the ridicule was unrelated to production.
Though Ernest Charous was a good producer, his new gold
Corvette was flipped over in the parking lot -- an event
announced over the office public-address system. Another
broker arrived at work on several occasions and found urine
in his coffee cup and on his files. Some former brokers say
they have been harassed over the telephone even after leaving
the firm. (News staffers at this paper repeatedly received
obscene calls while this article was being prepared.)
   Moran's brokers vented frustrations by running through the
halls stamping their feet and shouting slogans. After making
a sale, they would ram a water-cooler bottle into the wall.
Partitions and light fixtures were destroyed, a custodian
says.
   People who have called on behalf of Mr. Hasho and the
former Garden City branch but won't identify themselves say
the former Moran brokers are spreading false information
about their former colleagues. The motive, they say, is to
attract former Moran clients to their new firms, though some
of the former brokers who are talking to reporters, the NASD
and the SEC no longer sell securities. And the former clients
who are suing, the anonymous callers say, are trying to blame
their own investment mistakes on their brokers.
   Even though Moran's second public stock offering, in
October 1988, brought more than $20 million, nothing could
stem the tide of red ink or stop the government from
investigating. In December 1989, several NASD agents visited
the Garden City office and confiscated scripts and other
records. A month or so later, the firm, its parent and two
other subsidiaries filed for protection under Chapter 11.
   Just why regulators didn't pick up the scent of problems
earlier is a complicated issue. Investigators and attorneys
blame the limited resources and the difficulties. "Putting
together a stock-manipulation case is a very complicated
process," says Ira Sorkin, a New York attorney who in the
1970s prosecuted many stock-manipulation cases. "If there's a
network of 300 brokers, where do you cut it off? You can't
indict them all," Mr. Sorkin says. "And by the time you have
a case against the ones you do nab, the nature of the
business is such that the rest have scattered."
   Mr. Berry, the New Jersey enforcement director, notes the
value of going after the top tier. "It's not a deterrence
unless the message gets out, and it's easier to get the
message out when you've got the big players," he says. But he
adds that the common reluctance to prosecute minor players is
a dangerous thing that many regulators seek to change. "The
failure to hold the brokers accountable sends the message
that they can get away with lying to clients and a wide range
of other crimes on a regular basis," he says.
   But none of this assuages the frustration and anger of
former First Jersey, Sherwood and Moran clients. Says Joel
Bernstein, the New York attorney representing Mr.
Modzelewski, "He stuck with his broker largely because he
believed if there was really something wrong, someone, in the
NASD or the SEC, would be out there catching it. He thought
there was a system out there to catch the thieves, if they
existed. Now, he's not so sure."
