   Student Loan Guarantors End Talks
   For Merger, Citing Federal Opposition

   An effort to solve the financial woes of a big
student-loan guarantor was dropped in the face of federal
opposition, leaving open the possibility of bank losses
unless the government agrees to a full rescue.
   The guarantor, Higher Education Assistance Foundation,
said it ended merger talks with Nebraska Student Loan Program
Inc. The merger was aimed at transferring some or all of
HEAF's $9.6 billion in guarantees of high-defaulting student
loans to the Nebraska agency. The Education Department is
developing its own plan to resolve HEAF's financial crisis,
but details aren't known.

   HEAF, a nonprofit corporation based in Overland Park,
Kan., is incurring deficits because of high defaults on loans
it guarantees. It portrayed itself as near collapse last week
to try to sell the Nebraska transaction in Washington,
according to people HEAF briefed.
   The Nebraska agency also disclosed that "two or three"
other guarantee agencies have approached it seeking to unload
loan guarantees but that these discussions have also been
terminated. The disclosure supported speculation in the
student-loan industry that financial problems are spreading
because of high defaults and aren't limited to HEAF. There
are about 55 guarantee agencies in the aid program, standing
behind about $51 billion in educational loans.
   A spokeswoman for the Education Department said the
department rejected the HEAF merger proposal because the
Nebraska agency could have been overwhelmed by HEAF's size
and because the proposal would have unfairly extended a
valuable exemption to HEAF under the loan program.
   When students default under the loan program, the
guarantee agencies must usually pay lenders 100% of the
unpaid principal, which qualifies them for reimbursement from
the Education Department. But when agencies' default
reimbursements hit certain levels, the government pays them
only 80% of loan value. This is how HEAF is losing money.
   The Nebraska agency, because it is relatively new,
receives 100% reimbursement unconditionally and will continue
to for a year. HEAF wanted to transfer a large portion of its
riskiest guarantees to the agency to secure full repayment.
   HEAF says it has met payments on all lenders' default
claims but that its position has been worsened by the
Education Department's disclosure of its financial troubles
last week.
   "The public representation of this information has caused,
for understandable reasons, members of the lending community
to lose confidence in the HEAF guarantee," Mr. Westbrook
said. "Such loss of confidence obviously puts us in an
untenable position. We have been told (by the Education
Department) that the option of merging with Nebraska is
unacceptable and we will receive a proposed solution
imminently. We have not received that solution."
   Nebraska Student Loan Program said one of the reasons it
was talking to HEAF was to protect Nebraska Higher Education
Loan Program -- a buyer of loans that repackages them as
bonds -- against possible losses if HEAF fails to honor its
guarantees. Nebraska Higher Education Loan Program "holds a
large volume" of HEAF-guaranteed paper, Nebraska Student Loan
said. "Any difficulty HEAF may have had in honoring its
commitments would be of significant concern" to the Nebraska
loan repackager, it added.
   One of HEAF's largest creditors is Student Loan Marketing
Association. Sallie Mae, which extended an $865 million
credit line to HEAF last December, is one of the country's
largest holders of student loans, which it purchases
wholesale from lenders. Sallie Mae's stock plunged $4.125 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday to
close at $49.875 a share.
   A spokeswoman for Sallie Mae yesterday reiterated a
statement that the company "would not suffer any material
loss" because of HEAF's problems. "We don't believe there is
any doubt we would be able to collect 100% of what we've
advanced to HEAF," she said.

   Exxon Profit Rose in Second Quarter,
   But Amoco and Arco Earnings Declined

   Second-quarter earnings increased at Exxon Corp., while
profits declined at two other major oil companies, Amoco
Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co.
   Overall, oil companies registered sharply higher
profitabililty in their gasoline refining and marketing
businesses in the quarter. Results from oil-production
operations were mostly lower as crude prices declined, and
the petrochemicals business also remained in the doldrums.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unusually long maintenance turnarounds at some refineries
helped reduce inventories and keep product prices high. Also,
a sharp drop in the price of crude oil, the raw material from
which refined products are made, "gave a boost to product
prices as well," said William Brown III, oil analyst for
Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Mr. Brown and other analysts predict, however, that the
strong refining margins of the second quarter will decline
this quarter, leaving major integrated oil companies with
flat to lower results.
   Exxon missed out on the second-quarter profit runup in the
refining and marketing side of the business, despite an
overall increase in earnings. As other companies reaped
profits from this sector, one of Exxon's major refineries was
closed for an unexpectedly long time, and two others were
idled for routine maintenance. An Exxon spokesman said that a
portion of the decline could be blamed on the closures, but
he declined to elaborate.
   Exxon's large Bayway refinery in New Jersey was closed for
several months. In January, a break in an underwater pipeline
there dumped more than 500,000 gallons of oil into New York
Harbor, and several other incidents at the Bayway docks
prompted Exxon officials to close the facility for an
internal study of the operation in addition to scheduled
maintenance. Refineries in California and Texas were also
down for planned maintenance in the period.
   Exxon said profit rose to $1.1 billion, or 87 cents a
share, from $140 million, or 11 cents a share, a year
earlier. The 1989 figure includes an $850 million provision
to cover cleanup of the giant Alaskan oil spill. Earnings
before the provision were $990 million, or 78 cents a share.
Revenue increased 10% to $26 billion.
   Refining and marketing operations overseas were especially
profitable, with earnings climbing to $498 million from $141
million.
   Amoco, based in Chicago, said net fell 24% to $379
million, or 75 cents a share, from $497 million, or 96 cents
a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a gain
of $471 million from a settlement with Iran that was offset
by a $477 million charge for expected environmental clean-up
costs, mostly in the company's gasoline refining and
marketing business. Revenue rose 9.4% to $7.45 billion from
$6.81 billion.
   Because of the environmental costs, Amoco had a $125
million loss in refining and marketing. Without the charge,
the company's refining sector's profit rose to $292 million
from $213 million because of higher margins and sales.
Chemical results declined because of lower prices and charges
for environmental remediation.
   Oil prices that were more than $2.50-a-barrel lower than a
year earlier sharply reduced U.S. exploration profits, to $82
million from $143 million. Exploration and production results
were also hurt by higher expenses overseas and unfavorable
currency effects.
   Arco net fell 16% to $391 million, or $2.36 a share, from
$467 million, or $2.66 a share, a year earlier, as record
refining profits weren't enough to offset lower exploration
and production results. Revenue declined 6.9% to $4.04
billion from $4.33 billion.
   The company, based in Los Angeles, said the average price
it received for domestic crude fell $3.57 a barrel to $10.61
in the quarter. Natural gas prices also fell. As a result,
exploration and production profit dropped to $96 million from
$229 million.
   But Arco's refining and marketing results nearly doubled
to $175 million from $91 million because of strong gasoline
prices and the lower oil prices.
   In addition, Arco increased its first-quarter net income
$45 million, or 27 cents a share, to $592 million, or $3.55 a
share. Because of an unusual accounting situation arising
from Arco's equity investment in Lyondell Petrochemical Co.,
the Securities and Exchange Commission advised Arco to
recognize some dividend income differently.
   The wide refining margins boosted earnings for Ashland Oil
Inc., almost exclusively a refiner and marketer, to a record
$100 million, or $1.79 a share, in the third quarter ended
June 30, more than double the year-earlier $43.5 million, or
78 cents a share. Sales rose slightly to $2.24 billion from
$2.21 billion.

   Some Have a Real Ax to Grind,
   While Others Just Give a Hoot

   DETROIT, Ore. -- Each summer for the past four years, a
group of Oregon environmentalists have camped out in the
Willamette National Forest to hear a concert and learn about
old-growth trees.
   But this year the Forest Service has refused to issue a
permit for the event. The reason: The Aug. 24-26 get-together
might disturb a nearby pair of Northern spotted owls, the
bird to which environmentalists heretofore have flocked in
their fight against timber interests.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Forest Service says it's concerned that the music,
along with 1,000 or more people tromping through the woods,
might frighten the adult owls from their nest, leaving their
fledglings behind. And campers scavenging for firewood could
remove ground cover for mice and other small creatures that
the owls eat. "It's a combination of things," Detroit Ranger
District biologist James Farrell says of the reasons for the
permit denial.
   But Michael Donnelly sees the devil quoting Scripture for
his own purpose. Mr. Donnelly's group, Friends of the
Breitenbush Cascades, has battled the Forest Service over
clear cutting in areas near the concert's site. Hard feelings
from that, he hints, may be behind the permit hassle. "They
wouldn't look for owls then, but now that we want to have a
concert they look for them," he says of the Forest Service.
   Others also see woodsy Machiavellianism at work. "The
general observation is that the owls are quite tolerant of
human activity," says Richard Brown, a former Forest Service
biologist who is now with the National Wildlife Federation's
Portland office. "It may be stretching things a bit to
present (the concert) as a significant threat."
   Mr. Brown, in fact, is surprised by the Forest Service's
sudden solicitousness. "When you look at the insults the
Forest Service was willing to inflict on the owl up until
June 23 (the day it was announced as an endangered species),
certainly the concert pales into insignificance compared with
the habitat destruction from logging and road construction."
   The environmentalists won't find much sympathy at Grim
Bros. Logging, in Estacada. Don Grim has seen big chunks of
Forest Service land taken from his chain saws in order to
spare the spotted owl. He and some friends may now employ a
favorite tactic of the environmentalists. "We're considering
going down there and chaining ourselves across a road," he
says with a laugh. "To protect the owl."

   James A. Middleton, 54, who formerly oversaw exploration
and production in the 48 contiguous states, will assume Mr.
Morrison's former duties overseeing West Coast petroleum
operations.
   Messrs. Arnault and Middleton will report to Robert E.
Wycoff, 60, Arco's president and chief operating officer. Mr.
Morrison will report to Mr. Cook.
   Analysts said the shift in responsibilities is a
particular boost for Mr. Arnault, who was a principal
architect behind the company's huge restructuring program
started in 1985. "It tells me that Arco is going to move
aggressively in the international area," said Bernard J.
Picchi, an oil analyst with Salomon Bros. in New York. "I
think this is a way that (chairman) Lod Cook is saying, `We
believe in international, and we want a man who was
successful in restructuring the company to oversee that
effort.'"

   Scientist Who Exposed Global Warming
   Proposes Satellites for Climate Research

   WASHINGTON -- James Hansen, the NASA scientist who helped
make the "greenhouse effect" an international issue, is
proposing a $200 million satellite program to settle the
question of whether the Earth is warming and why.
   The climate satellite proposal, which has circulated among
scientists, already has provoked considerable controversy. It
calls into question the necessity and timing of a gargantuan
National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite
program, called the Earth Observing System, or EOS, which
could cost as much as $50 billion over 25 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Hansen's proposal comes out of a series of private
meetings that Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), chairman of the
space and science subcommittee, has held with about 20
environmental scientists. Sen. Gore says he plans to release
a number of proposals in October to accelerate climate
research. "Something like what (Mr. Hansen) is proposing does
make sense," the senator said.
   Essentially, Mr. Hansen suggests taking three instruments
off EOS and NASA's proposed space station and putting them on
a relatively small satellite, which would study clouds, water
vapor and particles suspended in the atmosphere. If NASA
launches two climate satellites, for about $200 million,
starting in 1995, Mr. Hansen predicts, the satellites would
yield enough information to settle the central debate over
global warming by the end of the decade.
   "It would answer the questions of whether the Earth is
warming and whether humans are the cause of that," Mr. Hansen
said. An article giving details of his proposal is scheduled
to be published in the fall issue of Issues in Science and
Technology, a publication of the National Academy of
Sciences.
   The climate satellites would focus on the role of clouds,
Mr. Hansen said. Generally, clouds cool the Earth by
reflecting sunlight back into space -- something akin to a
giant window blind. But scientists don't know whether cloud
coverage is increasing or what kinds of clouds predominate,
leading to big differences in the severity of global change
predicted by different computer models. "Climate satellites
are a must," said Veerabhadran Ramanathan, a University of
Chicago climate specialist.
   Mr. Hansen's proposal puts him in the spotlight for the
third year in a row. In 1988, he set off alarms about global
change by testifying in Congress, during a blistering heat
wave, that he was "99%" certain that a global warming trend
had begun. Last year, he became a cause celebre when the
White House Office of Management and Budget tried to censor
his testimony. This year, the quiet, determined director of
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York is
taking on NASA's vast EOS project.
   NASA envisions launching a half-dozen $3 billion
satellites, which would carry as many as 16 different
instruments to study the Earth, including some as big as
cars. The first satellite, EOS-A, is scheduled for launch in
1998 and five others will follow over 15 years. The National
Space Council, led by Vice President Dan Quayle, is concerned
about the cost and risk of the project and is considering
whether to restructure it.
   Mr. Hansen says the EOS satellites, already three years
behind schedule, are bound to fall further behind -- leaving
climate scientists with big gaps in needed data. He says NASA
could fund the climate satellites out of a portion of the EOS
project devoted to smaller satellites.
   But EOS officials think that Mr. Hansen is underestimating
the cost of his climate satellites and that his project would
siphon funds from EOS, undercutting support for the program.
"The dumbest thing to do is to say maybe EOS ought to slip a
year to solve Jim Hansen's problems," said Gerald Soffen,
EOS's project scientist.
   Two NASA scientists at the agency's Langley Research
Center sent Mr. Hansen a six-page letter criticizing his
proposal as too limited because it fails to consider other
environmental problems EOS will address, such as ozone
depletion, acid rain and deforestation. Berrien Moore, a
University of New Hampshire scientist involved with EOS, said
he doubts that the climate satellites will settle the
global-warming issue. "I don't think you'll get a smoking
gun," he said.
   For his part, Mr. Hansen says he doesn't want to kill EOS,
which will provide data needed to make better predictions of
how the climate will change in different places on Earth. But
he is willing to forgo EOS data for a time to answer what he
considers a more pressing question sooner.
   The criticism of Mr. Hansen's proposal is overlaid with a
sense of consternation about Mr. Hansen's ability to dominate
the global-warming debate and fear of his popularity in
Congress. If the climate satellite approach proves popular,
Mr. Moore said, "There's a high probability that Congress
will say we'll throw up a $200 million satellite and buy out
of the (EOS) project."

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- General Signal Corp. reported a
second-quarter loss of $21.9 million, or $1.14 a share,
reflecting a $60 million charge on the divestiture of three
semiconductor businesses.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the maker of electrical
controls equipment posted a profit of $18.7 million, or 98
cents per share. Sales for the current quarter were $481.6
million, down from $488.5 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The $60 million charge, on a pretax basis, reflected the
shedding of three semiconductor businesses, which "have been
unprofitable and were not forecasted to grow in accordance
with targeted objectives," according to Edmund M. Carpenter,
chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Carpenter observed
that "based on first-half order input and divestitures, we
feel very positive about second-half results." The
year-earlier quarter included a $3.1 million gain on the sale
of a defense unit.
   For the six months, General Signal reported a loss of $1.6
million, or nine cents per share, against profit of $38.5
million, or $2.02 per share in the year-earlier period. Sales
declined to $952 million, from $966.9 million. The results
also included the $60 million loss and $3.1 million gain in
the respective periods.

   Nicaragua Remains a Divided Nation
   As Sandinistas Back `Cold War' on State

   MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- Late last month, the commanders of
the U.S.-backed Contras formed ranks for the last time,
standing solemnly as their weapons were melted down with
blowtorches.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the newly elected
conservative president, hailed the end of nearly a decade of
guerrilla warfare against the leftist Sandinista party that
she defeated in February's election.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Nicaragua remains a bitterly divided society.
   In their new role as the opposition, the Sandinistas are
undertaking their own fifth-column resistance, not on jungle
footpaths but in the corridors of dozens of state agencies.
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega calls it "governing from
below."
   After two crippling general strikes by Sandinista unions
and a load of problems from an intransigent Sandinista
bureaucracy, the three-month-old Chamorro government is
becoming painfully aware of what he means.
   On the desk of Carlos Briceno, a Chamorro loyalist who
heads the state television network, sits a rock the size of a
softball. It was thrown at his home during a Sandinista
strike two weeks ago.
   Mr. Briceno's problems go back even before that, to the
day in April that he took office. He says his Sandinista
predecessor carried out the equivalent of a scorched earth
policy. The television network was left with debts of
$500,000 and a bank balance of just $300. More than 30 of the
station's automobiles were missing. A transmitter tower had
been dismantled and hauled off. "There weren't even any
videocassettes," says Mr. Briceno, "which was like going to
work at a hospital without syringes."
   The only thing Mr. Briceno was left with an excess of was
employees -- a total of 300 of them. That's been more of a
curse than a blessing, given the fervent loyalty most of them
display to the Sandinistas. When Mr. Briceno assigned a
reporter to a story on an anti-Sandinista press conference,
the reporter came back hours later claiming to be unable to
find the address. The next day, the reporter located the
address but fouled the footage by getting dirt in his camera.
   Though officials of Mrs. Chamorro's government seem
shell-shocked by this resistance, the Sandinista strategy
shouldn't be that unfamiliar to them. After all, the Contras
also did everything in their power to undermine the incumbent
Sandinista government's economic and political authority.
   "It sounds strange to say it, but we are finding that
there are many ways in which it is easier to be the
opposition," says Sofia Montenegro, an editor of the official
Sandinista newspaper, Barricada.
   Many Nicaraguans are willing to overlook Mrs. Chamorro's
slow start as an inevitable phase in the country's
development toward democracy. The president can still draw on
a reservoir of good will after having quickly made good on
her campaign pledge to abolish compulsory military service.
   Still, the early difficulties have set off messy public
disputes among Mrs. Chamorro's political allies over her
strategy of "national reconciliation." The centerpiece of
that plan was leaving Sandinistas in control of the army
while the fighting force was scaled down. To the hardline
businessmen and landowners who backed her -- including Vice
President Virgilio Godoy -- it was appeasement. To the
foreign-educated technocrats who form the inner circle of her
government it was pragmatism.
   "We are a government with popular support but without
coercive force," says Francisco Mayorga, the Yale
University-trained head of the central bank and architect of
the new government's economic strategy. "We have jumped on --
have fallen on, really -- this horse and are trying to grab
hold of the reins while we're riding it."
   More than anything, the government's trying to get a grip
on inflation, which has been running at around 100% a month.
Mr. Mayorga's plan was to quickly pare the deficit, fix
distortions in the exchange rate and prices and then launch a
new currency at par with the dollar. The new currency would
have the financial backing of some $500 million in
international assistance flowing into Nicaragua and the
psychological support of the flurry of market-oriented
economic reforms the government hoped to unleash in its first
days.
   Even Mr. Mayorga acknowledges that the Sandinista strikes
and bureaucratic foot-dragging have delayed those reforms by
weeks. Typical is a faltering Chamorro administration program
to allow landowners whose property had been improperly
confiscated by the Sandinistas to quickly rent it back.
   So far, the program has only yielded a harvest of
irritation for expropriated landowners like Mario Gonzalez
Arguello. In 1983, the Sandinistas took away several hundred
acres of prime cotton-farming land Mr. Gonzalez owned in
central Nicaragua. Mr. Gonzalez left for Miami to make a
living selling cars.
   Mr. Gonzalez returned this year and quickly won approval
of his claim from officials in Managua. But actually taking
control of the land has proven a greater chore. Three times
he has tried to visit the land, only to be driven off on each
occasion by machete-wielding Sandinista sympathizers who work
on the government-owned farm abutting his property.
   "On one hand, the government is giving me back my land,
but on the other hand government employees are holding onto
it," he says. "It's absurd."
   Of the 11 landowners who won approval of petitions for the
return of confiscated lands, only one has succeeded in taking
control of his property, according to the leading Nicaraguan
growers lobby.
   The Sandinistas have also stymied significant steps to
trim the bloated bureaucracy or sell some of the more than
400 state-owned enterprises acquired by the leftist
government.
   The Chamorro government's difficulty in getting on with
its economic program has given second thoughts to the foreign
investors who were also being heavily counted on. Juan Lopez
Zeledon, a business leader and real estate developer, said
that around the time of the inauguration nearly a dozen
foreign investors were looking seriously at an office
building he owns in central Managua. "After the first
Sandinista strike in May, no one would even consider an
investment," he says.
   Government department heads such as Mr. Briceno say that
the struggle for control of the bureaucracy is likely to be a
war of attrition. But "every day that we stay in control, we
get stronger," says Mr. Briceno.
   It's clear Mr. Briceno also knows a thing or two about
infighting. Last Thursday, when the Sandinistas organized
public rallies marking the anniversary of their 1979
revolution, he aired an all-star lineup of movies. "If people
can stay home and watch `Batman,' you can be sure they won't
go to the square to see Daniel Ortega," Mr. Briceno says.

   This clear, energetic and untendentious biography of D.H.
Lawrence by Jeffrey Meyers (Knopf, 446 pages, $24.95) is the
first in more than a decade and most welcome for its candid
narrative and new information about the novelist's childhood,
marriage, sexual life, health and always complex friendships.
Mr. Meyers's life of Hemingway was praised when it appeared
five years ago, and here again he has produced a readable,
scholarly biography that doesn't break its subject on the
wheel of some reductive thesis or bury him in self-serving
detail. Lawrence lives.
   The eloquent victim of the most famous Oedipus complex in
English literature, David Herbert Lawrence was the fourth of
five children of an illiterate Nottingham coal miner and a
snobbish would-be schoolteacher. As a young writer, he was
taken up by many of England's most prominent people (Bertrand
Russell, E.M. Forster, Ford Madox Ford, Katherine Mansfield,
Ottoline Morrell), but quarrelled with them all. During World
War I his fourth novel, "The Rainbow," was suppressed for
obscenity and he was expelled from Cornwall as a suspected
German spy (his wife, Frieda von Richthofen Weekley, was a
highly conspicuous German baroness, six years older than he,
whom he had stolen from his favorite professor at Nottingham
University). Lawrence spent the last 10 sickly years of his
life in perpetual motion through Italy, France, Germany,
Ceylon, Australia, the American Southwest and Mexico, and
died of tuberculosis in France in 1930 at 44. He had
published some 50 works and many more were to appear
posthumously.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Immensely difficult, sensitive, contentious and
self-contending, Lawrence was very much the self-proclaimed
"genius" -- novelist, poet, travel writer, critic,
correspondent, religio-psycho-political polemicist. Above
all, he was a great crusading modernist, a believer in
redemptive art and salvation through personal relations, who
declared the novel was "the one bright book of life" and the
novelist therefore "superior to the saint, the scientist, the
philosopher, and the poet, who are all great masters of the
different bits of man alive, but never get the whole hog."
   Typically grandiose Lawrentian claims, and yet typically
qualified by his insight that since the novel was "the
highest example of subtle inter-relatedness that man has
discovered," any attempt to turn it into a sermon or a
treatise, to forsake art for doctrine, would fail: "If you
try to nail anything down, in the novel, either it kills the
novel, or the novel gets up and walks away with the nail." So
readers should, "Never trust the artist. Trust the tale."
It's a rare prophet who cries caveat emptor.
   Lawrence's authentic genius was such that it's impossible
to reduce his best works to our last reading of them: they
keep changing each time through -- they shoot us from one
reaction to another: delight, outrage, fatigue, admiration,
impatience. His pronouncements about a coming Manichean
"apocalypse" and our necessary submission to "dark phallic
power" have dated, to put it gently, but his best literary
works are still alive, asking questions, not delivering
answers, reading us as we read them.
   Today his novels "Sons and Lovers," "The Rainbow" and
"Women in Love," and some of his stories and novellas, are
regarded as his strongest works. But his most famous novel
probably still is "Lady Chatterley's Lover," his 10th and
last, which was judged too obscene for publication in England
until 1960. A year after it was privately published in sunny
fascist Italy in 1928, Edmund Wilson forcefully argued that
it was art, not pornography, and that Lawrence was a heroic
figure: "D.H. Lawrence is indestructible: censored, exiled,
denounced, snubbed, he still possesses more vitality than
almost anyone else."
   Although most of Lawrence's obituaries were hostile when
he died the following year, E.M. Forster, the doyen of the
Bloomsbury group that Lawrence had denounced as a swarm of
black beetles, praised Lawrence even more highly than Wilson:
"Now he is dead, and the low-brows whom he scandalized have
united with the high-brows whom he bored to ignore his
greatness. . . . All that we can do . . . is to say straight
out that he was the greatest imaginative novelist of our
generation." It took decades before such praise was
comprehensible. The English critic F.R. Leavis was ridiculed
for years for his high estimation of Lawrence.
   Mr. Meyers has re-examined Lawrence's life as the origin
of his art. At times he may tend to simplify both somewhat,
but he has come up with new material and given a clear shape
to much of the old. In addition to evidence of Lawrence's
generosity, high spirits, wit, invigorating sensitivity and
passion for experience, we read about his social, sexual and
racial prejudices, his meddling and imperious way with
friends, his obsession with homosexuality as both a saving
grace and an abomination, his hatred of democracy, his
longing for a mighty dictator. Most of all we read about his
violent, exultant, dependent relationship with his wife,
Frieda, who carried on with half a dozen other men at various
times but nursed him to the end.
   Mr. Meyers's biography successfully conveys that Lawrence,
who chose the phoenix as his personal symbol, did burn with a
brighter flame than most men. And even more unusual was that
he had the genius -- like Keats, another impassioned,
tubercular, working-class English writer -- to create great
works of literature before he was consumed.

   New Plants, Lower Costs Give Canadians
   Edge Over U.S. Auto Union as Talks Start

   TORONTO -- The Canadian Auto Workers union is in a
stronger position than its U.S. counterpart as it begins
contract bargaining today with the Canadian subsidiaries of
the Big Three auto makers.
   Labor costs in Canada are lower than in U.S. plants,
resulting in savings to the companies of an estimated $7 an
hour per employee. And, although vehicle sales have slowed on
both sides of the border, some of the Big Three's more
successful models are built in Canada in newer, more
efficient assembly plants. As a result, proportionately fewer
workers have been laid off in Canada than in the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With these advantages, the CAW confidently has set higher
wages as its top bargaining objective for the 65,000 workers
it represents at the Big Three. By contrast, the United Auto
Workers union in the U.S., on the defensive after recent job
losses, has targeted total job security in its round of
contract talks, which began last week. The Canadian union,
which broke away from the UAW in 1985, also says
"philosophical" differences account for the divergent
bargaining goals. Both unions' current contracts with General
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and their
Canadian units expire Sept. 14.
   Canadian auto workers are "in relatively better shape"
than those in the U.S. and so are "playing to their
strengths," says William Pochiluk, president of Autofacts
Inc., a research firm based in Paoli, Pa.
   Mr. Pochiluk says the Big Three are drawn to invest in
Canada because of the favorable exchange rate -- the Canadian
dollar currently trades at about 86 or 87 U.S. cents -- and
Canada's system of national medical care, which cuts down on
corporate health care costs. Industry officials have said
they will make controlling health care costs one of their top
objectives in U.S. contract bargaining.
   Sam Gindin, director of research at the CAW, calculates
that total labor costs in the U.S., including wages and
benefits, amount to about $32 an hour per employee at the Big
Three. In Canada, this figure is 29 Canadian dollars (US$25)
an hour, he says. Executives at GM, Ford and Chrysler didn't
disagree with these figures.
   The CAW kicks off bargaining with a largely ceremonial
meeting with GM today, followed by meetings with Ford and
Chrysler later in the week. Each side is expected to exchange
opening statements and then adjourn for bargaining on local
issues. Formal negotiations on the national contracts will
resume in mid-August.
   Late in August, the union will pick one of the Canadian
units of the Big Three as its target and will negotiate a
pact to serve as the pattern for the other two companies.
Ford and GM are considered the most likely choices as
targets: Ford would be financially best able to afford higher
wages, but a pact with the much larger GM could be expected
to set a trend in the industry. In the U.S., analysts expect
the UAW target to be GM.
   By pushing for higher wages, the CAW could erode the
competitive advantage the Canadian industry now has, warns
Anil Verma, a professor of industrial relations at the
University of Toronto. He says Canada's attraction to
investors already has been diminished by recent gains in the
value of the Canadian dollar and by Mexico's moves to draw
investment by liberalizing its markets.
   "I think the (Canadian) union's assumption that job
security is somehow taken care of is on shaky ground," Mr.
Verma says.
   CAW officials say they won't ignore job security in their
bargaining. CAW President Robert White said in a recent
interview, "I don't think we should fool our members that
somehow we live on an island and we can guarantee absolute
job security."
   As in the U.S., Canada's auto makers are expected to make
competitiveness a major issue in the talks. Walter McCall, a
spokesman for Chrysler's Canadian unit, says Asian car makers
that have set up socalled transplant factories in Canada have
a "significant cost advantage" over the Big Three, largely
because of lower pension costs, the result of younger work
forces.

   PHILADELPHIA -- Meritor Savings Bank reported a
second-quarter loss of $136 million, or $3.90 per share, as
expected. The loss reflects heavy charges for
recapitalization and restructuring, including a provision of
$43 million for loan losses.
   Meritor's year-earlier losses for the second quarter were
$21 million, or 61 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Roger S. Hillas, Meritor chairman, said the results showed
"progress in long-term strategic restructuring of the
institution." A debt-recapitalization plan approved by
federal regulators this month will increase Meritor's
shareholder equity by about $98 million, which will be
reflected in the third quarter.
   The plan will put Meritor in compliance with all the new
capital requirements under the thrift bailout law passed last
year. Meritor, the nation's largest thrift in the early
1980s, has shrunk nearly 70% to about $7 billion from $13
billion.
   Among the costs and charges in the quarter, Meritor had a
loss of $74.5 million, or $2.12 per share, in connection with
its sale of 54 branches to Mellon Bank Corp. Meritor also
wrote off $172 million in goodwill connected with the branch
offices sale, terminated interest rate swap and floor
contracts at a cost of $55 million and established a $54
million reserve for expenses from unused office space.
   Meritor also quadrupled its provision for loan losses from
a year earlier to $43 million. A "significant portion" of the
loan-loss provision is due to deteriorating commercial and
real-estate loans and Meritor's plans to accelerate the
disposal of non-performing assets, Mr. Hillas said.

   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Greyhound Dial Corp. posted a net loss
of $60.8 million, or $1.54 a share, for the second quarter
resulting from a one-time $100 million charge to set up a
loss reserve for the bankruptcy of Greyhound Bus Lines.
   In the year-ago second quarter, Greyhound Dial had net
income of $35.6 million, or 92 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Dial sold the bus company in 1987, but retained
a 22.5% stake in the bus company's parent, GLI Holding Co.
Greyhound Dial also holds Greyhound Bus Lines preferred
stock, a junior subordinated note and other notes and
accounts receivable with the bus company. Greyhound Dial also
leases substantial assets to the bus lines.
   Greyhound Bus Lines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection June 4 as the result of a strike and other
difficulties. Under Chapter 11, the court protects a company
from its creditors while it works out a plan to pay off its
debt. Greyhound Dial said its actual loss from its bus lines
investment will be determined by bankruptcy proceedings and
the results of the bus line's continuing business operations.
   Greyhound Dial reported income from continuing operations
of $39.2 million, or 97 cents a share, for the second
quarter, a 9.8% increase over year-ago income from continuing
operations of $35.6 million, or 92 cents a share. The $100
million charge for the bus lines bankruptcy was listed as a
loss from discontinued operations and was equal to $2.51 a
share. Second-quarter revenue declined 1.4% to $912.3 million
from year-earlier second quarterly revenues of $925.5
million.
   For the six months, Greyhound Dial posted a net loss of
$43.9 million, or $1.12 a share, compared with a year-ago
profit of $50.5 million, or $1.30 a share. That included the
$100 million bankruptcy charge for the bus line. In the most
recent first half, the company had income from continuing
operations of $56 million up 11% from year ago income from
continuing operations of $50.5 million.
   First half revenue rose slightly to $1.78 billion from
$1.77 billion.

   ATLANTA -- Federal officials investigating the fatal 1989
crash of a Southern Co. plane said they were unable to
determine the cause of the on-board fire that brought down
the aircraft.
   In its final report, the National Transportation Safety
Board said it could find no evidence that a lightning strike,
a mechanical malfunction or a bomb triggered the blaze aboard
the Beech 200 April 10, 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jacob F. Horton, senior vice president of Southern's Gulf
Power unit, died in the crash, along with the plane's two
pilots. Transcripts from the cockpit voice recorder showed
that the three men became aware of a fire at the plane's rear
and the pilots attempted to radio for help about a minute
before the aircraft slammed into an apartment complex in
Pensacola, Fla.
   The NTSB report said that the failure of the plane's crew
to put on oxygen masks, to cut the effect of smoke and fumes
in the cockpit, "contributed to the accident."
   In a statement responding to the report, Southern Company
Services Inc., the Southern unit that owned the plane, said
it was disappointed that the fire's origin remains unknown.
But Allen Franklin, the unit's president, said "perhaps
additional information will come to light through the legal
process."
   Last year, lawyers for Mr. Horton's estate filed suit
against the Southern subsidiary, alleging that sloppy
maintenance and operation of the plane led to the crash.
Southern Co. has since filed a counterclaim, alleging that
actions taken by Mr. Horton himself caused the fire.

   ST. LOUIS -- General Dynamics Corp., in an effort to shore
up its troubled A-12 Navy attack-plane program, said it
placed several senior executives on special assignment,
including Herbert F. Rogers, president and chief operating
officer.
   Mr. Rogers will relocate to Fort Worth, Texas, where the
plane program is located, and assume the duties of general
manager of the Fort Worth division. Mr. Rogers will continue
to report directly to Stanley C. Pace, chairman and chief
executive officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   William A. Anders, General Dynamics' vice chairman, will
assume Mr. Rogers's corporate management duties. The new
assignments "will not change the timetable" of Mr. Anders's
scheduled appointment as chairman and chief executive officer
of the company Jan. 1, a spokesman said.
   Charles A. Anderson, corporate vice president and general
manager of the Fort Worth division, will become program
director of the A-12. John A. Lamers, vice president of the
A-12 program, will become deputy program director.
   Mr. Pace said the new assignments will help focus
necessary corporate and division resources on the A-12. The
company last week took a $450 million charge against
second-quarter earnings for the delayed program, resulting in
a net loss of $240 million. General Dynamics' partner in the
program, McDonnell Douglas Corp., didn't take any such
charge.
   In addition to improving performance on the A-12 contract,
Mr. Rogers's special assignment "will assure that the other
important aircraft and business programs of the division
receive continued management focus," Mr. Pace said.

   Time Warner Had
   $189 Million Loss
   In Second Quarter

   NEW YORK -- Debt-laden Time Warner Inc. posted a
second-quarter loss of $189 million after interest payments
and dividends, while operating profit declined in magazines
and book publishing and rose only modestly in recorded music
and at the Home Box Office unit.
   Time Warner's operating cash flow -- the figure the
company views as the best measure of its performance before
deducting expenses related to its recent merger and
approximately $10.6 billion in debt -- rose only 3.3% in the
quarter, to $536 million. Operating profit actually fell 1.1%
from a year earlier, to $268 million; that figure is pretax
earnings before paying interest and after deducting
depreciation and other merger-related items.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner's results, as expected, continue to be hurt by
the cost of paying for the former Time Inc.'s acquisition of
Warner Communications Inc. And the combined company's debt
actually inched upward in the second quarter, rising by about
$100 million as the company acquired Lane Publishing Co. and
made other, smaller investments.
   Total revenue in the quarter rose a scant 4% to $2.59
billion from $2.48 billion in the year-earlier period, whose
results have been restated as if the merger had already been
in place. Time Warner's loss of $189 million, or $3.29 a
share, compared with a similar loss of $3.32 a share for the
year-earlier period. The loss comes after the company paid
$138 million in dividends on preferred used to complete the
merger. Without the dividends, the loss would have been $51
million, a figure that the company insists is the better
measure of its quarterly finances.
   First Boston Corp. analyst Jessica Reif said the
second-quarter numbers were unimpressive and slightly below
her expectations -- and would have been even worse but for a
$15 million dividend that Time Warner received from its stake
in Turner Broadcasting System Inc. She worries that
Entertainment Weekly, budgeted at a $35 million loss for this
year, is likely to run a deficit of $50 million.
   Emanuel Gerard of Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co., an
institutional research firm, said Time Warner is more likely
to disappoint investors with earnings downturns than to
delight them with upside surprises in the next two years.
"The only thing that will make this stock go up is a
financial event, a major asset sale at a price that blows
everyone away," said Mr. Gerard, who is a former executive of
Warner.
   Yet Time Warner so far has stuck to its pledge, made when
the merger was announced, that it won't sell off any major
operations. Despite the mixed results, company executives
said in a statement that they were "pleased with the
continued strength and contributions that each of our
businesses is making to the growth of Time Warner."
   Time Warner's results were hurt by a profit decline of 15%
in magazines, which included a $12 million loss in the
quarter on the new publication Entertainment Weekly. Profit
fell a sharp 56% in book publishing, reflecting the absence
of income from Scott Foresman, the unit that was sold late
last year. But even excluding Scott Foresman, results were
only flat.
   Profit was up only 5% in music and 6% at the HBO cable
channel but a strong 23% in the Warner Bros. movie division
and 18% in cable systems. Cable profits, however, rose
largely on acquisitions of local systems.
   For the first half, the loss was $376 million or $6.54 a
share, compared with a restated $406 million loss, or $7.15 a
share. Included are $274 million in dividend payments in the
most recent period and a similar amount a year earlier.
First-half revenue rose to $5.33 billion from $5.03 billion.
   Time Warner common closed at $93, down $1.875 in a
similarly declining market overall, in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. The company's preferred had a
smaller decline, with the most watched issue, the D series,
falling 37.5 cents to $42.

<LP>
   Investors who thought they could just sit back and watch
the stock market coast ever higher got a rude shock
yesterday.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 105-point drop in the
first hour of trading showed once again how volatile stock
prices can be.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But many advisers say the average investor who is in the
market for the long term probably shouldn't rush to make any
changes based on a single day's events. "People are going to
come around to the view that the less often they move money
around, the better off they'll be," John Bogle, chairman of
Vanguard Group, the big Valley Forge, Pa.-based mutual fund
company, says. "Extremes of optimism and pessimism may lead
you to do the wrong thing."
   For the minority of aggressive traders who do make changes
based on daily market moves, some Wall Street strategists say
this could be the time to lighten up a bit. "This is not
something that's going to be over in a few days," Byron Wien,
U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., says.
   At the same time, however, he says this isn't "the
beginning of a bear market. It's only a correction of 10% or
less, and we are already at least one-third of the way
through it." Bargain-hunters may want to look for buying
opportunities "among stocks that have been destroyed in the
last week or so, where the problems are temporary."
   Other market pros advise aggressive investors to run
against the herd. "Wall Street is manic-depressive," Michael
Metz, chief market analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., says. "Try
to capitalize on both sides. Sell when it's manic, and buy
when it's depressed."
   Philip Hummer, a partner at Wayne Hummer &amp; Co., says many
of that Chicago brokerage and money management firm's clients
would do well to use the market drop as a buying opportunity.
Many of them have only 10% of their investment dollars in
stocks, preferring the greater stability of fixed-income
investments, he says. Yet over the past several decades,
stocks have far outpaced the alternatives and delivered
average returns of about 10% a year.
   Dennis Gurtz, a Washington financial planner, agrees that
shareholders unnerved by the stock market's gyrations should
try to focus on the historical trend. "They should just
remember why they bought what they bought to begin with --
for the long-term growth," he says.
   Mr. Gurtz generally recommends that investors buy into the
stock market in regular installments over time, a strategy
called dollar cost averaging. He says investors might want to
accelerate some of their buying if the market continues to
slide in the near term.
   The reasons for yesterday's market decline included higher
interest rates in Japan, lower-than-expected earnings late
Friday at big companies such as Texas Instruments Inc. and
McDonald's Corp., and the realization that the industrial
average mightn't soon break through 3000 points, after all --
a level at which some traders had planned to sell.
   Vanguard's Mr. Bogle notes that even after yesterday's
decline, the stock market remains expensive by a number of
historic yardsticks, including ratios of price to dividends,
to earnings, and to book value.
   For the past 60 years, he says, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock index has sold for an average dividend yield of 4.5%,
an average 13.9 times the past 12 months' earnings, and 1.6
times book value, or assets minus liabilities. Yet even after
yesterday's decline, he says, the market's price level
remained higher by all three benchmarks -- at a 3.4% yield,
16.1 times the past 12 months' earnings, and 2.5 times book
value. The lower current yield number means the price is a
higher multiple of the current dividend.
   Still, for investors who have thought through how much of
their assets should be in stocks for the long haul, pulling
out isn't a good idea, some market advisers say, because they
would run the risk of missing the next big market upsurge.
And historically, the bulk of stocks' extra returns have come
in short, unexpected bursts, the pros note.
   "Your first reflex may be to push the sell button," John
Markese, director of research for the American Association of
Individual Investors in Chicago, says. But "that doesn't make
any sense at all," he says.
   Over time, Mr. Markese says, such market swings should
cancel out.

second-quarter net loss of $15.7 million, or $1.09 a share,
after adding $25 million to its allowance for possible loan
losses.
   Howard is one of many thrifts that have been hurt by weak
real estate markets in the Northeast. Howard's nonperforming
loans climbed 25% from March 31 to stand at $503 million as
of June 30.

   Midsummer Michigan Primary Once Again Pits
   Candidates Reflecting 2 Faces of Republicanism

   SAGINAW, Mich. -- The 1988 Republican presidential
campaign, safely tucked away in the trundle beds of memory
just about everywhere, is still causing restive nights here
in Michigan.
   For 17 months of elections, caucuses, conventions, court
fights, bickering and threats, the state's Republicans turned
against themselves in a savage blood feud. Grown men threw
ferocious tantrums at the doors of party meetings. Elderly
women in wheelchairs slugged opponents in the nose. Hardly
anyone knew what they were fighting about, but the conflict
between the establishment forces of George Bush and the more
activist, populist legions of Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson
became a symbol of the struggle over the character of the
GOP.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now that battle is entering another phase, spilling over
onto the Aug. 7 Republican primary to select a challenger to
face Democratic Sen. Carl Levin in November. With many wounds
still unhealed, Michigan's weary GOP voters must choose
between Rep. Bill Schuette, a modern version of the old-guard
Midwestern Republican, or Clark Durant, who speaks the new
mantra of entrepreneurism and market choices.
   "These," says Brooks Patterson, who was Mr. Bush's
campaign co-chairman in Michigan in 1988, "are two
Republicans who represent two views of the party."
   Mr. Schuette is the favorite, but there are too many
variables in a midsummer primary, being held at a time when
many of the GOP voters are more interested in tanning lotion
than tax policy, to be certain of the outcome. With a
dedicated band of -- this is not too severe a word --
zealots, Mr. Durant is giving Mr. Schuette a lesson from the
millions of automobiles that still are produced in this
state: Objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear.
   Mr. Schuette is proceeding cautiously, emphasizing his
support from the GOP establishment. He has the backing of
county chairmen in 61 of the state's 83 counties and the
support of 51 of the 70 Republicans in the state Legislature.
He has the endorsement of the National Association of
Homebuilders, the National Federation of Independent
Businesses, the American Medical Association, the American
Bankers Association and the Michigan Farm Bureau.
   The Schuette strategy is to act as if Mr. Durant doesn't
exist. "We've made this a Bill Schuette-Carl Levin race," Mr.
Schuette says. "My gunsights are right on Carl Levin."
   Mr. Durant, however, has taken direct aim at Mr. Schuette.
"The choice is a status-quo, conventional, establishment
Republican or an opportunity-oriented populist," he says.
"The party is going to have to make this decision sometime."
   The other night, when a questioner at a candidates' forum
in the Detroit suburbs blamed the Democrats for the
high-spending ways of Washington, Mr. Durant interrupted:
"We're both guilty."
   Last week, Mr. Durant began a new offensive designed to
underscore his status as an outsider. The charge: Mr.
Schuette "voted along with the pack" and supported the
savings-and-loan bailout, which Mr. Durant described as one
of those typical Washington "giveaways."
   The counter-charge: Mr. Durant invested more than $50,000
in a Texas thrift. "Here's a guy who's totally against the
S&amp;L bailout and yet he invested money in a Texas S&amp;L that got
$1.3 billion in government tax write-offs," says Douglas
McAuliffe, the Schuette campaign director.
   The response: "I put some savings in a bank because I
wanted a good return," Mr. Durant says. "I didn't cost the
taxpayer anything. He cost them billions with his vote."
   Mr. Durant has been speaking his anti-government idiom for
years; in 1976, in an act of political apostasy, he supported
Ronald Reagan against Michigan's own Gerald Ford. When
President Reagan appointed him chairman of the Legal Services
Corp., he tried (unsuccessfully) to cut its budget sharply
and trim its purview. He helped salvage the bankrupt Ann
Arbor Railroad, a state-owned and state-subsidized, 47-mile
spur from Ann Arbor to Toledo, Ohio, transforming it, he
tells campaign audiences, from "a tax user to a tax payer."
   But he is best known in Michigan for refusing to defect
with the Kemp forces who in early 1988 abandoned an alliance
with Pat Robertson and went with George Bush. Mr. Durant, a
national co-chairman of the Kemp campaign, clung to what he
called the "Anybody But Bush" effort. "Clark is the last of
the believers," says John Buckley, who was press secretary to
the Kemp campaign.
   Many of the novices who swarmed into politics in the
Robertson campaign now have drifted into the Durant camp.
"This isn't the Robertson campaign reborn, but it's the kind
of campaign that a lot of the Robertson people feel
comfortable in," says Marlene Elwell, a principal Robertson
organizer who isn't involved in the 1990 Senate primary.
   The 36-year-old Mr. Schuette, a rather conventional figure
who would melt easily into the crowd at a Bush fund-raiser in
any downtown hotel, may have erred in permitting himself to
become the issue rather than his opponent, who is often
regarded as a quirky iconoclast and a "bomb thrower," even by
his allies. The editors of the Monroe Guardian, a weekly
newspaper published in a blue-collar corner of southeast
Michigan, may have underlined Mr. Schuette's vulnerability
when they wrote in their endorsement of Mr. Durant that he
"appears to have a clear vision of what America should be,
while Schuette appears to have only a vision of himself in
office."
   But Mr. Schuette isn't any bland Babbitt. "He's a
moderate," says Patrick Anderson, an ardent conservative who
is the former president of the Farmington Area Republican
Club, "but a good moderate." He's taking a gamble, moreover,
by relinquishing a safe seat in the northern half of
Michigan's Lower Peninsula covering the rolling farms, inland
lakes and small towns west of Saginaw Bay that spawned Thomas
E. Dewey and today is a patchwork of knotty-pine fishing
cottages, hunting lodges and chemical plants.
   Mr. Schuette himself is the son of a Dow Chemical plant
manager and the stepson of a retired Dow chairman, and at age
31 he defeated three-term Democratic Rep. Donald Albosta, a
sugar-beet farmer, by 1,314 votes. Soon he became the House's
most outspoken voice for Michigan's dry edible beans, winning
his constituents' loyalty by closing a loophole that
depressed bean prices. By 1988, when he won with 73% of the
vote, he was campaigning as "Michigan's congressman" and soon
began describing himself at Lincoln Day dinners -- he spoke
at 25 in the first 90 days of 1989 -- as "a footsoldier in
Congress when Ronald Reagan made our revolution of ideas a
reality."
   Mr. Schuette brags that he was "for George Bush before it
was cool" -- he supported Mr. Bush over Mr. Reagan in 1980 --
but he broke with the president this summer when Mr. Bush
indicated that tax revenues had to be part of a budget
agreement. "If you raise taxes, you turn the throttle off,
shut off the steam of the economy, and there will be no gas
for growth," he says.
   But Mr. Durant, 41 years old, likes to say that while Mr.
Schuette supports "no new taxes," he supports even lower
taxes. "No new taxes is not a good enough answer," he says.
"We penalize labor, capital, savings, thrift and risk-taking,
and you can't compete with that."
   Republicans hope, perhaps vainly, that the bitterness that
started with the first round of precinct-level elections that
kicked off the 1988 campaign four years ago will finally
dissipate after next month's primary. "Carl Levin is far more
liberal than the average Michigan resident," says GOP state
Sen. Richard Posthumus, who hasn't endorsed either man.
"Party people know that the destruction has to be kept under
control so we can talk about taxes and foreign policy in the
fall against a very vulnerable incumbent."

   GERMAN WOMEN: LEFT OUT?

   Women feel left out as the two Germanys move toward
unification, the West German Women's Council said.
   "Half the population is being shut out of the unification
process," the council said after a meeting of about 80
women's groups representing more than 10 million women in
West Germany. The council criticized the West German
government over the treaty being negotiated with East Germany
for the social union of the two countries.
   "In the second state treaty (on social issues) there is no
perceptible concept of women or children's issues," Council
Chairwoman Brunhilde Fabricius said.
   One of the major social issues dividing the two Germanys
as they prepare for unification by the end of the year is
abortion. The Bonn Justice Ministry said last week that East
Germany's more liberal abortion laws wouldn't be adopted by a
united Germany.
                                                                                                       

   FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINA
                                                                                                       

   Foreign investment in China fell sharply in the first half
of this year but an easing of foreign sanctions, imposed
after last year's military crackdown, should mean growth in
coming months, a Chinese official said. Liu Xiangdong,
spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade, said the number of new foreign-investment projects
approved during the first half of the year fell 8.1% to 2,784
and their total contracted value slumped 22% to $2.35
billion. He blamed the slump, which occurred despite a steep
rise in investment from Taiwan, partly on what he called
distorted reports by Western media on the political unrest
last year.

   EC HELPS ITS TROUBLED REGIONS
                                                                                                       

   The European Community said it had earmarked 663 million
European currency units ($835.3 million) to help
underdeveloped regions in the 12-nation trade bloc. Spain
will get the largest share, with 514 million ECUs for
scientific-research programs in Andalusia, Asturias and
Castilla-La-Mancha. Among other beneficiaries, two
industrially declining regions in England and three in
Scotland will share 60.6 million ECUs.
                                                                                                       

   PHILIPPINE CAR PROGRAM
                                                                                                       

   The Philippine Trade and Industry Department said that
only car makers that sell their basic models at 175,000 pesos
(about $7,700) per unit can participate in the nation's
so-called people's car program. The program was launched
early this year by the department to make more cars
affordable to consumers. The department made the price
announcement after speculation arose that participants in the
program would be allowed to raise their retail prices to
200,000 pesos per unit because of the steady depreciation of
the peso and higher labor costs.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH TV PROJECT
                                                                                                       

   The French government said it would provide state-owned
Thomson S.A. with three billion francs ($545.2 million) over
the next five years to finance the electronics group's
research and development in the field of high-definition
television, familiarly called HDTV. In May, Thomson linked up
with NV Philips of the Netherlands in a 20-billion-franc HDTV
joint research and development program over five years and
has already devoted six billion francs to its HDTV research.
                                                                                                       

   MEXICAN PRICES
                                                                                                       

   Mexican Labor Secretary Arsenio Farell Cubillas said his
government would take further steps this year to restrict
increases in prices and wages, the daily newspaper El
Universal reported; he didn't specify what those steps would
be. His statements, in an interview, came as opposition
lawmakers lashed out at the government's wage- and
price-control program and demanded higher wages to meet
rising prices. Mr. Farell was quoted as saying that higher
wages would mean higher prices because they would raise
industrial and manufacturing costs.
                                                                                                       

   GAS MASKS FOR POLLUTED POLAND
                                                                                                       

   Poland is considering issuing gas masks in the southern
part of the country to protect people from air pollution, an
official said today.
   A proposal is being drafted to distribute the masks in
heavily industrialized Katowice province, said Col. Czeslaw
Bujala of the provincial Civil Defense Office. Air pollution
is particularly severe in Katowice, which accounts for 20% of
Poland's industrial output. A 1988 report said the province
is home to a quarter of Poland's 900 worst-polluting plants.
   The province has 1,053 factories making hazardous
materials or using them for production, the Zycie Warszawy
newspaper reported. It said initial plans call for
distributing gas masks to up to 100,000 people, particularly
those living near seven plants considered the most dangerous
in case of accidental emissions.
   Col. Bujala said the gas-mask plan still must be approved
by Civil Defense headquarters, he said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan rejected a Chinese offer of two pandas. A Taiwan
official said the rejection wasn't a political move. Taiwan
zoologists don't have the know-how to raise the animals, the
nation's Council of Agriculture said. . . . Some 70,000
immigrants have come to Israel so far this year, most from
the Soviet Union, Immigration Minister Yitzhak Peretz told a
parliamentary committee. He predicted 20,000 immigrants a
month from August onwards.

   WE'RE STILL STUDYING new IRS pension regulations,
companies say.
   The proposed rules aimed at assuring that retirement plans
don't discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees
run 388 pages and "there are some areas we're not sure what
the IRS meant," says United Technologies Corp. So the company
doesn't yet know whether it will have to rewrite its
retirement plans to comply with the regulations, which are
scheduled to take full effect next year. Campbell Soup Co.,
too, says "it is a little premature."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. figures it will have to make "minor
changes but certainly nothing major." But Potomac Electric
Power Co. still has its "benefits accounting people and
actuaries" assessing how the utility will be affected. If
midlevel executives at Hershey Foods Corp. are worried their
pensions may be pinched, they haven't voiced complaints yet.
"I don't think they really understand what is going on," an
official says.
   United Parcel Service is too tied up with labor
negotiations to judge what the rules "mean to us."
                                                                                                       

   CANADA, TOO, rewrites pension regulations, curbing some
retirement savings.
   Canada's federal government doesn't require any
nondiscrimination tests like those imposed in the U.S. That
seems to be "a U.S. peculiarity," says Robert Heitzman of
consultant Kwasha Lipton. But, like the U.S., Canada does
limit the amount of tax-deferred retirement benefits that a
worker may accrue, and these are being curtailed by Canada's
new tax legislation that takes effect next year.
   The new rules say that no more than 18% of earnings, to a
maximum of 15,500 Canadian dollars a year, may be set aside
in an employee's retirement arrangements, including the
Canadian equivalent of individual retirement accounts and
corporate pension plans. Previously there had been only
separate limits. The new rules also restrict worker savings
at companies that compute pensions on the basis of career
earnings rather than final pay, Mr. Heitzman says.
                                                                                                       

   BLAME UNION ACTIVISM for job losses, an economist says.
   Unionization by itself doesn't lie at the root of
declining manufacturing employment, says Michael Zimmer, a
professor of economics at the University of Evansville in
Indiana. Instead, he says, look at the propensity of unions
to strike. Workers are more likely to strike in
"union-intense industries," especially in the durable-goods
field. And as strikes increase, workers are more apt to lose
their jobs, Mr. Zimmer says.
   The impact, moreover, lingers. "Industries that strike for
longer durations tend to be characterized by diminished
future job prospects," he says. And workers forced out in a
retrenchment following a strike often must settle for less
pay when they finally do find employment. Competition from
foreign manufacturers intensifies the job loss, pushing
workers to look for work in other fields, the economist
contends.
   "I think he's ignoring much bigger economic factors," a
spokesman for the AFL-CIO responds.
                                                                                                       

   PATERNALISM IS GONE. Half the major manufacturers surveyed
by the Conference Board say they now have only a
"business-financial" relationship with employees. Fully 70%
say workers should move on if that will further their
careers.
                                                                                                       

   MIXED FEELINGS. Three of four chief executives think
federally mandated health care would make their jobs easier
but only one in six favor it, the Employers Council on
Flexible Compensation says. They worry short-term savings
will give way to higher costs over the long term.
                                                                                                       

   MEA CULPA. Nearly 17% of 1,900 applicants at two local
public-safety agencies admit they committed recent crimes
serious enough to disqualify them from employment, says Reid
Psychological Systems, which publishes personnel tests.
                                                                                                       

   AMERICAN WORKERS are worse than their foreign
counterparts, CEOs believe by a slight margin, Continental
Bank says. But the executives vote almost 4 to 1 that
American management is better.
                                                                                                       

   HIGH SCHOOL COACHES are tough to recruit in districts
offering puny pay.
   "We find ourselves with coaches with no experience
whatsoever," bemoans Lloyd Williams, athletic director of
Memphis city schools. State law, he explains, requires that
all coaches be certified teachers. But coaching stipends run
to only $1,200 a year for a head football coach, so few are
willing to take on the after-class chore. West Mifflin, Pa.,
School Superintendent John Kresovich complains "we have fewer
and fewer applicants from our staff each year."
   But generous pay and winning teams attract applicants to
some Texas and Louisiana schools. Aldine Independent School

   Sugar Subsidies
   Assailed for Drug,

   WASHINGTON -- Congressional foes of U.S. sugar subsidies,
after years of taking their lumps in floor fights, are
invoking the environment and the war on drugs in their battle
against one of the most powerful lobbies in town.
   In a clash that could crystallize the shape of a number of
commodity programs for the next five years, opponents are
making the case that the U.S. policy of curtailing imports of
low-cost sugar so as to prop up domestic sugar prices has
contributed to the boom in Peruvian and Bolivian coca
production and the influx of cocaine into U.S. cities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Throughout the 1980s, (shrinking) U.S. import quotas
pushed the Andean farmer out of sugar while the increase in
cocaine consumption pulled him toward coca," Sen. Bill
Bradley (D., N.J.) asserted in a letter to his colleagues.
   The argument has been embraced by some anti-drug and
law-enforcement groups that are raising their voices in the
current debate over the 1990 farm bill. But sugar-program
defenders dismiss the notion of a sugar-coca connection as
unsubstantiated "trash" and accuse the other side of waging a
"huge misinformation campaign."
   Another fresh argument being circulated on Capitol Hill
goes to perceived environmental repercussions of the sugar
program. The subsidized expansion of Florida's sugar cane
industry is polluting the fragile Everglades, nine
environmental and consumer groups warned in a July 13 letter.
At the same time, lawmakers are being told how coca-leaf
processors are dumping toxic chemicals into the headwaters of
the Amazon River.
   Just how persuasive these arguments are should be known
today when the House and the Senate are due to vote on the
sugar provisions of the $54 billion, five-year farm bill.
Floor fights are anticipated in both chambers.
   "Sugar will be the first real bellwether vote " on the
bill, said a top aide to House Agriculture Committee Chairman
Kika de la Garza (D., Texas). "It will be the first test of
strength" for would-be reformers of the government's vast
subsidy programs.
   The sugar growers are counting on Rep. de la Garza and
other rural members to beat back the attack on sugar once
again. Sugar production is so profitable that another victory
would be worth every cent of the $2.4 million in campaign
contributions that sugar growers and corn-sweetener
manufacturers have given lawmakers since the last farm-bill
vote in 1985.
   But a loss on sugar would give great impetus to plans for
overhauling the peanut, honey and wool-mohair programs and
would strengthen the hand of a reform coalition led by Reps.
Dick Armey (R., Texas) and Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), who
are intent on outlawing cash subsidies to farmers earning
$100,000 a year or more.
   Today's scheduled votes on sugar, besides gauging the
power of well-heeled political action committees, also will
test the willingness of Congress to put broad consumer
concerns and trade policy objectives ahead of agriculture's
special interests.
   Mr. Bradley calls the current policy of sugar
protectionism "an absolute disaster," adding that "it has
guaranteed high prices to sugar growers at the expense of all
Americans" while depriving poor sugar-producing nations of
export earnings. Every year since 1985, he and other critics
have assailed sugar price supports as "a hidden tax" on U.S.
consumers without ever making any political headway.
   But now Sen. Bradley, Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.) and
other sugar foes are relying heavily on the argument
regarding the sugar-coca connection to line up votes for
their "modest" proposal to lop two cents off the current
support price of 18 cents a pound.
   They base their case mostly on a study by Roberto Abusada,
a prominent Peruvian economist with a Cornell University
doctorate. The study was commissioned by the Washington law
firm of Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow, which represents several major
food processors who stand to profit from lower sugar prices.
   Mr. Abusada found, among other things, that the rise of
coca production in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley during the
1980s coincided with the collapse of the sugar industry on
coastal lowlands during the 1980s, and that sugar workers
migrated across the Andes to grow coca in the valley, where
Colombian cocaine traffickers obtain most of their coca
supply.
   U.S. sugar growers hotly challenge this idea. "This really
burns me," said Dalton Yancey, lobbyist for Florida and Texas
sugar cane growers. "It is a big cheap shot" and "a hoax" to
benefit Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow clients. Mr. Yancey contended
that the nationalization of Peru's sugar industry was a
greater factor in its decline than cuts in the U.S. import
quota for Peruvian sugar, and he scoffed at the idea of
Peruvian sugar workers migrating anywhere.
   But several key lawmakers are persuaded of the sugar-coca
link and favor a two-cent cut in the sugar support price,
which would have the effect of letting more foreign sugar
into the U.S. The quota system, said Rep. Sam Gibbons (D.,
Fla.), "just encourages poor nations to raise dope."
   Even a skeptic, Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.), chairman
of the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said
he sees the need for opening up U.S. markets. "It's very
difficult," he said, "for (Andean) governments to insist on
eradication of the coca crop when they cannot find markets
for substitute crops."
   U.S. sugar growers maintain that the sugar program must be
preserved as long as the European Community insists on
heavily subsidizing sugar production and dumping surpluses on
the world market. But Sen. Bradley and others contend that a
two-cent cut would force the European Community's hand in
negotiations over trade-distorting farm subsidies.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Folklore and Furnace: A Tale of Two NEA Grantees

   As Congress prepares to debate the renewal of the
controversial National Endowment for the Arts, in an
atmosphere electric with furor about obscenity, it seems
appropriate to take a dispassionate look at what the NEA does
and how it affects typical recipients. In other words, what
does the endowment do for the arts and how would its
elimination affect the arts public?
   Endowment grants are rarely large -- 89% are below $50,000
-- yet they are effective. During the 1980s, $237 million in
NEA challenge grants was matched by more than $2 billion in
private contributions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All this means that if the NEA were to disappear tomorrow,
our best-known arts institutions still would be around,
though a bit poorer. At New York's Metropolitan Museum, for
example, the endowment helps fund the temperature-control
system, a low-glamour necessity that doesn't attract
high-profile corporate donors.
   The congressional debate could, however, profoundly affect
the future of the little guys and newcomers, namely the more
than 1,000 orchestras, opera companies, dance troupes and
others that sprouted up after 1965. The diversity of these
groups is self-evident. Here's a closer look at two NEA
recipients that arguably represent opposite ends of the
social/intellectual spectrum -- rural Appalshop Roadside
Theater and urban Franklin Furnace Archives Inc., an
avant-garde performance and exhibition space in New York.
   On a sultry Saturday last month, some 3,000 Appalachian
hill folks descended on an old fort in tiny Nickelsville,
Va., for their third annual summer festival. There were hot
dogs and crafts booths and a spirited reenactment of the
Civil War. There also was an extremely polished presentation
of traditional mountain tales, punctuated by a lively chorus
of banjos and guitars, and lyrics that were pure hill: "And
Satan said, `I been the devil for all my life, but I never
seen hell 'till I seen your wife.'"
   The tall tales and twangy tunes came courtesy of
Appalshop, an award-winning performance troupe based a couple
mountains away in the little mining town of Whitesburg, Ky.
For nearly 20 years, Appalshop has brought its flavorful
rendition of Theater Americana to rural hotspots like
Nickelsville, where there isn't a theater for miles. The
company also has dispensed hillbilly high culture in big
cities such as New York, San Francisco and even London.
   Appalshop, which began life in 1969 as part of the War on
Poverty program, is Appalachia's biggest arts organization,
with an FM radio station, a documentary film company, a
record company and a theater, all under the roof of a neatly
renovated Whitesburg warehouse. With a full-time staff of 37,
it also is one of the biggest employers in economically
depressed Letcher County, where Whitesburg is situated. Not
surprisingly, Appalshop has a tight budget, with funds
cobbled together from the usual sources, including state arts
councils, foundations, private donations, ticket sales and
the NEA.
   The beleagured endowment is by no means Appalshop's only
economic source. The NEA accounted for about 18% of the
organization's $1.6 million budget this year. But in some
ways, it is Appalshop's best source. "It's a credibility
factor," says Dee Davis, a Kentucky-born member of Appalshop.
"When people come down here and see what we do in context,
they're willing to support us. But if they can't do that, the
NEA is a way of proving to people that our work has merit."
   Pretty patchwork quilts adorn the walls at Appalshop's
airy red brick warehouse, refurbished several years ago with
the help of a $10,000 NEA grant. Yet if the NEA suddenly
evaporated, Appalshop probably could limp along. "People
won't suddenly stop making music or telling stories down here
because there isn't any government money," says Ron Short, an
Appalshop actor and writer. Things would be tough, however.
With unemployment unofficially topping 50% and no big
corporations, Appalachia isn't bursting with local art
patrons or corporate donors. And despite Appalshop's
energetic efforts rounding up funds from foundations and
state arts councils, a loss of NEA cash infusions would
curtail activities, leaving locals even more dependent on
television.
   In its fledgling days, Appalshop "wouldn't have had a
snowball's chance" without the NEA, says Mr. Davis. In the
1960s, the arts largely were an urban phenomenon. What the
NEA did was acknowledge less-mainstream art forms, like folk
art, and help them thrive, he says. "There's been an opening
up of the definition of the arts in this country, and without
the NEA, we may go back to the narrow patron-defined system
of arts."
   From Appalshop's perspective, the one happy surprise to
come from the NEA imbroglio is a new infusion of sponsorship
interest. Given the current obsession with obscenity and art,
big foundations are cautiously choosing who to support. And
these days, Appalshop seems as wholesome and American as the
Stars and Stripes.
   Things are different up north in New York, where Franklin
Furnace, a 15-year-old "alternative" space that presents and
preserves avant-garde art, is having trouble. Earlier this
year, the New York Fire Department deemed its basement
performance space a safety hazard and closed it, apparently
acting on a tip from someone who didn't like the show. Then
the U.S. General Accounting Office began investigating
Franklin Furnace performances by several artists, including
the now-famous Karen Finley, after complaints that their work
was obscene. And though Franklin Furnace has received NEA
grants regularly for years, its latest application is
languishing in the endowment's Grants Office.
   Franklin Furnace, billeted in a no-frills storefront near
Chinatown, has raised eyebrows -- and hackles -- before, most
famously with its 1984 show "Carnival Knowledge," which
featured art by women in the pornography industry, including
ex-porn star Annie Sprinkle. "The work wasn't pro porn, but
we lost a couple of corporate sponsors over that," says
Barbara Pollack, a Furnace spokeswoman. But until its recent
notoriety, Franklin Furnace was known beyond art circles, if
at all, for launching the careers of Eric Bogosian,
motor-mouth star of the film "Talk Radio," and artist Jenny
Holzer, who represented the U.S. at this year's Venice
Biennale. The gallery also has an extensive collection of
avant-garde artists' books.
   Like Appalshop, Franklin Furnace probably owes its early
existence to NEA largesse. During the 1970s, modest NEA
grants helped places like Franklin Furnace devote themselves
to work by young artists, particularly those outside the
mainstream. "This is the R&amp;D of the art world," says Susan
Wyatt, director of Artists Space, a New York alternative
space. "The endowment has had a tremendous impact with very
tiny amounts of money."
   The Furnace is specially known for presentations by solo
performers, the angry, noisy artists whose favorite props are
their own bodies and bodily fluids. Martha Wilson, director
of Franklin Furnace, sounds a bit shell shocked as she
defends her performers' work, which is misunderstood, not
obscene, she says. The chocolate syrup Ms. Finley smears on
her nearly naked body in her most celebrated performance is
there to show women as victims. It must be seen in context,
she explains. Ms. Wilson is particularly annoyed that Ms.
Finley's loudest critics have not actually seen her perform.
"They don't care why Karen Finley smears chocolate syrup on
her breasts," she says.
   Earlier this month, the NEA denied grants to four
performers, all Franklin Furnace alumni who had received
grants in previous years. Ms. Finley was among the
de-granted. "I am told I have the freedom to perform anywhere
I want as long as it's not with public money. Yet all of the
art spaces and museums across our country are publicly
funded."
   That's the big concern at Franklin Furnace, where NEA
money accounts for between 5% and 10% of the $400,000 budget.
But the Furnace may have found a way out, through
conventional, but for it alternative, fund-raising methods.
It staged a successful $100-a-ticket benefit this month. The
approximately $17,000 raised will help keep Franklin Furnace
open if it loses its much-needed NEA grant.

   The Man Who Saved Russia...With Capitalism

   Mikhail Gorbachev ostensibly wants to dismantle his
centrally-planned economy. But after five years, the Soviet
Union is still mired in slothfulness and inefficiency. Why?
Because Mr. Gorbachev has not kept up the pace of his
domestic reforms.
   When Mr. Gorbachev took office in the spring of 1985, he
is said to have commissioned a study of the Stolypin reforms.
Piotr Stolypin was prime minister of Russia in the early 20th
century. Unlike Mr. Gorbachev, Stolypin managed to stave off
national disintegration while reviving a moribund economy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the summer of 1905, the humiliating loss of the war
with Japan precipitated a wave of strikes, mutinies and
pogroms. Czar Nicholas II granted a constitution that
established a democratically-elected parliament in October,
but that step failed to restore order. The following year,
the new parliament called for the resignation of the czarist
government and the expropriation of private property.
   Enter Stolypin. An experienced civil servant, he took over
the government with energy and decisiveness. He quickly
suppressed the revolution, and rewrote the electoral laws to
favor property owners. Stolypin believed that only
broadly-based property ownership could provide the foundation
for democracy and prosperity.
   At the time, agriculture accounted for half the nation's
GNP and an impoverished peasantry constituted 84% of the
population. The peasants lived in approximately 100,000
villages across Russia, most without electricity and some
inaccessible even by road. Their customs had changed little
since the Middle Ages. Land was owned communally by the whole
village and periodically redistributed in an egalitarian
fashion by village elders. Capable individuals had no
incentive to improve their farming practices, since the
rewards would effectively revert back to the commune. The
result was soil exhaustion and technological backwardness.
The peasant commune was a primitive socialist society.
   Stolypin blamed the peasant commune for many of the ills
affecting Russia. Since individual peasants rarely owned any
land of their own, they had no reason to respect anybody
else's property. Whenever the squalor of village life became
unbearable, they attacked the property of landowners,
shopkeepers or whoever else who happened to have more than
they did. These revolts had to be suppressed by force,
propelling Russia into a cycle of revolt and repression.
   Stolypin's solution was privatization. He wagered that the
peasants would leap at the chance to own their farms
independent of the village commune. He enacted a land reform
that gave peasants the right to claim the land they worked as
private property. They could even trade their scattered
strips for American-style homesteads.
   Peasants' distrust of the government ran deep and their
attachment to the village commune was reinforced by centuries
of tradition. But it wasn't long before the benefits of
Stolypin's reform became clear. The individual peasant farmer
could finally try out the innovative techniques he had
dreamed of; finally he could plant alfalfa without having the
village cattle come and eat it all; finally he could skip the
endless bargaining sessions at the village assembly and
concentrate on his own business.
   Within a few years, the creaking provincial bureaucracy
could not survey the lands and draw up the deeds fast enough.
By 1914, over 40% of peasant households held their land as
private property and many more waited for their petitions to
be processed. To the dismay of socialist intellectuals, the
peasants firmly rejected the notion of communal land tenure.
The big gentry estates meanwhile were squeezed out of the
market by more resilient peasant competitors; by 1916, the
gentry farmed only 11% of Russia's farmland.
   As a result, the efficiency of Russia's farming sector
improved dramatically. Russian agricultural production in the
period 1911-1913 was an average of 47% higher than in the
period 1901-1905. Domestic food consumption rose, but
agricultural exports rose even faster, by 61% between the two
periods. Russia solidified its position as the world's
largest exporter of agricultural products. Higher peasant
incomes meant higher consumption of domestic manufactures and
greater accumulation of capital (peasant savings increased
ninefold in nine years). Increased export earnings and the
solidity of the gold-backed ruble encouraged foreign
businessmen who rushed to invest in Russia's booming economy.
   Sadly, Stolypin did not live to see his reforms succeed.
In 1911, while attending a performance at the Kiev Opera
House, he was fatally wounded by a leftist gunman. With its
restructuring only partially complete, Russia was thrown into
the First World War. Strikes and mutinies precipitated a new
revolution in February 1917. Stolypin's newly-empowered
peasants refrained from joining it. But they couldn't hold
back the country's slide into anarchy and terror.
   The lesson of Stolypin's reform is that given economic
freedom, even backward peasants can become entrepreneurial
and politically conservative. Simply put, privatization pays.
But economic reform should be undertaken boldly: Vacillation
only leads to economic deterioration and political
polarization. If he is serious about economic reform, Mr.
Gorbachev needs a prime minister like Stolypin.

   S&amp;L Bailouts
   Put June Budget
   Into a Deficit

   WASHINGTON -- Savings-and-loan bailout costs shoved the
federal budget into a deficit in June, a month when corporate
tax payments usually produce a surplus.
   The government ran an $11.22 billion deficit during the
month, compared with a $7.79 billion surplus in June 1989,
the Treasury said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Weak corporate tax receipts were also to blame. They
failed to reach year-earlier levels, declining to $18.57
billion from $20.88 billion. Overall tax receipts edged up to
$110.61 billion from $108.25 billion. At the same time,
outlays surged to $121.84 billion from $100.46 billion.
   The slowing economy as well as the cost of taking over
failed S&amp;Ls and paying off insured depositors have wreaked
havoc with the federal budget this year. Just last week, the
Bush administration widened its estimate for the fiscal 1990
budget gap to $218.5 billion, including the thrift bailout
costs. Nine months into the fiscal year, the deficit stands
at $163.09 billion, the Treasury said.
   "I was expecting about a $2 billion surplus, which would
have been bad enough," said Stanley Collender, director of
federal budget policy at the accounting firm Price
Waterhouse. "This is close to extraordinary. I don't know how
much longer you can get bad numbers without someone sitting
up and taking notice."
   The Bush administration and congressional leaders have
stepped up the pace in their talks to reach an agreement to
slash the ballooning budget deficit in fiscal 1991, but there
were few signs of progress yesterday.
   In June, the government spent $15.82 billion to resolve
failed S&amp;Ls, the busiest month to date for the bailout.
Without that expense, the government would have posted a $4.6
billion surplus -- a modest number considering that June is a
deadline for quarterly corporate income tax payments.
   The government expects eventually to get back some of the
money it spent taking over failed thrifts by selling off
loans, securities, real estate and other assets inherited
from the institutions. For that reason, some members of
Congress argue that bailout costs shouldn't be included in
the deficit tabulations.
   But even without counting the thrift costs, the deficit
would probably be larger than last year's $151.86 billion
gap, partly because the slowing economy has crimped corporate
profits, leading to lower-than-expected corporate tax
receipts.
   More than $42 billion of federal spending last month went
to pay interest on the federal debt.

   NEW YORK -- Amax Inc. posted a 57% decline in
second-quarter net income, reflecting a slide in aluminum
prices.
   Meanwhile, Asarco Inc.'s earnings were nearly flat, as
increases in lead, zinc and gold prices were offset by a
decline in copper prices.

   Amax, an aluminum, gold and energy company, reported net
fell to $56.9 million, or 65 cents a share, from $130.9
million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier. Operating profit
declined 44%, to $102 million from $181 million.
   Sales fell 8.9% to $984.7 million from $1.08 billion.
Aluminum accounted for nearly two-thirds of Amax's total
sales. Amax said industry ingot prices declined about 26% but
added that the prices appear to have bottomed out.
   Allen Born, Amax chairman and chief executive, said the
company was "encouraged" by its performance so far in light
of the continuing sluggish economy. The quarter's results
included several one-time items, whose net effect was an
after-tax gain of $6.1 million, a spokesman said.
   The second-quarter results were slightly lower than
analysts had predicted. Vahid Fathi, an analyst with
Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben in Cleveland, said in a phone
interview that 1989 was a record year for Amax earnings.
   For the six months, earnings fell 56%, to $106.9 million,
or $1.22 a share, from $245.1 million, or $2.87 a share, a
year ago. Sales fell 7.3%, to $1.91 billion from $2.06
billion.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Amax shares fell 62.5 cents to $25.50.
   Asarco, a nonferrous metals company that also has
interests in specialty chemicals, reported second-quarter net
of $50.2 million, or $1.21 a share, nearly flat with $50.8
million, or $1.20 a share a year ago.
   Sales rose slightly, to $543.1 million from $539.3
million.
   Richard de J. Osborne, chairman, president and chief
executive, said the results "reflect continued good market
fundamentals" for the primary metals Asarco produces.
   Mr. Fathi said he doesn't believe the "strength in copper
is sustainable on a fundamental basis." The analyst said the
recent rise in copper prices, to $1.30 a pound, was a result
of disruptions in supplies by strikes and political unrest in
several copper-producing countries.
   For the six months, Asarco posted a 28% decline in net, to
$86 million, or $2.07 a share, from $119.3 million, or $2.83
a share, a year ago. Sales fell about 8% to $1.06 billion
from $1.16 billion.
   Asarco also said union members at its Ray unit in Arizona
overwhelmingly ratified a wage agreement. About 650 workers
struck the mine July 1 after the previous contract expired;
workers began returning to work last weekend.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Asarco shares also fell 62.5 cents to $27.50.

   NEW YORK -- Stocks tumbled steeply in a broad, deep
sell-off triggered mainly by earnings disappointments.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 56.44, or 1.9%, to
2904.70, putting an unmistakable chill on the Dow's
flirtation with 3000. At the depths of the slide, the
industrials were 105.69 points lower. On the way down,
"circuit breakers" were triggered that briefly halted trading
in major stock-index futures contracts in Chicago, which
helped stanch the selling pressure and allowed the Dow
average to rebound 40 points.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New York Stock Exchange volume swelled to 209,030,000
shares. Declining issues on the Big Board swamped advancing
stocks 1,430 to 227. Program trading, in which institutional
investors and brokers sell big baskets of stock through
rapid-fire electronic trading systems, accentuated the
sell-off. By 11:15 a.m. EDT, 100 million shares had traded in
orderly fashion on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Bad earnings news from several key companies were the main
culprit in the decline, but several other factors also cast a
pall over trading: fears of rising inflation, falling markets
overseas, and financial problems at one of the largest
guarantors of student loans.
   The big rout in stocks lifted U.S. bonds temporarily as
investors sought the safety of Treasury securities. But
eventually the bond market also retreated. The 30-year bond
finished about 1/4 point lower, or down about $2.50 for each
$1,000 face amount.
   U.S. bonds were unable to shake the influence of a big
sell-off earlier yesterday in the Japanese bond market.
Japanese rates can influence those in the U.S. by increasing
the allure of Japanese bonds for Japanese investors. These
investors are less likely to buy U.S. bonds, meaning U.S.
rates must rise to attract other investors.
   Plunging stock prices also sent the dollar tumbling to a
31-month low against the mark and a 27-month low against the
Swiss franc.
   "The dollar was easing off before the stock market plunge.
Then it really accelerated downwards with the stock market
except against the yen," said Andrew Robertson, a vice
president at Chase Manhattan Bank.
   Some analysts termed yesterday's plunge in stock prices a
"correction." But more than a simple shake-out of speculative
excess, yesterday's sell-off marked a reassessment of
earnings growth. "The earnings reports of the past week
served as a cold shower for investors," said James Solloway,
chief economist at Argus Research.
   For about the past nine months, investors have bid up
prices of growth stocks, shares in companies that generate
earnings in tough economic environments because of unique
products and strong franchises. The heights some stock prices
reached seemed to suggest such companies as Home Depot could
somehow keep profits growing no matter how sluggish the
overall economy.
   What resulted was "the most two-tiered market since 1973,"
said Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group
at Salomon Brothers.
   But last week the romance with growth started to fade.
While the Dow teased the 3000 level, thanks to gains in such
wellknown stocks as Coca-Cola, many other popular stocks were
being pummeled 20% or more over several days because their
second-quarter earnings disappointed highly expectant
investors and analysts.
   On Friday alone, Storage Technology, one of the
best-performing stocks on the Big Board this year, nosedived
34%. The company actually beat analysts' earnings
expectations by 27%, but its forecast of softening U.S.
demand caused institutional investors to dump shares.
   McDonald's, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, continued the pattern. Late Friday, the
restaurant chain's results showed foreign operating profit up
38% in the second quarter, but down 3% in the U.S., said
Joseph Doyle, managing director at Smith Barney. McDonald's
fell 3 to 33 on 4.2 million shares.
   With some companies already indicating that third-quarter
earnings may be weaker than expected, Salomon's Mr. Spence
said shifts in investors' expectations could keep rattling
the market.
   More earnings reports are on the way, and few expect them
to be free of negative surprises. Today, reports are expected
from Dow Chemical, a favored stock among value investors, and
Ingersoll Rand, a popular stock with money managers betting
on a capital spending boom. Other companies expected to
report today include Chevron, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Ryder
System, whose stock is in the Dow Jones Transportation
Average.
   Some analysts caution that the selling may last a day or
two more before investors think stocks are cheap enough to
start buying. However, some stocks that were hammered last
week rebounded; Storage Technology gained 5/8 yesterday to 26
3/8.
   Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns, expects
to see some flight away from technology shares into defensive
blue chips such as Merck and General Electric. "I still think
we are going over 3000, and we are going to do it with high
capitalization blue chips. And we are going to do it within a
month," he said.
   Or are the sellers yet to come? Mutual fund groups
reported little reaction among their shareholders. Vanguard
Group, of Valley Forge, Pa., summoned its money market fund
managers, accountants and lawyers to answer a flood of calls
that never came. "Frankly, they're over there twiddling their
thumbs," said a Vanguard spokesman.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks plunged broadly. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost
1.7% as did the Big Board composite index.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond
rose to 8.55%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar dropped. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6220 marks and 148.20 yen, compared with
1.6365 marks and 148.60 yen Friday.

   Environment:
   Conservationists Benefit as S&amp;L Debacle
   Forces Developers to Halt Steam Shovels

   The savings and loan debacle may spell ruin for scores of
developers and financiers, but for the white-crowned pigeon,
it means a new lease on life.
   A few years ago, the shy, dark gray bird was threatened by
aggressive real estate developers, who were advancing
steadily on its only U.S. habitat in the Florida Keys. One
nesting ground -- a 63-acre palm grove -- was surrounded by
two shopping plazas and a subdivision, and investors were
eager to develop it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But now, thanks to the thrift bust, the birds will be
encouraged to stay. The bank holding the grove, American
Savings &amp; Loan of Knoxville, Tenn., collapsed in 1984,
allowing federal regulators to sell the land four years later
to the Florida Keys Land Trust, a conservation group.
   Across the country, nature lovers are claiming land that
once faced certain development but now sits on Uncle Sam's
auction block. Sometimes the property shelters endangered
plants or animals. In other cases, it is the beach or vacant
lot that local governments can finally afford to turn into a
public park. Little wonder that some see the bust as nothing
short of divine retribution.
   The collapse "was an inevitable result of the rampant
greed of the mid-'80s," says Tim Jones, a member of Earth
First], a radical environmental group. "The benefits that
we're getting now are our just deserts."
   Not all conservationists are pleased with the way the
thrift cleanup is proceeding, though. Critics complain that
the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency chartered to
fix the problem, is focusing too much on the bottom line in
its rush to unload assets and too little on environmental
impact. They also worry that the RTC is too disorganized to
figure out which plots may be crucial to wildlife.
   "They're disposing of properties in urban areas the same
way they're dealing with environmentally significant ones,"
says an Environmental Protection Agency official. "You don't
manage a condo the way you'd manage a wetland."
   But for groups that can scrape together the money, now is
a good time to invest in Mother Nature. Federal bailout
managers already hold more than 2,500 pieces of undeveloped
land, some covering thousands of acres, and that total is
expected to climb to as many as 4,000 tracts. Although the
proportion of environmentally valuable property is believed
to be slight -- perhaps just 3% -- it's a big deal to
conservationists.
   The key to dealing successfully with regulators, say those
who have done it, is being able to put down cash up front. In
the case of the Florida Keys Land Trust, that meant
soliciting $1.4 million from everyone in the Keys -- right
down to elementary schoolchildren, who trick-or-treated for
penny and nickel contributions.
   Charles Olson, who negotiated the deal for the land trust,
says regulators said they were sympathetic but pushed for
more money. "I remember a lot of times hearing, `Look, we
like what you're doing, we think it'd be great. But that
doesn't matter. We just want a good business deal for the
taxpayer.'"
   In East Texas, the state Parks and Wildlife Department
transformed 3,000 acres of RTC-owned marsh into a wildlife
preserve. Three real estate brokers had bought the tract,
called Big Lake Bottom, in 1983. But when they still owed
about $1.25 million three years later, they deeded the land
back to their bank, which was eventually taken over by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The department, spotting an
opportunity, picked up the land for about $625,000 and set it
aside as a prime duck habitat.
   Some people have even grander plans. Frank and Deborah
Popper, two Rutgers University academics, have proposed to
transform the Great Plains' prairies into a vast buffalo
refuge, dubbed the "Buffalo Commons." Under the couple's
plan, buffalo and other wildlife would gradually reclaim the
drought-plagued lands being abandoned by farmers and oilmen.
   The large RTC presence in states like Texas and Colorado
is "another building block for the Buffalo Commons that's
already in place," says Mrs. Popper, who argues that any
prairie land the RTC can't sell, along with property
resulting from foreclosures by the Farmers' Home
Administration, should go to the buffalo.
   But such schemes draw exasperated sighs from regulators.
"We are trying to be as responsive as we can to them," says
RTC spokesman Steve Katsanos. But he adds: "The mandate we've
been given is to get as much money as we can for the
taxpayers."
   Despite some legislators' attempts to include strong
environmental guidelines in the thrift bailout legislation
last year, the law merely admonishes the agency to identify
properties with "natural, cultural, recreational or
scientific values."
   Conservationists are particularly disappointed by the
regulators' failure thus far to help set aside a 70,000-acre
tract of land near Austin, Texas. The land, owned by a mix of
developers, banks, homeowners and regulatory bodies, houses a
veritable "Twelve Days of Christmas" assortment of threatened
animals: two rare songbirds, five endangered cave
invertebrates, a couple of endangered plants and some newly
discovered salamanders.
   Through legal threats and public protests, environmental
groups have halted most tree cutting in the area. A meeting
on the site between environmentalists and RTC officials is
scheduled for the fall.
   Things have gone more smoothly in Garland, Texas, which is
converting a 34-acre, lakeside tract into a park. The city
had wanted to buy the tract in the mid-80's but was scared
off when a local housing boom drove the price to $5 a square
foot. A developer snapped up the land instead and set about
building townhouses.
   But around the time foundations and utility lines were
being laid, the real estate market went bust and so did the
developer and its lender, Independent American Savings
Association. That allowed the Trust for Public Land, a
national nonprofit conservation group based in San Francisco,
to snap up the tract from regulators. The group, which buys
properties to get them off the market while communities
arrange to purchase them, then sold the tract to Garland for
just $1 a square foot.
   Similarly, the Monterey Peninsula Regional Parks District
in California now owns a beach once scheduled to be a
freewheeling investor's condo complex. Developer Leonard Levy
had used the 90-foot strip of shore as collateral to borrow
millions for a leveraged buy-out of a maker of
computer-assisted design systems. When the company filed for
bankruptcy-court protection from creditors, the lender
collapsed too. The FDIC seized the bank, obtained title to
the beach property and sold the land to the parks district
for a mere $75,000.
   Even when nobody buys the RTC property, the slow sell-off
process cheers nature lovers. A few years ago, the Nature
Conservancy, a private group that buys land to protect it,
watched with dismay as investors snagged a patch of barrier
island forest off Nags Head, N.C., and began planning
clustered homes on the land, which teems with such wildlife
as otters and rainbow snakes.
   Then the S&amp;L crisis bankrupted the investors' thrift,
Great Atlantic Savings and Loan, and the RTC claimed the
forest. As far as the Nature Conservancy knows, nobody else
is interested in the land, giving the group time to negotiate
a deal for it.
   And in Addison, Texas, a two-acre lot has languished in
regulatory hands for at least six years. But neighbors in
this Dallas suburb are grateful. They have cleared litter
from the lot to create a makeshift softball diamond and park.
   "Besides that place," says area resident Jerry King,
"there's not a lot of wide open spaces around here just for
kids to walk and run and throw a frisbee."

   Apologists for the Farm Lobby

AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT (AGD)
</GV>
<LP>
   The House of Representatives is scheduled to begin debate
this week on a bill to provide another five years of farm
subsidies. Unfortunately, the main guide to the farm bill is
a 914-page report by the House Agriculture Committee -- a
report that breaks new ground in convoluted logic.
   How convoluted? U.S. peanut prices are double those in the
rest of the world. The committee does not blame the peanut
program's production controls and barriers to imports; it
blames -- "advertising costs which can be particularly high
when a major television or movie personality is hired to
represent the product."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The committee also notes, "If American consumers are
serious about saving money, they should make informed
choices, like purchasing generic peanut butter instead of
name brands." The Agriculture Committee sounds suspiciously
like the Japanese beef lobby, which encourages Japanese
consumers to adjust to the sky-high price of beef by eating
very small pieces of meat.
   The committee makes similar excuses for its expensive wool
program. The purpose of the National Wool Act, the committee
report says, is "to assure wool and mohair producers a fair
return . . . during periods of depressed market prices." The
so-called wool price depression has been going on for 36
years. The wool program is expected to cost $121 million this
year.
   The report praises the sugar program because "it insulates
the U.S. market from the very volatile and often depressed
world sugar market." The U.S. market is indeed "insulated" --
by sugar prices that are double the world sugar prices. The
committee wants to solve the "sugar problem" with production
controls on sugar farmers.
   The report announces that the new farm bill will "continue
the relative supply/demand balance in the dairy industry."
"Relative" is a generous description of that "balance": The
federal government is expected to buy the equivalent of
almost 8 billion pounds of surplus milk this year. The report
opines that "The {milk production} problem is one of
price-cost misalignment between the Federal support price and
a low cost of production for many producers."
   Stripped of jargon, that means that the reason the U.S.
has perpetual dairy surpluses is that the government pays
efficient dairymen far more than it costs them to produce
milk. The Agriculture Committee's solution -- more subsidized
dumping of U.S. dairy products and possible production
controls on dairy farmers.
   The report justifies spending $69 million a year on the
honey program because of the vital role that pollination
plays in crop production. But the General Accounting Office
last month recommended phasing out the honey program because
"producers of crops can rent bee colonies or purchase their
own."
   About wheat, the report declares, "the Committee's
legislation carries forward the same goals which have been at
the root of agricultural programs in place throughout the
20th century." Regrettably, this means the U.S. government
will continue trying to conquer world markets by shutting
down American farms. In 1988, the federal government rewarded
farmers for not planting 29.3 million acres of wheat -- equal
to almost the entire wheat acreage of the European Community,
the U.S.'s primary competitor in world markets.
   The Agriculture Committee's report takes pains to rebut
the suggestion that artificially doubling, tripling and
quadrupling food prices hurts the consumer in any way: "It is
clear to the members of the Committee that consumers would
not receive any benefit from cuts in farm commodity prices."
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates, based on a
study of 10 farm programs, that federal policy resulted in
$12.1 billion in higher prices to consumers in 1987.
   The report lavishes praise on the Export Enhancement
Program, which it credits for much of the increase in U.S.
wheat exports since 1985. But a Department of Agriculture
study concluded in 1988 that nine out of 10 bushels of wheat
exported via the program would have been exported anyhow. The
primary effect of EEP is that, instead of exporting for a
profit, the U.S. sells at a loss. Harvard economist Robert
Paarlberg notes, "It would have been almost a dollar a bushel
cheaper simply to buy surplus wheat on the free market and
then destroy it, rather than to give it away under EEP."
   Admirably, the committee report does concede that U.S.
farm policy hurts Third World farmers. "In El Salvador,
shipments of {U.S.-donated} nonfat dried milk exceeded the
amount of domestic consumption causing domestic milk prices
to decline and domestic production to plummet." Federal law
has long mandated that U.S. food aid not undercut farmers in
the recipient countries. But how could the dumping of more
than a billion dollar's worth of free food each year fail to
undercut those farmers?
   While the committee report repeatedly pays homage to the
need for farm programs to be market-oriented, this farm bill
is far more interventionist even than the existing farm
legislation. After 60 years of failed federal farm policies,
the House Agriculture Committee appears to have learned
nothing and forgotten nothing.

   Venture of Nestle,
   General Mills Buys
   Cereal Line in U.K.

   The cereal joint venture of Nestle S.A. and General Mills
Inc., seeking to reach some of the world's biggest cereal
eaters, agreed to acquire for $167 million (#93 million) the
breakfast cereal business of Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC, which
holds a 15% share of the United Kingdom cereal market.
   The acquisition, the first since the venture's formation
last December, gives it a No. 3 position behind Kellogg Co.,
with 47%, and Weetabix, with a 19% market share in the U.K.
Ranks also is the largest maker of private-branded cereals in
Britain and distributes throughout Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Initially, the venture plans simply to operate the
business as is, but it hinted that eventually it would seek
to expand with either current General Mills brands or new
cereals.
   Ranks Hovis had acquired the ready-to-eat cereal business
from RJR Nabisco, a unit of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.,
two years ago for about $144 million (#80 million). Ranks
distributes its products, principally Shredded Wheat and
Shreddies, in most of Western Europe.
   A Ranks Hovis official said the company decided to sell
the cereal operation partly out of frustration at not being
able to become "a very strong second" to Kellogg, and partly
because it anticipates a bruising battle between Kellogg and
the joint venture.
   "We know Kellogg will defend like mad, and General Mills
and Nestle will attack. So we sold it," said Bob Rogerson,
Ranks Hovis finance director.
   American cereal industry sources calculate that Ireland
has the biggest per-capital cereal consumption in the world,
at more than 15 pounds a year. Britain and Australia are tied
for second, at nearly 13 pounds each, followed by the U.S.
with almost 10 pounds a person. While its population eats
more cereal on a per-capita basis than the U.S., the United
Kingdom is a much smaller market as measured by sales.
   The U.S. is about a $6.5 billion market, while the U.K. is
about $1 billion, and all of Europe accounts for less than $2
billion in annual sales. For now, the venture's distribution
won't include Ireland, officials said.
   Although the European market is relatively small, both
partners in the venture see considerable growth potential,
particularly after trade barriers fall in 1992. Nestle
already has a cereal business in France, Spain and Portugal,
as well as a huge marketing and distribution network, but it
previously lacked a significant product mix.
   Until now General Mills, the world's second-largest cereal
maker behind Kellogg, has been only a negligible factor on
the continent. It currently exports relatively small amounts
of Cheerios, Golden Grahams and Cinnamon Toast Crunch (its
most popular brand in Britain) to major supermarket chains as
well as Harrods, the London department-store outfit.
   Both partners in the joint venture, CPW S.A., have said
they intend to reach $1 billion in sales by the year 2000.
CPW is headquartered in Morges, Switzerland.
   The acquisition includes Shredded Wheat Co., with a plant
at Welwyn Garden City near London; Viota Foods, with a cereal
plant at Bromborough, England; and A.C. Fincken Ltd., with a
plant at Watford, England.

   The stock market pitched and heaved yesterday, the Dow
Jones Industrials trading off as much as 100 points before
closing down 56 at 2904. On Friday it lost 32 points. Only a
week ago it was hitting its record high of 2999.75. Being as
licensed as anyone, we'd like to toss a thought into the
hopper of explanations: Over the past week, the market has
caught scent of a Washington budget deal.
   After all, the Dow Jones Average hit its record the day of
Budget Director Richard Darman's mid-session review of the
economy, fraught with warnings of "crisis" unless a
deficit-closing deal was reached. Yesterday, the government
reported that its deficit for the first nine months of the
fiscal year increased to $163 billion from $105 billion in
the same period a year earlier. The Dow Jones News Service
helpfully noted "government receipts totaled $777.75 billion,
compared with $749.14 billion the year before. Outlays
through June totaled $940.84 billion, compared with $854.54
billion a year earlier." But news from the budget talks
revolved around stock-transfer taxes, limits on personal
deductions and other monstrosities.

   The latest consumer price index report showed an increase
of 4.7% from a year earlier. Commex gold jumped $7.80 to
$369.10 yesterday. Last week Fed Chairman Greenspan held out
the prosect of easier money after a budget agreement with
"major, substantive, credible cuts in the budget deficit."
   So the pieces are falling into place for the following
scenario: a cosmetic budget deal, with empty promises on
spending. New and awkward taxes. And easier money. The stock
market is the town meeting starting to boo.
   The market turmoil, the threat of new inflation, the
current stupor in the economy -- none of it would have
happened if Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell had stayed
out of the way and let Congress cut the capital-gains tax
when it wanted to. Vice President Dan Quayle, outside the
Beltway at the Republican National Committee earlier this
month, got it right: "Congress's failure to pass the
president's capital-gains proposal last year is partly
responsible for the current slowdown in economic growth."
   All the more so since evidence accumulates that a
capital-gains tax cut would pay for itself in new revenues.
The Joint Economic Committee recently lined up testimony from
Allen Sinai, an economist who has previously opposed a lower
capital-gains rate as a handout to "the rich." Members and
staff started to climb walls when Mr. Sinai testified he'd
changed his mind. His econometric model, he said, showed that
a cut in the capital-gains rate to 15% from the current rate
would increase GNP by about 0.4% a year through 1995, and
generate $30 billion to $40 billion in additional government
revenues.
   "A capital-gains tax cut would increase capital spending,
GNP, income, jobs, household wealth and improve the U.S.'s
competitive posture," Mr. Sinai concludes. "For me, that
outweighs its effect on income distribution."
   Of course, if a capital-gains cut increases revenues, it
can scarcely be any kind of handout to "the rich" that needed
to be balanced by raising other taxes. If you believe only
"the rich" pay capital-gains tax, an increase in revenues
from this tax is proof positive that "the rich" are paying
more taxes, not less. Actually, though, "the rich" happen to
include a lot of perfectly normal folks.
   In particular the elderly, as a new study shows. In a
study for the National Center for Policy Analysis, former
Treasury economists Gary and Aldona Robbins noticed that the
elderly hold about 40% of the capital stock of the U.S. They
found that every year almost half of elderly households with
incomes between $25,000 and $40,000 report capital-gains
income. These people have over their lifetimes actually
managed to accumulate savings; all economists agree that the
American economy needs more of them doing more saving.
   This is, however, the one class of taxpayers who are now
paying higher marginal tax rates. Capital gains are now taxed
at normal rates, and above a certain income, half of Social
Security benefits are too. In 1978, an elderly couple with a
capital gain of $20,000 and $30,500 of other income,
including Social Security, would have paid a marginal rate of
16% on their capital gains. In 1985, the marginal rate would
have declined to 9%. Today it would be 42%, plus state and
local taxes.
   So you have a capital-gains proposal that would both
increase revenues and help the economy. And you have an
incipient budget deal that at best would displace some
borrowing with taxes, probably ones that would hobble the
economy. In the past week Washington has moved a lot closer
to the latter. No one should be surprised that a formerly
ebullient stock market has turned nervous.

   NEW YORK -- If consumers aren't eating enough Big Macs,
will we miss Dow 3000?
   The question isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. Late
last Friday, McDonald's Corp., one of a select cadre of
seemingly invulnerable growth stocks whose six-month-long
rise drove the Dow Jones Industrials within a fraction of
3000, disappointed Wall Street with lower-than-expected
earnings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday, Wall Street took its revenge. Acting like
jilted lovers, investors dumped McDonald's and other growth
stocks, knocking the industrial average down 56.44 points to
2904.70 in heavy trading. The question now is whether
yesterday's big decline is a mere interruption of the upward
movement or something more serious, the start of a shift in
sentiment that would kill any thought of a 3000 Dow for the
rest of this year.
   For months, investors have had an almost insatiable
appetite for big, household-name growth stocks, such as
McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Walt Disney and Procter &amp; Gamble. And
although these issues have begun to look expensive by some
measures, many experts still see them climbing further. Much
further.
   "There's a very select group of stocks with good
earnings-growth stories that are being pushed up," says
Charles Clough, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. "We're not convinced that's over yet. Since it's in such
short supply, the price of growth is likely to keep going
up."
   But other analysts who only a week ago were predicting a
surge above 3000 now see an ominous portent. "There's been a
change in investor psychology," contends Kenneth Spence,
director of the technical-analysis group at Salomon Brothers.
"With weakness in earnings for autos, hamburgers and
semiconductors, the earnings rebound that investors expected
in the second half of the year is under a great deal of
suspicion."
   If nothing else, the Dow's dive yesterday -- it was down
more than 105 points early in the day -- illustrates what can
happen in a stock market dangerously dependent on a handful
of supposed winners. Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief U.S. market
strategist for Barclays Bank, puts it this way: "If the
market starts to decline, what stocks will investors sell?
They can only sell the stocks they own, and the growth stocks
are what they own."
   Of course, it isn't any surprise to most investors that as
prices rise, which the growth stocks have been doing for the
past several months, so inevitably do the risks. But the
irony of the Dow's climb to 2999.75 last week, and the sudden
plunge yesterday, is that investors have pushed up the
average partly in a quest for safety. Amid fear late last
year that the economy might slide into recession, investors
sought out stocks that seemed relatively immune to economic
cycles.
   Big companies such as Merck, Gillette, Home Depot,
Wal-Mart, Anheuser-Busch and Philip Morris became the
darlings of Wall Street. Whether because of these companies'
marketing muscle, unique products or their innovative
management, investors became convinced that the firms would
thrive whatever the environment. Consequently, prices of such
companies' stocks rose much faster than anyone expects their
earnings to grow. While the average Dow Industrials stock
sells at a per-share price of about 14 times its annual
earnings (for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, it's about 16), some
of the growth stocks investors were snapping up through last
week were selling at as high as 40 times earnings.
   No matter. Some money managers argue that sustained growth
in earnings is a valuable commodity, well worth the high
prices they pay to own a piece of these companies. If this
all sounds reminiscent of the "Nifty Fifty" phenomenon of the
early 1970s, it is.
   "My style is to be in what used to be known as the Nifty
Fifty," says Roger Engemann, who heads a Pasadena, Calif.,
money-management firm. "We expect these stocks' earnings to
grow at 20%-plus per year for the next five years. What's
that worth? At the very least, it would be a 20 multiple."
   Indeed, if the Nifty Fifty upsurge is repeated, earnings
growth will be worth a lot more than Mr. Engemann's minimum.
In the fervor of the market's fling with growth stocks in the
early '70s, a price-earnings ratio of 20 was a bargain. In
April 1972, Polaroid commanded a multiple close to 65 times
earnings; Digital Equipment had a P/E ratio of 80; Walt
Disney, a P/E of 78, and McDonald's, a P/E of 70.
International Business Machines looked like a laggard at only
41.
   By those standards, most growth stocks today still look
awfully tempting, perhaps especially to investors who,
stunned by the October 1987 stock-market crash, sat out much
of the market's nearly 1,300-point recovery. "As these people
come back, they're saying they want the very best," says Jack
Orben, president of American Family Services, which manages
money for wealthy individuals. "They find great comfort in
high-quality growth stocks, a situation not terribly
different from the 1972-73 period."
   There's no denying the impressive returns to investors who
purchased growth stocks a year ago. Then, before the
growth-stock frenzy, an investor could have bought a
portfolio of growth stocks at prices about equal to the
overall price-earnings ratio of the broader market, says Ms.
Cohen, Barclays Bank's strategist.
   "That means you could have bought the "creme de la creme"
of corporate America at no price premium at all," she says.
Even after yesterday's slump, that same portfolio would cost
a big premium.
   James LaTorre, a portfolio manager at the Ivy Fund, has
watched his Ivy Growth with Income Fund rise 7.5% so far this
year, more than double the total return -- price plus
dividends -- of 3.03% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stocks at
the end of June. The fund is loaded with such growth stocks
as Home Depot, Motorola, Boeing and Wal-Mart, all of which
sport substantial premiums for their earnings.
   "Price-earnings ratios are a moving target," Mr. LaTorre
says. "As long as the stocks are sufficiently popular with
institutions, you have to be in."
   Many companies are lumped under the heading of growth
stocks, and many of them deserve premium prices, analysts
argue. Although Boeing, for example, carries a relatively
rich price-earnings ratio of 25 times the past four quarters'
earnings, analysts such as Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany Corp., don't mind holding the stock
in hopes of further gains. Not only does the aircraft maker
have a huge order backlog, it also has managed in recent
years to focus on the lucrative commercial market while
paring its dependence on military sales.
   "Boeing is a good example of a company that has changed
enough to justify moving into uncharted waters," Mr. Johnson
claims.
   Gillette is another solid play, according to some
investors. Mr. Orben says that in view of its new Sensor
razor and its long-demonstrated marketing expertise,
investors can be comfortable with Gillette's stock price
despite a lofty P/E ratio of 23.5 times earnings. "It and
stocks like it are just going to continue hitting new highs,"
he predicts.
   But not every so-called growth stock will grow fast enough
to justify fat premiums. What happens when such a stock, for
whatever reason, loses a bit of its luster? A look at what
has just happened to McDonald's shares shows just how fragile
a reputation as a growth stock can be.
   Basically, the news that McDonald's reported Friday didn't
sound bad at all. Second-quarter net income rose 10%.
International sales and earnings were robust. And although
analysts had expected quarterly earnings of 60 cents a share,
the company earned 59 cents -- hardly a major disappointment.
   But the average company-owned restaurant did $4,000 less
business than a year ago, and the average franchisee-operated
one did about $10,000 less. McDonald's said it isn't
satisfied with the performance and is weighing new menu
strategies. To analysts, that news suggested stepped-up price
discounting. McDonald's shares dropped $1.50 Friday and
another $3 yesterday to close at $33. The declines brought
the stock's price-earnings ratio down to 16.4 times the past
four quarters' earnings, from 19 just before the financial
results were announced.
   Although that P/E is still at or above average, McDonald's
prolonged stock rise and its plunge in a few days is somewhat
reminiscent of the rise and the much-longer fall of the Nifty
Fifty in the early '70s. Back then, skyrocketing oil prices,
soaring labor and food costs and a tumbling dollar brought
stagflation. Even the big growth companies couldn't stand up
to the painful combination of a severe recession and surging
inflation. By late 1974, Polaroid had tumbled to less than $8
a share from $74, and Xerox to $50 from about $150 earlier.
   "You had a tremendous concentration that blew stocks to
unrealistic values" in the early '70s, recalls John M.
McCarthy, a 63-year-old portfolio manager of the $3.7 billion
Affiliated Fund, who was running the fund during the 1970s
growth-stock boom. "When you bought Polaroid in April 1972 at
65 times earnings, you were buying infinity."
   Now, Mr. McCarthy worries about a rerun. "I'm staring at a
pit out there," he frets. "If the market has been going
straight up, with a concentration in a limited number of
stocks, you know that sooner or later it's going to walk into
a black hole."
   The virtual certainty that something, sometime, will close
down the party isn't far from the minds of many analysts. "A
lot of these are stocks that I've happily recommended, and
I've enjoyed the ride up," First Albany's Mr. Johnson says.
"But now they've reached levels that make me uncomfortable."
   His discomfort stems from a simple question: What
justifies the recent high prices? The answer, in his view:
Nothing. "It isn't because interest rates are falling
sharply, and it isn't because the level or quality of
earnings are going to improve a lot," he says.
   Yet Mr. Johnson isn't selling even now. Most of
yesterday's drop, he believes, was due to program trading,
not selling by long-term investors. He is betting that
speculative fever is still at large among investors and that
they will ultimately drive still higher the prices of growth
stocks, even those that he deems the most overpriced, such as
General Electric, Merck, Philip Morris and Browning-Ferris.
   "We're stretching the rules, and you have to realize that
the risks are higher when you stretch the rules," he says.
"It's OK to stretch the rules as long as you know you're on
thin ice, and that's why I'm going to stay with Merck and
General Electric."
   Despite the battering from investors yesterday, even
McDonald's still has fans among growth-stock aficionados.
Hugh Zurkuhlin, a consumer-products analyst at Salomon
Brothers, contends that despite the sluggish U.S. economic
growth, McDonald's is poised for striking growth abroad.
"McDonald's looks like Coca-Cola looked in the 1950s, when
international growth was limitless," he says.
   And the most bullish of analysts contend that investors
needn't continue to concentrate their attention on the
supposedly-safe big growth stocks. "When interest rates
peaked, investors got a little afraid of a recession and were
looking for safe stocks like Disney and Procter &amp; Gamble,"
says Peter Canelo, chief market strategist at Bear Stearns.
"But with rates coming down now, people are not quite so
afraid of a recession, so they don't need the safe stocks
anymore."
   He expects the Federal Reserve to continue easing monetary
policy, slowly, for several months. Done correctly, he says,
such a strategy could inspire confidence that the economy
will continue to grow while inflation remains in check. And
that might well open the door to big gains for industrial and
technology stocks.

   ATLANTA -- Equifax Inc. and Telecredit Inc. said they
signed a definitive agreement providing for the acquisition
of Telecredit by Equifax in a stock swap valued at about $580

   Equifax, which provides credit reports and similar

   Media:
   Family Cable Channel Switches Signals
   From Religious to Entertainment Fare

   Tim Robertson, the son of evangelical TV preacher and
onetime presidential hopeful Pat Robertson, is proving to be
adept at another kind of conversion: born-again television.
   Over the past three years, the younger Mr. Robertson, 35
years old, has transformed the Christian Broadcasting
Network's cable channel from a Bible-thumping religious
programmer with a few old western reruns into The Family
Channel, a mainstream -- if somewhat mild-mannered --
entertainment network.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the hotly competitive cable market, Family Channel has
substantially boosted its ratings and ad revenues and now
reaches nearly 50 million homes, or 54% of all U.S. TV
households. For this fall, it is aiming its efforts at prime
time, doubling offerings there and spending $100 million on
series and other original programs.
   For viewers looking for an alternative to the titillation
of "Twin Peaks," Family Channel may have the answer; its
small-town America looks more like "Bordertown," where a
Canadian Mountie and a U.S. Marshal patrol the border and vie
for the affections of a pretty doctor. Even though it eschews
sex, drugs and violence and refuses ads for alcohol and
R-rated movies, Family Channel is emerging as a scrappy
competitor to such established cable powerhouses as USA
Network, Turner Network Television and ESPN.
   Competitors praise Mr. Robertson for upgrading Family
Channel. "Tim has been very serious about running a network
since he took over," says Kay Koplovitz, president of USA
Network. "The Family Channel has a whole new look in prime
time, and they've made a big commitment to original
programming." But she adds, "just because it's original
doesn't mean it's going to be competitive."
   Some advertisers are impressed. "The Family Channel is
making major strides to get into the competition with their
squeaky-clean image, and they are working hard to be an
original program supplier," says Bob Perlstein, executive
vice president of media buyer SFM Media Inc. Adds Steven
Kubinsky, ad director of Nestle S.A.'s Nestle Foods unit,
"Family has segued into a mainstream cable network very
well."
   Some critics, however, say the channel is somewhat
schizophrenic. "A religious vision for the channel is still
very much in evidence, and that has kept Family struggling to
find a balance between the wholesome and the holy," says a
recent critique in television trade journal Channels. Family
Channel, it adds, "is attempting to shed just enough of its
preacher image to please the marketplace while retaining
sufficient religion to comfort its carryover flock."
   And at least one effort to straddle both worlds failed:
CBN's attempt three years ago to launch a nightly half-hour
news program with a religious bent. The show was canceled
after just two months when advertisers refused to buy time.
"No one would believe we could do an objective newscast,"
says Mr. Robertson. "We were smart enough to know you can't
push water uphill, and I hope we will always be smart enough
to know when we've done something that doesn't work."
   Originally spawned 13 years ago to bring CBN's "700 Club"
fund-raising show to millions of cable subscribers, the
network's overhaul started when the younger Mr. Robertson was
named president in 1987, after spending his entire career
working in CBN's broadcasting operations. Mr. Robertson saw a
dearth of family-oriented fare on ad-supported basic cable
and began upgrading CBN Cable's programs, rechristening it
the CBN Family Channel in 1988 and dropping CBN from the name
and the logo last year.
   In January, the conversion was completed; in order to
preserve its tax-exempt status, CBN separated Family Channel
from the ministry, selling it to International Family
Entertainment, a new partnership led by the Robertsons and
Denver cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., for $250 million
in cash and notes convertible in a few years to stock
representing 18% of the concern; TCI also agreed to assume
$43.5 million in program commitments.
   CBN had been under pressure for some time to unload the
cable channel; under Internal Revenue Service rules,
nonprofit organizations are prohibited from operating
commercial enterprises that account for more than an
"insubstantial" portion of their revenue. Combined ad sales
and fees from cable operators will bring in well over $100
million this year, compared with a negligible $2 million in
1981.
   The Robertsons say no funds raised from the TV ministry
have gone to the commercial network, which has until now
financed programming via internal cash flow and partnerships
with producers.
   CBN talked to a number of possible investors, including
Hollywood studios, but the Robertsons' insistence on keeping
"The 700 Club" and maintaining control of programming and ad
policies were always a deal-breaker. Tele-Communications, by
contrast, says many of its cable subscribers pay for cable
just to get "The 700 Club," and others like the idea of safe
but entertaining family programming.
   Tele-Communications also made a very good deal for the
Robertsons, giving them the control they sought and the
opportunity to substantially increase their own personal net
worth if Family Channel continues to prosper. Mr. Robertson
already has global ambitions; he is discussing a European
version of the channel.
   Like its rivals, Family Channel is offering a wide range
of programs in different "day parts" aimed at children,
women, and men. Animation company Dic Enterprises Inc. is
producing a block of children's programming called FunTown,
and Lucasfilm Ltd., creator of such movies as "Star Wars,"
has developed a new series based on the popular computer game
"Maniac Mansion." Along with the American Pediatrics
Association, Family Channel is producing "Healthy Kids."
   Also on the lineup is a series based on the movie "The
Black Stallion," and "T and T," which stars the former
"A-Team" actor known as Mr. T. Family Channel is also adding
new episodes of "Rin Tin Tin K-9 Cop," about a supposed
descendant of the fabled TV dog, and "Zorro," a new version
of the old series. In the new "Big Brother Jake,"
body-builder-to-the-stars Jake Steinfeld is a celebrity who
gives up the high life to bring up five foster children. Not
everything is so original; there's a takeoff of the ABC
network hit "America's Funniest Home Videos" dubbed "Zaniest
Videos: You Asked For It]"
   Family Channel bought some broadcast network reruns such
as CBS Inc.'s canceled "Beauty and the Beast." But it
continues to draw respectable male audiences with
all-afternoon weekend blocks of old standbys like "Wagon
Train," "Gunsmoke," "The Big Valley," "The Virginian" and
"Bonanza: The Lost Episodes." It may also get involved in
distributing a western-oriented cable channel, "The Cowboy
Network," that is being discussed.
   Despite a tough ad climate, Family Channel's ad revenue
rose to $68 million in 1989 from $54 million in 1988; Tim
Robertson says ad revenue is expected to exceed $80 million
this year. And like rivals USA and TNT, it is increasing the
number of slots allocated to local cable systems to sell ad
time on the network.
   Although it continues to devote several hours daily to
religious programs, Family Channel doesn't sell any ads for
"The 700 Club," which was moved to 10 p.m. from 8 p.m. And
the network is deliberately vague on the programming schedule
it provides advertisers, using the listing "various" for time
slots for other religious programs.
   "Advertisers ultimately came to the realization that we
deliver a media value that they need and want," says Dick
Hammer, who heads advertising sales for the channel. While
there was plenty of resistance three years ago, he adds,
nowadays, "the ownership and the religious roots of the
organization never come up in discussion." Mr. Kubinsky of
Nestle's says that in recent presentations, "one of the
things they told us was that this is a channel that you can
stick your kid in front of and not worry about what he or she
might be exposed to."
   As for complaints that changes have left the network with
a schizophrenic image, Mr. Robertson says: "At the core of
who we are, there remains a commitment to providing
value-based programming." While shows don't "all have to be
about going to church or synagogue on weekends or running
around saying grace over food," he adds, Family Channel is
committed to "solid entertainment where good guys win, bad
guys lose, people aren't engaging in gratuitous sex, and
violence is a last resort where the bad guy is punished or an
innocent defended."

   U.K. May Decide
   To Sell PowerGen
   To Hanson PLC

   LONDON -- The British government said it may shelve plans
to float PowerGen, Britain's second largest
electricity-generating concern, and instead sell it to Hanson
PLC or another company.
   Hanson, a conglomerate with interests in consumer goods,
building products, foods and a variety of manufacturing
industries, confirmed yesterday that it has indicated to the
government "a firm interest" in bidding for PowerGen, a
state-owned concern scheduled to be privatized in February.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sale is part of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
electric-utility privatization plan that is expected to raise
#11 billion ($20 billion). Analysts say PowerGen alone could
fetch #1 billion.
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham told the House of Commons
that if Hanson decides to bid for PowerGen, he will invite
other companies to make offers. Analysts suggested that
companies from continental Europe and perhaps the U.S. would
join any eventual auction.
   But Mr. Wakeham stressed that the government hasn't ruled
out floating the generating concern. "I therefore propose to
pursue discussions with Hanson in parallel with pushing
forward preparations for the flotation of PowerGen," he said.
   Yesterday's announcement, which sparked angry debate in
Parliament, marked the second major shift in the government's
strategy for privatizing the electricity industry. In
November, the government withdrew all of Britain's nuclear
power plants from the planned sale after the plants were
publicly criticized as unreliable and uneconomic.
   Recently, critics of the plan have suggested there isn't
sufficient investor interest to successfully float both
PowerGen and National Power, Britain's largest generating
concern. Mr. Wakeham called Hanson's overture "a vote of
confidence" in PowerGen and its management.
   Hanson's deputy chairman, Martin Taylor, called PowerGen
"a strong, good basic industry supplying continuing needs."
He declined to say how much Hanson would be willing to pay.

   Hostile Tender Offer Priced
   At $857 Million; Move
   Is Termed `New Ground'

   Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. launched a surprise
$27-a-share, or $857 million, tender offer for a neighboring
utility, Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co. of Wichita.
   While other utilities have put unsolicited proposals
before the boards of target companies, yesterday's bid
appears to be the first major hostile tender offer in the
heavily regulated electric industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bid represents "new ground for the industry," said
Prudential-Bache analyst Barry Abramson. "I don't think
(Kansas Gas &amp; Electric) will go down easily," he added,
noting that the offering price contains a smaller premium to
book value than have other recent acquisitions in the
industry.
   The move was born out of Kansas City P&amp;L's frustration
over its failure to obtain a friendly deal with its neighbor.
The Kansas City, Mo., concern has made unsuccessful overtures
for a combination over the past two years. The two companies
already jointly own 94% of a nuclear generating plant.
   Kansas City P&amp;L said the proposed acquisition would allow
it to make use of Kansas Gas &amp; Electric's excess capacity,
thus deferring the potentially costly expansion Kansas City
P&amp;L otherwise faces to satisfy its growing customer base. In
addition, it projected advantages accruing from better
utilization of plant assets, joining two complementary
transmission systems and economies of scale.
   Such calculations are behind a recent spate of
acquisitions and mergers in the industry, where enlightened
managers are increasingly seeking combinations to boost
efficiency.
   In March, for example, eyeing a similar discrepancy in
capacity requirements, Iowa Resources Inc. and the
slower-growing, capacity-rich Midwestern Energy Corp.
definitively agreed to form a holding company that will
combine the two utilities.
   But unlike the situation in that friendly deal, Kansas
City P&amp;L opted for a tender offer, with a bid for Kansas Gas
&amp; Electric that was 37% above the Friday close for shares of
the Wichita company. Friday's price represented a 52-week
low, however, for the Wichita company, which is still
financially recovering from earlier difficulties with its
nuclear operations.
   In Wichita, a spokesman for Kansas Gas &amp; Electric declined
to comment, saying the company was still reviewing the offer.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Kansas G&amp;E shares jumped $4.625, to close at $24.375.
Yesterday's closing price shows investor wariness over the
lengthy time a deal could take, and the numerous conditions
on which it is predicated.
   But the fact that the bidder has lined up bank financing
and is actually making an offer indicates, as one trader put
it, "these guys are very serious."
   "Wilson, I want to emphasize our strong desire to achieve
a negotiated transaction . . . Personally, I would have
preferred to proceed with negotiations prior to commencement
of our tender offer, but we were strongly advised to commence
our offer before making a proposal to you," wrote A. Drue
Jennings, Kansas City P&amp;L president and chief executive
officer, in a letter to Kansas Gas's chairman and president,
Wilson K. Cadman.
   The adviser on the bid is a team of investment bankers led
by David Hedley, who left Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
January, just before that firm collapsed. They now work for
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Kansas City P&amp;L said it estimated that savings of $85
million, over a five-year period, could be obtained from
combining the company. In an interview, Mr. Jennings called
that estimate "conservative."
   But the company's short-term borrowings to fund the
buy-out -- which could be avoided if the parties were
involved in a friendly, stock-swap acquisition -- would work
to offset a big part of those savings.
   Salomon Brothers analyst Gregory B. Enholm finds much more
significant the savings that would be available through
Kansas City P&amp;L's access to the target company's excess
capacity. "If you look at the interest cost on borrowing a
billion dollars" for the acquisition, buying extra capacity
in the form of another utility "is cheaper than building a
new power plant," he asserted.
   Under Kansas law, an unsolicited bidder is restricted from
voting its shares above 20%, unless, at a special shareholder
meeting called for that purposes, stockholders of the target
company confer voting rights on the suitor for the full
amount of its shareholdings. Kansas City P&amp;L filed suit
yesterday in federal court in Kansas City, Mo., asking the
court to order Kansas G&amp;E to call such a meeting by no later
than 50 days.

   Investors hammered over-the-counter stocks in the worst
one-day pasting since last year's "mini-crash" on Oct. 19.
   "The OTC market is getting its brain beat in," said
William Sulya, director of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards, St.
Louis. Despite a "few signs of life" at the end of the day,
Mr. Sulya said he wasn't convinced the selling spree had

   The Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 10.63 to 444.64, or
2.3%, surpassing yesterday's 1.9% drop in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. Declining shares swamped advancers, 1,857
to 431, as 186 stocks fell to new lows and only 21 reached
new highs. Volume eased slightly to 168.9 million from 174.6
million Friday.
   The steep plunge in smaller stocks in lock-step with
larger shares was unusual, said Jack Laporte, president of
the $1 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, who noted
that smaller issues usually trail big drops in large stocks
by a day.
   "What bothered me was that the secondaries
underperformed," he said. "Normally, they get whacked the
next day." Mr. Laporte called "disturbing" the recent poor
performance of OTC stocks relative to the broader Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index. The OTC market has fallen 5.32% in
the last five sessions, compared with a 3.4% decline in the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Index.
   Traders and portfolio managers blamed the OTC bloodbath in
part on program trading of larger stocks, nervousness about
corporate earnings, fears about the economy and concerns that
the market for initial public offerings might lose some
steam.
   Alan Radlo, manager of the $734 million Fidelity OTC
Portfolio, grumped about program trading. "They might as well
be playing with jelly beans instead of the market," Mr. Radlo
said, adding that he finds such influences on the market
discouraging not only to himself but also to his mutual fund
clients. Both Mr. Radlo and Mr. Laporte said they bought
shares during yesterday's fall.
   Scattered among the day's most-active shares were some
well-known stocks that ended higher after a day of erratic
trading.
   Nike rose 3/4 to 90 3/8 after shares of the athletic
footwear maker traded as low as 84 1/2. Apple Computer, which
Friday announced a five-million share buy-back program,
gained 1/2 to 41 1/2 after falling to 40.
   MCI Communications closed unchanged at 38.
   Intel, the day's most active stock, fell 5/8 to 44 1/2 on
3.1 million shares. Among other technology shares, Sun
Microsystems slipped 1 3/8 to 30 7/8; Conner Peripherals slid
1 to 26 3/4; Oracle Systems dropped 1/2 to 17 3/8; Lotus fell
3/4 to 24 1/2; Microsoft declined 1 1/4 to 72, and AST
Research tumbled 1 1/4 to 20 3/4. The Nasdaq Industrial
Index, which includes many computer-related issues, dove
12.60 to 479.36, a 2.56% slide.
   Although a big queue of sellers lined up before the
opening, traders contended that activity throughout the day
was orderly. "The way it started it out, I thought it would
be a disaster," said Jerry Mullins, head of OTC trading at
Dean Witter Reynolds. Mr. Mullins attributed the steady
erosion in smaller stocks to a lack of support among buyers.
"I guess nobody wants to take positions," he said.
   Investors remained cautious throughout the day, according
to E. E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld,
New York. "It's like cattle," he said. "They can go either
way here. If someone starts a run on the down side, they'll
hit them again."
   Among the day's prospectors, Mr. Radlo said he bought
about 75 issues, among them shares of banks with strong
earnings, oil-service related companies and specific
companies with robust operations. Those included stocks of
included Bancorp Hawaii, a Honolulu commercial bank; Novell,
a maker of personal-computer network systems; and Medical
Care International, which Friday reported net income for the
second quarter rose to 37 cents a share from 24 cents a year
earlier. Medical Care fell 1 7/8 to 38.
   Despite having their "fingers burned" by disappointing
earnings among some technology companies, T. Rowe Price's
investment managers still have faith that long-term bargains
remain in the shares of some technology companies and other
OTC concerns with double-digit earnings growth, said Mr.
Laporte.
   "We feel strongly that valuations remain compelling," he
said, adding that the New Horizons Fund hasn't changed its
level of cash. Among the stocks he favors are Medco
Containment Services, a provider of prescription services by
mail; Autodesk, a maker of computer-aided design and drafting
products; and bubble-gum card maker Topps.
   Earnings reports managed to lift the price of a few
stocks. American Power Conversion rose 2 1/2 to 40 1/4 after
the Peace Dale, R.I., maker of power supply products reported
net income for the second quarter more than doubled to 53
cents a share from 26 cents a year earlier. The company also
announced that it would split its stock 3-for-1.
   Dynatech gained 1 1/2 to 18. The Burlington, Mass.,
scientific-instrument company reported net income for the
first quarter ended June 30 rose to 45 cents a share from 37
cents a year earlier.
   BB&amp;T Financial added 1/2 to 18 1/2. The Wilson, N.C.,
thrift was the subject of a positive profile in the current
issue of Barron's.
   Amgen gained 3/4 to 85 1/2. Friday, the Thousand Oaks.,
Calif., biotechnology company reported net income for the
first quarter ended June of 57 cents a share, before a
2-for-1 stock split, compared with five cents a share a year
earlier. Also, analysts at First Boston and Prudential-Bache
Securities repeated their "buy" opinions on the stock,
according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.

   The obvious thing about Supreme Court nominee David Souter
is that few people outside of New Hampshire know much about
him, though then-Governor John Sununu appointed him to the
state Supreme Court. He's been a federal judge for less than
a year and has written very few federal opinions or
law-review articles.
   The point is that his paper trail is scant indeed, making
it tough for Senate liberals to Bork him. We're confident
that as Judge Souter's state-court opinions go on public
display, they'll demonstrate his credentials, and his
original-intent jurisprudence. Yet the Bork lynching
continues to extract its toll; something's seriously amiss
when an unknown record becomes a huge advantage in
Washington.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Another `Fantastic Win for Faldo'
   ----

   St. Andrews, Scotland -- We Americans may no longer rule
The Golfe, but some of us have a neat way of putting things.
Asked last week what a British Open title at St. Andrews's
Old Course, the game's birthplace, would mean to him,
Missourian Payne Stewart, the beknickered dandy, did not
pause. "This is the original tournament played on the
original course," said he. "I don't know how you could get
any better than that."
   Nick Faldo, the Britisher who did win the thing before the
delighted home folks, was less original. Noting that he'd now
won four of golf's "majors" -- two of these and two Masters,
including last April's -- he resorted to quoting Jack
Nicklaus, who's won 18 of 'em. "Like Jack says, they're all
the same -- all fantastic," he declared. "Can't say one is
any better than the others."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Faldo is getting accustomed to golfing glory, and,
perhaps, its edges are beginning to blur for him. In an era
in which many men hit the little white ball very well, the
tall, patient 33-year-old with the metronome swing hits it
best. The unofficial but real title of world's best had been
in dispute for the past several years, but now it's his.
Given another inch or so, the margin by which he missed a
putt on the last green at the U.S. Open at Medinah in June to
fall a stroke short of a playoff spot, he might have had a
chance at a Grand Slam, with the PGA Championship to come.
That's something the game was thought to have outgrown.
   Faldo has won the big ones with pars -- 18 of them on the
final day of the 1987 British Open at blustery Muirfield --
and with birdies. He did both here in unusually fine weather
last week, putting together the best 54-hole total in the 119
times they've held the tourney, then playing his patented
down-the-middle game in the final round Sunday to coast home.
His 72-hole score of 270 comprised rounds of 67, 65, 67 and
71, and was 18 strokes under par.
   That was five shots better than Stewart and Mark McNulty
of Zimbabwe, who tied for second. McNulty came from well back
with a last-round 65, and, thus, never contended for the
lead. Stewart provided a whiff of Sunday drama by shaving
four strokes off par through 12 holes to move from five
strokes back to two. But he drove into one of St. Andrews's
nasty pot bunkers on 13 to give back a shot, and Faldo,
playing just behind him in the day's final twosome, birdied
the par-four 15th to stretch his lead to four.
   From there, it was downhill for both men, with Faldo's
trip by far the more pleasant. His walk along the 18th
fairway, lined by many of the 40,000 people who paid their
way in plus hundreds more leaning from the windows and
balconies of the graystone buildings on the street that
parallels the hole, was a heady triumph for a Britannia that
has ruled little of late. Long after England's Fred Perry had
won three men's singles tennis titles at Wimbledon, they put
a statue of him on the grounds. One more Open crown for
Surreyman Faldo could get him bronzed, too, and quicker.
   They also might like to bronze Faldo's scorecards from
this tourney. Over 72 holes he recorded 20 birdies, one eagle
and just four bogeys, three of them on the dreaded "Road
Hole," the 461-yard par four that bedeviled everyone. He
landed in only one bunker, missed just two greens in
regulation besides 17, and had no three-putt greens. The
latter achievement is especially noteworthy, because St.
Andrews's seven huge double greens make putts of 60 feet or
longer commonplace.
   His 270-shot score was the second best in the tourney's
history, and the best in the 24 editions played at St.
Andrews. The last time anyone won two of golf's majors in the
same year was when Tom Watson captured the Masters and
British Open in 1977. Watson's 268 at Turnberry that year is
the record for the event.
   Faldo wasn't the only player who laid waste to the proud
Old Course; the Open record for the layout fell on Saturday
to a 63 by Britisher Paul Broadhurst, and Australian Ian
Baker-Finch had a 64 the same day. The 36-hole cut was made
at one-under-par 143 -- the lowest ever for the event -- and
severed such luminaries as Seve Ballesteros, Curtis Strange
and defending champ Mark Calcavecchia. Fifty-six of the 72
men who survived broke par for 72 holes.
   The onslaught raised the question of whether park-like St.
Andrews, with its wide fairways, has outlived its day as a
championship layout. The answer, usually, was that the
relatively gentle breezes of last week had defanged the old
links ("When the wind really blows here, the seagulls walk,"
quipped Faldo), but it sounded less than convincing.
   If there was an individual loser, it was Greg Norman. The
jaunty Aussie, co-favored with Faldo going in, shot 66s on
each of the first two days to equal Faldo, but when the two
played together in Saturday's final twosome his game went
haywire and he posted a 76, with a 40 on the back nine. He
recouped somewhat for a 69 on Sunday, and a sixth-place tie,
but his failure to add to his sole major title -- the '86
British Open -- has become familiar. So, too, has his failure
to appear to answer news media questions after poor rounds.
   Faldo, on the other hand, seems to grow under pressure,
and his Saturday round exemplified this. Of his 67 strokes,
only two went awry -- a drive that landed in a clump of
prickly gorse bushes on the 316-yard 12th hole, and a three
iron that fell short of the green on 17. Later admitting that
he was lucky to have any sort of second shot on 12, he
punched out, chipped to eight feet of the cup and saved par,
while Norman, perhaps relatedly, was missing a four-foot par
putt that would give him the first of his four bogeys on the
side.
   Faldo bogeyed 17, but then smacked a wedge to two feet of
the flag on 18 to set up the birdie three that established
the five-stroke lead he would hold all the next day.
   "It's not how many great shots you hit -- everybody out
here hits great shots. It's where your bad ones go," the
champ intoned.
   Words worth framing.

   New Retailers
   Face Struggle
   Getting in Malls

   How does an expansion-minded retailer break into the
shopping mall scene? Rebecca Matthias, owner of a chain of
maternity wear stores called Mothers Work, says the scenario
could have been written by Groucho Marx. "The malls are like
an exclusive club," she says. "If you're not a member, you
can't join."
   Mothers Work is in the club. Ms. Matthias opened her first
mall store in 1988. She argued long and hard to persuade a
leasing agent to let her into an upscale mall in King of
Prussia, a suburb of Philadelphia, paying what seemed an
exorbitant rent for just 640 square feet of space in a
dead-end corridor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The effort paid off. Business boomed and the store, which
sells apparel aimed at professional working women who are
expecting, got attention. Inquiries from shopping center
developers now pour in so fast that Ms. Matthias has hired a
real estate consultant to sort out the offers. "I get them
every day," she says.
   Ms. Matthias's experience illustrates the quandary that
confronts up-and-coming retailers who want the exposure and
traffic that comes with a mall address. Shopping center
developers, sensitive to the charge that malls look pretty
much the same from coast to coast, are desperate for fresh
retailing concepts. But many developers get nervous when they
see a hot idea coming from a small company without a track
record in mall selling.
   Robert Camp, president of Seattle-based retailer Simpson &amp;
Fisher Co., thinks getting a lease in any top-of-the-line
mall is the best way for a retailer to attract notice from
others. The mall's location isn't critical, he says, because
fiercely competitive developers watch each other constantly.
   Although lease negotiations for mall space "are typically
three months of wrangling," Mr. Camp says he was so eager to
get his second Westminster Lace store into the giant South
Coast Plaza complex in Costa Mesa, Calif., in 1987 that "I
virtually signed the deal as it was presented. I never
negotiated less hard."
   The payoff? "Right away it began opening doors for us,"
Mr. Camp says. Westminster Lace now has 22 stores, all but
one of them in malls. The stores sell apparel and furniture
that use lace.
   Ms. Matthias's eight-year-old Mothers Work had a healthy
mail order and retail business, supported by her own
manufacturing operation, before she set her sights on mall
locations. One rule of thumb is that mall space is roughly
three times more expensive than a comparable street location.
But malls also deliver droves of customers. For her stores,
she says: "You've got to have 1,000 pregnant women walking in
front of your door. Otherwise, you don't have a business."
   Two years after its debut, the King of Prussia store is
generating annual sales of $1,000 per square foot of store
space against rent of $63 a square foot. "Those are pretty
good numbers," Ms. Matthias boasts. The store is now the No.
1 producer among her 27 company-owned stores.
   "Get into one mall," advises Ms. Matthias, who now has 20
Mothers Work mall outlets. "Do whatever you have to. Maybe
it's not the best mall. Maybe you're paying outrageous
rents." With a good sales record, a retailer can put together
a fact sheet that will get the attention of other developers.
"These people don't have the time to really understand your
business," Ms. Matthias says. "They're going to look at a
couple of fact sheets and make a decision."
   Mr. Camp says mall operators have three criteria for
retailers. They want stores that are unique, beautiful and
that outperform the mall average in sales per square foot.
"It's tough if you're another chocolate chip cookie maker,"
he says.
   Handsome store decor can go a long way toward overcoming
developer skepticism, says Fred Simon, president of Omaha
Steak Shops, Omaha, Neb. He says mall operators gave the
thumbs down on his first attempts to lease space, saying:
"This is a fashion court. We don't want a meat store."
   Omaha Steak countered with a design featuring liberal
amounts of oak, tile and marble and large color
transparencies showing meat sizzling on outdoor grills. The
meat itself is tucked away in freezers. "We never show
products in the raw," Mr. Simon says. Omaha Steaks now has
mall locations in Omaha, Dallas and Washington and intends to
expand further in the East, Mr. Simon says.
   In Seattle, Reine Hillis gambled that leasing expensive
retail space in a glitzy downtown shopping arcade for her
upscale men's underwear store would bring calls from mall
developers. "They've found us," Ms. Hillis says.
   Boxer Bay, as her store is known, has secured space in
malls in Denver and Santa Barbara, Calif. Ms. Hillis also
says she has leapfrogged a 10-year tenant waiting list and is
negotiating to lease space in Beverly Center in Beverly
Hills, Calif. Boxer Bay is less than a year old. "We're
moving fast," Ms. Hillis says.
   Although the furious pace of shopping center construction
of the last 20 years has tapered off, in many urban areas the
commercial landscape is dotted with enough malls to give
consumers a choice. New retailing concepts can give a mall
extra pizazz and help set it apart from nearby competitors.
   As a result, the search for new merchandise from small
companies "isn't just an interesting sideline of our
business. It's right at the heart of the business," says
Harwood Beville, executive vice president of the Rouse Co.,
Columbia, Md., which operates shopping centers across the
country.
   For the past 10 years, Rouse has nurtured cash poor
entrepreneurs by letting them sell goods in mobile carts or
stalls in mall locations. Premier sellers can graduate to
leased store space.
   Kristine Brewer started hawking handmade sweaters from
Latin America on a cart in New York City's South Street
Seaport, a Rouse development, and on a street cart outside
Boston's Filene's department store. She says her $500
investment has led to annual gross sales of more than $1
million. Six years later, she has full-fledged stores called
Accento in Rouse markets in Boston and Baltimore, plus stores
in New York and New Orleans.
   "A pushcart is a great way to test your market without
having to invest a lot," says Ms. Brewer. It also tests a
retailer's mettle. "You don't have all the fringe benefits
that a store has, like glass doors and telephones."
   Stephen Plumeri, partner and president of New England
Development, Newton, Mass., says tenure at a mall isn't a
prerequisite with his company. "If a company comes to us cold
with unique ideas and some financial backing, we'll work with
them to put them in our malls." New England Development
operates 15 malls in the Northeast and one in Virginia.
   Barbara Ashley, vice president for retail at the Taubman
Co., a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., mall developer, also says a
mall track record isn't essential to pique developers'
interest. But she adds: "If you can make a business work for
you in a well-respected mall, it can only help."

   NEW YORK -- The bond market was whipsawed yesterday,
initially battered by rising interest rates abroad then
rebounding as U.S. stock prices plunged.
   Ultimately, the bond market ended unchanged to moderately
lower with the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond posting a
1/4 point decline, or a loss of $2.50 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It was a very volatile and choppy trading day," said
James Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc.
   The bond market opened sharply lower with prices falling
as much as 3/4 point in reaction to rising interest rates in
Japan. Yields on Japan's benchmark 10-year bond rose to a
six-year high of 7.475% yesterday, even though Japan's
central bank tried to stabilize rates.
   The increase in Japanese bond yields revived fears that
Japanese investors, traditionally big buyers of U.S. Treasury
bonds, may not participate aggressively in next month's
multibillion-dollar quarterly Treasury-bond auction.
   The Treasury's 10-year bond now yields just one percentage
point more than Japan's 10-year bond, which some analysts say
is too small of a spread to encourage Japan's big
institutional investors to buy U.S. Treasurys.
   The bond market then abruptly shifted gears as a plunge of
more than 100 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average took
center stage.
   "When you got the swan dive in the stock market, traders
were climbing all over themselves to buy bonds," said F. Ward
McCarthy, a managing director at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates, Princeton, N.J.
   The stock sell-off prompted some "flight-to-quality"
buying among nervous institutional investors who sold stocks
and reinvested the cash in the bond market. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average staged a partial rebound later in the day
and ended at 2904.70, down 56.44 points.
   "If investors are getting out of stocks, then governments
are the safest available alternative," said Charles
Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover
Securities Corp.
   The bond rebound was not only the product of modest
flight-to-quality buying, but also of traders reversing their
bets on the market.
   Alan McClymonds, co-head of government trading at First
Boston Corp., described yesterday's market as "vicious"
because many bond speculators lost large sums of money.
   In early trading, many speculators took on short
positions. In a short sale, dealers and speculators sell
borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by
replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities.
   But when bond prices rose yesterday, these speculators
were forced to cover their money-losing short positions by
buying bonds at higher prices.
   The losses didn't stop there. Mr. Capra at Shearson Lehman
said speculators continued to buy bonds in a bet that stocks
would fall further and lead to even higher bond prices. They
were wrong again.
   "The speculative side was in and out and lost money both
ways," said Shearson Lehman's Mr. Capra.
   The bond rally stalled out late in the day, however, as
investors turned their attention to the bond market's
numerous negative fundamentals. In addition to rising
Japanese bond yields, investors are worried that
budget-cutting negotiations between Congress and the White
House have stalled and that the Federal Reserve appears to be
abandoning its battle against inflation.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds ended little changed to lower in volatile
trading.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102, down
from 102 7/32 on Friday. The issue's yield rose to 8.55% from
8.53% on Friday. Two-year notes were quoted at 100 15/32
compared with 100 16/32 on Friday. The yield was unchanged at
8.07%.
   Meanwhile, at the government's weekly Treasury bill
auction short-term rates were set sharply lower.
   The average discount rate on three-month Treasury bills
was 7.49% at yesterday's auction while the rate on six-month
bills was 7.40%. Those rates were down from last week's
auction when they were 7.62% and 7.52%, respectively.
   The average rate on three-month bills was the lowest since
the average of 7.37% at the auction on Oct. 16 while the rate
on six-month bills was the lowest since the average of 7.30%
at the auction on Dec. 4, 1989.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The tumble in stock prices rattled the junk bond market,
sending the high-yield speculative-grade securities
moderately lower.
   Most junk bonds finished the session down 1/4 point to 3/8
point, the declines were modest compared to the sell-off in
the stock market.
   Among the high-yield bonds which ended the day lower were
pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. Pay-in-kind bonds pay
interest in the form of additional securities. The company's
17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, which previously
carried an interest rate of 14.07%, finished down 3/4 points
to close at 117 on the New York Stock Exchange. The 17%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, which also had a coupon
rate of 14.07%, ended down 1 point at 94 1/4.
   The junk bonds of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. continued to gain after
news that the New York-based retailer asked investment banks
to suggest ways for it to reduce debt and raise money. Macy's
14.5% senior subordinated debentures added 1 point to close
at 76.
   Time Warner Inc.'s convertible preferred stock slipped
after it reported a second-quarter loss of $51 million. The
company's 8 3/4% convertible preferred stock Series C ended
down 1/4 point at 42 1/8.
   Among new issues in the investment grade market, Spain
received an enthusiastic welcome when it tapped the corporate
debt market with its first underwritten U.S. debt offering.
   Spain offered $300 million of 10-year notes which were
priced to yield 9.125%.
   Mark Seigel, managing director in the syndicate department
at lead underwriter Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said the offering
received such a rousing response from investors because it
represents "the first opportunity for institutional investors
to purchase a discrete Yankee bond offering" from the Kingdom
of Spain.

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended unchanged to 1/8 point lower, with
some issues off 1/4 point in spots.
   In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were unchanged at 99 1/2 to yield
7.22%.
   No large new municipal issues were priced during the
session.
   Looking ahead on the calendar, New York City will sell
$1.1 billion of tax anticipation notes via competitive bid
today.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese bond yields hit a six-year high yesterday as
investors reacted negatively to a move by the Bank of Japan,
the nation's central bank.
   The BOJ bought a total of 500 billion yen ($3.36 billion)
of overnight commercial paper in two separate purchases. A
Bank of Japan official said the central bank was trying to
offset a rise in rates after the markets misread a 1.2
trillion yen bank loan call the central bank made last
Friday. He said the loan call was meant to drain excess bank
reserves, and not a signal that short-term interest rates
should rise.
   But investors interpreted yesterday's action as a
flip-flop in policy. "The BOJ reversed the move they made
last week, which made the market even more upset because {the
Bank of Japan} is flopping back and forth and is
untrustworthy," said a dealer at a foreign-based securities
firm. "The market is still negative about rates," said
another dealer.
   At the official 3:00 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was quoted
at a price of 85.75, down 0.45 points, to yield 7.47%,
according to Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. That yield was the
highest for a benchmark 10-year bond in six years. During
over-the-counter trading, after the Tokyo Stock Exchange
closed, the yield on the benchmark bond rose further to
7.48%. (Japanese bond yields are quoted here in local terms.
However, when calculated using the semiannual compound
measure to compare yields across markets, the yield on the
No. 119 bond was 6.97%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.,
New York.)
   Japanese rates on new three-month certificates of deposit
were unchanged yesterday at 7.7%. Corresponding Euroyen
deposits, which are securities sold in Europe that pay
interest in yen, were also flat at around 7.69%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended little changed.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were off 1/32 at 99
3/4 to yield 9.67%. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
issues were unchanged at 99 3/ 32 and Federal National
Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were flat at 99 19/32.
   In the primary market, trading began in two new issues, a
real estate mortgage investment conduit and an asset-backed
offering.
   Fannie Mae unveiled details of a $500 million Remic
mortgage issue, offered by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. and backed
by 9.5% Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities.
   And Sears Receivables Financing Group, a unit of Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co., is offering $250 million of securities backed
by credit-card receivables with a coupon rate of 8.70% that
were priced at 99.855 to yield 8.75%.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Juror's Mental State at Issue in Hearing

   In an unusual ruling, a New York judge has ordered a
hearing to determine whether a verdict in a psychiatric
malpractice case should be set aside because one of the
jurors apparently was mentally incapacitated during
deliberations.
   The decision last week by State Supreme Court Justice
Michael J. Dontzin of Manhattan highlights the troubling
question of when jurors should be allowed to change their
minds after they reach a verdict.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The question arose in a lawsuit filed by Audrey McDonald
and her mother, Bertha Jackson. The women sued New York City
Health and Hospitals Corp. and J.C. McIntosh seeking damages
for personal injuries Ms. McDonald sustained in a suicide
attempt just a few hours after Dr. McIntosh didn't admit her
to the hospital. After a two-week trial, the jury rejected
the malpractice claim and ruled in favor of the defendants.
   During post-trial interviews with the women's lawyer, one
of the six jurors said that another juror had appeared
mentally incapacitated during the deliberations. All the
other jurors, including the one in question, later submitted
affidavits in support of the women's request for a new trial,
stating that during deliberations the juror had been
disoriented, confused and unable to connect her thoughts.
   It is common practice for lawyers on the losing side of a
case to conduct such post-trial interviews. In this case,
plaintiffs' lawyer Larry S. Reich told the judge he talked to
the jurors only to assess his own performance in the trial.
But often lawyers also seek to uncover evidence of juror
misconduct or jury tampering.
   However, New York state, along with most U.S.
jurisdictions, typically refuses to allow jurors to impeach
their own verdict. The reason for this is to protect jurors
from being pressured following a trial into attacking the
credibility of their verdict or second-guessing their
decision.
   The one recognized exception to that rule has been when
the jurors claim there was some outside interference during
the deliberations, according to Prof. Stephen Gillers of New
York University School of Law.
   Despite that long-standing policy, Justice Dontzin said
that he could not ignore the serious issue raised by the
jurors and that he wanted to ensure that the plaintiffs were
not denied a fair trial.
   B. Lee Ware of the Houston firm of Vinson &amp; Elkins,
co-author of a book about juror misconduct, said that each
state employs different standards to determine whether a
juror is competent. "Just because the jurors themselves
believe the person is incapable doesn't mean it is true under
the law," Mr. Ware said.
   Lawyers for both sides said they could not comment on the
case because it is still pending. A date for the hearing
hasn't been set.

   INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURE is formed by two big law
firms.
   The new law firm created through the joint venture, called
Brobeck Hale &amp; Dorr International, was launched by 400-lawyer
Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison in San Francisco and 300-lawyer
Hale &amp; Dorr in Boston. The joint venture is believed to be
the first among domestic U.S. law firms.
   The new law firm plans to open a London office in August
and a New York office this fall. Initially, two partners will
work in each branch. All four will resign their partnerships
in the two U.S. law firms. Lawyers involved say the joint
venture is recruiting additional partners and associates for
the new offices.
   Major U.S. law firms have been scrambling to take
advantage of perceived new business opportunites in Western
and Eastern Europe. Many law firms have opened branches in
London and Brussels and some have formed loose affiliations
with European law firms.
   John W. Larson, managing partner of Brobeck Phleger, says
that his firm and Hale &amp; Dorr decided to join forces in part
because they believed their offices on the East and West
Coasts and their similar practices would give them an
advantage in the international arena. Both law firms are
known for their high-tech expertise.
   John D. Hamilton Jr., managing partner of Hale &amp; Dorr,
said the two law firms would put up $3 million to $5 million
over roughly a two-year period to launch the venture. Mr.
Larson said that Brobeck Hale &amp; Dorr could become profitable
by 1993.
   Initially, the two law firms expected to have a third
joint venture partner, the Washington law firm of Hogan &amp;
Hartson. But that firm decided not to participate, largely
because of potential conflicts of interest between its own
clients and clients of the joint venture.
   Separately, Hogan &amp; Hartson announced that it would open
offices in London and Brussels this fall.

   ARIZONA ISN'T IMMUNE from suits filed by drunk drivers,
court rules.
   The Arizona Supreme Court struck down a novel state law
that barred drunk drivers and their passengers who are
involved in car wrecks from suing city and state governments
over poor road design and maintenance.
   The state law was passed by the Arizona legislature in
1984 to deter drunk driving and to help offset a previous
state Supreme Court decision on the liability of local
governments and their employees. The court had ruled in 1982
that governments are rarely immune from liability. The new
law was controversial because Arizona's constitution is
particularly protective of a plaintiff's right to seek
redress through the courts.
   The recent Supreme Court case stemmed from a 1985 crash in
which two passengers were badly injured when the car they
were in slammed into a bridge abutment in Tucson. The
passengers, one of whom is now a quadriplegic, sued the
driver and the city, claiming the road they were on was
dangerously designed and not properly maintained.
   When defense lawyers for the city moved to dismiss the
case against Tucson, the judge declared the new state law
unconstitutional. That decision was overturned by the Arizona
Court of Appeals, but reinstated by the Arizona Supreme
Court. The justices said the question of who may be held
partially responsible for causing injuries must be decided by
juries.
   "The Arizona constitution forbids either the trial judge
or the legislature from interfering with the plaintiff's
right to have a jury examine the existence or extent of
contributory negligence," the court ruled.

   MOSCOW-BOUND: Clifford Chance, a 1,000-lawyer British
firm, announced it will open an office in Moscow later this
year. A Clifford Chance partner and an associate will work at
the new office, which will be jointly operated with the
Soviet Institute of State and Law, a group of Soviet lawyers
and legal scholars.

   BEIJING -- China's imports in the first half of 1990 fell
by almost one-fourth compared with the like period last year,
a government official said, blaming the drop on economic
sanctions imposed after China's crackdown on last year's
pro-democracy movement.
   China's exports, meanwhile, jumped 22% from the first half
of 1989, totaling $24.5 billion, Liu Xiangdong, spokesman for
the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said.

   Justice Brennan's retirement and the nomination of Judge
David Souter to the Supreme Court have almost eclipsed what
might have been the legal news of the month. So before
elaborating on the Supreme Court, we'd like to pause a moment
to note that in reversing Oliver North's convictions, the
Federal Court of Appeals has ruled that the Iran-Contra
prosecutions were indeed kangaroo trials.
   The court's tight reasoning Friday reversed all three
North convictions -- one outright and the other two pending
theoretically possible reinstatement after seemingly
impossible further hearings. It ruled that the North
convictions, and by implication presumably the John
Poindexter conviction as well, may have been tainted by the
misdeeds of Congress and Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Congress forced Mr. North to testify in public during the
summer of 1987. His testimony didn't go the way his
inquisitors had planned; he became a national hero instead of
an excuse to impeach President Reagan. The legal significance
was that Congress forced Mr. North to abandon his right
against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. When a
defendant is given immunity and forced to testify in public,
any trial must proceed without any use in any way of the
coerced testimony. No witnesses, prosecutors or jurors can be
"tainted" by Mr. North's testimony to Congress.
   At Mr. Walsh's urging, trial Judge Gerhard Gesell failed
to hold a hearing on this issue. Now the appeals court says
if anyone wants to keep pursuing Mr. North, there will have
to be a hearing to "inquire into the content as well as the
sources of the grand jury and trial witnesses' testimony."
The court added that the inquiry "must proceed
witness-by-witness; if necessary, it will proceed
line-by-line and item-by-item."
   "We readily understand how court and counsel might sigh
prior to such an undertaking," the court said, in a
not-very-subtle message to Mr. Walsh and/or Judge Gesell to
call the whole thing off. The judges said such a hearing
"could consume substantial amounts of time, personnel, and
money, only to lead to the conclusion that a defendant"
cannot get a fair trial.
   Many witnesses admit hearing Mr. North's congressional
testimony; one witness, Rep. Lee Hamilton, had earlier been
one of his interrogators. As we wrote two years and millions
of taxpayer dollars ago, the immunity issue was one of many
that would have stopped any normal U.S. Attorney from
bringing this case.
   The Fifth Amendment here is no Miranda-style technicality.
While reversing on narrower grounds, the appeals court saw
here the same principle that led the Founding Fathers to
include constitutional provisions banning ex post facto laws
or bills of attainder. This was a political battle
masquerading as a criminal case. The court wrote, "We do not
countenance political trials in this country, and this matter
is not styled Independent Counsel v. Executive Branch or even
Congress v. Executive Branch."
   It is now clearer than ever that Mr. Walsh should cut his
losses and go home. Or President Bush should send him
packing. Congress should forswear its triple punch of forcing
a presidential aide to testify, then sicking a loose-cannon
special prosecutor on him, then having the congressional
testimony used in criminal court. We can hope that Mr.
North's wrongful trial might be this country's last
experiment with political prosecutions.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush proposed the removal of all
U.S. tariffs on certain products exported by Ecuador,
Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, and promised to negotiate
long-term trade agreements with these countries.
   Mr. Bush's proposal yesterday, which requires
congressional approval, is part of an administration strategy
of offering trade incentives to Central and South America
and, in particular, to the Andean nations, which are the
world's largest producers of coca and its derivative,
cocaine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last month, the administration proposed a comprehensive
package of debt reduction and investment incentives for Latin
America. Yesterday's announcement was designed to show
special concern for countries attempting to fight production
and distribution of illegal drugs.
   It was also timed to coincide with yesterday's visit to
Washington of Ecuadoran President Rodrigo Borja, whom Mr.
Bush lauded for having eradicated coca production in his
country in recent years.
   In addition to the removal of tariffs on such products as
plywood, canned crab and various agricultural goods, the Bush
administration package would provide U.S. technical
assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, to aid in
developing agricultural trade for the U.S. Mr. Bush also
signed a package that removes tariff on 67 other products
exported by the Andeans. And he signed a measure establishing
a council to begin work on developing long-term trade and
investment agreements between the U.S. and the Andean
nations.

   Carbide Net Falls
   38%, Monsanto's
   Increases by 2.5%

   Union Carbide Corp. reported that second-quarter profit
fell 38%, while Monsanto Co. posted a 2.5% increase made
possible by an assets sale.
   Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn., continued to be hurt by
the downward pressure on prices in its mainstay commodity
chemical business, though the company's earnings were toward
the high end of the range of analysts' estimates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Monsanto, based in St. Louis, would have posted a 9.6%
profit decline without the one-time gain on the sale, largely
because of a weather-related decline in sales of agricultural
chemicals. Its operating performance was in line with
analysts' expectations.
   The results of these two major chemicals companies will
probably be mirrored as others in the industry disclose
results of the latest quarter. Other commodity makers besides
Carbide, hurt partly by excess production capacity in certain
lines, are expected to post sharp profit declines. More
diversifed companies, like Monsanto, are expected to report
more modest decreases or in some cases increases.
   In the latest quarter, Carbide earned $116.0 million, or
81 cents a share, against $186 million, or $1.33 a share, a
year earlier. The results included a nonrecurring gain of $20
million, or 14 cents a share, from the sale of a business to
Hoechst Celanese Corp. That gain was partially offset by a
charge of $8.6 million, or six cents a share, related to the
expense of discontinuing certain business lines.
   In chemicals and plastics, pretax operating profit fell
39% to $172 million. Profit in industrial gases increased 59%
to $121 million. In carbon products, profit dropped 18% to
$14 million.
   Quarterly sales were $2.14 billion, down less than 1% from
$2.28 billion a year ago.
   Six-month profit was $210 million, or $1.47 a share, down
46% from the year-ago $387 million, or $2.76 a share.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Carbide shares closed at $19.625, up 62.5 cents.
   At Monsanto, quarterly earnings were $247 million, or
$1.90 a share, up from $241 million, or $1.77 a share, a year
earlier.
   The company's one-time gain in the latest quarter was $31
million, or 24 cents a share, which resulted from the
divestiture of certain assets of a joint venture in Japan
with Mitsubishi Kasei Corp.
   Pretax operating profit from crop chemicals fell 20% to
$172 million from the record quarter of a year ago. In the
other chemicals segment, whose products include plastic for
auto windshields, profit fell 12% to $127 million, owing in
large part to slower sales into the U.S. auto industry.
Profit in the G.D. Searle &amp; Co. pharmaceutical unit was $13
million, versus a $4 million loss a year ago.
   Sales edged up 1% to $2.37 billion from $2.35 billion.
   Six-month profit was $441 million, or $3.37 a share, down
4.8% from the year-earlier $463 million, or $3.39 a share.
   Monsanto shares rose $1 to close at $50.25 in composite
Big Board trading.

   Russians Feel Sting of Being in Minority
   As Nationalism Grows in Soviet Moldavia

   TIRASPOL, U.S.S.R. -- It is Sunday morning, usually his
day off, but Mayor Igor Smirnov is sitting at his desk in a
defiant mood. He faces three to 10 years in prison for not
flying Moldavia's newly redesigned flag -- with the hammer
and sickle notably absent -- on top of City Hall, he tells a
visiting reporter. But he just won't do it, he says.
   The new flag looks exactly like the flag of neighboring
Romania, and Mayor Smirnov says he has 40,000 constituents
who fought against Romanians allied with Hitler's Germany in
World War II. "They fought against that flag," he says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Smirnov is a 49-year-old Communist Party official and
former factory director who is used to getting his way. He is
a Russian, and Russians aren't used to being ordered around
by members of the Soviet Union's ethnic minority groups. But
that's just what has happened to him and 1.5 million other
Russians and Russian-speaking Ukrainians since February's
elections, when ethnic Moldavians won control of Parliament
in this tiny republic with a total population of 4.5 million.
   The Parliament has labeled Russians like Mayor Smirnov
"occupiers" on Moldavian soil, declared Moldavia's
sovereignty, and changed Moldavia's name to Moldova. And
under a language law enacted last year, Russian speakers in
top positions in government and industry who don't learn the
Moldavian language by 1994 face losing their jobs. Moldavian
is a dialect of Romanian.
   It's "the worst form of nationalism," says the mayor.
   He and fellow Russians, who make up the majority of the
population along the Dneister River industrial belt, have
launched a civil disobedience counterattack. They want to
carve out their own autonomous region, loyal to Moscow
instead of Kishinev, the Moldavian capital.
   Ever since 1940, when the sunny, fruit-growing area then
known as Bessarabia was annexed by the Soviet Union from
Romania, Moscow was busy pacifying, industrializing and
"Russifying" the region. Russians and Ukrainians poured into
new industrial areas and dominated top jobs in government and
industry. Moscow used its police-state grip to keep local
animosities in check.
   That structure began buckling under Mikhail Gorbachev's
glasnost, or openness, policies. In May 1989, three small
Moldavian dissident groups formed the Moldavian Popular Front
and began staging demonstrations in Kishinev calling for
democracy and the adoption of Moldavian as the republic's
official language. One demonstration reportedly drew 500,000
people -- an enormous number in a republic this small.
   By August, the old Parliament felt enough pressure from
the demonstrations to pass a language law, despite a
month-long general strike in Russian-speaking regions to
protest it. Beyond making Moldavian the language of business
and government in the republic, the law requires Moldavian be
written in the Latin alphabet, as it is in Romania, and not
in the Cyrillic script Russians use.
   In February's elections, Russians and Russian-speaking
Ukrainians won only 117 of the 390 seats in Parliament.
(Communist Party members won 83% of the seats, but they are
split along ethnic lines.) The Moldavian majority's first
acts, when Parliament opened in April, were to change the
republic's name and flag.
   Iurie Rosca, a founder of of the Popular Front, says the
Russians are just another ethnic minority group that will
have to learn to get along with the majority or leave.
   No way, says Mayor Smirnov. He and two other Russian
mayors have refused to fly the new flag atop their city halls
or change their Cyrillic signs to Latin lettering. Parliament
tried to pressure them into compliance June 5 by making it a
crime punishable with a jail sentence not to fly the new
flag.
   On June 21, the Tiraspol City Council countered by
declaring the city's own sovereignty. It also declared the
Moldavian flag and language laws invalid "in territories
densely populated with non-Moldavian residents," and said
Tiraspol, henceforth, would be governed by Moscow's laws and
its own, but not those handed down by Kishinev.
   On June 24, the Parliament passed a law declaring invalid
the 1940 treaty under which Stalin annexed Moldavia and
saying that the Russians have been, since then, an illegal
occupation force.
   The Russian parliamentarians hoped for support from
Moscow, but none came. Historian Pyotr Shornikov, an ethnic
Russian delegate from Kishinev, says "the central authorities
are paralyzed." The Russians haven't gotten any help from
local Communist Party officials either. Petru Lucinsci, an
ethnic Moldavian who is Moldavia's party leader, says simply
that the Russians are going to have to be more
"understanding."
   But that isn't easy. Russians like Mr. Shornikov charge
that the Moldavian Popular Front has secret plans to join
Romania. Popular Front officials deny it.
   Russian delegates have problems getting into the
Parliament building. Last May, demonstrators roughed them up
when they tried to enter the building. Since then, barricades
and uniformed police have surrounded the building. After that
incident, some Russian delegates boycotted Parliament
sessions for a month. They were joined by 12 delegates
representing the Gagauze, a tiny Turkic-language minority.
During their absence, the Moldavians in Parliament pushed
through confirmations of ministers, or cabinet officials.
Eleven of 12 such posts went to ethnic Moldavians. They also
passed a resolution supporting Lithuania's March 11
declaration of independence.
   Outside Parliament, ethnic tension is ever-present. Last
Nov. 7, several Moldavian Popular Front members were arrested
after they climbed aboard Red Army tanks participating in the
annual Revolution Day parade. Three days later, thousands of
their supporters stormed the Ministry of Internal Affairs
building in Kishinev and set several fires inside. That
touched off a melee between internal security troops and
demonstrators that left 142 troops and 215 demonstrators
injured, according to local press accounts.
   In May, a Russian student was cursed and then beaten to
death by ethnic Moldavian youths simply because he was
speaking Russian in their presence.
   What the Russians have going for them here is the
possibility that the Moldavians will break into various
factions. The Popular Front, which held them all together,
has in recent weeks turned on the Communists in its ranks.
   "I can no longer work with such people," says Mr. Rosca, a
front organizer, of the Communists. His boss is the chairman
of the front, Ion Hadirca. He resigned from the party four
months ago. He used to chair the party-dominated Writers'
Union. A few years ago he won a republic prize for a poem he
wrote entitled, "My Communist Youth Card."
   A moderate in the front, Viorel Ciubotaru, calls Mr. Rosca
a "totalitarian" who is trying to drive non-Moldavians out.
Mr. Ciubotaru is organizing a new party, the centrist Social
Democratic party, and has accused Mr. Rosca of tactics bent
on making non-Moldavians "hate Moldavians."
   Another front defector, Andrei Turcanu, says the
organization is full of radicals who don't understand
democracy. They are bullying the Russians, he says.
   "You can't use the same tactics (in Parliament) that you
used on the street," he says. He's organizing a moderate
Christian Democratic Party.
   At its congress on July 1, delegates of the Moldavian
Popular Front told malcontents to shut up or quit the
movement.
   On the same day, residents of the Russian-dominated city
of Bendery voted 9-1 against flying the new Moldavian flag,
and approved the creation of a Russian autonomous region
along the Dniester River.

   Xerox Drops Backer Spielvogel for Y&amp;R

   Backer Spielvogel Bates lost one of its most prestigious
clients yesterday, as Xerox Corp. pulled its $25 million-plus
account and handed it over to Young &amp; Rubicam.
   The switch followed a highly-guarded two-month review
pitting all four of Xerox's U.S. agencies, including Backer,
against one another. The scope of the change came as a
surprise to many in the industry, who had expected Xerox to
yank only the corporate portion of its business, not its
product advertising. Backer had handled both types of
advertising; its "We document the world" campaign ended in
November, while its newest campaign centers on Xerox's recent
Malcolm Baldrige National Quality award.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Xerox and the agencies wouldn't publicly discuss billings,
but industry estimates range from $25 million to $40 million.
According to Leading National Advertisers, Xerox spent about
$18.2 million on U.S. advertising last year.
   The account move deals yet another blow to Backer
Spielvogel Bates, the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. unit that had
handled Xerox since 1986. Backer earlier this year suffered a
painful loss when Prudential Insurance pulled its $60 million
account. The agency also has been a poor new business
performer in the U.S.
   Carl Spielvogel, Backer Spielvogel's chairman and chief
executive officer, declined to comment on the Xerox loss. But
he defended his agency's record saying: "Our business is
strong. On a global basis we have picked up $460 million in
new business this year, and our year isn't over until
September 30." He said most of the wins came in Europe,
followed by Asia, but he added that the U.S. agency is ahead
of last year in billings due to "good growth from existing
clients. We have to gear up our new business efforts, and
that's what we're doing."
   The account loss couldn't come at a worse time for Backer.
With parent Saatchi hit by declining earnings paired with a
heavy debt load, rumors have abounded that Backer would be
put on the block.
   But in an interview yesterday, Robert Louis-Dreyfus,
Saatchi's new chief executive, dismissed the speculation as
"rubbish." He said that in the past three weeks, he has heard
he is selling Backer to at least four different buyers, but
that he has no plans to do so, nor has he ever: "I haven't
changed my mind since the beginning."
   "I echo the sentiment," Mr. Spielvogel said. "At a certain
point, if the parent company decides to sell, they said they
would talk to me and my management group first. I have no
reason to doubt that." Mr. Spielvogel has been quite vocal
about his desire to buy back his agency from troubled
Saatchi.
   For Young &amp; Rubicam, meanwhile, the Xerox account is an
important win. The privately held firm has handled Xerox in
Europe for more than 20 years, and has long wanted to get its
hands on the U.S. business.
   A Xerox spokesman said Young &amp; Rubicam's European
experience was a clear plus, because "Xerox wants more
integration between our corporate campaigns throughout the
world." He said Xerox wants ads that can be adapted for
different countries world-wide. The company's strategy, he
added, will be to position itself as "the document company,"
offering everything from copiers to fax machines to computer
networks. The new campaign is expected to break in September.
   The win was the first following a reorganization at Young
&amp; Rubicam in May, under which Joseph DeDeo, formerly
president of the agency's European operations, became
president of the entire agency. Also pitching the account
were Ogilvy &amp; Mather and Lowe Marschalk, both of which will
continue to handle direct response advertising for Xerox.

   Procter &amp; Gamble pulled its Puritan Oil ad account from
Grey Advertising and awarded it to Ayer, New York. According
to Leading National Advertisers, a tracking firm, P&amp;G spent
about $14 million advertising the brand last year.
   P&amp;G, based in Cincinnati, said it switched the brand
because it wanted to have its two trademark cooking oils
handled by separate shops. Grey, based in New York, will
continue to handle the Crisco brand.

   WASHINGTON -- Ford Motor Co. agreed to pay a $1.2 million
penalty to settle charges of failing to keep proper job
safety and injury records required by the Labor Department.
   Separately, the department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration said the company agreed to establish a
program to reduce injuries caused by repetitive motion tasks
-- which often result from assembly line jobs -- at 96% of
its factories.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As part of its record-keeping agreement, Ford is required
to set up an audit system for workers' health records at 12
company facilities and, if the error rate is more than 5% at
any one plant or nationwide, it must retrain its
record-keeping staff.
   The penalty results from the 1989 inspection of a Ford
Electronics &amp; Refrigeration facility in Lansdale, Pa. OSHA
officials said the incident was the third time the company
was cited for record-keeping violations.
   To help prevent repetitive motion injuries, the company
can change the design of its tools and workstations and use
mechanical devices to do excessive lifting. The United Auto
Workers Union, which represents Ford Workers, will partly
administer the program.

   NATIONAL CONVENIENCE STORES Inc. said its board voted to
suspend the quarterly dividend on its common stock. The
company's most recent quarterly dividend was eight cents a

preliminary, unaudited results for its fiscal year ended June
30 show that its pretax operating loss has narrowed from a
year earlier, but the improved performance "is not sufficient
for the company to retain its common stock dividend." In
fiscal 1989, the company posted a pretax operating loss of
about $14.5 million, said J.C. Brewster, senior vice
president, finance. The net loss was $8.9 million. After a
gain on the sale of assets and an extraordinary credit from a
debt swap, Mr. Brewster said, National Convenience will
report a net profit for fiscal 1990.

   NEW YORK -- Michael Eskridge resigned as president of
National Broadcasting Co.'s consumer and business cable
channel, CNBC, to start a consulting company to manage media
properties.
   Mr. Eskridge, 45, said he wasn't asked to leave his job
and that his first client will be GE Capital, a unit of NBC's
parent company, General Electric Co. Mr. Eskridge, whose new
office will be in the same building as CNBC in Fort Lee,
N.J., said it hasn't been determined yet whether his
operation will be a subsidiary of GE Capital or an
independent contractor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I had always talked about wanting to run broadcast
properties on my own someday," said Mr. Eskridge, who had
management experience in both radio and television in his
nearly 20 years with NBC. "It just so happens that GE Capital
came to NBC asking for help on some of the broadcast
properties they had financed, and they were put in touch with
me." He said he has already begun helping GE Capital and that
he'll be working initially with half a dozen properties,
mostly television stations.
   Despite a perception in the industry that NBC has been
disappointed with CNBC's ratings, subscriber base and ad
sales, Mr. Eskridge said the channel has been a success and
its future is bright. CNBC started in April 1989 with about
13 million subscribers and has about 17 million now. The goal
is 30 million subscribers.

   An Immigrant Economy Less Prone to Pentagon Pulverizing

   The Berkeley graduate who learned socialism from Michael
Harrington thinks the great Southern California capitalist
boom is still young. The prophets from UCLA's management
school, where market theory rules, see the sun starting to
set.
   That may seem surprising, but methodology more than
ideology illuminates the Whither Los Angeles debate. It's a
matter of economic science vs. street sense.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most economists aren't going as far as the UCLA
Forecasting Group in espying the brink of recession. But
clearly layoffs are rolling through 360,000 civilian
aerospace jobs in the state. Most of these are in the Los
Angeles region, although the San Jose area actually has a
higher concentration. McKinsey &amp; Co.'s consultants see at
least a quarter of this work force gone by the end of the
Pentagon downsizing. That's the same proportion as was aced
in the cutbacks that wracked Southern California 20 years
ago.
   The "multiplier" effect on other employment is projected
to extend the current damage. UCLA finds construction
activity already falling through the floor. It detects no
source of strength in any sector. (Another straw in the
western wind: demand for temporary office workers, a good
modern barometer, has been down for months.) The aerospace
bust could be a catalyst for widespread movement away from
the congestion, crime and costs of a spent-out metropolis.
   Enter Joel Kotkin, who left Long Island, N.Y., in the
early '70s and old-line leftism by the '80s to emerge as a
guru of pluralist prosperity in Los Angeles. An "ethnically
conscious" Jew who insinuates himself into the immigrant
neighborhoods and businesses of his adopted hometown, he is a
prolific writer, fellow of a Denver-based outfit called the
Center for the New West and a seeming encyclopedia on the
people and commerce of the new LA.
   The trained experts can't fathom what's going on at ground
level, says Mr. Kotkin, 37. "I can think circles around the
Ph.D.s in economics, at least on this stuff." The history
B.A. sees an unremitting rush of talent, wealth and energy to
the opportunity of this place in the sun. It isn't just
foreigners, he says: domestic in-migration, especially of
young white men, remains strong. But he agrees with the
UCLAns that one breed of Californian, for whom aerospace "was
General Motors transplanted," is in eclipse.
   "A lot of people came to California from the Midwest
looking for paradise, and they found the center of the world
instead," he says. With their plants closing they will not
wish to stay. "There are people who are culturally displaced
in LA. A lot of the unhappiness you hear is Ozzie and Harriet
waking up one morning and finding out that their next-door
neighbor's wife is wearing a sari and the guy across the
street is Filipino." Eight people may be living as an
extended family, noisily celebrating odd holidays and
evincing a busyness that rankles the settled.
   At work, a 50-year-old defense engineer may have no future
here if he's "used to spending all that needs to be spent to
get a perfect specification and he can't get into a
commercial mentality," says Mr. Kotkin. Or if he has a
problem reporting to, say, a young Vietnamese boss at the
sort of specialized R&amp;D firms that will want to stay in the
Los Angeles of tomorrow.
   So some in aerospace will move, at least to the far
reaches of the urban sprawl. But the economy will not
implode, Mr. Kotkin thinks. Each time the Pentagon shrank
after wars, in the '40s, '50s and '60s, he says, LA's
downfall was falsely assumed, because "people in the East
think Southern Californians are a bunch of idiots and that
the only reason they could be any good is that the federal
government is shooting them full of steroids."
   But entrepreneurial industrialists picked up the slack.
Initially they were Howard Hughes and associate Charles
Thornton (later of Litton Industries). By the '70s the huge
influx of foreign investment and people had begun. Unsuited
to military work during its heyday because of security
strictures, these outsiders aren't hurting today.
   "The federal government is becoming more irrelevant to the
economy," Mr. Kotkin maintains, citing the accompanying
chart. (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ July 24, 1990)
Indeed, Pentagon work is a bigger factor in the Washington,
D.C., area and New England than on the West Coast.
   Small manufacturing is king in Southern California. A
garment industry rivaling New York's has sprung up. World
trade and the financing that underwrites it have blossomed.
There's ever-expanding "Hollywood," of course. And the
unmeasurable: "God knows what percentage of the income in
East LA {the Latino center} is being made in the underground
economy," he says. "I don't mean drug dealing -- construction
work, gardeners, people bringing in produce and selling it
off a truck." Mr. Kotkin likens the situation to author
Hernando de Soto's Peru. And he suggests this measure of
success: Homes in East LA, not long ago considered a blighted
barrio, sell for three times what they'd cost in Compton, a
largely black suburb.
   "Half the economy seems to be operating in some language
other than English," exaggerates Mr. Kotkin. "And the money
is coming from someplace else." Along with the Chinese
diaspora, he says, the hottest source is ethnic Indians from
Hong Kong, but they're cooling their heels. "They're coming
in and buying stuff in Cerritos," a middle-class multiethnic
area. "If it doesn't make a lot of money in five years,
that's fine. They got their money out of Hong Kong. Cerritos
isn't going to be taken over by the communist Chinese."
   With all of its lawyers, regulators and outright thieves,
Southern California is no easy pickings for small business,
he acknowledges. But to the immigrant, "the hassles are
infinitely less than dealing with the Mexican bureaucracy, or
having to drive around in a {lousy} car so you don't get
kidnapped in Taipei, or worrying about Li Peng marching into
town tomorrow."
   Northern Mexico's growing vibrancy will change the picture
further. It is already leading to a surge in middle-class
Mexican tourism in Southern California, Mr. Kotkin says. And
the "maquiladora" assembly plants across the border are
proving a market for such components as specialty plastics
made in the LA area.
   If New York City of the early 1900s was the model of the
LA dynamo, doesn't that augur ill? Mr. Kotkin, whose
grandfather ran vaudeville theaters in Brooklyn, says no. New
York's economy choked on corporatization and from a virtual
shut-off of immigration from 1924-65. Los Angeles is
atomistic and, the border laws notwithstanding, maintains a
vital inflow.
   Mr. Kotkin isn't oblivious to the problems that
large-scale immigration can bring. He wants government to
deal with them, which is one reason he still considers
himself a liberal. But whatever his ideology, his layman's
economics may gauge better than sophisticated models the
health of America's second city. If anything was learned from
the failed forecasting of the 1980s, it's that global shifts
of capital, both money and human, count for more than many
realized.

   Lindley H. Clark Jr.'s June 13 Speaking of Business column
suggests that unions have created their own demise. While
some of Mr. Clark's commentary may have validity, it is
mostly flawed reasoning. The most irritating proposition is
that nonunion workers are asking the question "what good is a
high union wage if you don't have a job?" Let's rephrase the
question: "What good is a job if I can't afford food,
clothing, housing and medical care?"
   Mr. Clark suggests, "As union density has decreased,
public attitudes have changed, making it easier for
management to stand up to unions"; a groundless, incorrect
and deceptive hypothesis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The only attitude that has changed is that of the
government, which formerly demanded a level playing field for
both management and labor. The National Labor Relations Act
guaranteed that workers could organize and join the unions of
their choice. But the fact is, nonunion workers are scared
that if they exercise their government-protected rights, they
will be fired from the job that, even as Mr. Clark's
assertion suggests, they so desperately need. This is
economic slavery, not labor-management relations.
   All union people, along with candid management people,
know employers try to intimidate employees. While much of
this intimidation is an outright violation of the law,
employers reason that it is cheaper to pay the paltry fines
than it is to pay equitable wages, health insurance and
pensions.
   Unfortunately, our labor laws are becoming profound
hypocrisy. The U.S. government supports the right of East
European workers to organize and strike and yet its support
of workers' rights at home is disappearing. As a result, Mr.
Clark is correct: Unions are getting weaker.
   In order for labor and management to coexist accordantly,
in a relationship that by its very nature is diverse and
discordant, there must be a balance of the strength each side
can exert. When one side begins to dominate the other, the
end result must be economic collapse or anarchy, and neither
is acceptable. Free and effective labor unions cannot exist
without a democratic society and a democratic society cannot
be a democratic society without free and effective unions.

   Fed Governor Seger, Staunch Supporter
   Of Easier Credit, May Resign This Year

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Martha Seger, the Federal Reserve Board's
most consistent advocate of easier money, said she may resign
this year for personal reasons.
   "I'll probably be making a decision by the end of the year
on whether or not I have to leave," Ms. Seger said in an
interview yesterday. "I'm going to play it by ear."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Seger said she may have to resign to care for her
elderly mother, who lives in Arizona and has recently
undergone hip-replacement surgery and suffered a stroke.
   If Ms. Seger resigns, the Bush administration is unlikely
to find another reserve board governor who will be more
consistent in pushing for lower interest rates than Ms.
Seger. But they may be able to find a replacement who has
more clout with her Fed colleagues. Ms. Seger is considered a
maverick by most of her fellow policy makers at the Fed, and
is thought to have little influence in the policy-making
process.
   Appointed in 1984, Ms. Seger still has eight years to go
in her 14-year term. But according to friends, she has
increasingly complained of getting poor treatment from top
Fed staff, saying they sometimes don't even bother to inform
her of important meetings. In the telephone interview
yesterday, Ms. Seger acknowledged her differences with the
Fed staff, but said that isn't the reason she's considering
leaving.
   Her resignation would give President Bush an opportunity
to make two new appointments to the Fed's seven-member Board
of Governors. Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson already has
announced he plans to resign early next month.
   The Senate earlier this year confirmed Mr. Bush's first
appointee to the Reserve Board, former Treasury official
David Mullins.
   In the interview yesterday, Ms. Seger put herself at odds
with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan by saying she believes the
economy now stands on the brink of recession. "I think we are
at risk," she said. "Whenever you get growth very, very, very
slow, it's easy to tip from modest black ink into red ink."
   She also said she's very concerned that a credit crunch
may be having widespread effects on the economy. "This is one
of the drums I've been beating for some months now," she
said. "I first started to hear it from builders. . . . But it
has spread way beyond that. I'm hearing stories from bigger
businesses in the Northeast whose banks are reacting to tough
regulatory treatment. And a number of car dealers, who are
not exactly teeny, tiny businesses, have found their bank
lines cut."
   Ms. Seger, 58 years old, has a Ph.D. in finance and
business economics from the University of Michigan. Before
coming to the Fed, she was a professor of finance at Central
Michigan University and banking commissioner for the state of
Michigan.

   Your June 13 editorial "The Liberal Barrio" characterizes
the Los Angeles County redistricting lawsuit as simply a
liberal/conservative tug of war. You suggest that the
plaintiffs in Garza v. Los Angeles County and U.S.A. v. Los
Angeles County are seeking new elections in constitutional,
redrawn district boundaries to undermine the board's
conservative majority. You are mistaken.
   The issues are preserving the fundamental right to vote
and ensuring that election systems do not dilute Hispanic
voting strength. Filed by the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund (MALDEF), the American Civil Liberties
Union and the U.S. Justice Department during the Reagan
administration, the lawsuits were tried concurrently.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On June 4, a federal judge ruled the supervisors had
intentionally and illegally gerrymandered district boundaries
to dilute the effectiveness of the Hispanic vote. When
drawing the county's five districts, the incumbents dispersed
Hispanics among several districts instead of leaving their
cohesive neighborhoods intact. As a result, Hispanics have
seen their votes canceled out by the votes of Anglos who,
because of gerrymandering, are the majority in every
district.
   In more than 100 years, no Hispanic has been elected to
the board, even though Hispanics have always been a
significant portion of the county's population. Today, about
35% of all Angelenos are Hispanic. The powerful board, which
administers law enforcement, fire protection and health
services, controls a $10 billion budget and governs more than
eight million people.
   Even after the district boundaries are redrawn, most
Hispanics in Los Angeles will never have the opportunity to
serve on this board. What Hispanics should have and what the
U.S. Constitution guarantees them is the opportunity to vote
in legally drawn districts where their votes have the same
value as everyone else's.

   WASHINGTON -- The House passed legislation that would give
the Securities and Exchange Commission enhanced enforcement
power and would attempt to curb abuses in the penny-stock
market.
   The bill, approved by voice vote, is a combination of two
pieces of legislation. One would give the SEC its first
fining power outside of insider-trading charges. In egregious
situations, it would allow the agency to bar corporate
officers and directors from serving in such capacities at
public companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The other piece would force penny-stock dealers to provide
additional information to investors.
   The Senate already has passed a bill similar to the
House's enforcement measure, but has no penny-stock
legislation in any advanced stage. The bills apparently were
combined to force the Senate to consider including the
penny-stock measure during a House-Senate conference on the
legislation.
   "These two bills represent a powerful expansion of the
enforcement weapons available to combat the problems of
securities fraud in general and the penny-stock market in
particular," said Rep. Edward Markey, the Massachusetts
Democrat who heads the House subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance.
   Still, the penny-stock provision represents a toned-down
version of the original bill, which the SEC had said could
curb some legitimate capital-raising activities.

   Hal O. Carroll's Manager's Journal, "Keep Lawyers -- and
Legal Fees -- on a Leash" (editorial page, June 25),
correctly targets the need for clients -- corporate and
individual -- to view legal services in the context of the
supply-demand equation and insist that lawyers not consider
themselves immune from certain basic rules of the
marketplace.
   But he passes over the biggest culprit: time billing. He
advocates invoices that permit "detailed analysis of time and
cost." As a practicing lawyer for 30 years who spends most of
his time on litigation for corporate and insurance clients,
I'm amazed that the same people who wouldn't think of
reacting to the price of a refrigerator or carpet by asking
"how many hours did it take to produce it?" seem to think
that there's a necessary relationship between time spent and
dollar value when it comes to legal services.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Time billing encourages lawyers to enlarge their bills by
simply spending lots of time creating a product that might
have been 95% as valuable to the client at 25% of the
time-cost.
   The very corporate and insurance clients who are most
victimized by the "billable hour" are the most unbending in
demanding that the firms they hire itemize all services by
time and render bills set by that criterion only. They beg to
be hosed -- and the profession cheerfully accommodates them.
   Robert D. Rachlin
   Burlington, Vt.
   ---
   Most of what Mr. Carroll says is already common practice,
i.e., discount for volume, "triage," cost monitoring,
multiple firms, in-house control, and merits no serious
comment. However, his recommendations on "bidding," conduct
of litigation and "purchasing" legal services are totally
naive.
   Does he realize that corporate (client) management of
litigation exposes the attorney to ethics as well as
liability complaints? There is no conceivable circumstance in
which a lawyer, having conducted his defense in accord with
the pecuniary demands of corporate management, rather than in
accord with sound and accepted legal practice, could
successfully plead -- in a malpractice suit against him -- "I
did it that way because management ordered me to."
   How about a client (insured) who is damaged by an
insurer's litigation decisions, its management presumably
having read Mr. Carroll's admonition: Beware of doing
"everything possible" to win a case? I remind him that in
such a case the defendant is the client of the attorney, not
of the insurance company. For an attorney to act in a way
inconsistent with the attorney-client relationship is bound
to create a conflict of interest that will impeach him in the
event of a malpractice suit or complaint to the bar.
   His real target should be the "adversarial process." An
attorney who does anything other than everything he deems
necessary to achieve a favorable result is as much a fool as
the lawyer who has himself for a client. (My apologies to Abe
Lincoln.)
   As long as we labor within the spirit of the adversarial
system, we have no alternative but to proceed fully and
compentently to victory, once committed to trial. Cost is
necessarily a secondary consideration when measured against
the quality and thoroughness of pretrial work up; as long as
we seek resolution by "combat" there can be no alternative to
quality and thoroughness.

   Measure to Investigate Thrift Debacle

   WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee, propelled by
fear of voter anger over the costly savings and loan crisis,
approved legislation aimed at investigating the causes of the
debacle and invigorating punishment of those responsible.
   The package of thrift-related measures passed by the
committee in a voice vote includes increased spending for
enforcement, new criminal penalties for fraud and the
creation of a national commission to determine the origins of
the S&amp;L debacle and recommend solutions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An amendment offered by Rep. George Sangmeister (D., Ill.)
and approved by voice vote would require life sentences for
the kingpins in S&amp;L fraud schemes.
   The thrift measures were added to a broader anti-crime
bill that received final approval from the committee last
night. The Senate earlier this month approved its own package
of S&amp;L legislation, which has similar goals but differs in
many specifics from the measures approved by the House panel.
   The Bush administration has backed many of the
congressional proposals, but not all. For example, the White
House strongly opposes the creation of a bipartisan
investigative commission as an unnecessary new bureaucracy.
   The House legislation would create new criminal offenses
for concealing assets from a receiver of a failed thrift and
for obstructing a government examination of a financial
institution. The bill would also authorize $153 million for
each of the next three years to hire more prosecutors and
agents devoted strictly to cases involving financial
institutions. That amount is $9.5 million a year less than
what the Senate approved.
   These provisions reflect lawmakers' tendency to stress
that criminal activity caused many of the failures in the S&amp;L
industry. Charging that the Bush Justice Department has moved
too slowly to investigate thrift fraud, Rep. Charles Schumer
(D., N.Y.), lead sponsor of the House measures, said, "It is
critical that the administration prosecute, convict and
punish those who committed crimes against the S&amp;L industry."
   Most law enforcement officials, however, contend that the
vast majority of thrift failures resulted from mismanagement,
lack of government supervision and loosening of industry
regulations by Congress in the early 1980s. Moreover,
whatever new criminal statutes Congress ultimately passes
won't apply retroactively to acts committed before the
sanctions are signed into law by the president.
   On the civil side, the House legislation would give
prosecutors and bank regulators the authority to undo
fraudulent transactions by thrift executives. Under the bill,
S&amp;L defendants would be barred from using the bankruptcy laws
as a shield from court judgments, and regulators could
prohibit "golden parachute" severance payments to thrift
executives.

   The Year Congress Busts Open

   "This is a four-year plan," Ed Rollins, National
Republican Congressional Committee co-chairman, said last
year about his one-year-old attempt to cut into the
Democratic majority in the House. "I tell {candidates}, `It
may take two times, but if you go with us in 1990, we'll be
with you in 1992.'" Over at the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, the same message is being heard. Douglas
Sosnik, political director, says: "For the past year there
have been a significant number of members with safe seats who
are already preparing for potentially tough races in 1992."
   This linkage of two election cycles by campaign
strategists is quite rare, and the result of three factors:
changes in campaign finance law, the reapportionment and
redistricting that will follow the 1990 census and the makeup
of the Senate class that comes up for re-election in 1992.
These factors should combine over the next two election
cycles to produce a record number of retirements, as well as
substantial turnover in both the House and Senate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   During the five elections of the 1980s, an average of
about 31 House members chose not to seek re-election. That's
down significantly from the previous decade, when an average
of about 41 members retired or sought other office. But in
1992 alone, at least six dozen congressmen are likely to
decide against seeking re-election. Combine the 27
representatives who are not seeking re-election in 1990 with
the at least six dozen likely to bow out in 1992, and you
have about a quarter of the current membership back home
after 1992. (The turnover could be even greater if for any
reason -- abortion, S&amp;Ls -- there is a national electoral
tide against one of the parties, as in 1982, or against
incumbents in general.)
   Reapportionment has already had a significant impact on
this year's House races, as incumbents focus their
re-election energies on parts of their districts they think
will gain importance after boundaries are redrawn and
campaign strategists recruit candidates for this race with an
eye toward the new districts of 1992. More than a few
congressmen will find themselves without districts in 1992,
since as many as a dozen states could lose at least one seat
because of population shifts and a handful of larger states
in the Northeast and Midwest will lose at least two seats.
These congressmen will have to retire, run against other
incumbents or seek election to a different office.
   But while redistricting will bring political challenges to
incumbents, 1992 is likely to be best remembered as the year
when dozens of veteran House members took the money and ran.
   House members who took office after Jan. 8, 1980, may not
convert campaign funds to private use. But congressmen who
were sworn in by that date were "grandfathered" by earlier
legislation and can take campaign funds with them when they
leave the House. Due to changes adopted by Congress last
year, however, any officeholder seeking re-election in 1992
will automatically lose the right to convert those funds.
   With 79 grandfathered members having more than $200,000 in
their campaign accounts at the end of March (to say nothing
of the 89 grandfathered members who will run for re-election
this year and have less than $200,000 on hand), it wouldn't
be surprising to see dozens of veteran lawmakers opt for
retirement. Add the 21 members who will reach at least 70
years of age in 1992 but don't yet have at least $200,000 on
hand, and you have another reason for a record House
turnover.
   Naturally, not all members who are eligible to convert
campaign funds will choose to do so. Some simply don't need
the extra cash, and others are in such powerful positions or
have such long careers ahead that they can resist the
temptation. But the change in campaign law will prove to be a
strong incentive for retirement, especially to members for
whom retirement is a consideration anyway.
   With more Republican than Democratic senators up for
re-election this year (18 vs. 16, before the death of
Democratic Sen. Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii), GOP strategists
began this cycle just hoping to maintain their 45 seats in
the Senate. But a strong class of candidates this year has
given the Republicans at least an outside chance of ending
Democratic control of the Senate. Even a GOP gain of a seat
or two in November would place the party in excellent shape
for 1992, when 20 Democratic senators and only 14 Republicans
are up for election. For the GOP, then, 1990 is a stepping
stone to 1992, a presidential election year when the party
has a realistic chance of regaining control of the Senate.
   The Senate class of 1992 offers plenty of opportunities
for ambitious politicians and would-be politicians. At least
three incumbents -- California Democrat Alan Cranston, New
York Republican Alfonse D'Amato and Washington Democrat Brock
Adams -- have suffered from the sort of negative publicity
that usually terminates a political career.
   Sen. Cranston, who has been hurt by his relationship with
financial wheeler-dealer and campaign contributor Charles
Keating, would face a serious primary challenge if he were to
seek re-election. At least five congressmen -- Democrats
Barbara Boxer, Robert Matsui, Tom Lantos and Mel Levine and
Republican David Dreier -- have been mentioned as possible
California Senate hopefuls, and other congressmen might be
interested. Reps. Levine and Dreier, in particular, have been
squirreling away money for years, anticipating a statewide
bid. Both have about $1.5 million in the bank.
   If California Republican Sen. Pete Wilson is elected
governor this November, the state's voters will have to fill
his seat as well in 1992.
   In New York, Sen. D'Amato has been hurt politically
because of his alleged role in the HUD scandal, as well as by
suggestions that he used his influence to help large
contributors to his campaign. Among those mentioned as
opponents are former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, New York state
Attorney-General Robert Abrams, Rep. Thomas Downey and Rep.
Stephen Solarz, who had almost $1.5 million in the bank at
the end of March. And in Washington, Sen. Brock Adams has
been embarrassed by charges that he made sexual advances
toward the daughter of a longtime friend. Republican Rep. Rod
Chandler is mentioned as a likely opponent.
   Other senators up for re-election in 1992 seem likely to
draw credible challengers. Besides Sen. Cranston, two others
of the "Keating Five" -- Democrat John Glenn of Ohio and
Republican John McCain of Arizona -- are up in 1992, and
Senate races in Idaho, Oregon, Wisconsin and a number of
Southern states should produce interesting races. All these
opportunities should attract a record crop of House members
intent on moving up the political ladder or looking for a new
opportunity following redistricting. The nature of the 1992
Senate class, then, should add further to House turnover.
   Some Republican optimists look to 1992 as the year when
the GOP takes over the House. But while unusual circumstances
will combine to create an unusually large number of open
seats, over the past few years the Democrats have proved far
more adept at winning supposedly competitive races. Still,
the likelihood of six dozen House vacancies will give both
parties what they have been clamoring for: an opportunity to
test their appeal in districts without entrenched incumbents.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Industrials Plunge 56.44 on Worry
   Over Earnings, Rates and Inflation

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices suffered their biggest setback in
six months as disappointing corporate earnings and other
worries took their toll on the market.
   An unsettled outlook for interest rates and inflation,
news of financial difficulties facing the largest guarantor
of student loans and waves of futures-related sell programs
also pressured share prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
tumbled 56.44 points to 2904.70.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of the damage was done early in the session as the
market picked up where it left off late Friday, when an
earnings-related slide thwarted the industrial average's
latest attempt to finish above 3000 and left the average with
a loss of 32.67.
   In the first hour of trading, the Dow industrials tumbled
about 60 points as prices steadily eroded. Less than 20
minutes later, the 30-stock measure was down more than 105
points at what proved to be its session low.
   The average then jumped more than 50 points within minutes
after the second wave of selling subsided, but the recovery
was short-lived and prices drifted below those levels until
just before the close.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
skidded 6.30 to 355.31, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index tumbled 3.43 to 194.22 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index dropped 6.01 to 329.86.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,430 to 227 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume swelled to
209,030,000 shares from 177,810,000 Friday.
   The drop in the industrial average was the third largest
point decline this year and the largest since Jan. 22, when
it plummeted 77.45 points. The second-largest drop was
recorded Jan. 12, when it fell 71.46 points.
   On the earnings front, the latest shock came from the
second-quarter report released by McDonald's late Friday. The
stock plunged 3 to 33 in Big Board composite trading of 4.2
million shares in the wake of the report; although net income
rose 10% from the year-earlier level, earnings per share of
59 cents didn't meet analysts' projections.
   An increase in Japanese interest rates overnight put
additional pressure on the market, analysts say, as the move
cast further doubt over whether rates in the U.S. would be
likely to decline soon. Those concerns had surfaced last week
following news that June consumer prices rose 0.5%, which
stoked fears of renewed inflation.
   Also, worries about debt problems in the economy
intensified following a report in this newspaper that the
Higher Education Assistance Foundation, the largest guarantor
of student loans, is facing a possible bankruptcy filing
unless it merges with another guarantor or receives other
federal aid. Student Loan Marketing Association, one of the
foundation's largest creditors, tumbled 4 1/8 to 49 7/8.
   Amid all those developments, sell programs related to
stock-index arbitrage pummeled the market at midmorning as
index futures fell to discounts to the cash indexes. The
arbitrage trading, which involved the sale of baskets of
stocks and the purchase of futures contracts, resurfaced
periodically in the afternoon.
   The Dow Jones Utilities Average, which closed Friday at
its lowest level in 13 months, went down another 1.95 to
200.20. The average hasn't posted a gain in the past seven
sessions and has closed higher only twice in 15 sessions this
month.
   The Dow Jones Transportation Average hit its lowest level
since late June by retreating 23.18 to 1136.13. Among its
component issues, airline and air-freight stocks were
especially hard hit; USAir Group fell 1 1/8 to 23, Alaska Air
Group lost 1 to 21 1/2 and Airborne Freight fell 7/8 to 25.
   The earnings report from McDonald's -- one of the many
consumer stocks to benefit over the past few months from a
focus on issues viewed as most likely to deliver earnings
growth -- came on the heels of a series of disappointing
results last week for technology companies, another market
favorite for some time.
   Taking those reports together, "The growth stock mystique
has been pretty well destroyed," said Michael Metz, chief
market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Mr. Metz said the market's steep drop on the heels on its
late sell-off Friday represents "a really traumatic blow to
confidence" from which investors will need time to recover,
making an immediate rebound unlikely.
   "You're going to have a market that is risk-averse and
gun-shy, at least for the next few weeks," Mr. Metz said.
"Now that confidence has been shaken, you have a market where
there's no great conviction and there's a high degree of
anxiety."
   While expressing greater confidence about the potential
for an immediate recovery, Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of
technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.,
Philadelphia, said stocks have probably seen their highs
"over the next several weeks, and possibly over the next
several months."
   Only two of the more than 80 Dow Jones industry groups
closed higher -- precious metals, traditionally a "safe
haven" for investors in uncertain periods, and trucking.
   Among precious-metals stocks, Battle Mountain Gold gained
1/4 to 11 1/8, American Barrick Resources added 5/8 to 20
3/4, Newmont Mining advanced 1 3/8 to 47 and Placer Dome rose
3/8 to 16 3/4.
   The trucking sector's rise resulted from a rally in
Consolidated Freightways, which gained 1 3/4 to 15 after
issuing its second-quarter earnings report. The company
reported a loss of $3.6 million, or 19 cents a share, but
analysts had generally expected a bigger loss.
   Union Carbide gained 5/8 to 19 5/8 on 1.1 million shares.
The company reported net income of 81 cents a share for the
second quarter, down from $1.33 a year ago but near the upper
end of the range of analysts' estimates.
   Texas Instruments, whose second-quarter earnings report
touched off the market's plunge late Friday, rose 1/2 to 33
5/8 after plummeting 5 7/8 in the prior session.
   Storage Technology, another victim of heavy
earnings-related selling Friday, rebounded 5/8 to 26 3/8.
   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric climbed 4 5/8 to 24 3/8 after Kansas
City Power &amp; Light began a $27-a-share takeover bid for the
company, along with an offer for three preferred-stock
issues. Kansas City Power dropped 7/8 to 31 1/2.
   Kansas City Southern Industries gained 1 5/8 to 48 1/8. A
report in the newsletter "Mergers &amp; Corporate Policy" quoted
a source as saying management is considering a plan to sell
an asset, most likely its railroad unit, and then take the
company private for $80 a share. The company declined to
comment.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 5.53
to 354.92. Volume totaled 17,170,000 shares.

   Ford Set to Lift
   Prices 4% to 5%
   On 1991 Models

   Some Increases of as Much
   As 9% Are Scheduled

<LP>
   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. has told dealers it plans to
raise prices on most 1991 models between 4% and 5%, with some
models jumping as much as 9% from year-earlier levels.
   Among the biggest proposed increases: A $1,077 boost in
the base price of the least expensive Taurus models.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ford's tentative 1991 prices, sent to dealers late last
week, indicate that the No. 2 auto maker wants to boost most
base sticker prices at a rate roughly equal to the general
level of inflation. Ford's pricing moves appear aimed at
bolstering its sagging U.S. automotive profit despite
stiffening competition from Japanese auto makers and General
Motors Corp.
   But some analysts and dealers said Ford will have trouble
making its pricing strategy stick.
   "If the domestic {auto makers} all go up 5%, that will
dramatically narrow the gap between comparable domestic
vehicles and comparable Japanese vehicles," said Shearson
Lehman Hutton analyst Joseph Phillippi. Currently, he said,
many Japanese cars still cost more than comparable domestic
models.
   Ford could change some or all of its prices between now
and the start of the 1991 model year in October. Auto makers
typically look over their competitors' preliminary prices
before setting final numbers for the fall lineup.
   So far, dealers said GM and Chrysler Corp. haven't
released their preliminary 1991 prices. But Chrysler said it
will offer new, low-priced "America" versions of its Dodge
Sundance and Plymouth Shadow compact cars, starting at $7,599
for two-door models and $7,799 for four-door models. The 1991
Sundance and Shadow "America" cars, essentially stripped
versions of current models, replace the discontinued Dodge
Omni and Plymouth Horizon models as the lowest priced
domestic cars in Chrysler's lineup.
   Some of the biggest price boosts Ford plans will affect
certain versions of its Taurus and Sable midsized cars and
its sporty Mustang model.
   Ford is proposing to increase the base price of the
cheapest Taurus L model $1,077, to $13,717 from $12,640 a
year earlier. A Ford spokesman said the 8.5% increase
reflects the replacement of the current three-speed automatic
transmission with a new electronically controlled four-speed
automatic transmission, as well as additional sound proofing.
   Meanwhile, Ford plans to boost the price of the Mustang LX
5.0 Liter coupe $1,106, or 9.1%, to $13,270. The company
spokesman said this Mustang model, which accounts for just 4%
of total Mustang sales, is getting new, larger wheels and
new, adjustable sports seats.
   Ford also plans to raise prices on most truck and van
models. The hot-selling Explorer XLT four-door off-road
vehicle, introduced last March, will start at $19,091 this
fall, up 2.6% from its $18,605 introductory price. Ford is
proposing to boost the starting price of the least expensive
version of the popular Ford F-150 full-sized pickup 7%, to
$10,971.
   In addition, Ford said it will tack on $10, on average, to
the delivery charges customers pay. The delivery charge for a
Taurus LX will rise to $480 from $470, a Ford spokesman said.
And charges for certain optional equipment will go up, too.
Automatic glare-reducing mirrors offered on several of Ford's
luxury models will cost $111 for the 1991 model year, up from
$99 in the current model year.
   Ford actually made its 1991 pricing move in two steps. In
June, the auto maker slapped midyear price boosts on many
1990 models, in a move analysts saw as a way to soften the
blow of increases this fall.
   Dealers had varying reactions to Ford's tentative 1991
prices, first reported in yesterday's editions of the trade
journal Automotive News. "I really feel they were
conservative," said Bill Schicker, owner of McMahon Ford in
St. Louis.
   But Jim Hoffer, manager of Jordan Ford in Mishawaka, Ind.,
expressed surprise at the big proposed increases on the
cheapest Taurus models. "That scares me," he said. "There's
no reason for them to be up a grand."
   Prudential-Bache analyst Philip K. Fricke said even the 4%
to 5% price boosts proposed for the bulk of Ford's lineup may
prove too much for a relatively soft market. "It's kind of
shooting for the stars," Mr. Fricke said of Ford's strategy.
   What's more, Mr. Fricke said, Japanese auto makers are
benefiting from the relative weakness in recent months of the
yen against the dollar. The result, he said is that Japanese
auto makers could "minimize price increases and still offer
more" standard features.
   Indeed, that's what the major Japanese auto makers did
last fall, when the Big Three boosted prices sharply in part
to recover the costs of additional safety equipment. The
result was a sharp drop during the fall and winter in sales
of Big Three cars, and market-share gains for Toyota Motor
Corp., Honda Motor Co., and Nissan Motor Corp.

   NCNB Corp. -- $200 million of subordinated notes, due July
15, 2015, was priced at par to yield 10.20%. Rated single-A-3

   Stone Container Corp., Chicago, said its board amended its
shareholder rights plan to reduce certain triggering
thresholds to protect the company's stockholders in the event
of an unwanted takeover.
   The pulp and paper concern said that as a result of the
change, the acquisition by a person or group of 15% or more
of its common stock will entitle the holders of rights to
purchase a specified amount of the company's common at half
price. Under the company's existing plan, adopted in July
1988, the threshold was triggered at 20%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also, the company removed an exception to this feature
that would have prevented its operation in the event that a
person or group crossing a 30% threshold became the owner of
85% or more of the common through a cash tender offer.
   Stone Container said the amendments weren't taken in
response to any effort to acquire the company.

   Tokyo stocks withdrew further, with prices displaying
widespread bearishness on the Japanese government bond
market's weakness, as well as cautiousness amid busy
arbitrage selling, traders said.
   Meanwhile, London share prices sank in tandem with Wall
Street to close sharply lower, as few issues were able to
escape the general onslaught.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 526.73 points to
31894.79. The drop represents a retrenchment of 1277.49
points, or 3.9%, in the past week.
   At the end of the morning session Tuesday in Tokyo, the
Nikkei index was down 67.66 points to 31827.13.
   Volume on the first section Monday was estimated at 300
million shares, down from 503.6 million shares Friday. Losers
widely outpaced advancers 861 to 151, while 110 issues were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 33.51 points, or 1.42%, to 2329.92. The
Topix also was under selling pressure by arbitragers, though
the average still managed to outperform the Nikkei Index.
   The second section index fell 39.45 points, or 0.90%, to
4360.11. Volume was estimated at 13.5 million shares, down
from 17.7 million shares Friday.
   Traders said they knew before arriving in the morning that
the bond market was bound to remain weak after Friday's move
by the Bank of Japan to call 1.35 trillion yen ($9.07
billion) of bank loans had jostled yields out of a tolerable
range.
   In an unusual and reverse move Monday morning, the Bank of
Japan purchased overnight commercial paper twice for a total
of 500 billion yen, but the attempt to put a cap on yields
was rather ineffective, traders said.
   The stock market paralleled the bond market's unwinding,
although a lack of volume indicated more uncertainty than
panic, traders said.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the yield on the
benchmark, the No. 119, 4.8% coupon of 1999 was up 9.5 basis
points, or hundredths of a percentage point, at 7.47%, the
weakest closing yield for the No. 119. The price was down
0.42, at 85.75. The yield traded to a six-year high of 7.475%
before the stock exchange close.
   Moreover, front-month September bond futures prices were
also hitting lows not seen since early February, traders
said. Indicating further concern about the direction of
interest rates, the move in bond futures encouraged greater
liquidation by stock market participants, traders added.
   J. Graham Biggart, head of futures and options trading at
Schroder Securities, said that one of the major bearish
conditions of the market right now is the vast number of
investors holding long positions and who are being forced to
liquidate because of margin calls.
   Buying opportunities are limited as it is, with interest
rate concerns damping such sentiment. But with the margin
calls, any small rallies will immediately be taken as a
chance to sell off, he said.
   Meanwhile, the yen is beginning to gain interest with
rates at high levels, although there hasn't yet been a
notable advance. Rumors and anxieties that the arrest of the
head of a major Tokyo stock speculator group Thursday could
lead to another Japanese political scandal have prompted some
dollar-buying.
   Should the yen manage to strengthen substantially,
however, stock prices could receive some help, traders said,
as domestic-demand related stocks might rally.
   Financial shares were broadly lower.
   Mitsui Trust fell 20 yen to 1560 yen, and Mitsubishi Trust
fell 40 yen to 1830 yen.
   Nomura Securities dropped 30 yen to 2150 yen, while Nikko
Securities slipped 30 yen to 1180 yen.
   Construction shares were lower. Nippon Hodo fell 200 yen
to 3610 yen, Ohbayashi Corp. slipped 30 yen to 1650 yen,
Taisei eased 30 yen to 1260 yen, and Sekisui House fell 40
yen to 2070 yen.
   Many high-technology shares also fell. Sony dropped 90 yen
to 8800 yen, and Fanuc fell 60 yen to 7350 yen.
   In London, most of the session was listless, as investors
found scant reason for getting involved in the market during
the usually stagnant summer.
   But once New York opened, London stocks sagged under the
weight of Wall Street's losses. U.K. stocks rebounded from
lows just before the close.
   "It came quickly and sharply and obviously sentiment has
been knocked in our market. But I wouldn't say there was an
awful lot of selling pressure," one market maker said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index settled
at 2359.7, just slightly better than the late afternoon low
of 2352.5 and well below the opening intraday high of 2406.3.
The index was off 40.4 points on the day.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 31 points to
1867.1. Volume stood at a relatively meager 369.8 million
shares compared with 437.6 million Friday.
   There were few stocks that went against the general
downward bias. Of these, Lasmo added 12 pence to 434 pence
(22 cents to $7.89) ahead of its interim earnings tomorrow,
and Burmah Oil gained on a buy recommendation from a small
regional-based U.K. brokerage firm.
   Also bucking the lower trend was food maker Ranks Hovis
McDougall, which advanced 7 pence to 347 pence. Anglo Group,
one of Sir James Goldsmith's bid vehicles, said it will offer
holders the opportunity to receive listed Ranks Hovis shares
in exchange for their now-unlisted investment in Anglo.
   The day's biggest loser was Reuters, which shed 38 pence
to #12.29 ahead of interim figures set for disclosure today.
   After the close of trading, U.K. conglomerate Hanson said
it has held discussions with the government that could lead
to the private sale of PowerGen, an electricity generator.
Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, confirmed the company has a
"firm interest" in making a bid for PowerGen. Hanson fell
7.25 pence to 233 pence.
   Thorn EMI shed 24 pence to 735 pence. Dealers said the
stock was sold on rumors of an imminent acquisition.
   Elsewhere, shares closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid and Milan. South African
gold stocks closed higher. Brussels was closed for a holiday.
   Also, stocks closed lower in Sydney, Taipei, Seoul,
Wellington and Manila, mixed in Singapore, and higher in Hong
Kong.

   I submit the following footnote to Peter Keresztes's
review of "Letters to Freya, 1939-1945" (Leisure &amp; Art, June
25), the correspondence of the German resistance leader Count
Helmuth James von Moltke to his wife, Freya.
   Readers of the review will be interested in George F.
Kennan's tribute to Moltke found on pages 119-122 of his
"Memoirs: 1925-1950" (Little, Brown, 1967).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kennan writes: "I consider him, in fact, to have been
the greatest person, morally, and the largest and most
enlightened in his concepts, that I met on either side of the
battle lines in the Second World War."
   He concludes: "I record all this because the image of this
lonely, struggling man, one of the few genuine
Protestant-Christian martyrs of our time, has remained for me
over the intervening years a pillar of moral conscience and
an unfailing source of political and intellectual
inspiration."

   My compliments for running a review of "Letters to Freya"
by the remarkable Count von Moltke. He was a great hero. Not
to nitpick, but as an old OSS man I was much involved and the
Stauffenberg assassination attempt was July 20, 1944, not
July 1. The term "Zwanzigster Juli" has entered the German
language as a euphemism for courage and sacrifice.

   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. -- The value of mergers and acquisitions
proposed in the second quarter plunged 46%, despite a 12%
rise in the number of transactions, as the focus of activity
shifted to sell-offs of "mid-market price range" businesses,
a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. unit says.
   There were 626 M&amp;A deals valued at $30 billion that were
initiated in April, May and June, compared with 561
transactions valued at $56.4 billion in the year-earlier
three-month period, according to W.T. Grimm &amp; Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The megadeals of the 1980s are no longer the norm," says
Beth Rosencrans, research director at W.T. Grimm.
   The value of corporate combinations proposed in the second
quarter also fell 13% from the $34.3 billion of transactions
begun in the first quarter, as the number of transactions
launched rose 6.8% from 584 in the first three months of the
year, W.T. Grimm says.
   The total value of the 10 biggest transactions announced
in the first six months of 1990, $22 billion, is less than
half the value -- $55 billion -- of transactions announced in
the like 1989 period, W.T. Grimm says.

outstanding but maintained the purchase wasn't a prelude to a
takeover of the Reno, Nev., company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the investor group, which includes John Simmet and his
closely held company, Simcote Inc., St. Paul, Minn., said it
holds 652,000 Syntech shares, including 265,000 shares
purchased between May 24 and last Thursday.

   NEW YORK -- For those who follow the ups and downs of
Donald Trump, there may soon be some new SEC-approved
securities. Call them Trump futures, though they don't yet
have a name.
   The new securities, currently in the process of being
hatched, would rise and fall with Mr. Trump's perceived
ability to satisfy potential claims arising from his 1988
sale of Resorts International to Merv Griffin.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Resorts, a gambling concern that later fell on hard times,
will be in U.S. bankruptcy court in Camden, N.J., today
proposing a plan of reorganization. The plan has the backing
of creditors and is expected to be confirmed by Judge
Rosemary Gambardella.
   For the record, the plan would halve Resorts' debt to $435
million from $931 million. Creditors would receive about
three-quarters of the company's stock; Mr. Griffin, who would
remain as chairman and who would invest an additional $23
million in cash, would get 21.5%. This much, in the arcane
world of bankruptcy, is standard operating procedure.
   But a novel feature of the plan "provides that a trust
will be established and funded to pursue for the benefit of
{Resorts creditors} all claims the debtors and their
affiliates may have against Donald Trump, Trump Taj Mahal
Associates L.P." and various Trump affiliates.
   Holders of nearly $600 million of the company's debt
securities have argued that the sale of Resorts, and a
related transaction with Mr. Trump, constituted a fraudulent
conveyance -- in laymen's terms, that is, so weakened Resorts
as to leave it insolvent, leading to the company's
bankruptcy-law filing.
   Under fraudulent-conveyance law, former shareholders of a
company can be ordered to return the cash they received for
their shares in these circumstances.
   The reorganization plan, which is opposed by Mr. Trump,
transfers the purported causes of legal action against Mr.
Trump to a separate trust. Ten million units of the trust
will be distributed to Resorts creditors, and the value of
these units will consist of whatever settlement or award the
trust can win from Mr. Trump.
   Marc Kirschner, an attorney for the creditors committee at
Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, says he expects that the units
will be tradable securities. "We have applied for a
`no-action letter' from the Securities and Exchange
Commission," meaning a letter stating that trading the units
wouldn't violate U.S. law.
   "We believe they comply with applicable laws," he says.
"If we get the letter, they will be tradable securities."
   It's uncertain who would make a market in this special
sort of Trump securities, but it's expected that somebody
would. "They wouldn't be listed. It would probably be some
sort of over-the-counter market," says Arthur Newman, a
Chemical Bank restructuring specialist hired to advise the
Resorts creditors.
   "Creditors feel there is a very significant cause of
action which should yield a large return," he says.
   Mr. Trump declined to comment.
   But an attorney for Mr. Trump says "Mr. Griffin structured
a takeover that piled on more debt. It's as clear as can be
that Griffin and not Trump was responsible for the financial
debacle at Resorts." Under the reorganization plan, however,
debenture holders would release Mr. Griffin from
acquisition-related claims.
   To put some teeth into the trust, Resorts will endow it
with a litigation kitty of $5 million. And the trust has
hired lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, a heavyweight partner of Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, to serve as trustee and to
spearhead any litigation.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Trump and Resorts debenture holders have
been trying to negotiate a settlement. Both sides may have an
incentive for doing so now.
   Currently, the creditors committee could approve any
settlement. But once Mr. Feinberg takes over as trustee, any
deal would need the approval of a majority of unit holders.
Both sides are thus likely to spend much more time and money
on the case if a settlement isn't reached fairly soon.
   Creditors were once dreaming of collecting $100 million or
so, but that was before Mr. Trump's financial distress became
household news. Some people close to the matter now say the
litigation-related units could be worth a total of $20
million to $50 million (including any unspent portion of the
litigation kitty).
   Mr. Trump, whatever his net worth, still controls hundreds
of millions of dollars in assets. But he is believed to be
using his troubles to his advantage. "He can argue that even
if we prevail, what do we have?" one creditor says. "That's
how talks have been going."
   If the matter isn't settled out of court, it's anybody's
guess where the units will trade.
   "They are clearly worth something, but I haven't figured
out how much," says William Teitelbaum, a Resorts debenture
holder and a member of the creditors committee.
   "There are two issues. Is there a significant judgment
that can be won? It's my belief that there is. The real issue
is: Is it collectable? I haven't seen Trump's financial
statements."
   Mr. Trump sold his controlling interest in Resorts stock
for $96 million; he also received roughly $60 million from
Resorts in exchange for terminating his management contract
with the company. And, in addition, Mr. Trump purchased back
from Resorts the then-unfinished Taj Mahal casino for $273
million in cash.
   "What the bondholders have on their side is common sense,"
one bondholder claims. "Resorts was sold in November of 1988.
The deal put $325 million of additional debt on its books. By
June of '89 they were saying they couldn't make interest
payments." And six months after that, the company filed for
bankruptcy-court protection.
   An additional possible claim is that Mr. Trump underpaid
for the Taj. However, given the Taj Mahal's uncertain state,
that claim is considered weaker.
   One point in Mr. Trump's favor is that while
fraudulent-conveyance suits have been a hot topic, the area,
as it applies to modern leveraged buy-outs, is uncertain and
relatively new.
   Another point is that $50 million of the money used to
purchase Mr. Trump's stock was invested by Mr. Griffin. Thus,
Mr. Trump could argue that this portion of the payment didn't
directly weaken Resorts.
   If the units do begin trading and are offered cheaply,
bankruptcy specialists note that Mr. Trump might want to
acquire some and reduce his exposure.
   "If they get cheap enough, I'll want to buy them," one
debenture holder says. "But I don't know what cheap enough
is."

   LONDON -- A last-minute, cost-cutting agreement reached
with unions at Irish Press newspapers paves the way for the
Ingersoll-managed group to restore the papers to a prime
position in Ireland, Ingersoll said.
   The group, Irish Press Newspapers Ltd., is 50% owned by
U.S. publisher Ralph Ingersoll's British company, Ingersoll
Publications Ltd. The remainder of the company is owned by
Irish Press PLC, which belongs to Ireland's de Valera family.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The group reached the agreement with the National Union of
Journalists and the Irish Print Union on Sunday, just before
it was to close down the Irish Press, Evening Press and
Sunday Press.
   The settlement calls for 200 voluntary layoffs, an
immediate start to the use of new technology, and the
introduction of a basic five-shift, 35-hour workweek
throughout the company. Journalists have been working a
four-day, 28-hour week. The 750 workers had rejected the same
proposals on Thursday.
   Ingersoll Publications, which bought a half-stake in the
newspaper group in December, also manages the newspapers.

   Some Lawmakers to Return Donations
   From Failed S&amp;Ls to Help Rescue Effort

   WASHINGTON -- Politicians have stumbled onto a new funding
source for the multibillion-dollar thrift bailout: their own
campaign contributions.
   In a ritual reminiscent of the potlatch, an ancient Native
American ceremony in which tribal leaders would demonstrate
their virtue by giving away their most valuable belongings,
an increasing number of politicians, with great fanfare, are
returning political contributions from the savings and loan
industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among those who have vowed to return some or all of their
S&amp;L contributions are Sen. Robert Dole (R., Kan.), Chairman
Ronald Brown of the Democratic National Committee and Sen.
Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), who is under scrutiny by the
Senate Ethics Committee for his ties to the failed Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   The politicians appear to disagree about what to do with
the spurned donations. In a Sunday appearance on NBC's "Meet
the Press," Sen. Dole said he thought it made the most sense
to give the money to the Treasury. That's the tack Sen.
Riegle plans to take as soon as he's finished
"cross-checking" his files for S&amp;L money, a spokeswoman said.
But the DNC prefers to return a $5,000 S&amp;L donation to the
giver, whom it declines to identify.
   Sen. Tim Wirth (D., Colo.) chose a more novel approach:
giving the money to his home state's department of revenue.
   In a prepared statement, Sen. Wirth said he would rid
himself of $98,950 in campaign contributions from the savings
and loan industry and from S&amp;L customers "known to have
failed to repay S&amp;L loans." The figure represents an
accumulation of contributions going back to 1980, when
banking deregulation began. At the time, Sen. Wirth was a
member of the House.
   Sen. Wirth said he was giving the money to his home state
because Colorado taxpayers are voters, because Coloradans may
have been personally liable as U.S. taxpayers for
contributions made by owners of failed S&amp;Ls, and because "the
cost of the S&amp;L scandal will be carried by every Colorado
taxpayer." Asked to elaborate, Sen. Wirth said that if the
money went to the U.S. Treasury it would be spent to "build
MX missiles."
   The issue of savings and loan contributions has been
prominent in a few House races around the country. In
Georgia, for example, a potential Republican opponent to
Democratic Rep. Doug Barnard put up billboards urging Rep.
Barnard to give back $20,000 in campaign contributions from
Charles Keating and his associates. Mr. Keating controlled
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, whose failure is expected to cost the
government $2 billion. A spokesman in Rep. Barnard's office
said the congressman has returned some S&amp;L contributions but
not the Keating money.
   Thrift contributions began to loom larger as an issue
earlier this month when Edward Rollins, co-chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, said on NBC's
"Meet the Press" that "any member who took money from the
savings and loans ought to throw it into the Treasury and
make a contribution towards this massive problem." Mr. Brown,
another guest on the program, responded with the pledge that
the DNC, "if we have received any money, is giving it all
back." According to DNC spokesman Michael McCurry, Mr. Brown
had already arranged to return the $5,000.
   A few days after Mr. Rollins's televised remarks, a
spokesman for Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), who faces
re-election this fall, told the Detroit News that Sen. Levin
would send to the U.S. Treasury campaign contributions from
any individuals who are "under investigation for civil or
criminal wrongdoing" involving thrifts. Sen Riegle made his
pledge the following day.
   Sen. Levin's spokesman, Willie Blacklow, said that Sen.
Levin had recently sent some S&amp;L money to the Treasury,
though he wouldn't say how much.
   There are signs that the Republicans are beginning to
regret making thrift contributions an issue. One week after
Mr. Rollins's appearance on "Meet the Press," Sen. Dole faced
rigorous questioning on the same program about his
presidential campaign's political contributions from Mr.
Keating. Sen. Dole said he'd be happy to return the Keating
money, but protested, "We had thousands of contributors; I
didn't go down and check them out."

   Trading Halt

   The "circuit breakers" that have gradually been added to
financial markets since 1987 got their toughest test of the
year yesterday. They passed.
   The system of trading halts in the Chicago stock-index
futures market, order slowdowns on the New York Stock
Exchange and other measures aimed at preventing a financial
meltdown began to be invoked shortly after 10:30 a.m. EDT. At
that point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen more
than 100 points in the first hour of trading and was sinking
about two points a minute. Selling pressure was concentrated
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where futures on the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index are traded.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At 10:34 a.m., the S&amp;P futures had sunk to 352.80, down 12
on the day. That decline was enough to trigger a Merc circuit
breaker that blocked any S&amp;P futures trading at lower prices
for 30 minutes.
   The Merc's restriction "certainly broke the decline," said
Ron Bechky, a stock trader at Montgomery Securities Co. About
16 minutes later, enough buy orders began arriving at the
Merc that futures trading could resume at higher prices.
Futures rallied somewhat in the next hour, while stocks also
recovered some ground.
   The Merc's circuit breaker "did exactly what it was
supposed to do," said Jay Hohmann, head of futures trading at
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. "It gave the
market a moment to stabilize itself."
   Although stocks and futures spent the rest of the day deep
in minus territory, the remainder of trading was far more
orderly. By day's end, stocks and futures had recouped much
of their losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at
2904.70, down 56.44, while the S&amp;P futures finished at
357.85, down 6.95.
   The New York Stock Exchange took less decisive action
yesterday. It doesn't have any provisions for halting
trading, no matter how sharp a single day's price declines
may be. The Big Board did, however, take several small steps
toward reining in stock-index arbitrage trading for the day.
   In index arbitrage, traders shuffle money between futures
and broad baskets of stocks, depending on which is cheaper.
As the Dow Jones industrials fell 30 points, and then 75
points, the Big Board blocked index arbitragers from quick
access to its automated order delivery system.
   Shortly after noon, the Big Board also asked that index
arbitragers "voluntarily" agree to sell individual stocks
only if the most recent price change was upward. This
restriction is meant to avoid an avalanche of selling in
stocks that are already falling in price.
   Traders differed on how much impact, if any, the Big
Board's actions had. "It had no effect on us at all," said
Jeff Miller, a managing partner at Tabak Miller &amp; Hirsch, a
New York securities firm specializing in index arbitrage. But
a major index arbitrager, who asked that his named not be
used, said the Big Board's curbs "kept us from doing index
arbitrage as aggressively as we wanted."
   Last month, a New York Stock Exchange panel headed by
General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith called for more
extensive circuit breakers, including a one-hour Big Board
trading halt if the Dow Jones industrials fell 100 points.
Yesterday's partial market rebound without a trading halt,
however, is likely to undercut the Smith panel's
recommendations, which already had met plenty of investor
resistance.
   "Circuit breakers can't keep markets from going up or
down," said Robert Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust
Co. "All they can do is allow all participants to be informed
about where the market is and develop their strategies
accordingly."
   According to traders at the Chicago Merc, yesterday's
market sell-off began with big futures sell orders from major
Wall Street firms such as Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co. The Merc traders speculated that the sell orders
were on behalf of European investors; the traders said the
selling helped drive down the stock and futures market in the
initial 30 minutes. Salomon and Goldman traders declined to
comment on their activities.
   At the market's midmorning bottom, Merc traders said,
about 600 to 700 S&amp;P 500 contracts were offered for sale by
speculators and other firms. Each S&amp;P contract represents 500
times the value of the S&amp;P 500 index and is worth about
$178,900, so the total amount offered corresponded to about
$107 million in stock.
   The Merc traders said that Salomon bought about 250 to 300
contracts, while Goldman purchased about 150. That buying
soaked up a lot of selling pressure, traders said, and helped
the stock and futures markets rebound.
   If the Merc traders' figures are accurate -- and if
Salomon and Goldman were trading for their own accounts
instead of for customers -- yesterday was a profitable day
for the two Wall Street giants. If Salomon held the futures
contracts it purchased at midmorning until the market close,
it would have booked at least a $750,000 profit on its
futures trades, while Goldman would have cleared $450,000.
   Another stock-index futures contract, the 20-stock Major
Market Index, which is traded on the Chicago Board of Trade
and mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average, sank low enough
yesterday morning to set off a circuit breaker. Trading in
the MMI was effectively halted for seven minutes, beginning
at 10:40 a.m. EDT, a Board of Trade spokeswoman said. At that
point, the MMI was down 20 points at 579.50.
   ---
   Corrections &amp; Amplifications
    THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE will halt trading for one
hour if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 250 points.
The Big Board delays program traders' use of its automated
order system by five minutes only if stock-index futures fall
enough to trigger trading limits at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Yesterday's edition misstated the Big Board
restrictions.

   A proposal by Alfred A. Checchi, chairman of Northwest
Airlines parent NWA Inc., suggesting a "controlled
liquidation" of Eastern Airlines, was presented to financial
advisers for Eastern's creditors, but no action was taken.
   Under the proposal, Northwest, St. Paul, Minn., would take
over certain Eastern planes, airport gates and maintenance
facilities, and arrange the sale of the rest of Eastern's
assets to benefit its creditors, people familiar with the
proposal said. If such an arrangement materializes, Northwest
could strengthen its position on the East Coast with little
risk, while offering Eastern's creditors a resolution of the
carrier's 16-month-old proceedings under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Advisers to Eastern's creditors are expected to report on
the plan soon to the full creditors committee. That panel's
endorsement would probably speed the bankruptcy court
approval needed for such a proposal to take effect. Committee
representatives couldn't be reached for comment.
   Eastern reiterated it hasn't received any offer from
Northwest to acquire any part of the airline. It said that
Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the court-appointed trustee running
the airline, a unit of Houston-based Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc., has said there is no intention to liquidate
Eastern, and that the carrier is interested only in offers
for the complete operation and its employees.

   Blackstone Group and media investor I. Martin Pompadur
said they formed a joint venture to invest $100 million of
equity capital in domestic and foreign media and
entertainnent properties.
   The investors are entering the media market at the bottom,
which may be to their advantage as buyers. With uncertainty
in the regulatory market and the restrictions on highly
leveraged transactions that characterized the cable industry
in the past, for example, cable system sales have slowed to a
trickle. Radio and television stations have been hurt by a
difficult advertising climate, as have newspapers and
magazines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's really a sluggish time" because of the various
problems confronting the industry, Mr. Pompadur said, adding
that a number of media properties could be helped with an
infusion of equity and some operating expertise. Henry
Silverman, a general partner at the Blackstone investment
firm, said his group believes it is "a perfect time to get
into the media business" because many operators are facing a
liquidity crunch. He said the venture will specifically seek
distressed situations.
   Mr. Pompadur is a longtime media executive and investor
who has raised several hundred million dollars since 1983
through various public limited partnerships for media
investments.
   Blackstone's Mr. Silverman said the $100 million will come
from Blackstone's general pool of funds.

   LONDON -- Sir James Goldsmith believes he knows how to
make bread in the food business.
   Sir James, whose investment group owns 29.9% of Ranks
Hovis McDougall PLC, is urging the major British baker and
food producer to expand into Europe "instead of buying brands
in the U.S."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There are two natural opportunities for RHM: Western
Europe, where the market is fragmented, and Eastern Europe,
where the food industry is retarded, insufficient and
inefficient," Sir James said in an interview in Paris. "In
Eastern Europe, you've got the opportunity not for products
like pheasant in aspic, but good-quality healthful foods."
   The Ranks Hovis stake is Sir James's last remaining
holding of his investment vehicle, Anglo Group PLC, which
offered holders a small part of its Ranks Hovis stake in
exchange for Anglo common and bonds.
   Ranks Hovis has some of its own ideas about business. The
company agreed to sell its breakfast cereal operation to CPW
S.A., a joint venture of General Mills of the U.S. and Nestle
S.A. of Switzerland, for #93 million (US$167 million).
   In Windsor, England, Bob Rogerson, Ranks Hovis finance
director, said "we don't disagree" with Sir James's views
about Western Europe. "We have a natural affinity for Western
Europe -- but we can't be everywhere." And, he said, the
situation in Eastern Europe "is less clear -- those markets
aren't so well-developed, nor are the countries wealthy."

   Restaurants Plan to Switch

   McDonald's Corp., joining the fast-food flight from
cholesterol, plans to stop cooking its french fries and hash
browns in saturated fat.
   At one time, McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., had
resisted suggestions that it drop beef tallow shortening,
which is heavy in saturated fat, from its cooking process.
The company contended that the tallow enhanced the fries'
taste.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But yesterday, after a similar move by rival Burger King,
McDonald's said it will convert from a blend of tallow and
vegetable shortenings to an all-vegetable oil it said is
nearly free of cholesterol. The current blend is 55%
unsaturated. The new cooking process will be 100%
unsaturated, McDonald's said.
   McDonald's has been under increasing pressure from
nutrition-minded critics to drop tallow. In its announcement
yesterday, the fast-food chain said the decision "was based
on the very positive results from more than eight years of
extensive research and customer tests."
   It said the change is expected to be completed in its U.S.
restaurants by year's end.

   Marathons Keep Track
   Of Runners With Tags

   THE PHOTO FINISH may become a quaint anachronism as sports
events and auto races begin using digital radio-tag
technology.
   Contestants wear wristwatch-sized devices that emit a
unique low-power signal used to identify and time them. The
tags already have been tried on a test basis in the Los
Angeles Marathon, in triathlons and in cycling and
wind-surfing races.
   William Burke, president of the marathon, says several
companies offered to supply radio-tag systems, from giants
such as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to a start-up
called American Sports Timing Inc. of Topsfield, Mass. He
says they chose the start-up's system because it "seems to be
the one that is farthest along, with the best accuracy." Mr.
Burke says correctly timing the 20,000 entrants whom the race
attracts has become "a logistical nightmare."
   David McGillivray, technical coordinator of the Boston
Marathon, calls radio-tag technology "the wave of the future"
and says the nation's oldest marathon is considering it for
future races.
   Davy McKee Corp., a British company that makes radio tags
for industrial and transportation applications, says its
customers have come up with some surprising uses. Hospitals
use the system to keep track of wandering patients, while
others have begun using them to prevent mix-ups or even
kidnapping of babies.
                                                                                                       

   Relief Is Coming Soon
   For Lousy PC Graphics
                                                                                                       

   NEW CHIPS in the pipeline promise big enhancements to the
power of PCs.
   Researchers at Edsun Laboratories Inc., a chip designer in
Waltham, Mass., have developed a device that squeezes
stunning graphics performance out of an ordinary $400 color
computer monitor. The chip, which plugs into the standard
graphics boards inside most computers, displays as many as
790,000 colors -- compared with just 256 for the board by
itself -- and smooths out the jagged edges that appear when
curved or diagonal lines are drawn on most screens.
   The chip lets pixels, individual points of light on a
screen, display two colors at once. In conventional designs,
pixels display just one color, causing the jagged edges and
limiting the color palette. The chip makes PC screen
resolution almost as good as that of a $10,000 workstation,
producing almost photo-quality images.
   Steven D. Edelson, chairman, says several computer makers
are negotiating to use the chip, which would cost about $15
each, in forthcoming products. He wouldn't name the
companies.
   Another chip maker, Chips &amp; Technologies Inc., has
developed add-in PC accelerator boards to speed up specific
software programs such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Windows.
While accelerators aren't new, tailoring them for specific
mainstream software packages is unusual. As software becomes
more complex and slower-running, demand for these
turbochargers could take off.
   Industry insiders say Chips &amp; Technologies is discussing
some novel marketing approaches with major software makers.
The company hopes to be ready to show a Windows booster at
Comdex, the big fall computer exposition.
                                                                                                       

   Large Computer Buyers
   Found a Software Clique
                                                                                                       

   THE STRUGGLE over software standards has computer makers
forming cabals and consortiums of every stripe.
   Now, fed up with the fractious process of setting
standards, a few big corporate computer purchasers have
formed a clique of their own.
   Dubbed the Houston 30, for the city where the first
meeting took place, the informal group is made up of
computer-systems managers from some of the nation's largest
purchasers of computers, including General Electric Co.,
Eastman Kodak Co., General Motors Corp. and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Together, they
represent billions of dollars in buying power.
   "There's a growing frustration among corporations over the
slow progress toward achieving open systems," says Bud Huber,
a Hughes Aircraft Co. network systems manager. The group,
which meets again in September, hopes to force faster
progress toward standards that allow different companies'
computers to run the same software.
   There's a lot at stake for these companies -- and for
computer makers -- in the shift to open standards. Buyers
want standards so they don't get locked in to a particular
company's hardware design. Computer makers, some customers
suspect, want to slow the emergence of true standards to
protect fat profit margins.
   The group was especially critical of the impasse between
AT&amp;T's Unix International software unit and the Open Software
Foundation, a group backed by International Business Machines
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp. They
called the failure of the groups to agree on a standard "a
classic example of vendors making their {interests} paramount
to the detriment of the customer base."
                                                                                                       

   In Software Industry,
   Big Shots Get Bigger
                                                                                                       

   CONSOLIDATION continues apace in software, as mergers have
erased half of the companies that were in the top 10 of
Software Magazine's Top 50 list five years ago.
   But the Big Three just got bigger: Computer Associates
International Inc. was tops in 1989 with $1.29 billion in
world-wide sales, while Microsoft Corp. surged into second
past Lotus Development Corp. with sales of $691 million.
Lotus, with sales of $556 million, came in third in the $25
billion world market for packaged software, the magazine
said.

   Mycogen Corp., San Diego, posted its first profitable
quarter, with net income in the second quarter of $209,000,
or two cents a share, compared with a net loss of $184,000,
or three cents a share, in the second quarter of last year.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 48% to $4.3 million from $2.9
million last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the first half, the maker of biological pesticides
said its net loss narrowed to $466,000, or five cents a
share, from a net loss of $919,000, or 13 cents a share, last
year. Revenue for the first six months was $7.4 million, up
55% from $4.7 million in the same period last year.
   The profitable quarter follows several recent moves by the
company, including receiving federal government approval in
March to do large-scale commercial tests on a genetically
engineered pesticide called MVP. Mycogen also entered into
two separate joint research pacts; with Monsanto Co. in June
to develop plants genetically resistant to pests, and with
S.C. Johnson &amp; Son Inc. in May to develop biological
pesticides for common household pests.

   Schwab Subsidiary
   Is Fined, Censured

   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange censured and fined
Charles Schwab &amp; Co. $375,000 for allegedly misusing
customers' stock for the firm's profit.
   The fine against the nation's largest discount broker is
among the stiffest ever levied by the Big Board. And the
case, similar to recent regulatory action against Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., underscores the increased
scrutiny regulators are placing on brokerage firms'
back-office operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In any examination of member firms, we'll be looking for
these practices," said Regina Mysliwiec, a vice president in
the Big Board's enforcement division.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Schwab, a unit of
San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., agreed to a finding
that it surreptitiously used customers' stock to participate
in more than 150 tender offers or other reorganizations
between 1985 and 1988, booking about $2.4 million in profits
for the firm.
   As part of the settlement, two Schwab executives were
censured without admitting or denying the allegations. Barry
Snowbarger, a senior vice president, agreed to a censure, a
one-month suspension and a supervisory bar for 18 months from
the firm's operation and credit areas. Stephen Cass, a vice
president, consented to a censure and supervisory bar of 12
months, with the exception of direct project support staff,
the exchange said.
   Neither man was available for comment, a Schwab spokesman
said.
   Schwab, which said the practices involved less than 1% of
its customers, repaid nearly $3 million to customers in early
1989 after company officials discovered the problem. In a
statement, Charles R. Schwab, the firm's founder and
chairman, said, "We have undertaken strong internal measures
to prevent such practices in the future, including new
policies governing each type of reorganization transaction,
separation of functions and a complete restructuring of the
reorganization department."
   The firm's reorganization department, a back-office
processing unit, handles tender and exchange offers, stock
purchase rights and warrants, and convertible securities.
   In at least 40 partial tender and exchange offers,
Schwab's reorganization department tendered part of its
customers' stock without permission from the investors,
allegedly generating about $1.4 million in profits. This
amount was said to come from keeping the difference between
the funds it received for the tendered shares and the
typically lower cost of repurchasing shares to replace the
customers' stock.
   In a similar fashion, Schwab allegedly made about $250,000
in profit through at least 47 conversion offers, and about
$550,000 in profit through at least 79 rights and warrants
offers, the Big Board said.
   The firm also was required to conduct an outside review of
the reorganization department and report the results to the
exchange.
   The action was made public after the market closed
yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Schwab stock closed at $15, down 37.5 cents.

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Loral Corp. won a bidding contest to buy Ford
Motor Co.'s aerospace unit, beating out competing offers from
a group led by Westinghouse Electric Corp. and a partnership
of General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft division and
Alcatel N.V. of Belgium.
   Ford's acceptance of Loral's offer for its Ford Aerospace
Corp. subsidiary, following close bidding, sets the stage for
a transaction valued at about $1.3 billion, according to a
person familiar with the negotiations. The acquisition
furthers Loral's strategy of seeking a larger piece of the
shrinking pie of defense business. Meanwhile, the transaction
will help replenish Ford's cash hoard, which has been eroded
by lower profits, heavy capital spending and its purchase of
the British car maker Jaguar PLC.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The estimated value of the acquisition includes $811
million in cash and the assumption of Ford Aerospace debt,
letters of credit, and a continuation of health and benefit
plans for the unit's 17,000 employees, according to the same
person. The other bidders were only offering about $750
million in cash, the person said.
   Loral had revenue of $1.27 billion in its fiscal year
ended March 31 and ranks 30th among Pentagon contractors in
terms of value of contracts. It will become the 19th biggest
supplier after it acquires Ford Aerospace, which had 1989
revenue of about $1.9 billion.
   Loral said it has arranged financing for the acquisition
that "won't create a large debt burden for the company."
Loral said it will make the acquisition through a new
corporation owned jointly by two initially equal partners,
Loral and the merchant banking partnerships of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. Each will contribute about $150 million of
equity, Loral said. The balance of the purchase price will be
financed with bank borrowings by the new corporation, but
won't add to Loral's debt obligations. Loral said it will
have the option to later increase its equity in the new
corporation.
   Loral said the acquisition won't dilute its stock.
   The purchase represents the first time in Loral's history
under the acquisitive leadership of Bernard L. Schwartz,
chairman and chief executive officer, that the defense
electronics concern has acquired a company larger than
itself.
   In an interview, Mr. Schwartz said he doesn't foresee any
problems in Loral's digesting Ford Aerospace. "If we thought
it was too much we would have hesitated in going forward," he
said. "We have a history in managing these things."
   He noted that Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.'s aerospace unit
was nearly the size of Loral when Loral bought it for $588
million in 1987. "The advantage of this situation compared to
(the Goodyear Aerospace purchase) is that (Ford Aerospace) is
very profitable. We won't have to put a lot of effort into
turning it around," Mr. Schwartz said.
   Both companies each have order backlogs of about $2
billion.
   Despite assurances by Ford Motor officials that Loral will
maintain overall compensation and benefits "substantially
comparable to those currently in force for Ford Aerospace
employees for two years," personnel at the Newport Beach,
Calif., concern expressed fear about the future. "There are a
lot of negative stories going around," one high-ranking Ford
Aerospace executive acknowledged. "A lot of people are
worried that Loral is heavy-handed in terms of cost-cutting."
   In the interview, Mr. Schwartz sought to dispel such fears
among Ford Aerospace employees, saying he has no plans for
any layoffs at the unit. "We've met all the management at
Ford Aerospace and we think they're good people," he said.
"We think we can create an environment where they'll want to
stay on and (be motivated) to do as good as job as they've
done in the past."
   Ford Aerospace will increase the diversity of Loral, which
has prided itself as a pure defense electronics concern, and
put it into some new businesses such as communications
satellites and air-to-air missiles. Mr. Schwartz said he has
no plans to shed any Ford Aerospace operations. "We're
approaching it on the basis that we're going to make all of
them fit," he said.
   In Pittsburgh, a Westinghouse spokesman said the company
and its partners were "extremely disappointed" and "will
continue to watch the situation with interest." A spokesman
for Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft declined to comment.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton, which is joining Loral in the
acquisition through a partnership, raised the funds for the
partnership in 1989 from a combination of outside investors
and Shearson employees. Shearson recently underwent a
restructuring in which its parent, American Express had to
shore up its balance sheet.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Loral shares closed at $25.375 apiece, down 62.5 cents, while
Ford shares fell 37.5 cents apiece to close at $42.875.

   IBM Names Head
   Of Semiconductors
   To U.S. Staff Post

   International Business Machines Corp. appointed the head
of its huge semiconductor operations to a staff job helping
run its U.S. business, which has been getting unwieldy.
   Patrick A. Toole, a 52-year-old senior vice president, was
named to the new position of general manager, operations, for
IBM U.S. He will report to Terry R. Lautenbach, 51-year-old
general manager of the U.S. operations, which includes the
semiconductor operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Toole should be a good complement for Mr. Lautenbach,
as Mr. Toole has a strong background in development and
manufacturing while Mr. Lautenbach came up the marketing side
of IBM. Mr. Lautenbach frequently needs to referee among the
general managers who report to him, deciding, say, whether
some scarce chips should be given to the mainframe business
or the minicomputer business. The organizational structure of
IBM U.S. has been getting more complex because more
operations are being broken out into separate lines of
business. Mr. Lautenbach also needs to keep the pressure on
to cut costs; while sales in the past year have finally
started picking up in the U.S., growth is still far slower
than it is overseas.
   Moving to a staff job from a job with major operational
responsibilities is not usually a good sign. So it's possible
Mr. Toole has taken some of the heat for some recent problems
with IBM products, apparently including some difficulties
with chips that will go into the generation of mainframes
that IBM is expected to announce in September. But former IBM
employees said it's not clear whether those problems belong
to his operations or to the group that designs and builds
mainframes. The former workers add that the quiet Mr. Toole
has a good reputation internally.
   IBM named Paul R. Low to succeed Mr. Toole running the
semiconductor operations. Succeeding Mr. Low in charge of
data-storage products is Ray S. AbuZayyad, a former IBMer who
has been at Siemens AG. For both men, the appointments are a
return to familiar territory.
   Mr. Low, a 57-year-old vice president, had had most of the
semiconductor operations reporting to him before he took over
data-storage products in 1987. Likewise, Mr. AbuZayyad, 52,
had had most of his current responsibilities from 1985 to
1987, before Mr. Low succeeded him. In 1987, Mr. AbuZayyad
became the president of IBM's Rolm telecommunications
division, then he left IBM altogether to run Rolm Systems for
Siemens AG when the German company bought most of the Rolm
assets from IBM last year. Returning to IBM as a vice
president, Mr. AbuZayyad gets an expanded version of his
former job; while he used to control just the data-storage
products for IBM's mainframes, he now runs the data-storage
operations for all IBM's products.

   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. plans to name
Leonard Reinhart president and Donald Robinson executive vice
president of a new consulting group, which will recommend
investment managers to the brokerage firm's clients.
   Mr. Reinhart, 35 years old, and Mr. Robinson, 32, have
been senior vice president and first vice president,
respectively, at Shearson's consulting-services division. The
business that the two executives will lead has been part of
consulting services; it will get a higher profile as an
independent entity, Mr. Reinhart said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The group "evaluates money managers {who are} independent
of Shearson and recommends them to our clients," Mr. Reinhart
said. "We determine the risk you're willing to take and what
your goals are, and we match you up with an investment
manager."

   The Red Sox Better
   Than the Sox Do

   Mr. Waseleski Keeps Statistics
   So Detailed That Players
   Use Them in Salary Talks

   MILLERS FALLS, Mass. -- Nobody knows more about the Boston
Red Sox than Charles Waseleski III, a chunky, rumpled
35-year-old office manager in this Western Massachusetts
village of 1,300 people.
   How often does Wade Boggs ground into double plays against
left-handed pitchers? Three times this year. What percentage
of the time do Red Sox hitters advance runners from first
base with no outs? This year, 43.2% of the time. Which Red
Sox pitcher is most bothered by the close -- in left field
wall -- the Wall, they call it here -- at Fenway Park? John
Dopson, who gave up 13 hits, including seven home runs, to
the Wall or over it in 1989. When a Red Sox relief pitcher
enters the game with a man on second, how likely is that
inherited runner to score? The probability is 42%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Waseleski uses minutely detailed scorekeeping and an
Apple II computer at his rolltop desk in his cramped
one-bedroom apartment to compile such esoteric statistics.
The computer stores data on every Red Sox game since 1983.
"There was no intention of {my} becoming this warped," says
Mr. Waseleski of his peculiar avocation. It just grew
naturally from his devotion to scorekeeping.
   A sportswriter for the Boston Globe, which buys a weekly
statistical compilation from Mr. Waseleski, has called him
"the maniacal Chuck Waseleski." Says Brian David, a players'
agent at Speakers of Sport, a Northbrook, Ill., agency:
"There's nobody like him." Mr. Waseleski was once able to
tell him the number of times that Jim Rice held to singles
balls hit off the wall, as compared to the opposition
left-fielder. "I couldn't stop laughing," Mr. David says.
"This was too much."
   A sample of other arcana: Last year, the Red Sox's Dwight
Evans hit .277 against right-handed pitchers and .303 against
lefties. He batted .275 in Fenway Park, knocking all eight of
his at-home homers over the notorious Wall. At night he
batted .325; by day, .215. The Red Sox's rookie first baseman
Carlos Quintana has been batting .400 when he comes to the
plate with two outs. But that statistic, Mr. Waseleski
concedes, "only means something to me, Carlos and his mom."
   Mr. Waseleski is in tune with the times. The passion for
baseball statistics has exploded in the past few years,
partly because of the popularity of fantasy leagues in which
opponents "draft" players to create teams whose probability
of success is determined statistically. Managers and players
themselves also use computers to compile statistics.
   How much the mastery of statistics helps real players play
or fans understand the game still is questionable. "You can
understand all the statistics available and it doesn't help
all that much," says Roger Angell, who writes about baseball
for the New Yorker.
   But for Mr. Waseleski, a confirmed bachelor, statistics
are life. After work on a typical summer evening, he plunks
himself down in a recliner and clicks on his 25-inch color
TV. (During West Coast games, the videocassette recorder is
on, in case he falls asleep.) He keeps his computer keyboard
on his right knee and a clipboard and hand-drawn scorecard on
his left. He records every pitch and how it ends -- in a
swinging strike, a called strike, a ball, a foul, a hit or a
fly-out. He is supposed to feed his landlord's cat. The cat
will wait until the game is over, and the dishes will remain
unwashed.
   Like many other New Englanders, Mr. Waseleski became
hooked on the Red Sox in 1967, the "Impossible Dream" season
in which the team unexpectedly won its first pennant in 21
years. While at Merrimack College in suburban Boston, he
regularly went to Fenway. After graduating magna cum laude
with a B.A. in English, he returned home, found a job as a
technical writer with Douglas G. Peterson Associates, an
engineering firm in nearby Greenfield, and spent his spare
hours collecting ever more complete statistics.
   Through a friend he met Boston Globe sportswriter Peter
Gammons, now of ESPN, who wanted information unavailable from
the box scores, such as measures of clutch-hitting prowess.
Among other things, Mr. Waseleski proved that slugger Jim
Rice (contrary to fan misconceptions) was a clutch hitter --
in 1982, for example, batting .304 in late-game clutches.
   A Red Sox pitcher interested in personal computers heard
about Mr. Waseleski and introduced him to other players, who
asked to use his statistics in salary negotiations. Now, Mr.
Waseleski knows half the players on the team.
   During the season, Mr. Waseleski publishes his statistics
in a monthly report that is sold to sportswriters and
players' agents. Off-season, he sells reports on individual
players to agents for use in negotiating salaries. Neither
Mr. Waseleski nor his customers will say how much they pay
him.
   Mr. Waseleski's devotion to his task takes some of the fun
out of it. He dreads high-scoring contests and extra-inning
games; they keep him up late. He likes games in Fenway
because, he has found, there are "substantially fewer"
extra-inning games there than in other ball parks. He
welcomed the three-day break for the All Star Game, of which
he watched only one inning.
   Mr. Waseleski's masterpieces have been his documentation
of the performances of two Red Sox's greats, third baseman
Wade Boggs and pitcher Roger Clemens. When Mr. Clemens set a
record by striking out 20 Seattle Mariners in a game four
years ago, Mr. Waseleski produced nine dense pages of
statistics on the game: how many of the victims went down on
three straight strikes (five); how many hit more than one
foul ball (four), and how many of the three hits in the game
came after two strikes (two).
   Mr. Boggs is known as an extraordinarily disciplined
hitter who almost never swings at a first pitch. Two years
ago, when he hit a first pitch home run in Minnesota, the
phone in Mr. Waseleski's living room rang. He picked it up
and said "seven." The caller was a sportswriter who did in
fact call to learn how many first-pitch hits Mr. Boggs had
had that year. When Mr. Boggs pops out to the infield, Mr.
Waseleski knows it happened only 11 times all last year. And
when Randy Johnson of Seattle struck him out three times in
one game this year, Mr. Waseleski had the names of the three
pitchers who had previously accomplished that feat.
   "If Boggs ever hits .400, Chuck will be on Letterman.
He'll be larger than life," says Dan Shaughnessey, a Globe
sportswriter.
   Mr. Waseleski says he gets just as much pleasure out of
documenting other oddities: Little-known relief pitcher
Dennis Lamp went 2 2/3 innings per outing for the longest
average relief performances in the major leagues last year.
Marty Barrett had no strikeouts against lefties in 118 plate
appearances, and was the toughest player to strike out in the
majors, with only one in every 28 times at bat.
   Mr. Waseleski isn't bothered at all by the single
statistic that haunts most Red Sox fans: zero World
Championships since 1918. "I honestly don't care where they
end up in the standings," he says. "Win or lose, I know I'm
going to be around for 162 (games), so it doesn't matter."
   Never mind that the Red Sox have been struggling with
Toronto over first place in the American League's Eastern
Division in recent days. Mr. Waseleski is looking forward to
those out-of-town games in late August, when first place is
usually sewed up and, he says, no one else is paying
attention to the Red Sox any longer. "I feel like I have the
team to myself."

   Cyclops Industries Inc., a Pittsburgh-based producer of
stainless and carbon steel products, said it will report
losses for the second quarter and the first half.
   It cited a pretax charge of as much as $16 million for
restructuring its specialty steel division and realigning
certain carbon strip operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said it will close a Pittsburgh plant that
produces high-temperature steel sheets, idling 85 hourly and
10 salaried employees. It said high-temperature sheet has
been a low-volume product for some time.
   In the 1989 second quarter, Cyclops earned $12.1 million,
or $1.69 a share, on sales of $301.5 million. In the 1989
first half, the company had net income of $21.3 million, or
$2.98 a share, on sales of $608.3 million. Net for the 1990
first quarter fell to $3.6 million, or 49 cents a share, from
$10.1 million, or $1.42 a share, a year earlier, on sales
that slipped to $299.3 million from $364.7 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Cyclops shares closed at $24, unchanged.

   ALBANY, N.Y. -- Trans World Music Corp., a music and
videocassette retailer, plans a public offering of one
million common shares, its first offering since July 1986,
when the stock began trading over the counter.
   In a registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Trans World said that Robert J. Higgins,
its president, chief executive officer and largest
shareholder, will offer 750,000 shares, reducing his 67%
stake to 57%, and that the company will offer 250,000 shares.
The company has about nine million shares outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James R. Williamson, chief financial officer, said the
offering price is expected to be "near market price." Trans
World shares closed at $31.50, down $1.50, yesterday in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., which managed the initial public
offering, will underwrite the latest offering, with an option
to purchase an additional 150,000 shares.
   Proceeds would be used to reduce short-term debt and
finance the opening of about 120 stores in the eastern U.S.
this year.
   Trans World recently settled a trademark-infringement suit
for $1.5 million with a rival retailer, Peaches Entertainment
Corp., and last year had losses when it leased space in
stores owned by Crazy Eddie Inc., a defunct electronics
chain.
   Separately, Mr. Williamson, the finance chief, said he is
resigning, pending the appointment of a successor and an
orderly transition. The company said he is relocating to the
Midwest for personal reasons.

   NEW YORK -- A plunge on the New York Stock Exchange pulled
the dollar to its lowest level against the mark in 2 1/2
years. The U.S. currency ended nearly 1% lower against its
German counterpart, posting its worst close since the
beginning of 1988.
   The dollar also fell substantially against the Swiss franc
and other continental European currencies and to a lesser
degree against the pound.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, profit-taking on long, or overbought, Canadian
dollar positions -- led by trade in futures -- actually
boosted the U.S. currency's price in Canadian dollars.
   The dollar almost held its own against the yen, retreating
only slightly. The Japanese currency was facing pressures
similar to those on the dollar after a second consecutive
sell-off of Tokyo stocks.
   As yen holders sold the Japanese currency for dollars and
then changed those dollars into marks, the U.S. currency was
supported against the yen while its descent against the mark
was exaggerated.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6220 marks, well below 1.6365 marks late Friday in New
York.
   The U.S. currency held above 148 yen and was trading at
148.20 yen, down from 148.60 yen in New York late Friday. The
mark rose to 91.30 yen from 90.80 yen.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 148.20 yen, down from 148.50 yen there late Monday. The
dollar was trading at 1.6230 marks.
   The dollar also fell to 1.3815 Swiss francs Monday, 5.4445
French francs and 1188.3 Italian lire from 1.4010 Swiss
francs, 5.4945 French francs and 1199.8 lire late Friday.
   Sterling was trading at $1.8225, up from $1.8190 late
Friday.
   The last time the U.S. currency bought so few marks was
Jan. 4, 1988, when the dollar ended at 1.5858 marks.
   "We are getting to levels that are very significant," said
Bernd Becker, chief New York dealer for Oesterreichische
Laenderbank. "We've been dealing for so long in this narrow
range. This is the biggest move I've seen in a long time. No
one wanted to miss the boat, so everyone jumped on."
   After emerging from a listless Asian day and European
morning, the dollar felt steady selling pressure in New York
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost ground right from
the opening bell.
   But only when the industrial average was down 102 points
during the session did currency trading rooms awaken from
their midsummer slumber to sell the dollar out of its
accustomed range.
   As the dollar crossed a divide at 1.63 marks, stop-loss
selling sped its descent, said Andy Robertson, Chase
Manhattan's corporate foreign exchange sales manager. In 10
minutes, the dollar fell an entire pfennig against the mark.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $369.10 an ounce, up $7.80. This was the
highest close since May 22. Estimated volume was a very heavy
six million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$368.45 an ounce.

   Turner Taps
   President
   For CNN

   Ted Turner stole the spotlight from athletes at his
Goodwill Games in Seattle yesterday, picking a new president
for his Cable News Network and conceding that the games
themselves will result in a significantly larger loss than
initially believed.
   W. Thomas Johnson Jr., vice chairman of Times Mirror Co.,
is expected to be formally named CNN's new president this
afternoon, succeeding Burt Reinhardt. The choice is viewed as
reflecting Mr. Turner's desire to recharge the 10-year-old
network and reposition it as a primary channel, or what
people in the television industry call a "top of mind"
network.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For all its success, CNN has hit a plateau in the past
year. While the network's viewership soars when big new
events break, it ebbs during periods of calm. Moreover, CNN,
once unique in its ability to offer news 24 hours a day, now
faces considerable competition on cable TV.
   Several months ago, Mr. Turner, chairman and chief
executive officer of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., was close to naming Paul Amos, executive vice president
for programming at CNN, as the network's new president,
according to an executive close to the company. But Mr.
Turner decided instead to shake up CNN, retaining both an
executive recruiter and Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. to study
the network's management and future direction. Mr. Turner has
said his primary concern for CNN has always been editorial
integrity. And Mr. Johnson, as a seasoned newspaper executive
with a major metropolitan daily, possesses strong
credentials.
   Mr. Johnson, a 48-year-old native of Macon, Ga., certainly
answers the call for change at CNN, having spent most of his
career in print journalism. A former White House fellow, he
first came to prominence in 1967, when he was named deputy
press secretary, and later became special assistant, to
President Lyndon B. Johnson. He served as executive vice
president and director of Texas Broadcasting Corp. in Austin
from 1970 to 1973. He started his newspaper career in 1973 as
executive editor and later became publisher of the Dallas
Times Herald, which was acquired by Los Angeles-based Times
Mirror. He was named president of the Los Angeles Times,
Times Mirror's flagship newspaper, in 1977, and became
publisher three years later.
   From Times Mirror's point of view, Mr. Johnson's departure
isn't a complete surprise. Last August, he was succeeded as
publisher and chief executive of the Los Angeles Times by
David Laventhol, Times Mirror's president. Newspaper industry
analysts said at the time that the shuffle seemed geared to
inject the Times with the benefit of Mr. Laventhol's deeper
editorial background and his experience with the recent
growth of Times Mirror's Newsday in New York. The move also
was viewed by some observers as increasing Mr. Laventhol's
chances of eventually succeeding Robert F. Erburu as Times
Mirror's chairman, a post for which Mr. Johnson had once been
viewed as a likely candidate.
   Mr. Johnson, meanwhile, became chairman of the Los Angeles
Times and chairman of Times Mirror's newspaper management
committee, a move that stripped away his day-to-day oversight
of the newspaper. Mr. Johnson said at the time that he was
assuming "broader responsibilities," which included
overseeing companywide marketing, acquisitions and newsprint
supply for Times Mirror's newspaper group.
   Mr. Reinhardt, 68 years old, president of CNN since 1982,
was said in early 1989 to have signed a three-year contract
with Turner Broadcasting, with the understanding that a
search for his successor would soon be started.
   Mr. Johnson's expected move to CNN dismayed several of the
network's executives, according to another executive close to
Turner Broadcasting. At least four CNN executives have been
mentioned as possible successors to Mr. Reinhardt. They are
Mr. Amos, the programming executive; Lou Dobbs, vice
president and managing editor of CNN Business News; Jon
Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News; and Ed
Turner (no relation to Ted Turner), executive vice president,
newsgathering.
   Asked to comment on Mr. Johnson's selection, Ed Turner,
the executive vice president, said: "Whatever Ted wants. I'll
give Tom Johnson my enthusiastic support. I don't know what
his plans are, {but} it's a relief to get a guy with that
kind of reputation and someone who comes from one of
America's great newspapers." Mr. Dobbs of CNN Business News
said, "It's much too early to judge what the impact will be."
   Most of CNN's top executives are scheduled to meet with
Ted Turner and Mr. Johnson this morning in Seattle.
   Separately, at Turner Broadcasting's annual meeting in
Seattle yesterday, Mr. Turner said he expects the 1990
Goodwill Games loss to be "considerably more" than the $13
million that the company has already charged against earnings
for the event.
   Mr. Turner said losses from the games could climb into the
$26 million range, the amount of Turner Broadcasting's
deficit on the first Goodwill Games in Moscow four years ago.
Mr. Turner's comments marked the company's highest public
projection of Goodwill Games losses to date, and cast doubt
on whether Turner Broadcasting's board will support Mr.
Turner's goal of making the games a lasting, quadrennial
event.
   "The board will decide whether to go forward," Mr. Turner
said.
   Before the games opened here Friday, Turner Broadcasting
executives had said this year's games must show progress from
1986, both financially and in terms of their image as a
world-class sporting event. A strong field of athletes has
showed up to compete, but the Olympic Games knock-off has
evidently failed to arouse the requisite enthusiasm among
advertisers and television viewers to stem Turner
Broadcasting's losses.
   In other business at the annual meeting, Turner
Broadcasting's board declared a 2-for-1 split of its Class A
and Class B shares, payable Sept. 4 to stock of record Aug.
13. As of last month, Turner Broadcasting had approximately
49.6 million Class A common shares and about 26.8 million
Class B common shares outstanding.
   In another matter, a shareholder nominated the actress
Jane Fonda, a close companion of Mr. Turner's, for election
to the company's board. The nomination never came to a vote,
but it spawned an aside from Mr. Turner. "Miss Fonda has
enough influence," he said.

   WASHINGTON -- Raw-steel production by the nation's mills
increased 1.4% last week to 1,847,000 tons from 1,821,000
tons the previous week, the American Iron and Steel Institute
said.
   Last week's output fell 0.2% from the 1,850,000 tons
produced a year earlier.

   The industry used 82.8% of its capability last week,
compared with 81.6% the previous week and 83.3% a year ago.

   Fueled by a strong demand for energy in June, Southern
Co.'s second-quarter earnings rose 13%, to $216 million, or
68 cents a share, breaking a string of three consecutive
quarterly earnings declines.
   In the 1989 second quarter, the Atlanta-based energy
utilities operator earned $187 million, or 60 cents a share.
Revenue increased to $2.01 billion in the most recent
quarter, from $1.88 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company warned that it may have to take a $190 million
charge against future earnings, if the Georgia Court of
Appeals declines to reconsider a ruling against a Southern
Co. unit. In the 5-4 decision last week, the court refused to
order the Georgia Public Service Commission to reconsider a
$951 million disallowance of costs related to Georgia Power
Co.'s Plant Vogtle nuclear power plant.
   Three years ago, Southern took a $229 million after-tax
write-off, after the total budget for the plant exceeded a
self-imposed cap.

   The Fairlawn, Ohio, company said it agreed with competing
applicants for the broadcasting license on terms for a sale
of the station to Daytona Group of California. Daytona, of

station.

   Proceeds would be split between GenCorp and the competing
applicants, but the terms of the division won't be disclosed
until the transaction is approved by the Federal
Communications Commission, GenCorp said.
   RKO General Inc., a GenCorp unit, at one time was a major
television and radio broadcasting concern. However, its right
to operate the stations was challenged by various groups
because of alleged improper political payments by the parent
company and an alleged lack of candor in discussing those
payments in FCC proceedings.
   The company has been selling its stations and sharing the
proceeds with other concerns that applied for licenses to
operate the RKO stations.

   BUSH SAID he will nominate appellate judge David Souter to
the Supreme Court.
   Just three days after liberal Justice Brennan resigned for
health reasons, the president selected Souter, a former New
Hampshire Supreme Court jurist, for his first appointment to
the nation's highest court. Bush, in introducing Souter at a
White House news conference, said he hadn't asked the
50-year-old judge's opinions on such key topics dividing
liberals and conservatives as abortion and civil rights.
Souter's name is believed to have been given to Bush by his
chief of staff, former New Hampshire Gov. Sununu.

   Souter, though a conservative, lacks any reputation for
the kind of conservative judicial activism that aroused such
fierce opposition to Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork in
1987.

   MILAN -- Rodolfo De Benedetti, the eldest son of Italian
financier Carlo De Benedetti, was named general manager of
Cie. Industriali Riunite S.p.A. (CIR), the family's key
industrial holding company.
   The younger Mr. De Benedetti, 29 years old, will succeed
Corrado Passera in this chief operating position at CIR, the
company said. Mr. Passera resigned from CIR two weeks after
he was named general manager of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore
S.p.A., a publishing company controlled by CIR.

of directors Monday, the statement said.
   Rodolfo De Benedetti has a degree in political economy and
law from the University of Geneva. He started his career in
finance in 1985 with Lombard Odier in Geneva, and in 1987 he
worked with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   In 1988 he became director of international affairs at
Cofide before he was appointed general manager in April 1989.
He will leave his post at Cofide as a result of the new
appointment. Mr. De Benedetti is married and has two
children.

   Net Advanced 6.7%

   LYNDHURST, N.J. -- Curtiss-Wright Corp. said
second-quarter net income climbed 6.7% to $7.2 million, or
$1.45 a share, reflecting higher margins in the company's
aerospace segment.
   Revenue rose 8.9% to $56.5 million from $51.9 million a
year earlier. The company, which makes precision parts used
in aerospace, flow-control and other industrial applications,
had net in the year-earlier quarter of $6.8 million, or $1.36
a share. The year-earlier figures were restated to reflect
the cumulative effect of an accounting change.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The profit would have been greater except for losses at
the company's flow control and marine segment after a
"modest" profit in the first quarter, Curtiss-Wright said.
"The short-term situation in the area of highly engineered
valves remains unsettled," the company said. Despite winning
a number of Navy orders, the available number of orders has
shrunk to their lowest level in a a decade or more, the
company said.
   In the first half, net fell 26% to $11.6 million, or $2.32
a share, from $15.8 million, or $3.16 a share. The decline
reflects recognition of losses in short-term equity
securities, accelerated amortization of nonrecurring non-cash
charges in the first quarter and an upward restatement of
1989 first-quarter earnings. Revenue rose 5.1% to $109.5
million from $104.2 million.

   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. said negotiations to
sell its Maine National Bank unit ended because potential
bidders, who weren't identified, wouldn't agree to pay an
"acceptable" price for the unit.
   Bank of New England said it will continue to own and
manage the bank as part of its regional franchise. The sale
had been planned as part of a series of asset sales by the
troubled bank holding company as it tries to stem losses and
reduce debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bank's "recovery is proceeding," said Lawrence K.
Fish, chairman and chief executive officer. "We're making
slow but steady progress on a number of fronts, and we feel
the conditions are such that it is best to maintain the Maine
National Bank franchise."
   Among those believed to have been interested in acquiring
the Maine bank was Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.,
Providence, R.I.
   Bank of New England said in April that it would seek to
sell its banking subsidiaries in Maine and Rhode Island.
   Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker, Anthony, said the
planned sale of Bank of New England's Maine National Bank
unit was an "important but not critical" part of the parent's
restructuring program. "The major thing for Bank of New
England is to reduce nonperforming assets," he said. "Maine
National is not bleeding to death, so {the parent} must have
decided, `Why sell it at a fire sale price?'"

   Siemens AG, a West German electronics concern, said group
net profit in the first nine months of its fiscal year ending
Sept. 30, 1990, rose 4.7% to 1.14 billion marks ($694.7
million) from 1.09 billion marks in the year earlier period.
   The West German electronics concern said that group sales
in the same nine month period climbed 2.9% to 45.3 billion
marks from 44.0 billion marks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Siemens didn't specify its third-quarter
earnings, based on available data, group net profits fell 11%
to 387 million marks from 433 million marks in the 1989 third
quarter.
   Third-quarter group sales were down slightly as well,
easing 16% to 14.9 billion marks from 17.7 billion marks. But
a spokesman for Siemens said that the main reason for the
comparative weakness in the third quarter this year was due
largely to the receipt of some 4 billion marks for an atomic
energy plant in the 1989 third quarter.
   Excluding the revenue generated from the power plant,
sales rose 13% in the group and 19% domestically in the third
quarter, Siemens said. The company said that although the
sales data can be adjusted for the power plant, no adjusted
earnings data would be made available.

concern, is leading a consortium with Toyo Menka Kaisha Ltd.
and Nippon Oil Ltd., both of Japan, in a bid for control of
Oakbridge Ltd.
   Oakbridge, another Australian coal mining company, is
currently the target of a takeover bid by New Zealand-based
Elders Resources NZFP Ltd., which holds around 85% of
Oakbridge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The McIlwraith consortium said yesterday that it will
offer 88 cents a share for each common share in Oakbridge, 88
cents for each convertible note, and 0.13 cents for each
listed option. That offer values all of Oakbridge at around
300 million Australian dollars ($235.5 million).
   Elders Resources is bidding 90 cents a share for
Oakbridge, but that offer is conditional on winning at least
90% of the shares. Otherwise the offer is 86 cents a share,
McIlwraith said.
   McIlwraith's bid is aimed only at acquiring Elders
Resources' controlling bloc of Oakbridge shares, but it will
take all shares offered to it.
   It is advising other shareholders to hold on to their
shares. The McIlwraith consortium currently holds 2.6% of
Oakbridge's stock. It said other investors holding more than
10% of the stock won't accept the Elders Resources offer,
indicating the 90% threshold won't be achieved by Elders
Resources.

   Commodities:
   Plunge in Stocks Spills Over Into Commodities,
   But Traders' Second Thoughts Result in Rebound

   NEW YORK -- The stock market sell-off quickly spilled over
into commodities yesterday morning, but then futures traders
had second thoughts and started buying, causing prices to
rebound.
   Precious metals and crude oil futures were the exception
to this pattern, performing strongly throughout the session.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One reason the carnage in stocks first sent most
commodities prices falling was concern that stock-market
losses might cause some investors who play both securities
and futures markets to raise cash by selling futures. This
kind of selling didn't materialize, and in the late morning
and afternoon many commodities regained their losses and in
some cases even finished higher.
   A more fundamental concern was that the sharp drop in
stocks was a signal "that a recession may be shaping up and
people aren't going to buy commodities," said James Kneafsey,
president of Cambridge Financial Management in Cambridge,
Mass. But "as the stock market stabilized and turned higher,
it became evident that the stock-market plunge wasn't a sign
of a recession to come but only a classic correction from
recent record advances."
   Gold was the most glittering commodity performer, even
overshadowing cotton, whose prices fell the daily limit
before recovering to post gains.
   August delivery gold rose $7.70 an ounce to $369.70.
"President Bush asking for higher taxes and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan talking about lower interest rates
and easier money have been revolutionary developments and a
recognition of a dire financial situation, which favors
gold," said Harry Bingham, executive vice president of Van
Eck Funds, New York.
   Mr. Bingham noted that gold has been under pressure from
Middle Eastern selling in recent months and has been seeking
a bottom. Yesterday, the dollar plunged and oil prices were
strong, two factors that helped gold.
   "We may have seen a major turnaround in gold," he said.
   There was a pickup in Middle Eastern buying of gold
bullion as well, said William O'Neill, senior futures
strategist for Merrill Lynch, New York. In addition, "Gloomy
predictions that it will be a struggle to come up with the
necessary cuts to reduce the deficit in the federal budget
have benefited gold," he said.
   September delivery silver was up 3.3 cents an ounce at
$4.9280, while October platinum advanced $6.30 an ounce to
$487.60.
   Cotton futures prices dropped their daily limits of two
cents a pound in the October, December and May contracts
before recovering to close 0.67 cent higher in the October
delivery.
   According to Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for
Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, substantial rains in
parched cotton-growing areas of Texas were the major price
depressant.
   "Between one-half and two inches of rain fell in the
non-irrigated high plains of Texas over the weekend," said
Mr. Simon. "There hadn't been any rain for six weeks. Some of
the crop is dead, but the moisture benefited the remainder."
   Mr. Simon said prices strengthened on buying back of
contracts by traders who earlier had sold them on the belief
prices might continue to decline. "The close was strong," Mr.
Simon said.
   Grain traders in Chicago at first were gripped by the
concern that the severe stock market decline might force
traders to liquidate their commodity positions to raise funds
to satisfy demands for more capital in their accounts. When
that didn't happen, grain prices rebounded from initial
declines to post gains.
   Analysts said grain prices weathered the storm because
speculators happen to be relatively scarce. For example, open
interest -- or the number of contracts that have to be either
nullified by opposite trades or fulfilled by delivery of the
commodity -- in soybeans has slipped back to levels seen
before the 1988 drought. With the Midwest mired in a rainy
summer, there has been little opportunity for small traders
to speculate on crop-damage weather.
   At the same time, the stock market retreat hit just as
crop prices were already feeling around for a bottom. The
prices have been damped this month by improving crop
prospects in the U.S. and the continuing concerns about the
ability of the Soviet Union to finance its imports of U.S.
agricultural commodities.
   One sign of this is that some corn futures contracts
suddenly found strength midway through the session yesterday
after falling to the $2.50-a-bushel range.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, the corn contract for
December delivery settled at $2.5875 a bushel, up 4.25 cents.
   According to Jerry Welch, editor of the St. Louis-based
commodity market letter Commodity Insight, commodity markets
yesterday got all three things they needed to send them
higher: a weak dollar, stronger crude oil prices and a
declining equity market.
   Mr. Welch said that corn and oats have historically led
grains. He noted that oats initially declined only one-half
cent a bushel and closed six cents higher, which he took as a
bullish sign. He also pointed to corn's recovery and higher
close.
   Yesterday's "lows in corn, oats and soybeans could be the
lows for seven or eight months," Mr. Welch said. He added
that this year could parallel 1987, when the sell-off in the
stock market in October was the beginning of a giant rally in
grains that ended in 1988.
   Energy market participants were far more focused on the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting that
will begin Thursday in Geneva than on the stock market. Very
few traders were willing to sell contracts short ahead of the
meeting, so crude oil for September delivery rose 46 cents a
barrel to $20.50 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Traders expect OPEC ministers to cap production for member
countries at or below 22.5 million barrels a day in the third
quarter. Traders believe that action will help to curb the
tremendous oversupply of oil in world markets that has
depressed prices.
   December copper futures were off 0.65 cent a pound at
$1.1230. December traded as low as $1.1100 as traders sold
contracts on the belief that the stock market might be
reflecting a weaker economy and slower demand for copper.
Settlement of two mine strikes, one in Peru and the other in
the U.S., also contributed to price weakness.
   World sugar dropped sharply and posted only a moderate
rebound. The October contract ended with a loss of 0.39 cent
at 11.14 after dropping to a low of 10.93 cents. An absence
of significant demand for sugar on the world market has been
a price depressant.
   Coffee for September delivery settled 0.25 cent a pound
higher at 87.15 cents, while September cocoa recovered from a
sharp drop to $1,230 per metric ton to end with a gain of $17
at $1,259, just $10 below the high of the day.
   Orange juice futures were off 1.85 cents a pound at
$1.6225.
   Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Inc.,
said that with asset allocation such a hot subject now, he
would expect the stock market sell-off to cause some major
players to move stock market money into contracts such as the
CRB Index.
   "If they are lightening up in stocks, they have to put
their money somewhere," he said.

   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nestle Enterprises Inc. won't proceed
with an expansion of its Stouffer Restaurant Co. and instead
will try to sell the subsidiary, the Swiss-owned conglomerate
announced.
   "The decision follows an extensive evaluation of the
long-range business strategy of Nestle in the United States,"
Nestle Enterprises said.

   Nestle, one of three U.S. subsidiaries of Swiss-based
Nestle S.A., said it would begin "an orderly process of

   Stouffer operates 65 restaurants, including outlets under
the names of J.B. Winberie, James Tavern, Rusty Scupper and
Parkers' Lighthouse as well as the "Top" restaurants in New
York, Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Columbus, Ohio, and
Cleveland.
   James M. Biggar, Nestle Enterprises chairman, said
operating restaurants is better suited to specialty chains
and entrepreneurs than a large corporation.
   He said Nestle will focus its efforts on its Nestle Foods

   Unisys Introduces
   Several Mainframes,
   Filling Out 2 Lines

   BLUE BELL, Pa. -- Unisys Corp. unveiled several mainframe
computers that are generally 15% to 20% faster than its
current models, helping the computer and defense-electronics
company flesh out two important product lines.
   Machines in the new A16 series, toward the high end of the
A series, are designed to replace the A9 and A10 and some A12
models. These are, for example, more than twice as powerful
as the A10, and priced a bit less than twice as much. The
five A16s are priced from $1.8 million to $5.9 million.
Unisys also unveiled four A12s that are 20% faster than
current counterparts, and priced at $495,000 to $2.4 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company introduced machines at the high and low ends
of its other major line of mainframes, the 2200. The 2200/600
ES is as much as 15% faster than current high-end machines
but requires only 40% as much power and cooling. Prices range
from $2.3 million to $8.8 million. At the low end, Unisys
introduced the 2200/100, aimed at individual departments of
big companies. The 2200/100 -- available immediately, as are
all the other machines -- ranges from $115,000 to $200,000 in
price.
   All of the machines are likely to appeal mainly to current
Unisys customers but are nonetheless important. Though
Unisys's market share in mainframes has been ebbing in recent
years, as more customers go for machines that are compatible
with International Business Machines Corp. equipment,
Unisys's mainframe lines are still its mainstay.
   Unisys, which was marginally profitable in the first half
after a $639 million loss last year, must keep these lines
healthy until it can make the transition from reliance on big
systems toward small computers that run software that is
standard in the industry.

   NEW YORK -- Bankers Trust New York Corp. reported
second-quarter earnings of $174 million, or $2.06 a share,
flat with the year-ago figure of $175 million, or $2.14 a
share.
   Excluding tax benefits and a gain on the sale of its
factoring business, operating earnings were off 8.6% to $147
million, or $1.73 a share, compared with $161 million, or
$1.97, a year ago, according to analysts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chairman Charles S. Sanford Jr. said: "We again saw
superior results in our trading and risk management and trust
businesses, as well as a slight improvement in corporate
finance" from the preceding quarters.
   For the first six months, Bankers Trust's earnings rose
10% to $372 million, or $4.42 a share, from $339 million, or
$4.16, a year ago.
   Trading revenue posted a strong $50 million, or 26%, rise
to $243 million.
   Net interest revenue dropped 21.3% to $191 million during
the quarter, partly because of the continuing absence of
Brazilian interest payments and an $11 million reduction for
the recently completed Mexican debt accord and the pending
Venezuelan debt pact.
   Non-performing real estate loans, presumably including
$100 million owed by developer Donald Trump, rose $101
million during the period to $219 million. Problem loans to
highly leveraged transactions increased a modest $10 million
to $221 million.
   The provision to Bankers Trust's reserves for possible
loan losses was $28 million, the same amount that was charged
off against its reserve for non-developing country debt. Also
charged off were $129 million in developing country loans,
including $40 million owed by Brazil.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Bankers Trust closed at $39.50, down 37.5 cents.

   Iraq's Stab at Kuwait Relieves Pressure
   On Israel as Mideast Instability Grows
   ----

   TUNIS, Tunisia -- With the U.S. delaying military-aid
discussions and the European Community criticizing its
human-rights record, Israel has cause to complain about its
allies. Its enemies, on the other hand, never let it down.
   Last week's switch by Iraq's Saddam Hussein from
threatening Israel to intimidating neighboring Kuwait has
shifted the spotlight from Israel to the Arab world's
internal problems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Iraq, deep in the red from its war with Iran, wants
$25-a-barrel oil to pay its debt and fund its military
buildup. Kuwait, widely diversified with investments in the
West that benefit from lower oil prices, is happy with the
much-lower world price, recently about $14 a barrel.
   This disagreement has reopened an older wound, Iraq's
claim to sovereignty over Kuwait that predates the desert
emirate's independence from Britain in 1961. Then, Iraq was
bought off only after Kuwait paid $84 million, and even so,
territorial disputes flared in 1973 and 1976. This time,
Kuwait is likely to end up paying much more to appease Iraq
-- at least the estimated $10 billion Kuwait lent to Iraq in
the war with Iran.
   Meanwhile, the dispute has tied up the diplomatic energies
of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the Tunis-based Arab
League, much to the despair of many Palestinians. The quarrel
is "a stab in the back" says the Palestinian newspaper
AsShaab.
   But to many Arabs, the Iraqi president's attack on the
sumptuously wealthy Persian Gulf leaders plays almost as well
as his earlier verbal attacks on Israel. Impoverished
Egyptians and Jordanians, in particular, resent gulf wealth
that they often see first hand as low paid laborers working
far from home. Some Arab papers have particularly praised Mr.
Hussein's call to use funds from higher oil prices to fund an
inter-Arab development agency, although the Kuwait Fund for
Arab Economic Development already hands out hundreds of
millions of dollars a year in soft credits on top of generous
intergovernmental grants to Arab states.
   But even if Kuwait buckles, as is likely, Mr. Hussein's
attack is likely to fuel the arguments of those in Israel and
Washington who say the Iraqi leader is beyond the pale of
diplomatic discourse and unworthy of such favored treatment
as export-import bank credits.
   Meanwhile, other inter-Arab rifts -- the bitter feuds
between Syria's President Hafez Assad and both the Palestine
Liberation Organization's Yasser Arafat and Iraq's Mr.
Hussein -- also are likely to help Israel's new hard-line
government. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, trying to avoid
talks in Cairo with Palestinians designed by the U.S. to help
further Mr. Shamir's own plan for Palestinian elections, has
abruptly switched gears and called for talks with Syria
instead.
   Mr. Shamir launched the elections proposal 15 months ago,
then backed away from any steps that seemed likely to make it
feasible. The new focus on Syria seems designed to
marginalize the Palestinians, distract Washington and create
further delays.
   The wily Mr. Assad has dropped just enough crumbs about
his desire for peace to give Mr. Shamir's aides something to
keep chewing on. The reason isn't likely to be that Mr. Assad
is about to transform into a Sadat-style peace maker. More
probably, he enjoys inconveniencing Mr. Arafat, whom he never
has managed to bring under his control.
   Both Messrs. Shamir and Assad welcome anything that delays
an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue: Mr. Shamir, because he
believes it is in Israel's best interest, Mr. Assad because
he sees delay as feeding the forces of radicalism and
militance that he supports within the Palestinian movement.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Chevron Corp. said it is restructuring
its non-coal minerals business, Chevron Resources Co., and
taking a $30 million charge against second-quarter earnings
for anticipated losses on the sales of assets.
   The charge will be included in the oil company's earnings
report, scheduled for today. Chevron said it expects the
asset sales could total more than $70 million. In the
year-earlier second quarter, Chevron had net income of $404
million, or $1.18 a share, on revenue of $8.2 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chevron shares closed at $76.875, down 62.5 cents.
   Assets to be sold in the restructuring include several
gold properties, and American Gilsonite Co., a Salt Lake
City-based producer of solid hydrocarbon. Chevron said it is
still reviewing long-range plans for its uranium operations
in New Mexico and South Texas.
   The restructuring will result in the elimination or
transfer of 210 jobs, of which 150 are held by exploration
and other field employees. About 10 employees will be
transferred to a new strategic-minerals business unit that
will manage the three major minerals projects that Chevron
intends to retain.
   Projects to be retained are the Stillwater platinum and
palladium operations in Nye and Columbus, Mont., where
Chevron is the managing partner and owns a 50% stake in
Stillwater Mining Co.; the Collahuasi copper and silver
property in Chile; and the Lisheen zinc and lead property in
Ireland.
   Minerals operations to be retained will report to
Chevron's Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Co. unit based in
Englewood, Colo. Chevron Resources will manage the
disposition of its remaining assets.

   House Clears Bill Requiring Broadcasters
   To Provide Children's TV Programming

CONGRESS (CNG)
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The House passed a bill requiring
broadcasters to provide children's television programming and
to limit commercial time during children's shows.
   The Senate passed a similar bill last Thursday, but the
Senate version includes a provision to establish a National
Endowment for Children's Educational Television. The
endowment would provide grants for creating and producing
educational shows for children. Differences will have to be
worked out with the House before the bill can be sent to
President Bush.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's uncertain whether the president would sign such a
bill. Former President Reagan, citing First Amendment
concerns, vetoed legislation to cap advertising time during
children's shows and to require broadcasters to provide
certain amounts of children's programming.
   The legislation, which passed the House on a voice vote,
requires the Federal Communications Commission to consider a
broadcaster's track record on providing educational and
informational children's programming when the broadcaster's
license comes up for renewal.
   While not threatening a veto, the administration said that
evaluating children's programming as part of the
license-renewal process "raises serious First Amendment
concerns by permitting the government to deny license
renewals if a station doesn't carry what the government views
as adequate programming for children." The administration
also said it opposed capping ad time, saying that limits
could hold down revenues and perhaps even defeat the purpose
of the bill.
   Broadcasters didn't seem to share the Bush
administration's concerns. Instead, they enthusiastically
supported the measures. "The bill protects children from
overcommercialization in their TV and cable programs, while
acknowledging that advertising is what makes these programs
possible," said James C. May, executive vice president,
government relations, for the National Association of
Broadcasters. "It spells out, for the first time in statute
form, broadcasters' public-interest obligations to the child
audience but avoids unnecessary and unconstitutional
programming standards."
   The bills would require broadcasters and cable operators
to limit advertising during children's programming to 10 1/2
minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an hour on
weekdays. The FCC could review and modify those caps after
Jan. 1, 1993.
   Further, the House and Senate legislation directs the FCC
to conduct a study of program-length commercials such as
"G.I. Joe" and "Thundercats," with characters that are sold
as toys.
   The bills don't specify the number of hours that
broadcasters must devote to children's educational shows but
leave the evaluation of quantity and quality of children's
programming up to the FCC at license renewal time.
   "What's going to make this bill work is that it gives a
hook -- to parents, teachers and others who are concerned
about children -- to hang their concerns on," said Peggy
Charren, head of Action for Children's Television Inc. "We
believe that President Bush -- and Mrs. Bush -- will like
it," she said.
   Ms. Charren, who has been working to improve children's TV
for more than 20 years, said the bill was even more necessary
after the Reagan-era deregulation at the FCC. "With
deregulation, what got lost was that television has to be
meaningful for children, too," she said.
   Andrew Schwartzman, head of Media Access Project, a
public-interest law firm, also applauded the legislation.
"I'm sure it will make a difference in programming because it
sends a message that broadcasters must be responsible.
Broadcasters should be concerned less with what they can get
away with and more with how they are going to serve the
public."

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush, seeking to defuse a
political fight already brewing over his first vacancy on the
Supreme Court, struck quickly by choosing a conservative
jurist with no paper trail on abortion.
   In nominating Judge David H. Souter of New Hampshire,
President Bush chose a strict constructionist who he hopes
will satisfy conservatives, but a man whose lack of any
articulated stand on abortion may make him acceptable to
moderates in the party. And by moving within 72 hours of
getting an opening, the president short-circuited efforts by
activists to campaign for a nominee that took their side on
the abortion issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Souter, who will turn 51 during his Senate
confirmation hearings this fall, is a former member of the
New Hampshire Supreme Court. State courts, however, rarely
hear abortion cases. In his current post on the federal
bench, as a member of the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals
in Boston, he has spent exactly one day hearing cases. During
his confirmation proceedings for that job -- he was
eventually approved unanimously -- he told the Senate he had
given no speeches worthy of reporting.
   "He doesn't talk much about abortion, even to his closest
friends," says Thomas Rath, a former New Hampshire attorney
general.
   Mr. Souter doesn't have any reputation for the kind of
conservative judicial activism that aroused fierce opposition
to President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork in 1987. "He
isn't a politician or an ideologue, and he's not much
affected by contemporary political winds at all," says
Gregory Smith, another former New Hampshire attorney general.
   Even Clesson Blaisdell, the dean of Democrats in the New
Hampshire state senate, says, "I can't say anything bad about
him." Mr. Blaisdell's words may carry some extra weight in
Washington: He co-chaired the 1988 New Hampshire presidential
campaign of Delaware Democrat Joseph Biden, the chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will decide on Judge
Souter's nomination. Mr. Blaisdell is offering to speak to
Sen. Biden on the judge's behalf.
   "He'll interpret the law," Mr. Blaisdell says of Judge
Souter. "He won't be there representing one side or the
other."
   In one of Judge Souter's few actions regarding abortion,
he joined with a majority on the New Hampshire Supreme Court
in 1986 ruling that a woman who gave birth to a seriously
deformed child could sue her doctors because she wasn't
adequately informed of abortion as an option in her case.
That decision may give pause to anti-abortion activists, who
generally see such "wrongful birth" decisions as promoting
abortion. On the other hand, Judge Souter wrote a separate
opinion expressing concern that the ruling would require
doctors to engage in abortion counseling of their patients,
even if they opposed abortion.
   According to some of his friends, Mr. Souter's selection
follows a behind-the-scenes campaign waged on his behalf by a
group of New Hampshire Republican politicians led by Sen.
Warren Rudman and former Gov. John Sununu, now White House
chief of staff. They have been promoting Mr. Souter for the
Supreme Court ever since the Bork nomination failed. "It's
like having your younger brother put on the court," Mr.
Rudman said last night. Mr. Sununu officially recused himself
from the choice of a successor to the liberal and activist
Justice William Brennan.
   Paul McEachern, a Democrat who became an avowed Sununu
adversary in losing two gubernatorial campaigns to him,
yesterday termed the Souter nomination an eminent one. "He's
perfect politically," he said. "He defuses a huge problem for
Bush because he has found a man with views that aren't really
on one side or the other. They're not going to pin him down
on abortion."
   "If they wanted somebody who wasn't controversial, he
would be the ideal choice," added Rep. Chuck Douglas, a New
Hampshire Republican.
   By many accounts, Judge Souter is a solitary man who loves
his books. Never married, listed in Who's Who as an
Episcopalian, he lives in Weare, N.H. -- population,
approximately 2,000 -- in an old farmhouse distinguished by a
living room "so cluttered with books there's a path to where
you can sit among the books," says Mr. Rath, the former state
official. He is a 1966 Harvard Law School graduate and Rhodes
Scholar who drives a dilapidated car. He hikes in the White
Mountains and has conquered all the 4,000-footers in the
area.
   Though ambiguous on abortion, Mr. Souter's views on a
variety of other issues are decidedly conservative. On the
New Hampshire Supreme Court he wrote numerous decisions in
criminal cases, generally taking a tough stance and
recognizing society's interests in being protected.
   In 1985, for instance, the New Hampshire court ruled that
the state constitution barred police from setting up
roadblocks to catch drunken drivers. Judge Souter was the
only dissenter, saying the technique provided substantial
benefits to society and minimal intrusion on individual
rights. This year, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted his view in
a 6-3 ruling in a Michigan case. Justice Brennan, whom Mr.
Souter would replace, dissented.
   Mr. Souter's record on civil rights cases is also brief --
though, again, conspicuously conservative. He joined in a
1987 ruling restricting the rights of homosexuals to adopt
children. Sen. Rudman described a case in which the judge
ruled that testimony about a rape victim's behavior toward
some men in a bar was admissible. Women's groups attacked
that decision.
   When he was New Hampshire attorney general earlier in his
career, Mr. Souter made a special appearance in court to
plead with a judge not to give suspended sentences to some
1,400 protesters arrested at the Seabrook nuclear plant. As a
judge he generally joined in rulings in favor of Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire in connection with Seabrook.
   Conservative activists, though generally issuing
remarkably dispassionate statements about the nominee
yesterday, were crossing their fingers that Mr. Souter's
adherence to strict constitutional interpretation would also
make him an anti-abortion jurist. The National Right to Life
Committee took comfort in Mr. Bush's assurances that he was
nominating a justice who would "interpret the Constitution
according to its text." Robert Billings, legislative director
of the American Conservative Union, said that "we don't have
written cases yet or written opinions yet, but we feel the
opinions he has written on various cases point to the fact
that he's a strict constructionist."
   If the Senate Judiciary Committee members "want to get
into some heavy questioning on Roe vs. Wade {the case
recognizing a right to abortion}, it will be a little bit of
a battle," Mr. Billings said. "If pushed to the wall, he'd
have to say Roe vs. Wade is bad jurisprudence" because of his
judicial philosophy, Mr. Billings maintained. Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, raised questions about confirming "a nominee without
knowing" his abortion views.
   President Bush, for his part, expressed annoyance at the
heavy focus on the abortion issue and tried to downplay its
significance. "You might just think the whole nomination had
something to do with abortion," Mr. Bush said. "And it's far
broader than that. I have too much respect for the Supreme
Court than to look at one specific issue and one alone."
   Rather, Mr. Bush insisted that he chose Judge Souter
because of his broader conservative judicial philosophy,
without looking in detail into any issues or cases. He said
he never asked Judge Souter his views on abortion.
   "What I'm certain of is that he will interpret the
Constitution and not legislate from the federal bench," Mr.
Bush said. "We've got a nominee here who is extraordinarily
intelligent, has a record, has been confirmed by the Senate,
and who has satisfied inquiry at the state and federal level
as to his objectivity and as to his judicial philosophy. And
I am satisfied as to all those counts."
   Mr. Bush made his selection so quickly because he wanted
to "let the debate focus on the nominee and his talents"
rather than "get a lengthy debate started that would stir
over a bunch of issues that wouldn't be relevant," said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. Mr. Bush first met
Judge Souter Sunday night in the presidential residence, then
held a second meeting with him yesterday at the White House
to officially offer him the nomination, Mr. Fitzwater said.
   The White House's quick action has the effect of
short-circuiting efforts by those Republicans who favor
abortion rights: They were preparing to send out 10,000
telegrams urging support of a nominee who takes such a stand.
The speed also cut short deliberations among conservative
activists over whether to endorse a particular person before
the president chose.
   Judge Souter's prior nomination slipped through by
unanimous consent in a sparsely-attended, Friday-evening
Senate session on April 27. Several members of the Judiciary
Committee admitted that they recalled nothing about the
panel's brief hearings when Judge Souter was nominated to the
First Circuit.
   "If the president hadn't indicated that he was a member of
the First Circuit Court of Appeals, I'm not sure I would have
known," said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat, and
one of eight Democrats on the committee. "I stand in the
position of practically every other member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee: Judge Souter is pretty much a blank
slate."
   But Mr. Metzenbaum added, "So far, in the last couple of
hours, I haven't heard anything against him."
   Mr. Souter has a powerful sponsor in Sen. Rudman, who said
he urged Mr. Sununu, then governor, to appoint Judge Souter
to the New Hampshire court. At the time, Mr. Sununu could
barely contain his admiration for the judge. "When I'm old
and gray," he said at Mr. Souter's swearing-in ceremony in
1983, "people will say, `This is one of the greatest things
you did as governor.'"

   RJR Had $108 Million 2nd-Period Loss;
   Operating Profit, Cash Flow Improved

   RJR Nabisco Inc., saddled with huge debt expenses, posted
a net loss of $108 million for the second quarter. But the
food and tobacco giant again reported big gains in operating
profit and cash flow.
   RJR, taken private last year in a $25 billion leveraged
buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., had been expected
to post strong operating numbers for the period, and analysts
said the company didn't disappoint.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some industry observers said RJR had an additional
incentive to produce a solid second quarter because of its
plan, announced last week, to retire its most troublesome
junk bonds as part of a $6.9 billion refinancing. With
investors, lenders and regulators evaluating the package,
analysts said, strong operating results would only work to
RJR's advantage.
   Karl von der Heyden, RJR's chief financial officer, said
there was "absolutely no attempt to hype" the figures. But he
added that, in light of the recapitalization, the numbers are
"certainly helpful" in "reinforcing the positive impression
that people have" of the New York-based company.
   Among the most significant of those numbers is RJR's debt
coverage, or cash flow as a percentage of total interest
obligations. The figure stood at 1.32 at the end of the
second quarter, up from 1.14 three months earlier and 1.02 a
year earlier.
   "I had been anticipating 1.35 for the full year," said Sam
DeRosa-Farag, a bond analyst with First Boston Corp. in New
York. To reach 1.32 by the end of June, he said, "is
particularly impressive."
   RJR said operating profit in the quarter, after
amortization of trademarks and good will, jumped 34% to $735
million from $547 million a year earlier. The growth was
paced by a 36% increase in operating profit from tobacco, to
$718 million from $527 million. Operating profit from food
rose 3.7% to $199 million from $192 million.
   Mr. von der Heyden noted that operating profits continue
to benefit from cost-cutting measures taken last year,
including the dismissal of 2,300 employees and the move to
consolidate almost all cigarette production in two plants,
down from three. By contrast, he said, spending on marketing
and advertising has increased to about $1.5 billion through
the first half of the year, up about 8% from 1989.
   Revenue in the second quarter rose 4.8% to $3.46 billion
from $3.3 billion a year earlier. Tobacco revenue increased
6.3% to $2.02 billion from $1.9 billion, while revenue from
food rose 2.8% to $1.44 billion from $1.4 billion.
   Domestic tobacco sales rose about 7% to $1.48 billion,
while international tobacco sales increased about 4% to $540
million, Mr. von der Heyden said. Despite the increases, the
No. 2 cigarette maker's share of the U.S. market was "down
slightly" at the end of the second quarter, he added,
primarily because of a drop in sales in RJR's Winston and
Salem brands.
   The $108 million loss for the most recent quarter compared
with a net loss of $319 million in the 1989 second quarter.
"It's possible," Mr. von der Heyden said, "that we may have
positive net income sometime next year. We're getting there.
We're getting closer."
   But RJR's most recent operating gains didn't do much for
the company's widely traded pay-in-kind bonds, which were
dragged down yesterday with the stock market. RJR's 17%
debentures due 2007 fell one point, or $10 for each $1,000
face amount, to close at 94 1/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The company's 17 3/8% convertible debentures due
2009 fell 3/4 point to 117.
   For the first half, RJR had a net loss of $330 million,
compared with a loss of $558 million a year earlier. Revenue
rose 7% to $6.66 billion from $6.23 billion. Operating profit
jumped 41% to $1.34 billion from $949 million.

   Varian Associates Had
   Loss of $34.1 Million
   In Fiscal Third Period

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Varian Associates Inc., citing a
one-time charge, reported a net loss of $34.1 million, or
$1.76 a share, for its third quarter, ended June 29.
   The high-technology concern had profit of $9.1 million, or
45 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter
rose 13% to $343.6 million from $304 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The one-time expense was a previously announced
restructuring charge of $47.1 million after taxes.
   Excluding operations that are to be discontinued, Varian
had a net loss of $18.9 million, or 98 cents a share,
compared with a net gain of $9 million, or 44 cents a share,
a year earlier.
   Without the one-time charge, Varian said it would have had
profit on continuing operations of $13 million, or 67 cents a
share, reversing a four-quarter earnings slide. Softening
demand for semiconductor equipment and a shrinking military
market fueled the decline. A spokesman said the company ended
its tailspin through improved factory efficiency and rising
orders for medical equipment, environmental monitoring
instruments and pollution controls.
   In May, the company announced that by September it planned
to sell five operations and 10 product lines, many of them
military-related, and eliminate 600 jobs. While the company
has laid off about 600 people -- including about 140 from
corporate headquarters -- Varian has yet to complete the sale
of any of its targeted businesses, which make radio frequency
systems, broadcast equipment and night-vision goggles. A
spokesman said Varian is, however, negotiating with several
potential buyers.
   For the nine months, Varian posted a loss of $18.7
million, or 96 cents a share, compared with earnings of $30.5
million, or $1.46 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue fell 4.5% to $926.1 million from $886.2 million.

   Companies listed below reported quarterly profit
substantially different from the average of analysts'
estimates. The companies are followed by at least three
analysts. Results in parentheses are losses.
   The percent difference compares actual profit with the
30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues
forecasts in the past 30 days. Otherwise, actual profit is
compared with the 120-day estimate.
