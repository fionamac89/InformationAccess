   TOKYO -- Japan's household spending rose an
inflation-adjusted 3.7% in April from the year-earlier
period, helped by fast-paced growth of spending by wage
earners, the Statistics Bureau of the prime minister's office
said.
   An official at the statistics bureau said the year-on-year
growth reflects a rebound from the low level of spending in
April 1989 because of the introduction of a 3% consumption
tax at the beginning of that month.

   Your May 18 editorial "Blaming The Voters First" ignores
the most frequently cited reason for nonvoting: not being
registered to vote. Nonvoters, when surveyed after the 1988
presidential election, said registration requirements were
the most significant reason why they did not vote.
Eighty-five percent to 90% of those who are registered do
vote in presidential elections.
   Registration requirements differ in each state -- in some
instances, from township to neighboring township -- and
procedures are often cumbersome, sometimes discriminatory.
What is needed is a fair, simple, uniform system of voter
registration nationwide.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The National Voter Registration Act," which passed the
House with strong bipartisan support in February and is now
before the Senate, would create a more accessible
registration system and encourage more Americans to vote. The
legislation, dubbed "motor voter" because of its inclusion of
automatic applications to register to vote with driver's
license applications or renewals, provides opportunities to
register at other public agencies as well as at motor-vehicle
licensing bureaus.
   The costs to set up and administer "motor voter" and the
bill's other provisions have been minimal in the more than
half-dozen states that already have automatic applications
with driver's licensing. Those states report voter
registration is dramatically up with a manageable work flow
of applications year-round.
   The League of Women Voters believes the act is a sensible
first step to reverse declining voter turnout. Arcane and
obscure registration procedures are a barrier to voter
participation that we can do something about. Government
should be in the position of helping citizens to vote, not
putting up roadblocks that keep people away from the polls on
Election Day.

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices, reacting to mixed signals on the
economy, seesawed through the day, and stocks followed as
both markets ended with small gains.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 6.43 points to
2901.73. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose about 3/8
of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 of face amount. The
dollar fell against the mark and rose against the yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After opening higher, bond prices headed lower on news
that first-quarter economic growth was stronger than
previously estimated. On the surface, the gain would seem to
be bearish for bonds because there was less chance of a
recession and therefore less likelihood of the Federal
Reserve Board's easing interest rates.
   But later, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said he found the
recent slowing of the economy "puzzling," cheering traders
looking for any nuance suggesting Mr. Greenspan might begin
leaning toward easing interest rates.
   The budget-deficit report for May also helped bonds turn
higher. Some investors, expecting the deficit to be wider
than most estimates, sold bonds in advance of the news. But
when the deficit turned out to be close to expectations,
those investors bought back bonds to even up positions.
   Stocks tagged along, with the added influence at the end
of the session of futures-related buy programs and some
institutional buying related to end-of-the-quarter efforts to
dress up portfolios.
   In currency trading, the dollar firmed against the yen on
news suggesting the Japanese economy is overheating, said
Linda McLaughlin, currency trader at Chemical Bank.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on Big Board volume of 138.6 million
shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.49%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6778 marks and 154.80 yen, compared
with 1.6785 marks and 153.93 yen Wednesday.

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate, continuing President Bush's
unbroken string of veto victories, failed to override his
veto of legislation that would have eased restrictions on
political activity of federal workers.
   The vote was 65-35 for override, as opponents fell two
votes short of the two-thirds margin that was necessary to
overcome the veto. All 55 Democrats and 10 Republicans voted
to override, while 35 Republicans voted to sustain the veto.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last month, the Senate had voted 6730 for the bill, but
three Republicans who voted for the measure then opted to
side with the White House yesterday. They were Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, who was a co-sponsor of the bill; Sen.
Pete Domenici of New Mexico, and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New
York.
   The bill would have eased restrictions on off-the-job
political activity by nearly three million federal employees.
Those curbs have existed under the Hatch Act for 51 years,
and labor unions have long pushed to get them relaxed,
contending that government workers should have the same kind
of political rights as other citizens.
   When Mr. Bush vetoed the bill, he said that the Hatch Act
protects workers from harassment, ensuring the integrity and
neutrality of the federal work force. The House voted
Wednesday to override the veto.
   Mr. Bush's victory on the Hatch Act bill brought to 12 the
number of his vetoes Congress has sustained. Lawmakers have
yet to override him.

   One cat's fish could be another cat's "poisson," but would
that make it gourmet? The answer is the subject of a
tooth-and-claw battle between rival makers of canned cat
food.
   The Carnation Co. unit of Nestle S.A. claims its Fancy
Feast Gourmet Cat Food is the "Best tasting gourmet canned
cat food. So moist and delicious cats preferred it over every
other brand." That's got a competitor's back up.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's not so, the competitor insisted in a protest filed
with the National Advertising Division of the Council of
Better Business Bureaus, which referees advertising claims.
In fact, the ad cops recently reported, the competitor
produced a "palatability test" between one variety of its
gourmet cat food and Fancy Feast. "Test results indicated
cats ate more of the competitive product," the ad unit
declared.
   Carnation insisted the disgruntled competitor -- unnamed
in the National Advertising Division report -- was splitting
hairs. Indeed, it said, the challenger was really an
"ultra-gourmet sub-segment within the gourmet cat food
segment." A Carnation spokesman says, "In a situation like
this, you often get into a cat fight."
   The Carnation spokesman says gourmet is meant to suggest
especially good taste, as opposed to so-called maintenance
brands that merely keep a cat healthy. He concedes, however,
that "no precise standards" exist to define the concept.
   The competitor, objecting to Carnation's description of
gourmet cat food, "suggested it should be restricted to super
premium/single serve containers," the report disclosed. In
the end, Carnation agreed to change its advertising to merely
claim that cats prefer Fancy Feast over "every leading
brand."
   The National Advertising Division declines to say who
Carnation's challenger was, and Carnation isn't talking,
either.
   Still, industry rumor has it that the challenger was
Kalkan Inc., a Vernon, Calif., unit of Mars Inc., a big,
closely held candy maker that usually says little about its
affairs. Says Kalkan's label on a can of Sheba cat food: "We
guarantee your cat will enjoy Sheba. If not satisfied, send
proof of purchase and state price paid."
   But whether gourmet or not, Fancy Feast seems to be the
current cat's meow. John C. Maxwell Jr., a Wheat First
Securities analyst in Richmond, Va., estimates 1989 retail
sales at $168 million for Fancy Feast and $45 million for
Sheba.

   But No Tangible Evidence

   The nation's machine tool builders believe the outlook is
brightening somewhat, but there won't be any tangible
evidence in June 30 quarter profits.
   Earnings in the current period will be reduced by a lower
shipping rate caused by an order falloff that began a year
ago. Also, prices on machines shipped this quarter will
reflect the tough price competition in an industry that has
been hard-hit by foreign competition. Foreign producers and
their U.S. subsidiaries supply more than half the machine
tools purchased by U.S. manufacturers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Orders picked up in the second quarter from the dismal
levels of the January and February, and most producers say
they're receiving more inquiries and making more price
quotations. In fact, some producers felt optimistic enough to
raise prices selectively.
   However, there's still a lot of discounting from list
prices, some industry executives say, which may largely
negate the announced increases for the next few months, at
least. And the healthier order pattern would have to continue
for another quarter before machine tool builders will boost
production rates.
   Machine tools are complex, often computer controlled,
parts-making machines ranging from grinders and milling
machines to metal-forming presses. They shape most metal
parts during manufacture. Sales, therefore, depend on the
willingness of durable-goods producers, especially auto,
truck, aircraft and machinery makers, to invest in new
equipment.
   About a year ago, many U.S. durable-goods manufacturers
began to worry about an economic slowdown that they feared
could turn into a recession. Understandably, they cut back
machine tool orders. There are exceptions, such as producers
of commercial aircraft, which have been ordering briskly
because they have long order backlogs that would carry them
right through an economic slowdown. And the oil field
equipment industry is making a modest comeback because of
higher oil and natural gas prices.
   On the other hand, auto and truck companies, auto parts
producers and defense contractors -- all major machine tool
users -- have additional reasons for slashing orders. Many
defense contractors expect a gradual decline in sales for the
rest of the decade because the Soviet Union is far less
threatening than it was during the 1980s. And automotive
concerns have to sort out government-mandated fuel economy
and emissions regulations before deciding what vehicles to
tool up to manufacture.
   Orders placed with U.S. machine tool plants in the nine
months ended March 31 were 23% below the comparable period a
year earlier, according to NMTBA -- The Association for
Manufacturing Technology, a McLean, Va., trade group. Figures
for the second quarter aren't yet available, but they will be
somewhat better, producers say. But shipments trail orders by
a month or so to more than a year, depending on the
complexity of the machines.
   Exports have been a bright spot. Foreign sales in the
first quarter rose 26% from a year earlier, the NMTBA said,
and machine tool executives say export demand continues
strong in the current quarter.
   As a result, results will be mixed. A few producers, such
as Hurco Cos., Indianapolis, that are heavily involved in
foreign sales are faring better than a year ago. Hurco's net
in the second quarter ended April 30 rose to 45 cents a share
from 40 cents on a 13% rise in revenue to $24.8 million. "Our
sales gains have come in Europe and Asia," said Michael K.
Campbell, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
"The U.S. was about even with a year ago."
   Hurco specializes in small milling machines and machining
centers equipped with electronic controls that are easy for
an operator with little computer knowledge to program. About
half of this year's sales will be overseas, Mr. Campbell
said.
   The company expects continued earnings gains in the second
half, bringing profit for fiscal 1990 to the area of $2 to
$2.10 a share, Mr. Campbell said. For fiscal 1989, Hurco
earned $8.2 million, or $1.70 a share.
   However, Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest
machine tool producer, continues to experience the same
problems that drove down first-quarter net. The company had
sharply lower profit in the first quarter because of reduced
shipments of its higher-margin products, such as plastics
injection molding machines, and higher shipments of certain
lower-margin machine tools. Foreign shipments rose, but for
Milacron, exports carry higher distribution costs, the
company said.
   The same factors will depress second-quarter results, but
the company said it is optimistic about an improvement in the
second half. However, Milacron made a public offering of
three million common shares, which increased shares
outstanding 12% and will dilute second-half share earnings
gains.
   Cross &amp; Trecker Corp., another of the larger machine tool
companies, will do better in the June 30 quarter, its third
period, than a year ago, but it won't do well. The Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., concern reported a loss of $32.5 million for
the June 30, 1989, period, including a restructuring charge
of $21.3 million. The company won't flatly predict a profit
for the current quarter, but officials said Cross &amp; Trecker
will do better than in the March 31 second quarter, when it
had a net loss of $976,000, or 19 cents a share.
   As previously reported, Cross &amp; Trecker narrowed its loss
for the six months ended March 31 to $4.8 million, or 55
cents a share, from a loss of $13 million, or $1.05 a share,
a year earlier. Sales slipped to $215 million, from $233
million. However, the company said the comparable sales
figure for the 1989 half, excluding discontinued units, was
$189 million. Cross &amp; Trecker pulled out of several
businesses as a part of the restructuring, but didn't restate
1989 results to reflect those businesses as discontinued.

   TOKYO -- Considering the continuing strength of Japanese
domestic demand amid continued worries about the so-called
triple demerits of weaker currency, bond and stock markets,
Japan's economic growth will slow to a 4.6% pace in the year
ending March 31, Cosmo Securities Co.'s research unit
predicted.
   Recently released Japanese gross national product data
showed 5% growth in fiscal 1990, with little evidence of
damage from the triple demerits, the research group said, but
as these factors continue into the current fiscal year,
economic growth is likely to cool.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More diversified demand, with a greater desire for luxury
goods, will remain an underlying support for personal
consumption, seen growing at a 4.4% pace in fiscal 1991, the
unit said. Also, housing being constructed will probably
decrease slightly, but higher costs from increased value will
offset the slowdown.

   Bouygues Prefers Medium-Term Growth
   Over Quick-Fix, Short-Term Earnings
   ----

<LP>
   PARIS -- Bouygues SA, Europe's largest construction and
public works group, has made a conscious decision to favor
its medium-term growth over short-term earnings
considerations.
   Profit growth at Bouygues, one of the favorite blue-chip
stocks on the Paris bourse in recent years, is likely to
continue underperforming the rest of the industry sector this
year and next, Parisian equity analysts believe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But that doesn't mean that the group is running out of
steam.
   On the contrary, Bouygues is building up its financial
muscle thanks to a policy of diversification and real-estate
investment that will come to fruition in the next two or
three years, according to observers both within and outside
the group.
   Martin Bouygues, who has headed the construction group for
almost a year since taking over from his father, acknowledged
in an interview that investing in the future weighed on
Bouygues's financial performance last year.
   Consolidated net profit rose by 10%, to 573 million francs
($101.6 million) in 1989, from 519 million francs in 1988.
Consolidated revenue grew by 16%, to 47 billion francs, from
40.7 billion. Bouygues expects its revenue growth will slow
to 14% this year, reaching 53.5 billion francs.
   Bouygues's strategy of deliberately damping earnings
growth to invest in the future contrasts with strategies in
the U.S., where quarterly earnings reports may influence
decision-making.
   But Bouygues and its allies control 54.2% of the parent
company's voting rights, putting the group in a position to
carry on without worry about hostile takeovers or negative
shareholder reactions.
   "We're not looking for short-term shareholders interested
in a quick capital gain. What we want are stable, faithful
shareholders," commented Olivier Poupart-Lafarge, the group's
financial director.
   "From a shareholder's point of view, this is fine if you
have a clear idea of where future earnings will be coming
from, and that they will show up in the bottom line,"
comments Nigel Phipps, construction analyst with brokerage
Sellier SA. "If nothing shows up in the next two or three
years, Bouygues's core shareholders may become impatient," he
adds.
   Bouygues invested 4.6 billion francs last year, of which
2.8 billion francs went into sectors as varied as food,
banking and telecommunications.
   "Bouygues is doing exactly what it should be doing" by
branching into sectors such as communications, where profit
margins are higher and markets are less cyclical, comments
Pierre Bosset, construction sector analyst with Parisian
brokerage house DLP James Capel SA.
   In a move that raised some eyebrows, the group spent 1.2
billion francs last year to acquire a controlling interest in
Grands Moulins de Paris. But surprise turned to admiration
when it emerged that Grands Moulins, which controls 20% of
the French flour milling market, also owns prime land
bordering the River Seine.
   The group intends to focus its expansion efforts on Europe
this year. Mr. Bouygues says he is looking for partners in
Germany and the U.K. -- countries in which the group
currently has a low profile.
   Bouygues says the group's acquisition of a 3.5% stake
(raised to 4.5% earlier this year) in Banco Central, Spain's
second-biggest financial institution, is already starting to
bear fruit.
   Mr. Bouygues concedes that North America hasn't been a
priority area for growth, although the group's road-building
subsidiaries are active in the U.S.
   Despite his Gallic caution about Eastern Europe, Mr.
Bouygues is deeply involved in two joint projects in the
Soviet Union to build an eye clinic in Moscow and a hotel
complex in Uzbekistan.
   The French group is also active in Hong Kong, where it
built two high-rise office blocks and won a contract for
another two.
   Marring the overall picture is Bouygues Offshore, a
diversification into the oil services and construction
business that was hit by the downturn in the international
oil market.
   Martin Bouygues has frequently hinted that future
diversification will be in the communications business.

   Zeiss of East Germany Set Re-enter
   Free Market Via Merger With Namesake

   FRANKFURT -- VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, the well-known East
German optical firm, is quickly learning the art of mergers
and divestitures as it braces for re-entry into the free
market.
   The company is seeking to sell its defense-optics unit to
a Western firm even as it prepares to merge with its
prestigious West German namesake, Carl Zeiss Oberkochen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The western Carl Zeiss company was created soon after the
division of Germany and has been separated from the original
Carl Zeiss based in Jena ever since. But earlier this month
the two companies announced plans to get back together.
   Only a year ago, the moves by the eastern Carl Zeiss to
merge or divest would have been unthinkable.
   "The solution we are looking for now naturally would have
been absolutely out of the question under the old regime.
That has all changed, and we have to be able to compete,"
said Thomas Pfarschner, deputy finance chief of the eastern
Zeiss group.
   The Betrieb Gera defense-optics unit was formed in the
late 1970s after the East German government ordered Zeiss to
supply guidance systems and other sophisticated optical
equipment to Warsaw Pact armies. Its operations were top
secret. In the 1980s, Gera primarily produced laser-guided
aiming systems for tanks and portable target-finding
telescopes.
   But the spirit of disarmament has taken a toll on the
unit. Defense orders slowed to a trickle by the end of 1989,
and Gera now needs Western help to shift to nonmilitary
production. The eastern Carl Zeiss estimates that next year
demand for Gera's defense-related products will drop to a
third of former levels, threatening the jobs of 3,145
employees unless the changeover comes quickly.
   Salomon Brothers AG in Frankfurt, which is advising the
eastern Carl Zeiss on the sale, said talks are under way with
potential buyers from the U.S., Western Europe and Asia,
including Japan.
   "Gera would be a real bargain for somebody looking for
production capacity in East Germany, including anything from
optics, to electronics and communications," said Salomon
Brothers' Stephan DuCharme. The eastern Carl Zeiss is open to
offers for a majority stake.
   The Gera move is part of a larger plan to ensure the
survival of the eastern Zeiss after the reunification of the
two German economies. Roughly a third of East Germany's state
corporations, known as Kombinates, face the threat of
bankruptcy after German monetary union in July introduces a
hard currency and an open market. The eastern Carl Zeiss is
banking on its famous name and its a future linkup with its
West German sibling, but it also is feverishly streamlining
its bulky operations.
   Since the end of communist rule in East Germany late last
year, change has come quickly to the eastern Carl Zeiss. Few
employees lament the ouster last December of Wolfgang
Biermann, the group's general director since 1975. A
dedicated communist and a ruthless taskmaster given to
humiliating his managers, Mr. Biermann increased the
company's work force to 69,000 from 40,000 during his 14-year
tenure to fill government production requirements. Innovation
suffered as old equipment aged without replacement.
   The eastern Zeiss, now run by Mr. Biermann's former
deputy, Klaus-Dieter Gattner, already has decided to
discontinue its production of cameras, which it was forced by
the communist regime to begin in 1986. The company also has
decided to start getting most basic parts it needs from
outside suppliers; its current operations are weighed down by
the production of rudimentary materials, including its own
metalcasting in the group's forge.
   "Everything now is being restructured and consolidated,"
said Mr. Pfarschner. "We want to focus entirely on our core
technologies for the world market. But the changes also are
part of the intention of the two Zeiss companies to come
together in the future."
   Like thousands of other state-owned East German companies,
the eastern Zeiss also is preparing to become a public stock
company. The letter of intent signed by the two Zeiss
companies calls for them to merge operations within the next
four years.
   Despite their future plans and common origin in Jena
(dating from 1846), the two Zeisses still treat each other as
two wholly different companies.
   The western Zeiss in Oberkochen, for example, wasn't
consulted by its East German counterpart on its plan to spin
off its defense optics unit.
   "This is something that still affects another company,"
asserted Wolfgang Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the western Carl
Zeiss in Oberkochen. "Even though we are in talks to come
together, any decision to sell part of their operation is
theirs alone and doesn't warrant comment from us."

   AT&amp;T Calls

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- In the beginning there was Alexander Graham
Bell's invention. Then rotary-dial phones eventually gave way
to today's push-button models. Could SmartPhone be next?
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has developed a phone
for receiving advanced telecommunications and information
services and is talking with regional Bell and independent
phone companies about mass distribution of the system.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Called SmartPhone, the product -- which AT&amp;T is pushing as
the successor to the ubiquitous Touch-Tone phone -- is simple
to operate. Yet it comprises a sophisticated, "intelligent"
computer terminal with a touch-screen display and a built-in
modem. AT&amp;T has also designed network processors that would
enable the phone company to provide the service.
   The SmartPhone has a 4-by-6 1/2-inch screen with big
numbers that people push to dial a number or gain access to a
service. At the press of part of the screen, users call up a
local company's entire phone listings or automatically turn
on services such as Call Waiting and Voice Mail. But there's
more. The idea is to deliver all kinds of phone and
information services to the home inexpensively by making a
service vendor, such as a bank or an information company, a
partner with the phone company in distributing the phones and
delivering the service.
   AT&amp;T faces considerable obstacles, however, including
competing systems from other suppliers. And there is no
guarantee that state regulators will let local phone
companies provide all of SmartPhone's services.
   Michael Grisham, manager of strategic planning at AT&amp;T
Network Systems and a former Bell Laboratories engineer who
came up with the SmartPhone concept, insists SmartPhone isn't
a Trojan horse for eventually infiltrating AT&amp;T personal
computers into phone customers' homes. But SmartPhone is an
easy device for learning how a computer works. Users can
create files and program the product to store hundreds of
phone numbers by categories such as "Emergency" and "Medical"
or use vendors' services in whatever way the user selects. It
will take messages and return calls at the push of a button.
   SmartPhone draws additional computing power from an
outside processor that can either be operated by the phone
company to deliver information for a third party or by the
third-party vendor itself.
   Mr. Grisham estimates that the phone will cost about $200
to $300, on which "we don't expect to make much money."
Rather, he says, the payoff will be in increased phone
traffic, use of special services and orders for AT&amp;T network
equipment to provide the service. He expects the phone to be
bought by the service provider -- either the phone company or
a bank providing a financial service, for example -- and
distributed to phone customers for a fee of $10 to $15 a
month. The $200 to $300 price, as well as the rental charges,
are in the range of what people pay for some high-end
cordless phones.
   Discussions are under way to hold trials of the SmartPhone
system in early 1992, said Mr. Grisham, and regular service
could begin later that year.
   "This is the next-generation phone," said Joshua Harris,
an analyst at Jupiter Communications Inc., a New York-based
market researcher. "AT&amp;T has a good chance of making this the
de facto standard since it has already supplied most of the
systems" that back up the current phone network.
   But AT&amp;T faces stiff competition. Citicorp sells a phone
called the E.T. that provides home banking. Canada's Northern
Telecom Ltd., AT&amp;T's primary U.S. equipment rival, sells a
phone called the Maestro that gives customers access to
several advanced phone-company services. And Northern Telecom
is to announce next Tuesday software that can turn an Apple
Macintosh into a phone-service terminal.
   Moreover, several U.S. phone concerns are testing France's
Minitel and Canada's Alex systems, which use a "dumb"
computer terminal attached to a phone to give customers
access to information services.
   "Our Maestro retails for $136," said Dan O'Connor, vice
president of sales and marketing for Northern Telecom's
Network Terminals Group. "The trend in the market is for a
terminal that's closer to $100. People have a threshold on
what they'll pay." And, he noted, SmartPhone must jump
through some local regulatory hoops before phone companies
can provide the service.
   Initial targets for the SmartPhone service will be phone
companies that price their service by the minute rather than
by flat fees, Mr. Grisham said, as well as telephone
companies that currently use AT&amp;T's Craft Access computer
system, which would drive SmartPhone service.
   Companies that employ measured pricing would be able to
provide the service without having to file a lot of new
tariffs, since a customer would pay a small monthly charge
for service and be billed on a per-minute basis at the
regular call rate. Nynex Corp.'s New York and New England
telephone units currently price their services in this
manner. Nynex also uses the Craft Access System, as do the
phone companies of Ameritech, BellSouth Corp. and Bell
Atlantic Corp.
   "We think (SmartPhone) is a pretty good approach," said
Stephen Solcz, staff director of network planning at Nynex
Service Co. "We're just not prepared at this time to say it's
the right architecture. We're nowhere near making any
commitment to a trial."
   Providing SmartPhone service will require a simple
software upgrade of the phone company's existing Craft Access
System, according to Mr. Grisham. That system, which he
helped develop, now is used by the phone company's service
agents to access maintenance data through the phone line
while on a service call.
   "The cost of entry for the phone company is low since the
systems are already in place," said Mr. Grisham. "A phone
company would just have to add a processor and some new
software to start service." And it requires no new training.
   AT&amp;T plans to publish specifications later this year that
will permit other manufacturers to build their own smart
phones to work with the AT&amp;T system along with the processors
that drive it.
   "The days when you could lock anybody into a proprietary
interface are long gone, especially among phone company
customers," said Mr. Grisham. "We're dead serious about this.
Our goal has been universal information service. . . . We
don't expect to (provide) that by ourselves."

   Mixed Results of Sir James's Investments
   Spur Questions About His Future Role

   LONDON -- Is Sir James Goldsmith tiring of the takeover
game?
   Anglo Group PLC, an investment company controlled by the
Anglo-French financier and allied British investor Lord
Rothschild, agreed to sell an equipment-leasing unit for #120
million ($69.7 million). The move, in the wake of Sir James's
failed B.A.T Industries PLC takeover bid, raises some new
questions about the famed corporate raider's continuing
appetite for the takeover game in Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sir James, who last year made a much-ballyhooed return to
European investing after souring on U.S. takeovers, has had
mixed results thus far. His #13 billion B.A.T bid was
rebuffed by a radical corporate restructuring by the U.K.
tobacco and financial services giant, and Sir James recently
sold most of his B.A.T stake. Through Anglo and other
companies, Sir James and Lord Rothschild have controlled a
29.9% stake in U.K. food producer Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC
for more than a year without making a bid.
   Anglo said it agreed to sell its only operating
subsidiary, its leasing unit, to closely held financial group
Summit Group PLC for #120 million. The move leaves the Ranks
Hovis McDougall holding as Anglo's "most significant
investment," according to an Anglo statement. The statement
added Anglo's directors have been reassessing long-term
strategy since the B.A.T bid failed and "are actively
reviewing the range of options." They will give a further
indication of strategy next month.
   Because Anglo will have no operating businesses, the
disposal limits Anglo's ability to list its shares on the
London market. That, in turn, could dull its teeth as a
corporate raider by restricting the company's ability to
issue listed securities in any bid. As a result, traders said
yesterday's announcement dimmed hopes of a rapid Ranks Hovis
McDougall bid. RHM shares rose six pence to 356 pence on
London's stock market. Anglo shares were suspended at 173
pence.
   Sir James is known for unexpected moves. And it is all but
certain the legendary financier won't take all his marbles
from the table. However, he could be toning down his
activities somewhat. In a recent conversation, the
57-year-old financier described himself as "semiretired."
   His recent moves come as the takeover game becomes
increasingly difficult for financial bidders such as Sir
James because of high interest rates, growing doubts over
debt-financed acquisitions and mounting regulatory
resistance. Meanwhile, obvious targets are harder to find
because many companies have taken steps to increase value for
shareholders to forestall bids. After over two decades at the
center of global mergers, Sir James has spent much of this
year traveling in the Far East and vacationing at his Mexican
estate.
   People who work closely with the financier say that while
he still considers himself an active investor, he no longer
seeks to manage any company he controls. But a colleague also
warned against drawing conclusions from the announcement.
"There are plenty of options, and we are looking at all of
them," the colleague said. Whether Sir James decides to
pounce again will depend as much on circumstances at the
moment as on his determination to stay semi-retired.
   Anglo has five main options. It could bid for RHM. Or it
could seek another target and keep its stock-exchange
listing. Anglo could distribute the RHM shares to holders, or
try to list on another exchange. Or it could buy the 25% of
Anglo that Sir James and Lord Rothschild's interests don't
already own. The company is expected to disclose further
details by its annual meeting July 25.

   India has asked Switzerland for legal help in its probe of
what are alleged to be illegal commissions paid in the
purchase of six submarines from West Germany.
   Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler said India
alleges large payments were made by the Kiel-based
Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft to Indian officials via Swiss
banks in connection with the submarine deal. He said the
Indian request, consisting of about 100 pages, was now being
examined to see what measures might have to be taken by Swiss
authorities.
   Last January, accounts in four Swiss banks were ordered
frozen in connection with alleged bribes paid to Indian
officials by Swedish arms maker AB Bofors in the sale of
howitzers to India.
   A Swiss group involved in Third World matters said the new
Indian request named more than 30 Swiss banks through which
the illegal payments, said to total about 40 million Swiss
francs ($28.3 million), were allegedly made in 1981 and 1982
in the submarine deal.
                                                                                                       

   TAIWAN'S ELDERLY LAWMAKERS
                                                                                                       

   The elderly members of Taiwan's legislature, who have
dominated politics for four decades without having to face
re-election, must all retire by the end of 1991, the Council
of Grand Justices ruled. The elderly lawmakers, who number
nearly 800, were elected on the Chinese mainland shortly
before the Nationalist government lost a civil war to
communist forces and retreated to Taiwan in 1949. The aging
parliamentarians, now mostly in their 70s and 80s, were kept
in office to symbolize the Nationalist claim to still be the
legitimate government of China.
                                                                                                       

   AIR FRANCE'S CUTBACK PLANS
                                                                                                       

   Air France plans to cut back flights on some of its
less-traveled routes and take other cost-saving measures in
the face of sluggish traffic growth, Chairman Bernard Attali
told the French business daily La Tribune de l'Expansion. He
was quoted as saying that the state carrier's traffic rose
only 1.8% during the first five months of 1990, compared with
a 4.3% rise in capacity. Included among the cutback plans is
a reduction in the number of flights to Algeria and the
Caribbean.
                                                                                                       

   JAPANESE RICE
                                                                                                       

   Japan will keep its ban on rice imports because rice
farmers here are "special," the agriculture minister said.
"We have opened the agricultural market, but there is a line
beyond which we cannot pass," said Tomio Yamamoto, minister
of agriculture, fisheries and forestry. A recent survey of
3,000 people by Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper indicated
that 71% favored easing rice-market controls, up from 41% in
1988.
                                                                                                       

   PAPER FOR PRAVDA
                                                                                                       

   Finland's paper exporters are cutting off all shipments to
the Soviet Union because they haven't been paid. The move
could affect publication of the Soviet Communist Party paper
Pravda and the official government newspaper Izvestia. The
two papers' stocks of newsprint have dwindled to a week's
supply because other Western countries already have stopped
paper exports to the Soviet Union, the Finnish report said.
An official of the Confederation of Finnish Forest Industries
said the Soviets owe Finnish paper exporters about $22
million.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIET-SOUTH KOREAN TIES
                                                                                                       

   The top Soviet official in Seoul said he doesn't expect
his country to begin formal diplomatic relations with South
Korea in the near future. Valery K. Nazarov, president of the
Soviet trade office in Seoul, said there would be "several
steps to overcome" before establishing ties and indicated the
process would be complex. His comments contrasted with
widespread speculation among political leaders in Seoul that
ties would be established as early as September.
                                                                                                       

   POLISH UNEMPLOYMENT SOARS
                                                                                                       

   Unemployment in Poland accelerated in the first two weeks
of June, the Labor Ministry said.
   A ministry spokesman said 511,152 people, or 3.8% of the
work force, were registered as unemployed June 16, compared
with 443,222 May 31.
   The Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza forecast a further
sharp rise in unemployment during the summer. It said 6,900
enterprises had announced plans to lay off 270,000 workers by
the end of August. But the newspaper said about 45% of the
current jobless were people who had never worked before and
registered only to get unemployment benefits introduced by
the Solidarity-led government.
   Unemployment was officially nonexistent in Poland under
communist rule. There were just 9,000 people registered as
jobless in December before the austerity measures took
effect.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   In Brussels, about 150 farmers angry about a price freeze
on their products slipped through police controls and
confronted Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens in a
barber shop. "I am the son of a farmer and . . . sympathize
with you," the prime minister reportedly told the farmers,
who discussed their problems with him for a few minutes
before leaving. . . . Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
turned 37 yesterday but stayed away from scores of birthday
celebrations organized by her Pakistan People's Party. "She
is celebrating personally," a party spokesman said. "She does
not want to make it official."

   Renoir at $78 Million
   Simply a Decent Price

   Ann E. Berman's May 24 Leisure &amp; Arts article on the
recent Sotheby's impressionist/post-impressionist auctions is
interesting, not least because it permits a computation of
the return earned by the seller of Renoir's "Au Moulin de la
Galette."
   Ms. Berman states that the seller acquired this painting
in 1929 for $165,000. The selling price ($78.1 million)
includes both the buyer's and the seller's commission, so the
net price to the seller is approximately $64.5 million. Out
of this, taxes must be paid; if the applicable tax rate is
33%, then the after-tax selling price is approximately $43.5
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This is about a 9.56% compound annual rate of return on
the original purchase price, in nominal terms, and before
accounting for any costs of ownership of the painting
(insurance, security costs, conservation, etc.). If we adjust
for inflation, we can express the purchase price in terms of
current prices as about $1.5 million. In real terms, the
compound annual return on the original purchase price is
about 5.67% (again, without adjusting for any costs of
ownership).
   These returns, while decent, are clearly not spectacular.
Given that Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette" is one of the
most famous of his works, this suggests that the pecuniary
returns to ownership of even the best and most famous works
of art probably do not exceed the returns to other
investments.

   Japanese Banks Boost a Role in New York

   NEW YORK -- Japanese banks, hoping to cash in on the
potentially lucrative rewards of foreign-exchange dealing,
are expanding their currency trading desks in New York.
   The expansion follows, and for some banks it parallels,
the emergence of cash-rich Japanese insurance companies and
investment houses as major forex market players, according to
analysts who said the Japanese banks are going after their
share of the business that's handled in New York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. market had a net daily turnover of $129 billion a
day, a survey by central banks in April 1989 found, placing
it behind the U.K. market, with $187 billion, and ahead of
Tokyo, with $115 billion. That survey is the most recent
official compilation of global forex activity.
   Officials at the Japanese banks were quick to cite a
desire to expand their customer base, not only among Japanese
corporations, but also among non-Japanese businesses. To that
end, many of them are filling New York positions with locally
hired traders skilled in the ways of handling corporate
clients.
   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd., Mitsui Taiyo
Kobe Bank, the Bank of Tokyo and Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. are among the Japanese institutions adding more
traders to their currency operations in New York. Some, like
Fuji and Dai-Ichi, aim to double the number of New York
traders.
   The yen is becoming more and more international as a
currency, said Yoneo Sakai, joint general manager in charge
of treasury operations at Fuji Bank Ltd. New York.
   Not only Japanese corporations, but also U.S. corporations
are interested in dealing in the currency, he said, adding
that the Japanese banks have an advantage over their U.S.
counterparts because of their familiarity with the Tokyo
market.
   While the size of the role that Japan's big institutional
investors play in currency dealing hasn't been quantified,
market observers and participants agreed it has soared since
the mid-1980s, when the Japanese began casting their eyes
abroad in search of places to invest their big trade
surpluses.
   Life-insurance funds and other big investors have become a
force to be reckoned with in the currency market, said Dennis
Pettit, the newly hired foreign exchange manager at Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan in New York. The Japanese banks are
seeing a lot of that business and have to gear themselves up
to handle the volume, he said.
   Nicholas Sargen, director of research at Salomon Brothers
Inc., said Japanese investors started thinking about hedging
their U.S. investments in the mid-1980s, when the dollar's
sharp depreciation wiped out much of their gains in the bond
market. Ironically, they started hedging after the dollar
started appreciating again, he said.
   Insurance companies, investment houses and even importers
and exporters have to think about currencies much more than
they used to, said an officer at one Japanese bank's
expanding currency desk in New York. "Customer demand for
foreign exchange is getting bigger and bigger," said the
officer, on condition that neither he nor his bank be
identified.
   "It's really hard even for us to find their hedging
ratio," said the officer, who plans to hire four new traders.
"Clearly, it depends upon the trend of the dollar and some
other currencies. It depends on the market."
   But the Japanese haven't only been hedging more of their
long-term U.S. securities investments. They also have been
more and more willing to take short-term currency positions
that require them to have access to a dealer at any hour,
analysts said.
   David Gilmore, foreign-exchange analyst at McCarthy,
Crisanti &amp; Maffei in New York, said the Japanese investment
trusts and life insurance companies are doing much more
trading than they used to and need to get in and out of the
market several times a day.
   A lot of that business is falling in the laps of U.S.
banks, he said. It's profitable and the Japanese banks
probably want to pick that up, Mr. Gilmore said. To the
extent that Japanese banks were handling those orders before,
it was through their London offices or by bringing their
Tokyo staffs in early, he said.
   Michael Simpson, Salomon Brothers' director in Tokyo, said
that big Japanese institutions have been able for some time
to do business during New York's trading hours. Those that
didn't have a presence in New York either had direct contacts
with Japanese dealers at U.S. banks or they would run 24-hour
desks out of Tokyo, he said, adding that the long Tokyo hours
were particularly common around the release of key U.S.
economic indicators.
   Mr. Simpson said Japanese banks have been slow to react to
the explosion in Japanese investment abroad and in the yen's
trading volume: Yen transactions against the dollar in the
U.S. climbed 145% from March 1986 to April 1989, according to
a survey conducted last year by central banks.
   "Just because their investors are suddenly active, they
{the Japanese banks} don't open a trading room," he said.
"They tend to take their time over things. They want to be
sure of what they're doing."
   Representatives of some Japanese banks maintained that the
growing strength of big institutional investors is only part
of the reason for their expansion.
   Corporate business is like bread and butter for a bank,
said Keiichi Udagawa, manager of the foreign exchange
department at Bank of Tokyo in New York, where the bank has
long had a solid foreign-exchange presence. The Treasury
business is extra; it's also lucrative, he said.
   Because of the size of its New York trading operation --
it now has 25 desks doing interbank and customer business --
the Bank of Tokyo views itself more as a competitor of U.S.
money center banks than of smaller Japanese currency
operations, said Mr. Udagawa.
   At least in dollar-yen trading, "we compete with them
equally," he said, adding that the bank wants to expand its
capabilities in other currencies.
   Already active in mark-yen trading, "a very important
product in the market right now," the bank wants a greater
role in trading involving sterling and the Swiss franc as
well, Mr. Udagawa said, explaining, "We like to be
diversified."
   Tadashi Kawashima, assistant general manager at Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank's New York branch, said that until about a year
ago, 90% of his business was in dollar-yen trading. Today,
that trade accounts for only 30% to 40% of his business with
sterling, the mark and the Swiss franc taking up the slack,
he said.
   Although the expansions would leave most of the Japanese
banks with currency desks that are still far smaller than
those of such U.S. giants as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan
Corp., some analysts said they think the move could
eventually pose a threat to U.S. banks' relations with U.S.
corporate customers.

   REDMOND, Wash. -- Nintendo of America Inc. said it expects
sales of its videogame systems to surpass more than nine
million units this year, 1.5 million more than it previously
forecast. Nintendo said the increase is based on the pace of
sales to date.
   The increase comes despite introduction of new video-game
systems by its industry rivals. The company, a unit of
Nintendo Co. of Japan, estimates it controls about 80% of the
video-game systems market.

   Well, what am I . . . chopped liver? I've been
contributing to the Journal's "Pepper . . . and Salt" cartoon
panel for more than 30 years, along with a multitude of other

   In regard to William Fulton's May 8 editorial-page
article, "Can Anything Stop Los Angeles?": In 1983 I was
transplanted to the west end of the San Fernando Valley, and
I've witnessed an incredible metamorphosis of the area.
Development has been, shall we say, rampant.
   I believe there is a very affirmative yes to Mr. Fulton's
question as to whether the continued sprawling of Los Angeles
will ever cease. It has to do with one little precious
commodity called water.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Fulton correctly describes the economic effects of the
housing bonanzas in the valleys adjoining the San Fernando.
He aptly notes that areas such as Mojave and Rosamond are
next. But he and the developers are living in a fool's
paradise by failing to consider the impact these new projects
will make on available drinking water. It is a desert out
there and we are running out of water here.
   Los Angeles is finally catching up with its northern
cousins and moving to water rationing. Areas such as Santa
Barbara now have strict policies on water usage and
consumption. Reclaimed water is being used -- however, this
will surely not be enough for the demand required in these
newly developed areas.
   Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley and most of Southern
California are going to have to face the music and ratchet
down the laissez-faire attitude toward unchecked development.
The leaders here have truly been living in La La Land with
regard to meeting basic human needs for open recreational
space. If the developers want to develop, then LA's
government leaders should be giving them incentives to
improve what is already here with more parks, a reliable mass
rail system and better drinking water. Los Angeles doesn't
need more condos, strip malls or freeways. It needs active
leadership.

   Mr. Fulton's article reveals how current public policies
are immeasurably cruel to the poor.
   Basic food is cheap -- five pounds of rice cost $2. Used
clothing is cheap in thrift shops. Many poor people can even
afford cheap used cars. But the cost of housing has been
artificially raised in many areas. This dreadful shortage of
housing is not an act of nature, like a shortage of rain, but
is the direct result of deliberate, purposeful zoning and
"growth restrictions." Once this is done, "subsidized
housing" is promoted as a sop to the poor.
   We forget that the best way to ensure a good supply of
cheap used cars for lower-income people is just to keep on
building cars. The same is true of housing. The poor never
lived in new housing or drove new cars -- they moved into the
houses that wealthier people moved out of when new housing
was built. While at one time suburbs were towns in their own
right, containing a cross section of people from rich to
poor, many such suburbs now are wealthy bedroom communities.
The governments of such communities are legally able to
restrict housing and push up the price of homes to $325,000.
But would we tolerate a policy of the middle classes and the
wealthy to restrict production of food and clothes, to push
up the price of rice to $5 a pound, the price of a shirt to
$100, just so more lower-income people could come to
"subsidized" thrift shops and soup kitchens?
   Zoning and growth restrictions should be abandoned; they
reflect the legal enforcement of the wishes of those who have
a place to live, not those who need a place to live. Local
governments should vigorously build roads, schools, parks and
public utilities to keep up with where people want to live --
not to restrict them.

   K-Tron International
   Indicates It Expects
   Net to Rise This Year

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   PITMAN, N.J. -- K-Tron International Inc. is "comfortable"
with analysts' estimates of 1990 per-share earnings in the
area of $1.20, John C. Tucker, vice chairman and chief
financial officer, said.
   That would indicate net income of about $3.5 million. For
1989, the maker of gravimetric feeders, blenders and security
systems reported earnings of $3.2 million, or $1.08 a share,
on revenue of $57.6 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   K-Tron expects to post increased sales for the second
quarter, but profit will be "tighter" than a year ago because
of "a shifting mix in our product offering," said Leo Beebe,
chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview. He
didn't make a specific forecast. For the 1989 second quarter,
the company reported earnings of $1.1 million, or 36 cents a
share, on revenue of $14.9 million.
   K-Tron's gravimetric feeders and blenders are devices used
in controlling the rate at which ingredients are fed or mixed
in to make various products. The equipment is sold to
manufacturers of chemicals, plastics and food products.
K-Tron's gravimetric security systems are designed to detect
theft in retail stores by sensing changes in weight of
displayed merchandise.
   The order backlog for feeders and blenders, valued at
about $18 million, is 39% ahead of a year ago, said Mr.
Bebee. He also cited the 15% improvement in the
foreign-exchange rate as an encouraging sign for healthy 1990
earnings.
   In the 1990 first quarter, K-Tron opened a sales, service
and technology-training center in Singapore, hoping to
establish a stronger presence in the Far East and the Pacific
Rim. Near-term, the company expects some "offsets" against
earnings for start-up expenses of the Singapore operation.
"And that isn't cheap," said Mr. Beebe.
   Noting "some softening" in the U.S. market, he said
conditions are stronger in Europe, where demand is running
about 10% better than last year. Indeed, Mr. Beebe said
K-Tron is "having difficulty meeting demand" in Europe.
   During the first quarter, K-Tron reduced its debt about $2
million and continued to have "good positive cash flow," Mr.
Beebe said. As of March 31, long-term debt was $20.5 million.
He said the company plans to continue decreasing its debt.
   Although 1989 results were hurt by the company's
introduction of a new line of gravimetric blenders, Mr. Beebe
said he expects earnings to benefit from K-Tron's new modular
feeder line, introduced in the U.S. about two weeks ago.
   "Ultimately, the new modular feeder will provide K-Tron
with the bulk of its feeders business," said Mr. Beebe. He
expects the modular line to supplant the company's other
feeder lines in the near future.
   The modular equipment is designed so that components can
be shifted or interchanged, permitting quick cleaning and
ingredient conversion. This new flexibility cuts down on
production costs for manufacturers. Beebe said the new design
is a "natural evolution" in feeders.
   "We don't think we have a major competitor with the
modular," Mr. Beebe said. "No one else makes this product."
K-Tron is receiving orders for the modular line from many of
the same multinational customers it has developed in Europe.
   Separately, Mr. Beebe said K-Tron expects to renew its
current RJ Reynolds Tobacco contract to provide
"loss-in-weight" security systems to retailers of cigarettes.
He said the company is also "probing the market" for other
applications of the loss-in-weight technology, testing it
with merchandisers of expensive clothing, cosmetics and
liquor.

   NASHUA, N.H. -- Ferrofluidics Corp., a maker of seals and
dampers for computers, said its expects to take a charge of
as much as $15 million in its fourth quarter and year ending
June 30, related to writeoffs and a corporate restructuring.
   In fiscal 1989, the company earned $52,000, negligible in
per-share terms, on sales of $20.2 million. Fiscal 1989
fourth-quarter results weren't broken out separately. In the
fiscal 1990 first nine months, Ferrofluidics had a net loss
of $561,000, or 19 cents a share, on sales of $21.6 million.
The company declined to forecast results for the current
fiscal year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ferrofluidics said the planned charge will result partly
from a loss from the sale of its AF Technologies Ltd. unit in
Britain, and write-downs of other assets, inventories and
patents, including some related to its ferrofluid film
bearing program. The company also said it will eliminate a
deferred-tax asset on its books, because of adoption of new
Financial Accounting Standards Board standard.
   Ronald Moskowitz, chief executive officer, said the
restructuring "is in the long-term best interests of the
company and its shareholders, and will result in a more
profitable company."

   The Americas:
   Sandinista Party Fades Away as Its Well Runs Dry

   MANAGUA -- A common perception about Nicaragua is that its
newly installed government is weak, divided and confused,
while the Sandinistas, who still control the armed forces and
grass-roots organizations, are "governing from below," as
expresident Daniel Ortega predicted. The future, therefore,
looks bleak, and only the most optimistic hope that President
Violeta Chamorro will overcome the more experienced and far
better organized Sandinista Front, which is blocking her
every move with strikes and sabotage.
   There is no doubt that the Chamorro government is weak.
Analysts are right to point out that it presides over a
bankrupt economy. Economic advisers still are at odds over
the proper methods of implementing economic reforms. The
government hardly has any military or enforcement power. It
often lacks coherence and sophistication. But analysts keep
missing a crucial point: The Sandinistas, despite their
weapons, their national and international networks, and their
still vociferous militants, are -- and have been -- a largely
artificial force that can survive and thrive only through the
enforced monopoly of state power.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sandinista loyalists now are denied free gas, vehicles,
buildings and other privileges. The Sandinista Confederation
of Labor (CST) owns a large building in Managua that the
"comandantes" confiscated and converted into party property.
But now they have to pay electric bills, taxes and
maintenance out of their own pockets. Sandinistas are
beginning to realize how expensive a party can be once it has
to support itself without state resources.
   When they allowed an opening -- through elections, however
stacked in their favor -- the Sandinistas suffered a dramatic
political defeat. Now, deprived of the state as the party's
instrument of coercion, reward and funding, the Sandinistas
may be on the way toward political oblivion.
   I witnessed one of these reverses in the Ministry of
Education, where I work, affecting the Sandinistas' union of
teachers, called Anden. Like all other Sandinista
organizations, Anden was forced on the workers. It had been
supported by a combination of outright state subsidies and by
the enforcement of an automatic deduction from state employee
paychecks. Each month, Anden collected 1% of the payroll of
our 31,900 employees. Teachers recently were told that from
now on, membership in labor unions, including Anden, was to
be freely decided by employees. Carried out at all government
levels, this policy is dealing a mortal blow to the
Sandinista labor movement.
   For the first time Sandinista activities have to compete
for resources with the democratic unions. Thousands of
employees are leaving unions that the comandantes created and
imposed from above. The process is fueled by the bitter
memories of Sandinista edicts that strikes and demands for
raises were considered treasonous. And in most state-owned
factories or institutions independent labor unions were
severely harassed, if not banned outright. Now, the
democratic unions are fully legal and growing, while the
Sandinista ones are shrinking. On April 27, two days after
Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration, 5,000 of the 7,000 employees at
the huge, state-owned sugar mill -- San Antonio -- met at a
baseball stadium and voted overwhelmingly to leave the
Sandinista union and join the CTN, an independent union.
   The FSLN, the Sandinista Party, in fact is rich in
property and installations; before leaving office its leaders
outfitted their party at the expense of the national
treasury. They now own two newspapers, several radio
stations, countless buildings, many businesses, cars, trucks,
giant loudspeaker systems and the like. But they are hard
pressed to pay for operating costs. Though their finances --
as always -- are secret, every indication suggests they
already are in the red. When their loudspeaker system needs a
part, no longer can they charge the expense to the Ministry
of Culture, nor can they exempt themselves from import taxes.
   Slowly but steadily, the new government has been replacing
Sandinista militants in the state apparatus by members the
new authorities can trust. In the Education Ministry, we have
fired both national and regional directors appointed by the
former regime. The substantive impact this has had on
education already is being felt. No longer is the Sandinista
anthem sung in the nation's classrooms; the Nicaraguan
national anthem is sung instead. Next semester textbooks
infused with Sandinista doctrine will be replaced; for now
the ideological parts are skipped over, and we teach civic
education in their place.
   At times, the mobilization of Sandinista militants has
been able to block the removal of some of their members from
government posts. But newly appointed administrators simply
withhold from these managers decision-making power and even
their normal duties. Such circumstances have led numerous
Sandinista militants to resign from state jobs. For example,
20 top managers at the Ministry of Social Welfare, all
Sandinista militants, recently resigned (which also says
something about Sandinista practices of overstaffing in this
impoverished nation of three million).
   But in various government institutions there is a growing
willingness of old employees to cooperate with the new
authorities, even among many supporters of the past regime.
They are conforming to the country's new direction.
   As it slowly democratizes Nicaragua, the new government
gains ground. Ordinary citizens already have been granted far
greater room for initiative and freedom of action in all
realms. For example, the Education Ministry has just
eliminated all the red tape and cumbersome requirements that
Nicaraguans had to meet in order to establish private schools
of commerce, crafts, skills and other trades. We are letting
the market -- not the state -- pass final judgment on the
worth of different educational establishments.
   We also plan to relax the very detailed curriculum
requirements that currently are imposed on all schools,
inhibiting creativity and independence within the educational
community. Under the Sandinistas there was only one textbook
for every class. Even private schools had to follow it,
together with minute regulations on how and when to go from
one unit to the next. Now we will allow the use of many
textbooks and make the programs less constraining.
   At the economic and social levels both small and big
producers are celebrating the new freedom of the marketplace.
Small retailers are free to buy or sell the quantities and
qualities they want for nearly all products. In the past they
were closely controlled by Enabas, a giant state corporation
that ruined numerous small shops through excessive taxation
and cumbersome trade restrictions.
   The Sandinistas in the meantime still can make much noise.
They are entrenched at the National University, where they
enjoy nearly absolute control under an autonomy law that they
granted themselves, following their electoral defeat. The
poignant fact, however, is that the Sandinistas are back to
where they came from: the sub-culture of the university
elites bent on promoting utopias that have no roots in the
yearnings of the common man.

   Spain Overhauls Its Creaky Tax System,
   In Part to Avoid Threat of Capital Flight

   MADRID -- In a crowded tax office, bundles of paper tied
up with red tape fill a row of shelves against a wall. "Last
year's income tax returns," says Juan Miguel Lopez de Veraza,
the office supervisor. "We still haven't finished dealing
with them. Goodness knows where we'll put this year's batch."
   Behind him, a line of people waiting to make 1989 income
tax declarations stretches into the street. As the June 20
deadline neared, the scene in the Hortaleza district tax
office illustrated the government's success in widening its
tax net.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But it also underlined one of Spain's principal
shortcomings: cumbersome bureaucracy. Paying taxes may mean
"investing in Spain," as government-financed billboards on
Spanish highways proclaim, but up-front conditions are
onerous. This office in suburban Madrid is open to the public
from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday to Friday. Until Mr. Lopez de
Veraza put a stop to it recently, employees used to take
"coffee breaks" to go shopping during office hours. Even when
they're on duty, taxpayers may have to wait in line for
hours.
   Now, the government has embarked on an overhaul of Spain's
tax system that could help reduce some of the queues. Income
taxes are expected to be lowered slightly, and indirect taxes
increased. But the changes aren't a change of heart on the
part of Spain's Socialist government. Rather, they are being
forced on it by future freedom for capital movements in the
European Community. If Spanish income taxes are higher than
those in other EC countries, Spain could face a big outflow
of funds. Some savvy Spaniards are already moving their
fiscal residence abroad.
   Until now, in a nation where tax dodging is something of a
national pastime, Spanish fiscal policy has relied more on
sticks than on carrots. A top marginal income tax rate of 56%
starts on taxable incomes above 8,240,000 pesetas ($79,000).
Wealth tax starts at 0.2% on taxable assets above nine
million pesetas, rising to 2% above 2.5 billion pesetas. The
principle of progressively increasing taxation of incomes is
enshrined in the constitution. The only safeguard is a clause
stipulating that total taxes under both headings can't exceed
70% of an individual's annual income.
   Faced with widespread tax evasion, the government has done
its best to enforce the rules. In the past few years, it has
doubled the number of tax inspectors and uncovered
large-scale tax frauds, for example, in single-premium life
insurance policies.
   In Spain's property market, it has taken steps to prevent
the underdeclaration of sales values by saying it will tax
any difference between sales prices and market values as a
gift. It has announced plans for special taxes on real estate
bought through offshore companies under a system used by
non-residents and even some Spaniards to avoid Spanish taxes.
   Later this year, Spaniards will be issued with fiscal
identity cards, the use of which will be obligatory in all
sorts of transactions from opening a bank account to buying a
house. Due largely to successful tax policing, the government
hopes to eliminate its budget deficit in 1992.
   What it hasn't succeeded in doing, however, is to
establish a consensus that taxes are fair. Wealthy Spaniards
complain that they're being taxed too much, while labor
unions allege that many high earners don't declare as much as
they should.
   Last year, the constitutional court forced the
government's hand by ruling that a system for taxing married
couples was unfair. Couples were being charged on their
combined income at the same marginal rates as applied to
individuals. The result of the court's ruling was a
five-month delay in tax declarations while the government
amended the law. The change finally saved couples around 300
billion pesetas in income tax.
   Now, in an effort to win support for future tax policy,
the government has consulted economists and labor unions and
plans to open talks soon with employers. On Friday, a cabinet
meeting spent several hours discussing the issue. Officials
say they hope to get draft legislation ready to present to
Parliament next month.
   But the planned changes, though going some way toward
making Spain's tax system simpler, aren't expected to amount
to a tax revolution. The principle of progressive taxation
will be maintained, officials say. Though red tape will be
reduced in some areas, it's likely to be increased in others,
they admit.
   Income taxes are expected to be lowered slightly, for both
high and modest incomes. Top marginal income tax rates may be
reduced, either by cutting the top rate a few points or by
raising the threshold at which it comes into effect.
   Capital gains, at present taxed as income, are expected to
be treated more favorably, particularly for long-term
investments. They won't be taxed at all in cases where the
initial investment is below a specified limit. Total revenue
from income taxes is likely to fall 5% to 12%.
   But the reduction in revenues will be compensated for by
higher value-added taxes and excise taxes. The ordinary VAT
rate is expected to rise from 12% to 14% or more. A luxury
VAT rate of 33% is expected sooner or later to be reduced to
match the ordinary rate. In the case of cars, the difference
will probably be made up for by a registration fee.

   Budget Deficit
   Widened in May,
   Treasury Says

   WASHINGTON -- The federal government's budget deficit
widened to $42.55 billion in May from $25.43 billion a year
earlier, the Treasury said, reflecting sizable spending on
the thrift-industry bailout and declining tax revenue.
   Last month's budget gap compared with a revised surplus of
$41.76 billion in April. The Treasury previously reported the
April surplus as $42.52 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its monthly statement, the Treasury said receipts
totaled $69.21 billion last month, compared with $71.03
billion a year earlier and $139.62 billion in April.
   April usually shows a surplus because the filing deadline
for individual tax returns occurs at midmonth, and receipts
from personal income taxes set a record this past April.
However, both the White House and congressional budget
offices say that they've been forced to widen their deficit
forecasts for this year and next because federal tax receipts
are falling short of their forecasts.
   Although the reasons aren't yet clear, one factor appears
to be that total wages and salaries -- on which payroll and
personal income taxes are paid -- are falling short of
expectations and may have been lower in the recent past than
Commerce Department reports suggest.
   Outlays in May totaled $111.76 billion, up 16% from $96.46
billion a year earlier and 14% from $97.87 billion the month
before.
   Outlays this past May included $7.27 billion spent by the
Resolution Trust Corp. to clean up the S&amp;L industry. The rest
of the increase reflected such items as interest on the
national debt and spending on such programs such as Social
Security and Medicaid.
   For the first eight months of fiscal 1990, which began
Oct. 1, receipts totaled $667.13 billion, up 4.1% from
$640.89 billion the year before. Outlays through May totaled
$818.81 billion, an 8.6% rise from $754.1 billion a year
earlier.
   That produced a total deficit of $151.68 billion for the
first eight months of fiscal 1990, compared with $113.21
billion a year earlier.
   The deficit for all of fiscal 1989 was $152 billion. White
House Budget Director Richard Darman told congressional
budget negotiators this week that he expects the deficit for
all of fiscal 1990 to be between $184 billion and $206
billion, including spending on the S&amp;L cleanup. Excluding
thrift spending, the White House projects the deficit at $158
billion. The deficit target in the Gramm-Rudman law for
fiscal 1990 is $100 billion, but there is no legal penalty
for missing it.
   The government paid $21.65 billion in interest last month
on the federal debt.

playfully. But, turning serious, the tall and ruddy-faced
executive adds that if he didn't believe in the goals, "I
wouldn't be here."
   All this from a Cockney shipyard worker's son who had been
planning his retirement last fall after 40 years at Ford. He
joined the U.S. auto giant as an accounting clerk and spent
the past 16 years as vice president of European
manufacturing. He says he still hopes to retire to his rose
collection when he turns 65 in 1994.
   If anyone can make a success out of Ford's costly foray
into the ultra-luxury car business, it's probably a veteran
car man like Mr. Hayden. Industry executives and financial
analysts cite his role in knitting Ford's diverse factories
into one giant Continental manufacturing machine and his ties
with Ford Chairman Harold A. Poling, a longtime golf buddy.
Mr. Hayden is known "as a tough guy who spoke his own mind,"
says Alan Marsh, an ex-Ford official and now managing
director of Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.K. distributor.
   Mr. Hayden admits he can be abrasive in his bullheaded
determination to get things done. Three years ago, for
instance, his doctor ordered him to shed weight. The auto
executive put himself on a harsh regimen of 500 calories a
day, started 6 a.m. gym workouts and went to bed at nine
o'clock every night to avoid hunger pangs. "My wife said I
did that {diet} like I do everything else: head down and
charging," he recalls.
   He's taking the same no-nonsense approach at Jaguar, where
he ran the Ford transition team before being named Jaguar's
chief executive in March. He succeeds Sir John Egan, who won
a knighthood for rescuing Jaguar in the early 1980s before
seeking a rich partner last year when U.S. car sales soured
and losses piled up again.
   In one of his first acts this spring, Mr. Hayden axed a
badly needed sports car that Jaguar designers had worked on
for nearly six years. The prototype looked beautiful, but
didn't perform well because "it was grossly overweight," he
says. "You can't have a sports car that isn't sporty."
   Canceling a new model two years before its expected launch
"was quite brave," says Christopher Will, an auto analyst at
Shearson Lehman Hutton in London. He thinks Jaguar also
killed the car because of "the advent in Europe and the U.S.
of very good-quality Japanese sports cars." Mr. Will notes
another five years will elapse before Jaguar produces its
first model under Ford stewardship -- probably a
less-expensive range of so-called executive cars rivaling
BMW.
   Mr. Hayden plans to be equally tough toward poor-quality
suppliers and unionists who resist his push for greater
job-assignment flexibility on the factory floor. Sir John
made some headway with faulty suppliers, but he lacked the
buying clout enjoyed by Ford, Britain's biggest car maker.
While head of Ford's European manufacturing operation, Mr.
Hayden dropped half of its suppliers after they flunked a
numerical quality-control system he devised. Ian Mellor,
another former colleague, remembers that "nobody loved
supplying him" at Ford because he "just wiped out the
inefficient ones."
   Vows Mr. Hayden: The same fate awaits Jaguar suppliers who
"don't match up."
   Grappling with Jaguar's 14 combative and tradition-bound
unions poses a more ticklish task. Many Ford unionists saw
Mr. Hayden as "a very abrasive man" but also "found him
frank, honest and fair," says Andy Richardson, a Transport
and General Workers Union official at Bridgend, Ford's main
U.K. engine plant. Four years ago, Mr. Hayden warned Bridgend
workers that Ford would close the inefficient Welsh factory
in 1990 unless productivity improved. The unions complied.
   Mr. Hayden, in making surprise inspections of Jaguar
facilities late at night and before breakfast, is often
dismayed to find inflexible practices that were phased out
long ago by other British auto makers. An assembly line shuts
down, for instance, once workers meet their daily quota --
rather than when a shift ends. Production also sometimes
grinds to a halt because unions refuse to let non-craft
workers handle an absent craftsman's duties.
   "We're going to have to tackle that," Mr. Hayden says,
while conceding work-rule confrontations could spark a
strike. About 300 Jaguar paint-shop employees walked out this
week, virtually shutting down a 1,800-employee body plant
near Birmingham, because they opposed a management move to
end the night shift. Yesterday, they agreed to return to work
Monday. "We probably have more {wildcat} walkouts here than
we did at Ford," he notes, even though Ford's U.K. unit
employs nearly four times more unionized employees than
Jaguar does.
   But these challenges pale before a much bigger one for the
new Jaguar chairman: how to devise an executive car that can
combat Japanese rivals without watering down the Jaguar
image. A typical British executive car is mass-produced and
smaller than a luxury version. It generally is priced at no
more than #25,000 ($43,000) -- roughly #16,000 less than the
priciest Jaguar -- and appeals to drivers younger than most
Jaguar owners.
   Analysts expect an executive car will absorb most of Mr.
Hayden's plans for tripling output over the next 10 to 15
years. They say the new model also will clash with
less-lavish versions of Toyota's Lexus and Nissan Motor Co.'s
Infiniti. "There is no way to hide {from the Japanese} in the
luxury market except by going up and up," declares Shearson's
Mr. Will. "And what is Ford going to do with Jaguar? It's
going down" in size.
   Mr. Hayden, while declining to discuss any blueprints for
future models, says he isn't worried about the Japanese
threat. "Jaguar isn't a me-too car," he says, sounding more
like his predecessor Sir John than a Ford career man. "You
sit in a Jaguar. It smells like a Jaguar. It feels like a
Jaguar. And that's what you have to hold on to."
   The new Jaguar chairman says he also will preserve
Jaguar's snob appeal by not pushing production beyond 150,000
cars yearly and by limiting Ford's involvement. Fewer than 10
Ford executives will join him at Jaguar. Otherwise, he says,
there would be a lot of people saying, "Let's put the Jaguar
cat on the Fiesta" or "Bulldoze the {Coventry} plant."
   He pauses to look out of his spartan office at a
guardhouse topped with a white jaguar leaping into the air.
Ford's name doesn't appear on any sign at the Coventry
headquarters. Ford paid a lot for a valuable image, he says.
"The last thing we want is to make {Jaguar} a full clone."

   Of Democrats --

   ST. PETERSBURG -- Lenin must be turning in his mausoleum.
His hometown is leading the fight for the democratic Russia
he hijacked 73 years ago. A year from now Leningrad could
even have a new old name.
   A first-time visitor has no claim to expertise, but one
way to learn is to spend a few hours listening to Leningrad's
brave new democrats. Peter Gumbel, the Journal's Moscow
bureau chief and a real expert, said I should expect to hear
radical voices (by Soviet standards). He wasn't kidding. In
Leningrad these days, it's possible in a single afternoon to
meet social democrats, Christian democrats,
"anarcho-syndicalists" (libertarians), Russian nationalists,
and Greens -- and later that day to discuss the czar's glory
years with a neo-monarchist.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But this is no political Tower of Babel. At center stage
are committed, coherent reformers attempting to take power
from the Communist Party to yank Mikhail Gorbachev toward
democracy. These Democrats are wary allies of the populist
but enigmatic Boris Yeltsin in his battles with the
government. They're the Russians that Jim Baker and the U.S.
State Department never seem to mention.
   I met with several of them, including a young radical
named Alexey Kovalyov. He's 26 years old, handsome,
articulate and he detests the communists. He and his wife
still live with their parents, while they wait the 10 to 15
years it takes to get their own apartment. Their flat is tiny
and dark, but the tea is hot and the conversation
illuminating. As an archaeologist out of Leningrad University
he could not find a job in his field. So he went to work as a
museum guide and revolutionary.
   This March he ran with the Democratic Front that swept to
victory here in the first genuine election in Soviet history.
Of 380 seats in the city soviet (city council), democrats
took three-fourths. In Moscow, democrats took half. Reformers
also won big in Kiev, Lvov and many other cities. Suddenly,
the Soviet Union has leaders elected by real voters. (Mr.
Gorbachev settled for indirect election to the presidency by
the national Congress of People's Deputies, a third of whom
are Communist-appointed.)
   One of the new leaders is the Leningrad council chairman,
Anatoly Sobchak, a lawyer and people's deputy who wows
national TV viewers with his calls for independent courts and
a nonpolitical KGB. Mr. Kovalyov is a Sobchak reformer.
   These are my kind of Russians. Mr. Kovalyov wants private
property, free markets, and laws that apply to everyone
equally. Other reformers are less fervent free marketeers,
but the Swedish model seems to be the most socialism any
reformer can still tolerate. Mr. Sobchak talks of building a
new "civil society," subject to law and separate from
politics. Most democrats would let the Baltics and other
rebel republics go their own way. Economic progress matters
more to them than political dominance.
   This week the Leningrad reformers are debating a "free
economic zone" -- trade with the Baltics, Finland or any
nation that is interested. But what if Moscow objects? "The
party didn't imagine a noncommunist mayor of Leningrad,"
laughs Alexander Schelkanov, the new mayor and reformer.
"That doesn't mean the people cannot do it."
   All of which has the comrades at proletariat headquarters
glum. The communists still have the best offices in town, and
they still look good in special-order foreign suits, but they
lack the old Bolshevik elan. (It's an irony of socialism that
the scarcity it produces has made even the smallest foreign
symbol a sign of status; Lenin's revolution is being
subverted by the Lacoste alligator.)
   Oleg Kuzin, the number two man for ideology, toes the new
party line about "reform" within socialism, but he's
defensive about it. He can't understand why his team was
wiped out in the March vote. Perhaps he hasn't met the taxi
drivers here who refer to communists as the "Russian mafia."
Of course, he also knows the party still controls the means
of production, as well as central Soviet government.
   Mr. Kovalyov says democracy is now a political force in
the Soviet Union that won't go away. "It is important to
destroy the myth that Gorbachev is the only guarantee of
democracy," he says. Mikhail the Improviser will always head
for the political middle. Reformers must keep redrawing the
middle line until Mr. Gorbachev steps over it and endorses a
truly democratic system. Gorby still has another chance to
join the democrats at the 28th Communist Party Congress in
two weeks. The party may split and if Mr. Gorbachev sides
with the right wing, "that will be his last mistake. No one
will listen to him any more," Mr. Kovalyov says.
   A democratic Russia, it is obvious enough, won't come soon
or easily. The communist apparat, the military, the extreme
nationalists -- none will hand over power without a fight.
Mr. Kovalyov may be naive about his prospects, but
revolutions are not made by pessimists.
   Naive or not, these are the Russian patriots Americans
have long hoped might come to power. They want to complete
what Gorbachev started but is now hesitant to finish. A
democratic Russia wouldn't devote a third of its economy to
the military or donate $5 million a year to Latin dictators.
   It makes sense when the reformers say that Western aid to
the U.S.S.R. should be linked to further democratic progress.
They understand, as some Americans do not, that the current
Soviet system is so corrupt it must be swept completely away.
Their goal is not to sustain or co-exist with Lenin's heirs,
but to bury them.

   Imelda Marcos Remains an Enigma
   As Trial Often Borders on the Bizarre

   The long-running racketeering trial of Imelda Marcos has
shed surprisingly little light on whether the former
Philippine first lady was directly involved in illegal
activities. But it has done much to feed the mystery that
surrounds her.
   Is she the fragile defendant who breaks down at the
witness table, unable to go on? Or is she the indefatigable
"Madame" who leads her entourage through shopping sprees at
tiny Philippine stores in New York? Is she the quiet, forlorn
widow in mourning -- or the entertainer who belts out
requests to shouts of "More] More]" at a party celebrating
what would have been her 36th anniversary?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And, more to the point in the case, did she plunder the
Philippines of more than $200 million and illegally use the
money to buy up jewelry, art and real estate in the U.S.?
   Closing arguments in the trial will begin Monday, and the
often-bizarre case is expected to go to the jury around the
end of June.
   The federal prosecutors handling the case have presented,
through charts, documents and nearly 100 witnesses, a largely
circumstantial picture of alleged theft and fraud. But nobody
has testified that they saw Mrs. Marcos's hand in the cookie
jar.
   Instead, Philippine bank officials and people involved in
the real estate investments have said it was merely their
understanding that the purchases were done at Mrs. Marcos's
bidding. Prosecutors claim that Mrs. Marcos knew that the
money used in the purchases was stolen.
   Meanwhile, defense attorney Gerry Spence, a flamboyant
Wyomian whose Western-style dress and country-lawyer demeanor
have stood out in the Manhattan courtroom, has tried to show
that Mrs. Marcos knew little about the way the money was
being invested.
   Moreover, Mr. Spence has maintained that the source of the
Marcoses' wealth can easily be accounted for, not by theft,
but by Mr. Marcos's discovery of an extraordinary gold hoard
supposedly hidden in the Philippines by a Japanese general
during World War II.
   So far, the 11-week trial has been interrupted four times
by Mrs. Marcos's ailments. More recently, Judge John Keenan
recessed the trial for an early lunch last week when mention
of a purchase of Nautilus weight-lifting equipment for her
daughter Imee, allegedly with government money, sent Mrs.
Marcos's blood pressure soaring.
   "I'm so sorry," she told her attorneys, through tears, as
she went to her personal nurse, waiting with a stethoscope.
Benjamin Cassiday III, one of her attorneys, later explained:
"There they are, talking about her kid's Nautilus equipment,
and all that . . . and it's very upsetting to her."
   On trial with Mrs. Marcos is Adnan Khashoggi, accused of
helping her conceal ownership of the Manhattan real estate.
Mr. Khashoggi's lawyer, James Linn, conceded that his client
was in close contact with the Marcoses after they fled to the
U.S. in 1986. But Mr. Linn said the dealings had nothing to
do with real estate -- instead, he was trying to find a safe
port for a shipment of gold owned by Mr. Marcos, in return
for a share of it.
   Although Mr. Linn has poked fun at his client for falling
for what sounds like such an incredible story, it may not be
as absurd as it seems. During a New York visit, Philippine
Solicitor General Francisco Chaves said investigators believe
they have tracked down the ship, although the gold was
already unloaded. He said President Corazon Aquino's
government is now trying to find the gold, which it maintains
was stolen.
   Mrs. Marcos's comments and behavior have added to the
trial's bizarre side. Still in mourning for her husband,
Ferdinand, who died in September, Mrs. Marcos wears only
black clothes, simple jewelry and an unimpressive selection
of black shoes.
   "I am the center of the crucifixion," she reportedly said
to a group of Filipinos in the courtroom around Lent. On
another day, during a break after a former banker testified
that Mrs. Marcos summoned him into her bedroom to discuss
money, she laughed as she told two visitors in the gallery:
"He's going into my bedroom -- Ferdinand must be jealous as
hell]"
   In court, her attorney, Mr. Spence, has generated his own
controversy. The 61-year-old lawyer has clashed with Judge
Keenan regularly for asking improper questions of witnesses
and trying to introduce irrelevant issues. Mr. Spence has
become increasingly sensitive about reactions to his conduct.
After a reprimand from the judge, he met in chambers with
Judge Keenan and complained that people were laughing at him
"on the Aquino side of the courtroom." Mr. Spence, who wears
a rattlesnake-skin belt and western jackets -- but no suits
-- said the judge was giving the jury the impression that he
was "just a B.S. guy." The judge replied that he was taking
the matter too personally.
   Mrs. Marcos created a more private stir at a party marking
what would have been her 36th wedding anniversary. At the
surprise party, reported in a local Philippine newspaper's
gossip column, Mrs. Marcos was also given a letter from her
husband, Ferdinand. The card -- which read: "To Imelda,
beyond death, I love you, Andy," signed with his nickname --
was written before he died and was kept secret from Mrs.
Marcos.
   The main event, however, was a performance by Mrs. Marcos,
who took the microphone to sing "Feelings" and "Don't Fence
Me In."

   Are Still Facing
   Industry Slump

   Weak Commodity Prices
   Are Expected to Reduce
   Overall 2nd-Period Net

   The chemicals industry continues its downward cycle, with
weak commodity prices expected to reduce overall
second-quarter earnings 15% to 20% from a year ago. Earnings
have perked up slightly since the first quarter, aided by
seasonal improvements and prices stabilizing at lower levels.
But the industry slump is expected to continue for at least
two more quarters.
   The more-cyclical, commodity-chemical and plastics
companies will see declines in the 30% to 35% range because
selling prices have dropped precipitously from peak levels a
year ago. Companies in this group include Quantum Chemical
Corp., Union Carbide Corp. and Dow Chemical Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trend for diversified and specialty chemical makers,
such as Du Pont Co. and Monsanto Corp., is generally flat for
the second quarter. However, earnings will vary widely from
10% up to 10% down, depending on the company's individual
product mix. Despite generally strong demand and pricing,
many companies were hurt by weakness in major economic
sectors, including agriculture, automobiles and construction.
In addition, demand for synthetic fibers was down.
   The biggest factor in the overall second-quarter decline
is the 20% drop in selling prices for commodity chemicals,
triggered by excess capacity. Yet prices were better than
expected because maintenance and weather-related problems
idled much of the new capacity added in 1989. Nontheless,
prices for ethylene and its derivatives, for example, dropped
30% to 23 cents a pound, from 33 cents a pound in the
year-ago quarter. Styrene-plastic prices fell 17% to 38 cents
a pound, from 46 cents.
   In the commodity group, Quantum Chemical is expected to
report the worst year-to-year comparison because of its
exposure to polyethylene, which represents 60% to 70% of
earnings. The company won't get the full benefit of the
restart of its Morris, Ill., plant and a recent polyethylene
price increase, says Charles LoCastro of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp. He says equity earnings will be
affected by losses in a propane marketing joint-venture.
Several estimates range from break-even to $1 a share. A year
ago, the New York-based company had income from continuing
operations of $46 million, or $1.85 a share, on sales of
$672.5 million.
   Similarly, Union Carbide's earnings are likely to be cut
in half by soft selling prices for polyethylene and ethylene
glycol, a major product used in antifreeze. In addition,
Brazil's economic austerity program is likely to cut the
Danbury, Conn.-based concern's earnings about seven cents a
share, says Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. Estimates range from about 60 cents to 70 cents a share.
A year ago, Carbide had net income of $186 million, or $1.33
a share, on sales of $2.28 billion.
   For Dow Chemical, demand is holding for chemicals and
plastics. But profits will be hurt by weak prices and auto
industry exposure, as well as market softness and plant
maintenance shutdowns in Europe. Estimates range from $1.85
to $2 a share. A year ago, the Midland, Mich.-based concern
earned $728 million, or $2.70 a share, on sales of $4.60
billion.
   In the diversified group, American Cyanamid Co. is
expected to be among the leaders, with a 10% to 15% gain. The
Lederle pharmaceutical unit, which accounts for half of the
company's profit, is expected to show a strong 20% profit
improvement. Poor weather reduced expected gains in
agricultural chemicals, causing some analysts to downgrade
estimates to a range of $1.30 to $1.35 a share. A year ago,
Wayne, N.J.-based Cyanamid earned a restated $107.1 million,
or $1.15 a share, on sales of $1.30 billion.
   For Du Pont, earnings are likely to be flat or down
slightly from peak levels in the year-ago second quarter.
Most business segments will be flat. But fibers will be down
modestly as a result of weak demand for apparel fibers, such
as polyester and orlon, says Paul Leming of Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co. With wet weather hurting agricultural chemical sales and
mining operations, estimates range from 95 cents to $1. A
year ago, Wilmington, Del.,-based DuPont earned $714 million,
or $1 a share, on sales of $9.28 billion.
   Several analysts say Monsanto earnings will be flat
because of weak demand for agricultural chemicals, which
account for 20% of the company's sales and nearly 40% of
profit. Wet weather delayed farm planting and reduced
acreage. The downturn in automobiles and housing should
slightly reduce chemical profit. The NutraSweet unit is
expected to do well and drugs will be modestly up. Estimates
range from $3.50 to $3.80. A year ago, St. Louis-based
Monsanto earned $241 million, or $3.54 a share, on sales of
$2.35 billion.
   Ethyl Corp. is expected to gain 10% to 25% with strong
positions in a variety of specialty chemicals. The company
will benefit from improved sales of olefins used in
polyethylene production, antiknock gasoline additives,
bromine and lubricant additives. Estimates range from 47
cents to 54 cents a share. A year earlier, the Richmond,
Va.-based company earned from continuing operations $51.0
million, or 42 cents a share, on sales of $602.6 million.
   For Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc., earnings are expected
to be flat. Industrial gases are expected to grow 5% to 10%,
balancing a 20% downturn in chemicals. Several estimates
range from $1 to $1.08. A year ago, the Allentown, Pa.-based
concern earned $56.6 million, or $1.04 a share, on sales of
$669 million.

   U.S. Push for Japan to Spend More
   Flares Into Contentious Trade Flap

   When American and Japanese trade negotiators knock heads
yet again starting Monday, the most contentious issue will be
whether Japan promises to build enough parks, sewers, and
roads for its long-suffering citizens over the next decade.
   It may seem like a curious battle because the two nations
usually scrap over tangible import barriers, such as the
Japanese government's refusal to buy U.S. supercomputers or
to allow large U.S. retail stores to open in Japan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But in this case, the U.S. is resorting to macroeconomic
manipulation to try and whittle down its intractable $49
billion trade deficit with Japan. U.S. government economists
argue that Japan runs trade surpluses because it doesn't
invest enough, and they want Japan to boost public investment
to soak up more of its savings.
   Japan, for its part, is resisting, arguing that too much
pork barrel will overheat its already strong full-employment
economy, pushing up inflation and interest rates. And the
Japanese resent the U.S. demanding such specific policy
promises.
   "Can the U.S. make the same demands of West Germany?" asks
Yutaka Kosai, president of the Japan Center for Economic
Research. "Maybe Japan should demand that America . . . keep
its Gramm-Rudman-Hollings {deficit-reduction} targets."
   There will indeed be "a matching of strategies," insists
John Taylor of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers
and one of the principals of the U.S. negotiating team. He
says that as the Japanese reduce their imbalance, by boosting
investment to soak up more savings domestically, the U.S.
will reduce its imbalance, by cutting spending and increasing
its savings.
   In addition to public spending, the two governments will
haggle over a range of issues in Tokyo as they try to draft a
final report on the yearlong experiment, known as the
Structural Impediments Initiative, in reducing the bilateral
trade imbalance. They will try to agree on ways for Japan to
toughen its antitrust policy, and to become more
import-friendly. Japanese officials resolve to finish the
talks next week, and this week they handed over proposed
drafts to the U.S. for the final report, which one senior
U.S. official characterized as "some progress but not a lot."
   After two weeks of trading insults over the public
spending issue, each side appears to be backing off a bit.
The main sticking point has been the U.S. demand that Japan
promise to devote 10% of its gross national product on public
spending by 1995, up from 7%. On Tuesday, S. Linn Williams, a
deputy U.S. trade representative said "we are not necessarily
sticking to the GNP figure. We still find the GNP figure
attractive from our standpoint. At the same time, we
understand the Japanese government's point that it is
difficult to budget as a percentage of GNP."
   Japanese officials, meanwhile, are floating increasingly
higher levels of spending targets. Originally, the Japanese
government said it would devote 400 trillion yen ($2.6
trillion) to public works over the next 10 years, while the
U.S. was asking for about 500 trillion. Now the Japanese, in
proposals handed over this week, have raised that level to
415 trillion yen.
   While fighting over the specifics, Japanese officials
themselves admit they should spend more on their
infrastructure. According to the government's own studies,
the level of sewers, public parks, and roads is currently
below the 1965 average of the U.S., West Germany, England and
France, and far below current standards.
   For example, only 40% of the Japanese homes are attached
to sewage systems and the goal is to reach 70% by 2000. That
would still leave Japan behind current rates in England,
Germany, and the U.S.
   "What the U.S. is now saying is what we have been saying
for the past 10 years," says Makoto Taketoshi, a planning
director for the Ministry of Construction. In mid-May, his
office submitted a 300-trillion yen wish list for the 1990s.
One goal is to double the length of highways by the early
21st century.
   Japan lags Western countries because it has a relatively
recent history of urban development, and because, for many
years, "the emphasis was on improving production capacity
rather than social infrastructure," says Yukio Noguchi, a
public finance expert at Hitotsubashi University. Japan,
however, is rapidly catching up, and its current level of
public spending far exceeds that of the other industrialized
nations.
   But Japan's infrastructure improvement campaign has
dropped drastically since the late 1970s, when public debt
ballooned out of control as a result of a new social welfare
system and an oil-shock-induced drop in tax revenues. The
Finance Ministry went on a ruthless campaign to eliminate the
debt, and virtually all government spending was frozen in the
1980s.
   This isn't the first time Japan has been pushed to adjust
its domestic macroeconomic policies. In the late 1970s,
President Carter urged both Japan and West Germany to act as
"locomotives" pulling international growth. In 1985, Japan
agreed to pump up the value of the yen vs. the dollar, making
Japanese goods relatively more expensive. Shortly after,
Japan agreed to reorient its economy, depending on domestic
demand, rather than exports, for growth.
   While Japan's overall surplus has in fact dropped as a
result of these changes, the lingering U.S.-Japan imbalance
shows the limits of such economic tinkering. Many Japanese
officials argue that other factors, such as exchange rates,
interest rates, and other forms of investments and savings
could move to keep the imbalance at the current level.

   Greenspan Says Banks Haven't Induced
   A `Credit Crunch' With Loan Cutbacks

   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said he believes banks haven't cut back lending to
the point of inducing a "credit crunch" and he asserted that
"enough credit appears to be available" to fuel growth in the
economy.
   "All things considered, continued modest economic growth
remains the most likely outcome," Mr. Greenspan told the
Senate Banking Committee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The committee's hearing, called to consider mounting
anecdotal evidence that banks have tightened lending
standards in response to a slowing economy and tougher
regulation, didn't resolve a dispute between regulators on
one side and business groups and some lawmakers on the
others. In recent weeks, many business groups have complained
that banks have grown so tight with credit they are cutting
off creditworthy borrowers and aren't willing to back viable
projects.
   Some congressmen, particularly from New England, are
concerned the regulators may be exacerbating the economic
slowdown. "I have become convinced it's partly because of
overzealous regulation," said Sen. John Kerry, (D., Mass.).
   Bank regulators reiterated that they are simply making
banks set aside needed reserves for losses and that banks
should continue making loans they believe will perform. "It's
the banker's job to find the good loans and to make them,"
said Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke.
   The regulators maintain that the broad slowdown in lending
in New England, and the nationwide reluctance to lend for
real estate construction projects, is a healthy response to
lax lending standards over the past decade.
   In recent days, however, mixed signals on the issue have
been coming from the Bush administration. While the Treasury
has played down concerns about tight credit, two members of
President Bush's cabinet, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and
Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, have said they
believe the credit crunch is more widespread.
   "Especially hard hit have been small and medium-sized
businesses, since these businesses tend to rely heavily on
bank loans for their financing," Mr. Mosbacher said in a
statement yesterday following up on comments he made last
week to the Banking Committee. "These businesses include many
small producers of the technologically advanced products and
services that are of growing importance to our international
competitiveness." Mr. Mosbacher didn't say what he thought
was causing the credit squeeze.
   Mr. Greenspan, for his part, argued that there is no
general lack of credit for creditworthy borrowers. The Fed
chairman did say that banks "unquestionably have made credit
less available" for mergers and restructurings but said the
restraint was probably warranted, considering the "rapid
leveraging of many corporations" in the 1980s.
   Still, while "lenders are generally not retreating from
lending opportunities," Mr. Greenspan said, "significant
problems cannot be ruled out in the period ahead, and we will
continue to devote close attention to credit conditions."
   Speaking more broadly about the economy, Mr. Greenspan
said it is "puzzling" that unemployment has not gone up
despite the slowing of economic growth in the past several
months. Labor force growth has slowed, but the Fed isn't sure
what's behind that, Mr. Greenspan said.

   Shareholders' Secret Victory

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
</GV>
<LP>
   Advocates of shareholder rights have decried last week's
decision by a federal appeals court to strike down the
Securities and Exchange Commission's "one-share, one-vote"
rule as another victory for management at the expense of
shareholders. The truth is that while they may have lost a
battle, they have gained a tactical advantage.
   The SEC's Rule 19c4, which was adopted in 1988, prohibited
public firms from issuing multiple classes of stock with
unequal voting rights. There was a "grandfather" provision
that allowed companies with two classes of stock already in
place to keep them. At the time, 60 companies listed on the
New York Stock Exchange had multiple voting rights or planned
to introduce them, as did 182 companies on the National
Association of Securities Dealers automated quotation system
and 117 companies on the American Stock Exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SEC has long feuded with state securities regulators
and courts for control of the nation's securities laws. Its
strongest foe is Delaware, whose courts and legislature
dominate merger and takeover laws. Delaware is king of
corporate law because its stable, pro-management laws have
drawn most large public firms to incorporate there. Delaware
allows poison pills without shareholder consent, its
anti-takeover law makes obsolete many provisions of the SEC's
tender-offer regulations, and it allows dual-voting stock (as
do almost all state incorporation laws). The SEC vigorously
opposes all of these on the grounds that they are
unacceptable barriers to competition for control of public
corporations.
   The federal appeals court's stinging rebuke last week is
strike three for the SEC in this area of national merger
policy. Strike one was the 1985 International Household
decision allowing poison pills without a shareholder vote,
and strike two was the 1987 Supreme Court decision upholding
the new wave of state anti-takeover laws. The appeals court's
decision last week was a sharp reminder to the SEC that it is
the states that retain most of the authority and
responsibility for regulating the voting and merger rules of
public firms. Delaware remains king.
   The big question now is: Where does the SEC go to protect
its decaying franchise in setting national policy in
corporate control?
   According to my informal survey of academics, most expect
the SEC to appeal the decision -- and to lose the appeal. If
that happens, the the SEC could then ask Congress to enact
legislation providing explicit authority to federalize this
portion of the law of corporations. Although members of
Congress might be willing in principle to support a
one-share, one-vote law, they probably wouldn't have the
stomach for the politically bruising battle that would
entail. A more pragmatic response would be for the SEC to
find an indirect regulatory solution that achieves the same
result of prohibiting dual-voting stock without having a
formal rule like 19c4. Any such indirect action, however, is
likely to elicit a determined legal challenge from the
Business Roundtable (a group of 200 major corporations) --
the same folks who took on Rule 19c4 and won.
   What if the SEC does nothing? I know it sounds
far-fetched, in view of the regulatory zeal of Chairman
Richard Breeden. But, what if? After all, Mr. Breeden is said
to be a smart politician, and it might be smartest for the
SEC to concede the top slot in merger policy to Delaware. The
SEC could then concentrate on rooting out insider trading,
coordinating the regulation of international financial
markets, and cracking down on penny-stock promoters, program
traders, and rival domestic regulatory agencies. Let's face
it, the market for corporate control has already produced
more than its share of public embarrassments for the SEC --
on state anti-takeover laws, poison pills, and now one-share,
one-vote rules.
   Is it politically feasible for the SEC to walk away from
the one-share, one-vote controversy? Rule 19c4 had many
powerful supporters, who are now urging the SEC to appeal the
court ruling and to seek new legislation if it loses the
appeal. Institutional investors and shareholder activists
have staunchly opposed dual-voting and are extremely worried
that many public firms will now rush to create multiple
classes of stock, further entrenching managers and eroding
shareholder rights.
   This concern is largely misplaced.
   True, dual-voting stock is among the most effective
anti-takeover devices available to public firms. Also true,
several dozen firms adopted dual-voting stock during the
gestation period preceding Rule 19c4. But in the past two
years the demand for dual-voting stock (and other takeover
barriers) has been reduced by several changes -- the demise
of Drexel Burnham, the neutralization of Michael Milken, the
reduced availability of takeover financing, and the
legalization of substitute takeover barriers, such as poison
pills and state anti-takeover laws.
   In the case of dual-voting stock, however, the crucial
point is that any such recapitalizations must be approved by
a majority vote of shareholders. And in the past two years,
institutional shareholders have become much more powerful and
effective opponents.
   The best way for shareholder activists and the SEC to
pursue their mutual interests is to concentrate their
political efforts on achieving meaningful reform of the proxy
system. If the SEC can be persuaded to overhaul the proxy
system, then institutional shareholders will be able to
defeat via proxy fights most efforts to establish dual-voting
stock. Moreover, proxy reform would bring such great
across-the-board leverage to institutional investors and
shareholder-rights proponents that it would make no practical
sense for them to invest any more valuable political capital
fighting for a universal one-share, one-vote rule. Put all
your resources behind proxy reform and go for the Big Score,
I say.
   What precisely does "proxy reform" mean? Two thoughtful
proposals have been submitted recently to the SEC. The United
Shareholders Association (a Washington-based
shareholder-rights group founded by T. Boone Pickens Jr.)
seeks a confidential proxy voting requirement, improved
shareholder access to the proxy, shareholder approval of
poison pills, golden parachutes, and greenmail payments, and
liberalization of the SEC's proxy solicitation rules to
facilitate communications among shareholders. The California
Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest
pension fund for civil servants, has submitted to the SEC
similar proposals for proxy reform.
   As state anti-takeover laws, poison pills, and now
dual-voting proposals all threaten to entrench corporate
managements, shareholders must depend more directly on the
proxy machinery to make managers accountable. This makes
proxy reform to remove the clear biases against dissident
shareholders even more urgent. Surely, shareholder activists
can make the SEC and Congress see the merit of this argument.
   Even if the SEC decides to retreat from the battle for
corporate control, the shareholder advocates still ought to
benefit from the coming proxy battles over dual-voting
initiatives. Unlike Carl Icahn's controversial spin-off
proposal, or most poison-pill challenges, dual-voting
proposals will almost certainly be met with across-the-board
opposition by all kinds of institutional investors. It
shouldn't be hard for them to fight down such proposals
successfully. A few victories would provide the unity and
confidence necessary to bring success in the other, more
difficult proxy challenges.
   If the SEC's defeat in court on dual voting can bolster
the prospects for meaningful proxy reform, then
shareholder-rights advocates should come away clear winners.
Advocates of shareholder rights will decry last week's court
decision, as they should. If they play their cards right,
however, they will win the much bigger prize of proxy reform.

   The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that a landfill
operator's insurance policies cover damages resulting from
pollution that occurred over many years. Whether insurers are
liable for costs associated with gradual pollution has been
the subject of extensive litigation in the nation.
   The decision marks the first time Wisconsin's highest
court has interpreted a key provision in standard commercial
liability insurance policies, known as "the pollution
exclusion." The provision hasn't been used widely since 1986.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Insurers have contended that under the provision
policyholders are not covered for damages arising from
pollution that was released gradually into the environment.
Policyholders counter that they are entitled to coverage
under the provision as long as they didn't intentionally
cause or expect the pollution.
   The Wisconsin dispute involves a suit filed by 120
property owners who reside near a landfill site operated by
Land Reclamation Ltd., a landfill operator in Racine. The
residents allege that Land Reclamation violated environmental
laws in its operation of the site, resulting in water
contamination, decreased property values, and unpleasant
odors. Land Reclamation denies the charges.
   The residents sued the company and its insurer, Bituminous
Casualty Corp., seeking $9.6 million in compensation for
property damage. A lower court dismissed the case against
Bituminous, a subsidiary of Chicago-based Old Republic
International. Land Reclamation appealed the decision.
   In a 6-1 decision, the state Supreme Court found that the
meaning of the "pollution exclusion" was ambiguous and must
be interpreted in favor of the policyholder. The court also
ordered Bituminous to pay Land Reclamation's legal costs.
   In a dissent, Judge Donald W. Steinmetz said the court's
decision means that an insurance policy "now becomes a deep
pocket to pay for business mistakes."
   In a ruling that clashes with the Wisconsin decision, the
Massachusetts Supreme Court last week found that the
"pollution exclusion" bars coverage for gradual pollution.
   Peter Lardner, president of Bituminous, said the company
hasn't yet decided whether to appeal. "This continuing series
of conflicting court decisions contributes to more confusion
between customers and companies," he said.
   "It was important for us to know that we now have
insurance coverage," said Joe Muratore, a Racine lawyer for
Land Reclamation.
   Allan D. Krezminski of Schoone Ware Fortune &amp; Leuck in
Racine, a lawyer for the residents, said the decision may
spur settlement negotiations.

   INSIDER-TRADING CASE against Kidder, Peabody to proceed.
   A state court judge in Dallas denied Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co.'s request to dismiss most of the claims filed against the
investment banking firm by Dallas-based Maxus Energy Corp.
   Maxus Energy, formerly Diamond Shamrock Corp., alleges
that it paid more than it should have in its 1983 acquisition
of Natomas Co. because inside information was passed by
former Kidder investment banker Martin A. Siegel to
arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky.
   Kidder Peabody, contending that it knew nothing of the
alleged insider trading, won a ruling in mid-April from a New
York federal judge that the banking firm wasn't liable to
Maxus for damages.
   Kidder cited the New York ruling last week when it argued
before state District Judge Adolph Canales of Dallas that
most of Maxus's claims should be dismissed.
   But Judge Canales ruled this week that Maxus's case
against Kidder could proceed. The judge didn't give any
reason for his ruling. An attorney for Kidder declined to
comment on the decision.
   The case won't be scheduled for trial until after Oct. 1
to allow Mr. Boesky to testify, if needed, at the sentencing
of Michael Milken, former head of junk bonds at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.

   DEFENSE LAWYERS predict Panama will not thwart a pact on
Noriega's legal fees.
   Just as the U.S. reached an agreement that ended a
two-month squabble over legal fees for the deposed dictator,
the government of Panama has piped up, saying Panama should
have first claim to any unfrozen funds.
   Defense attorneys say they aren't worried, even though an
attorney for the Panamanian government, Gregory Craig, said
he intends to file civil suits against Mr. Noriega for more
than $5 billion for a host of alleged misdeeds, including
murder.
   Judge William M. Hoeveler indicated he will give priority
to Mr. Noriega's right to a fair trial over any civil claims.
Thus, the defense is confident the judge won't entertain any
requests to take away Mr. Noriega's kitty for legal fees.
   In an interview, Judge Hoeveler acknowledged that Panama
could petition foreign governments to freeze the accounts,
just as the U.S. did. "Where the money is out of the country
and controlled by a foreign entity, it may be entirely out of
my hands," he said.
   However, while Panama could itself seek to freeze the
accounts, the defense lawyers doubt the government of Panama
would do anything to aggravate the U.S., which has finally
come through with funds to rebuild the battered country.
   "Panama could ask foreign governments not to unfreeze the
accounts," says Jon May, an attorney for Mr. Noriega. "But if
it's not in the interest of the U.S., it may not be in the
interest of Panama to do it."
   Frank A. Rubino, another defense attorney, described the
appearance in court Wednesday by Mr. Craig, an attorney with
the Washington, D.C., law firm of Williams &amp; Connolly, as
"grandstanding."
   Mr. Craig couldn't be reached for comment.

   JUDGE ACCUSED of conflicts will continue to hear
California antitrust case.
   A Los Angeles federal judge ruled that U.S. District Judge
William L. Gray can preside over a multimillion-dollar
antitrust case involving six big oil companies.
   Earlier this year, attorneys for the plaintiffs had
requested that Judge Gray recuse himself from the case
because of various alleged conflicts of interest. Among other
things, the attorneys noted that the judge's wife held 10
shares of stock in Chevron Corp., a defendant in the case.
   The 78-year old judge, who has presided over the case
since its inception in 1975, refused to step down. Federal
Judge Robert M. Takasugi this week denied the plaintiffs'
motion to disqualify the judge on the condition that Mrs.
Gray sell the Chevron stock.
   Judge Gray said the shares were sold the day before the
ruling. "I'm delighted that it's over," he said. "I was very
much embarrassed about the motion which challenged my
impartiality and integrity. My reputation has been
vindicated."
   In the case, the city of Long Beach and the state of
California allege that the six companies conspired to pay
artificially low prices to the state and city for oil
produced from state-owned tidelands. Among the defendants are
Unocal Corp., Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell
Oil Co. unit, Exxon Corp. and Texaco Inc.
   Gary Hoecker, a Los Angeles attorney for Long Beach, said:
"We will decide Friday whether to abide by Judge Takasugi's
ruling or to appeal."

   GM Will Recall
   Camaros, Firebirds
   To Fix Seat Belts

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it is recalling about
1.6 million 1984-90 model Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac
Firebirds to fix defective seat belt buckles linked to at
least one injury.
   The company said plastic push buttons that operate the
buckle latches in the cars could be weakened by prolonged
exposure to sunlight and heat and could break, causing the
buckles to fail.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Two other GM cars have the same buckles, the subcompact
Pontiac LeMans and the ultra-luxury Cadillac Allante, a GM
spokesman said. But the company hasn't heard of any problems
with the buckles on those models, he added.
   GM said that because it doesn't have enough replacement
parts on hand to fix all the cars immediately, it is asking
Camaro and Firebird owners not to head for dealerships unless
their belt buckles appear broken. Owners who decide not to
get the problem fixed immediately will get a second letter
this fall to schedule replacement of buckles "as replacement
parts become available," the auto maker said.
   This is the largest recall GM has announced since July
1989, when it recalled 1.7 million full-size and luxury cars
to fix defective cruise control systems suspected of causing
throttles to stick open.
   GM said Camaro and Firebird owners will know they have a
problem if the red plastic push buttons on the safety belt
latches fail to hold the belt buckle in place, or won't
release properly.
   GM officials learned about the problem from reports
gathered by its field representatives, the spokesman said.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was also
investigating the problem. GM decided to conduct the recall
voluntarily, however, the spokesman said. GM didn't say how
many incidents it had discovered of the buckles failing,
other than the one that resulted in an injury to a passenger.
   GM said it will eventually replace all of the buckles in
the affected models at no charge to owners.

   Setting Up Market
   For Stock Futures

   SEOUL -- South Korea is considering the establishment of a
stock futures market in the near future.
   The Korea Stock Exchange has recently formed a task force
to study the possibility of setting up a stock futures market
to stabilize the stock market, according to stock exchange
officials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Shin Poong-Ho, a manager at the stock exchange's task
force, said they have long studied the possibility to prepare
for the forthcoming liberalization of the local capital
market.
   Beginning in 1992, foreign investors will be allowed to
invest directly in South Korean stocks. Foreigners now invest
in the local stock market through indirect channels, such as
country funds or equity-related bonds.
   Mr. Shin cautioned, however, that it will take a lot of
preparation to set up a stock futures market in South Korea
since the country now lacks preconditions for such a system.
South Korea doesn't even have a commodity futures market yet,
he commented.
   Sohn Chon-Kyun, a professor at the Korea Banking
Institute, said the local stock market isn't mature enough to
allow stock futures trading. "The investment pattern is still
too volatile and the market is too distorted to allow such
trading," Mr. Sohn said.
   He added, however, that quantitatively the local stock
market and its trading volume are big enough to have such a
system.
   In his recent report on the possibility of a financial
futures market in South Korea, Mr. Sohn said stocks would be
the most probable choice for South Korea at the moment if it
decides to introduce a financial futures market. Bonds and
foreign exchange could follow stocks, he said.
   Mr. Sohn proposed that any Korean stock futures market be
modeled after the Japanese one. The Japanese style is more
suitable for South Korea in that it is more conservative than
some other models, he said. South Korea wouldn't have to set
up a separate stock futures market, but could use the current
stock market for stock futures trading, he said.

   Measure Amending
   Orphan Drug Law

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee voted to limit windfall
profits available to certain manufacturers of drugs for rare
diseases, but it excluded two drugs from the measure after
furious lobbying by Genentech Inc. and Amgen Inc.
   The bill, approved 6-4, would modify a 1983 law that gives
the Food and Drug Administration authority to grant
seven-year monopolies to manufacturers of drugs for diseases
that affect fewer than 200,000 people. The law was intended
to encourage companies to produce drugs that would otherwise
be unprofitable. But consumer groups and rival drug companies
have complained that in rare cases the law has enabled a few
"orphan drug" manufacturers to reap large monopoly profits on
a few orphan drugs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The House bill would deny market exclusivity in cases
where a rival drug company can demonstrate it developed the
same drug simultaneously. But under a compromise offered by
Rep. Bill Richardson (D., N.M.), drugs that are approved or
on the verge of being approved by the FDA before Aug. 15
would be exempt.
   As a result, Genentech's human growth hormone and Amgen's
EPO would retain orphan drug status. Human growth hormone is
used to treat dwarfism. EPO, made by Thousand Oaks,
Calif.-based Amgen is used to treat anemia in kidney dialysis
patients.
   "The bill was substantially improved by the subcommittee's
actions," said David Beier, vice president, government
affairs, for Genentech, based in South San Francisco, Calif.
   Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), chairman of the House
health subcommittee, was less enthusiastic. "Those in favor
of the status quo as it exists were able to keep that status
quo for themselves," he said. But Mr. Waxman eventually
supported the compromise bill.
   The bill, which is opposed by the Bush administration,
maintains a provision that would deny orphan drug status for
drugs whose market expands beyond 200,000. This is intended
to deny unforeseen profits to manufacturers of drugs for
diseases, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, whose
patient populations exceed initial estimates.
   Among those companies most likely to be affected by this
provision is Lyphomed Inc. of Rosemont, Ill. The number of
patients using Lyphomed's aerosol pentamidine, used to treat
AIDS-related pneumonia, is rapidly approaching 200,000.
   The measure now goes to the House Energy and Commerce
Committee. In the Senate, a similar bill, introduced by Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), is expected to be considered
next month.

   The Mitchells' caution, which she attributes partly to the
savings-and-loan mess, is significant because it's so in
vogue. American consumers aren't tapping out of the spending
game, but they are cutting back. A few economists think
consumer spending, which accounts for an elephantine
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, is weakening
enough to bring on a recession, and even the vast majority,
who aren't so pessimistic, are getting warier.
   They all cite recent statistics. In May, retail sales fell
0.7%, completing the first three-month slide since the
1981-82 recession. Sales were down for autos, hardware and
building materials, furniture and general merchandise; only
apparel sales rose, after a decline in April. And in the
first 10 days of June, sales of domestic cars and trucks
skidded 13.1%, in a continuation of Detroit's marathon
demolition derby.
   Moreover, the outlook isn't very promising. The Conference
Board's index of consumer confidence fell only slightly in
May, to a reading of 106.7 from 107.3 in April, but it was
down 10 points from a year earlier. A May survey by Leo J.
Shapiro &amp; Associates, a Chicago market-research firm, found
consumers pulling back. Half the 450 respondents -- the most
since 1983 -- said they were buying less clothing, and 34%
are reducing their standard of living.
   Leo Shapiro discerns more worry about the economy than
about personal finances. "Six in 10 people now feel the
nation is in trouble, but they're confident about being able
to cope personally," he says. The percentage of respondents
saying "things are getting worse for the country" jumped four
percentage points to 57% last month after creeping higher
since January. "More consumers expect layoffs ahead," he
adds, "and more are tightening their budgets."
   Even many people not especially worried about losing their
jobs are spending less because their incomes are down. Roy
Kaye, an Atlanta printing-company salesman, says his earnings
have declined 10% to 15% lately because of the soft
advertising market. He recently paid off his home mortgage
because he fears that interest rates will rise while his
income shrinks. "I spend, but I also save," he says.
   Stephanie Bowman, a 33-year-old St. Louis mother of four,
is spending less because her husband's business -- selling
shoe leather to domestic shoe companies -- is off
"drastically." She says she has started shopping for
children's clothes at garage sales. At one recent garage
sale, she says, she bought a $5 dress for her five-year-old
daughter and 50-cent shorts for two of her three sons. "I do
it because it's a lot cheaper and I don't see anything wrong
in buying garage-sale items if they're in good shape," she
says.
   Such consumer caution doesn't prove that an economic
downturn is at hand. However, "modest growth in consumer
spending is essential to keep the economy from slipping into
recession," comments David H. Resler, the chief economist at
Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York.
Deficit-wracked governments at all levels are in a poor
position to step up spending to keep the 7 1/2-year expansion
going. Corporations, with profits weak, are continuing to
slash costs and are beginning to hold down increases in
capital outlays. Exports, though a bright spot, aren't likely
to grow abruptly, as they did in 1988 and 1989 with the aid
of a sliding dollar. Last month, housing starts fell again to
their lowest level since October 1982.
   But though conceding that overall demand is sluggish, most
economists, including Mr. Resler and the Conference Board's
executive director, Fabian Linden, don't see a recession
looming. The June survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a
Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, finds 51 forecasters predicting,
on the average, a 1.9% increase in inflation-adjusted gross
national product this year, down only slightly from a 2%
growth forecast last month. They expect consumer spending,
more than half of which goes for services, to rise 2.1% in
1990, compared with a 2.7% gain last year.
   However, the steady weakening of consumer spending is
adding force to the warnings of the more pessimistic
forecasters. For example, A. Gary Shilling &amp; Co., a New York
consulting firm whose longstanding recession forecast dates
back to August 1988, observes in its latest quarterly review
that "the free-spending American consumer has been the major
factor in the long global expansion of the 1980s, living high
on the hog on borrowed money."
   Now, Shilling economists see indications that "consumers
may be trying to hold down their everyday spending."
   The reason: "a fragile employment picture." If temporary
census workers are excluded, they say, the average monthly
growth in nonfarm payrolls in the first five months of 1990
was 135,000, compared to a 200,000 monthly average in all of
1989 and 275,000 in 1988. Manufacturing employment has fallen
in 13 of the last 14 months.
   Worried about jobs and inflation, "consumers already seem
to be sensing that employment and income prospects are not as
robust as they used to be," the Shilling firm comments, "and
are becoming more frugal. . . . More saving means less
spending and pulls down the contribution that the consumer
makes to economic growth."
   Michael Healy, a 47-year-old now living in San Francisco,
knows more than he cares to about employment problems. He was
the chief executive officer of Hibernia Brewing Co., an Eau
Claire, Wis., firm that went bankrupt in 1988 following a
product recall. Because he had used his two homes as
collateral when he borrowed money for the company, he lost
almost everything he owned. Today, he lives off his savings
and with some help from his brothers.
   "I'm not doing much of anything. I've really become very
frugal. I used to travel first class, get custom-made suits
and buy a new car every three years," he says. "Now,
vacations are out. New clothes are out. And my car is five
years old."
   On Wall Street, another bear is David B. Bostian Jr., the
chief economist at the Jesup &amp; Lamont Inc. securities firm,
who voiced optimism for years -- not even forecasting a
recession in the wake of the 1987 stock-market crash -- but
changed his tune last August. Since then, he has been
predicting "a mild recession" this year but "a buoyant global
economic expansion later in the decade."
   In his 1990 recession forecast, he cites a persistent
decline in corporate profits; the "rapid expansion" of state
and local budget deficits as well as the federal deficit, all
of which he believes "indicate recessionary conditions";
weakness in manufacturing and real estate, including home
construction; and "loan losses and credit restraints in the
banking system." He adds that "even the initial impact of
reduced military expenditures will prove recessionary," with
each $1 billion reduction in the $300 billion defense budget
possibly costing 35,000 to 40,000 jobs.
   Above all, Mr. Bostian emphasizes the country's debt
burdens, which he says are "like a lead weight around the
neck of the economy." He notes that the total debt -- public
and private -- has swollen from $5.5 trillion in 1982 to more
than $11 trillion. Because of high consumer debt, he adds,
economists counting on consumer spending to keep the
expansion going are indulging in "almost a pipe dream for the
simple reason that the increase in consumer debt has been in
a parabolic upward move."
   Some consumers are pulling back because of parabolic
increases in their personal debt. Timothy J. Lane, of Garden
Grove, Calif., went on a credit-card binge 2 1/2 years ago,
and it took him nearly two years to pay off his borrowings.
Now, the 30-year-old, unmarried engineering geologist doesn't
want to buy anything he can't pay for right away. "I don't
want to get besieged again," he says. "I have three major
credit cards, but I limit use of them as much as possible."
   Agreeing that "consumer debt expanded at an unprecedented
rate in this cycle, especially in 1985-87," Alexander P.
Paris of Barrington Research Associates believes that
probably "we'll pay for the profligacy on the installment
basis, just as the debt was incurred." The price? "Economic
growth below potential" and "higher interest rates and
inflation than would ordinarily be associated with that level
of growth."
   Many economists who aren't forecasting a recession are
hedging their optimism a bit. Commenting that "domestic final
sales are likely to show no growth," economists at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. add in a June report: "We still think the economy
can muddle through and avoid a fullfledged recession. But the
risks are clearly rising."
   And Jay N. Woodworth of Bankers Trust Co., who is
forecasting 2% growth in real GNP this year, recently told
Blue Chip subscribers: "Last fall, we couldn't see the roots
of a possible recession in 1990. Now, we can. The slowdown in
money growth, and the squeeze on the availability of credit
in the U.S., Japan, the U.K. and Canada make us very worried
about the outlook for the second half of 1990. The
deceleration in the growth of money and credit is heading
toward classic `crunch' proportions."
   A possible credit crunch is exactly what is worrying Stacy
Farmer, who runs a janitorial-services company in Atlanta and
says he has been paring his spending for two years. Although
his income has edged higher, he doesn't plan anytime soon to
replace either of his family's two cars, each of which has
racked up more than 100,000 miles. He also won't use credit
cards.
   And even some new-job holders are watching their spending.
Sanford Scheller, 32, moved to Los Angeles from Washington,
D.C., six months ago and could find only a lithographer's job
that doesn't utilize his 14 years of experience in photo
reproduction and graphics design. So, he is saving money to
study computer graphics, and frugality is the key to all his
plans.
   "The phone, the car, the roof over my head -- that's it,"
he says. "To do anything more would be frivolous. Coming to a
new area and not knowing what to expect, it's the only thing
you can do."

   When a top investment banker at Kidder, Peabody runs
around with a suitcase of $125,000 in cash from Ivan Boesky,
he has every right to feel guilty. Martin Siegel has atoned
by singing to the SEC and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani. We
worry that innocent people -- and more importantly, vital
economic institutions -- will get trampled in the rush to
clear consciences.
   -- WSJ editorial, February 1987.

   Martin Siegel, who was sentenced last week to two months
in prison, was a true inside trader. He stole information
from investment banking clients. He traded the tips to Ivan
Boesky in exchange for suitcases containing $700,000 in cash
commission. These are easily recognized crimes, but the
punishment didn't fit the crimes. Instead, prosecutors begged
the judge to go easy.
   Mr. Siegel, they said, "deserves to be rewarded
substantially" for his cooperation. Judge Robert Ward gave
him a token sentence of two months. Meanwhile, prosecutors
hope Michael Milken will receive five years or more for pleas
almost certainly coerced by the threat of RICO.
   The Siegel case ends on a rather bizarre note. It appears
we have just witnessed the extension of a reward for someone
who apparently fed only false information to prosecutors.
   Recall that Mr. Siegel's contribution to justice was
fingering the trio that came to be known on Wall Street as
the Giuliani Three -- Robert Freeman of Goldman, Sachs and
Mr. Siegel's former underlings at Kidder, Richard Wigton and
Timothy Tabor. After two years in legal limbo, all the
original charges against them were dropped.
   To be fair to Mr. Siegel, it's the prosecutors who say he
was the source for the case against Messrs. Freeman, Wigton
and Tabor. Indeed, the sentencing memorandums from Mr. Siegel
and the prosecutors suggest that the two sides are fighting
over who gets the blame for the hapless case against these
three.
   Lawyers for Mr. Siegel wrote that he "had no notice of, or
input into, the government's decision to arrest" the three.
Their memo says the "affidavit on which the arrest warrant
was based . . . contained certain misinformation seemingly
attributed to Mr. Siegel." Prosecutors disagreed. Their memo
said, "On the basis of information provided by Siegel, the
government arrested all three on complaints charging them
with participating in the information-swapping scheme."
   Whatever the details of what he said, we are prepared to
believe that prosecutors were anxious or suspicious enough
that they were happy to exaggerate Mr. Siegel's information.
   And whether the problem was Mr. Siegel's search for
information to peddle or Mr. Giuliani's own ambitions, the
prosecutors' memorandum admits that prosecutors brought the
case without checking Mr. Siegel's claims. Prosecutors said
it was only after the arrests that "errors" were corrected
when there was "an opportunity to review public record
information about the various deals." In other words, no one
bothered to check the public record before busting the
bankers. A little more care would have avoided several
charges alleging that information, which was already publicly
released, was inside information.
   Mr. Siegel no longer claims, if he ever did, that Mr.
Wigton and Mr. Tabor did anything wrong. He does still say
that he and Mr. Freeman traded inside information. We have
been skeptical, partly because prosecutors decided not to
bring Mr. Freeman to trial. Instead, Mr. Freeman reached a
controversial accommodation with prosecutors based on a
conversation about which ironically Mr. Freeman and not Mr.
Siegel was the source. Mr. Freeman pleaded to a mail fraud
count based on Mr. Siegel telling him, in reference to a
troubled takeover, "Your Bunny has a good nose."
   We are left to wonder why, if Mr. Siegel had a Boesky-like
information-swapping system with Mr. Freeman, he had to speak
in Bunny riddles. We also wonder whether prosecutors would
have insisted on a plea from Mr. Freeman if they didn't feel
they had to get something out of their indictment. Mr.
Freeman, who was never accused of conspiring with Mr. Boesky,
faces a four-month sentence.
   As we have said before, proportionality took a back seat
in many of the white-collar prosecutions in the 1980s. For a
universally recognized crime, Mr. Siegel gets about 60 days.
Meanwhile, prosecutors looking into practices for which
public officials adamantly refuse to provide bright-line
standards of behavior discovered technicalities that helped
undermine important institutions such as Drexel Burnham
Lambert and junk-bond departments up and down Wall Street.
   One purpose of law enforcement is to make clear what is
right and wrong behavior. To see, at the end of this long
saga, prosecutors arguing that a genuine inside trader
deserves the lightest sentence suggests that the law
enforcement officials themselves weren't at all clear about
the rationale for their labors.

   Equifax Agrees to Acquire Telecredit
   In Stock Swap Valued at $580 Million

   ATLANTA -- Equifax Inc., in a move to bolster its already
strong position in the information-services industry, said it
agreed in principle to acquire Telecredit Inc. in a stock
swap valued at about $580 million.
   Equifax, a major provider of credit reports and similar
information for retailers, banks and insurers, said the
transaction would be handled as a tax-free merger, in which
each share of Telecredit will be convertible to 2.69 shares
of Equifax common stock.

   Telecredit, based in Los Angeles, said a week ago that it
was talking with several companies about a possible business
combination. That news sent the company's stock soaring
earlier this week, closing as high as $53.25 a share on
Wednesday.
   Yesterday, however, Telecredit closed at $50.75 a share,
down $2.50 in heavy national over-the-counter trading.
Equifax's shares, meanwhile, dropped sharply after the
companies announced their merger plan and finished the day at
$19.50 a share, off $2.625, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
   "The market was hoping for (an acquisition price of) about
$60 a share," said Joseph A. Stieven, an analyst at Stifel,
Nicolaus &amp; Co. in St. Louis. But with Equifax trading at
$19.50 a share, each Telecredit share has an indicated value
of about $52.50.
   The planned merger was applauded by many analysts, who
said the companies would make a good fit. While Equifax,
which controls about 40% of the $1.5 billion credit-reporting
business in the U.S., evaluates risk from a distance,
Telecredit, through its primary business of guaranteeing
personal checks, places itself at the center of consumers'
financial transactions.
   Retailers and other merchants use Telecredit's check
service to verify customers' checks. If a check bounces after
Telecredit approves it, the company "purchases" the check
from the retailer. Dominating the market, Telecredit
guarantees more than $7 billion of checks annually.
   The other major part of Telecredit's business is
credit-card and debit-card processing services, mainly for
MasterCard and Visa transactions. The company's customers are
1,700 credit unions and small and medium-sized financial
institutions that don't process their own credit-card
payments.
   In the year ended April 30, 1989, Telecredit posted net
income of $24.9 million, or $2.26 a share, on revenue of
$158.7 million. For the nine months ended Jan. 31, the
company had net income of $21.9 million, or $1.98 a share, on
revenue of $129.2 million.
   "Companies like Equifax are trying to find ways to add
value to their services," said James Dougherty, an analyst at
County NatWest USA in New York. Joining Telecredit's data
base and operations with Equifax's, he added, "will give
Equifax the opportunity to sell a lot of different services."
   Mr. Dougherty estimated that costs associated with the
merger will reduce Equifax's earnings this year to between 95
cents and $1 a share, down about nine cents from his earlier
projections. In 1989, Equifax had net income of $35.7
million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $840.3 million.
   C.B. Rogers Jr., president and chief executive officer of
Equifax, said earnings dilution of nine cents is "in the
ballpark," but would be "no higher than that." In 1991, he
added, "We're hoping, with some effort, to see no dilution."
   Mr. Rogers said the companies had begun talks about two
months ago. He said he doesn't anticipate any changes in
management or any layoffs as a result of the merger.
   The proposed merger, among other conditions, is subject to
negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement between
the two companies and approval by their boards and
shareholders. Mr. Rogers said he hopes the merger can be
completed by late August.

   According to the Washington Post, Veterans Affairs
Secretary Edward Derwinski is determined to make his
bureaucrats write in language that non-bureaucrats can
understand. He even brought in a language specialist who has
collected gems of bureaucratese: a traffic light is an
"electronically adjusted, color-coded, vehicular flow-control
mechanism"; a parachute is an "individual aerial deceleration
mechanism"; a shovel is a "combat emplacement evacuator";
waves are "sea-air interface climactic disturbances." We of
course wish Sec. Derwinski luck, but we're intrigued by the
bureaucrats' amazing, almost incredible skill to conceal the
real meaning of simple nouns. As the saying goes, someone
should bottle it. A real entrenpreneur would find a way to
put this stuff in a box and sell it as a $25 party game
guaranteed to provide hours of puzzlement, laughter and
shrieks of disbelief.

   It may have seemed impossible, but Madison Avenue has
taken ad clutter to new extremes.
   Many packaged-goods advertisers are breaking conventional
marketing wisdom by running ads stuffed with pitches for two,
three, some times more than four separate products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A new commercial from Colgate-Palmolive starts with a
tired little kid marching up to the sink for a morning brush
with Colgate Junior toothpaste. Then the ad shifts to an
older kid stuffing a tube of regular Colgate into a backpack.
Cut to a shot of construction workers jackhammering the
street -- and a pitch for Colgate anti-cavity mouth rinse.
Then on to Colgate tartar control toothpaste and two types of
Colgate toothbrushes. All in 60 seconds.
   Colgate is hardly alone in its approach.
   Ralston Purina is working on a commercial that will
simultaneously pitch its Dog Chow, Puppy Chow, Hi-Pro and Fit
&amp; Trim dog foods. Johnson &amp; Johnson recently began a campaign
for its line of Tylenol products, including CoTylenol cold
medicine, Tylenol allergy medicine and children's Tylenol.
Guinness's U.S. importer just began running an ad that plugs
its Guinness Stout and Guinness Gold beers.
   Such "line campaigns" may stem in part from tighter ad
budgets, but advertisers who use them say they also
capitalize on the growing belief that the name of the company
itself -- not just its brand names -- is a powerful selling
point.
   Some advertising specialists, though, say that isn't
necessarily the case. Stuffed ads can backfire, these experts
say, because the individual brands' identities suffer, while
the more general corporate pitch may not pack as powerful a
punch with brand-conscious consumers.
   "This very well could be self-defeating," says Charlie
Moss, vice chairman at ad agency Wells, Rich, Greene in New
York. "I'm sure there are brands where this clearly wouldn't
work. There are times when consumers would be confused by a
general commercial that lumps together brands with very
conflicting images."
   Marketing gurus say past ad campaigns that have tried to
link disparate brands under a corporate umbrella have fared
poorly. A few years back, a campaign for Beatrice Cos.
linking varied brands from Stiffel lamps to Martha White
grits was met with widespread derision.
   Today, often mentioned as a disastrously confusing spot is
one by Van Munching &amp; Co. that has two pitchmen on a split
screen simultaneously talking up its Heineken and Amstel
Light beers. Not only is the ad hard to follow, skeptics say,
but also the two brands have very different targets that
can't be courted effectively in the same ad. Not so, says Bob
Fiore, at Van Munching's ad agency Warwick Baker &amp; Fiore.
"The audience is very, very similar." He adds, though, that
cost was one strong factor in deciding on the double pitch.
   Similarly, skeptics already question Ralston's planned
effort to promote four very different dog food brands in one
ad. Marketing specialists say the company is threatening to
walk away from all the time and money it has invested
developing unique personalities for each of its dog food
brands.
   "The brands are so strong on their own, I really have a
hard time understanding that one," says Jack Vogler, senior
vice president at Landor &amp; Associates, San Francisco-based
identity specialists. "It really doesn't sound like it's
going to do any one brand a whole helluva lot of good. This
is a really competitive marketplace."
   Ralston declines to comment on its new campaign. But the
ads are expected to focus on a general pitch for Ralston
brand dog food, while also briefly describing each of the
four brands.
   Some advertisers say the real power in a line campaign is
its ability to help bolster a company's corporate image while
reminding consumers of the products it makes. "We think this
is an interesting and involving way to tell American
consumers who may not be aware that Colgate has in fact this
multiplicity of products," says Ed Fogarty, president of
Colgate U.S. The new Colgate campaign replaces its "Wisdom
Tooth" ads, which featured actor Pat Morita of the "Karate
Kid" movies.
   Colgate and Johnson &amp; Johnson, though, aren't putting all
their money on the line campaigns. Both say they plan to
continue supporting individual brands with separate ads.
   A spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson's McNeil Consumer
Products unit calls the Tylenol campaign "supplemental
layover" in addition to the usual brand advertising. "We see
this as just a different approach to the everyday competitive
advertising," he says. The Tylenol effort, the first-ever
line campaign for the brand, began in April.
   Ralston says it isn't yet clear what ads, if any, it will
continue to run on its individual brands once the line
campaign starts. Ralston is expected to spend about $25
million on the line campaign.
   Colgate says it's finishing new ads for individual brands
that will be crafted in the same visual style as the line
campaign. The ads will feature the same theme song as the
line ads, but they will more prominently feature
brand-specific information, Mr. Fogarty says.
   "Our basic belief is that the umbrella commercial alone
wouldn't be enough," he says. "We did some preliminary
testing just before going on the air that was encouraging,
but the jury is out relative to whether the thing will work,"
he says.

   Hill Holliday Gets Lotus
                                                                                                       

   Lotus Development pulled its $10 million to $12 million ad
account from Scali, McCabe, Sloves and awarded it to Boston's
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos.
   Scali McCabe had won the software company's account just
last November after a review that also included Hill
Holliday. But Lotus said it moved the account because it
wanted an agency closer to its Cambridge, Mass.,
headquarters.
   In an unusual move, Lotus said two of its marketing
executives will take offices at Hill Holliday to work more
closely with the agency executives working on its account.
   "We think they {Scali} have been doing a nice job," said
Kelsey Selander, Lotus vice president of marketing
communications. "But we wanted to totally marry our internal
creative program with our agency. We wanted to work with an
agency at home."

   PERRIER ASSIGNMENT: Perrier Group of America, Greenwich,
Conn., named Young &amp; Rubicam, New York, to handle the
media-buying assignment for its imported and domestic bottled
water brands, including Perrier, Poland Spring and others.
The unit of Source Perrier S.A. said Young &amp; Rubicam will be
responsible for $24 million in media billings. Media-buying
responsibilities had been handled by a number of different
agencies.
                                                                                                       

   BILLBOARD COMPLAINT: The Coalition on Smoking or Health
dismissed the Outdoor Advertising Association of America's
new "code of advertising practices" as "one more cynical
public-relations ploy." The ad association, a trade group,
announced suggested guidelines restricting the placement of
tobacco and alcohol billboards earlier this week.
                                                                                                       

   PLAYBOY CAMPAIGN: A new trade advertising campaign for
Playboy magazine features "centerfold" pictures of some of
the magazine's biggest advertisers. One ad features a
fold-out picture of Bob Greenberg, general manager at
Panasonic. The tag line, "I've appeared in Playboy more times
than Bo Derek," refers to the many times the company has
purchased ad pages in Playboy. The campaign was created by
Kaye/Donna/Pearlstein.

   DAYTON, Ohio -- Duriron Co., a maker of pumps, valves and
filtration systems, said second-quarter earnings probably
won't meet year-earlier record profit of $5.1 million, or 43
cents a share, citing product development programs and
manufacturing upgrades. But it said net income should equal
about 39 cents a share, the average of the past five
quarters.
   For the full year, Duriron said it still expects to exceed
its 1989 record earnings of $19.7 million, or $1.58 a share.
Sales last year were $281 million. The company said incoming
business remains strong, as a result of capital spending by
customers involved in chemical processing.

   Another socialist politburo has suffered a major setback
at the polls. This time the victor is not a charismatic labor
leader or a tousle-haired playwright but rather Islamic
fundamentalists. And so the world now sits up and wonders if
Algeria is about to become another Iran.
   Algeria need not devolve in that fashion. The unexpected
success of the Islamic Salvation Front in the municipal and
provincial elections last week signifies more about the
post-colonial past than it does about some fundamentalist
future.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Arabs have a saying that "the state eats the green and
the dry." They mean that an authoritarian government consumes
everything in its path. It captures the labor unions, the
guilds, the bar and the middle classes. It allows no
bourgeois opposition and renders exiled political leaders
almost powerless by strangling their domestic support. There
is only one refuge, the church. This has been the pattern in
Algeria.
   These are the first elections the post-colonial Algerian
government has permitted. While stifling dissent, the rulers
created a rich and corrupt apparatchik class. Meanwhile, oil
wealth was squandered on huge industrial public works, farms
were collectivized, the currency inflated and the young
denied opportunity (in sum, a familiar Third World scenario).
   Inevitably, opposition to the government flocked around
Islam, as opponents to communism in Poland flocked around the
Catholic church.
   Also, the Algerian population is overwhelmingly young, and
concentrated in urban centers along the coast. Unemployment
has been as high as 22% nationwide and 50% among the urban
poor. Throughout the Islamic crescent these idle young have
been the breeding ground for fundamentalist revolution. The
half educated young urban poor are nurtured by the welfare
organization that fundamentalists sponsor.
   But one of the peculiarities of Algeria is that while the
opposition is hostile to the legacy of socialist misrule, it
is not mainly composed of radical anti-moderns. Nor do most
supporters of the opposition despise the West or their
current president, Chadli Bendjedid. Indeed, President Chadli
is credited for having begun to open up his nation's
political system, and for allowing this election. Many of
those who voted for the fundamentalists would support a
secular opposition if one existed.
   The proper course now would be to throw the political
doors wide open. The Algerian government should allow an
array of non-fundamentalist opposition parties, and reduce
the danger of an Islamic revolution. The worst course would
be measures to stifle dissent.
   Too many Western commentators develop brain lock-up when
confronted by Islamic fundamentalism. Rather than being
imprisoned by the experience of Iran, the world might better
view these election results as an Eastern European democratic
revolution stuck in an Arab context. It even comes complete
with a reassertion of ethnic, in this case Berber, identity.
If real reform continues, the election results aren't likely
to lead to an Islamic revolution, or a wave of chaos and
emigration.

   Over-the-counter stocks crawled marginally higher in the
last hour of trading after drifting most of the day.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.47 to 461.27, or
0.10%, as volume slipped slightly to 144.3 million shares
from 148.1 million Wednesday. Advancing shares beat
decliners, 963 to 916.

   Institutional investors continued to step in and buy
stocks when they fell to attractive prices, said Ralph
Costanza, head of OTC trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham.
"When they see an opportunity, they step in and buy," said
Mr. Costanza.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index opened lower and drifted 1.44
before recovering. Buying among smaller investors also is
orderly and cautious, he said. Small investors appear to be
buying shares of companies researched by brokerage firms
rather than chasing after speculative stories, according to
Mr. Costanza.
   Subaru of America was the day's most active issue, mainly
because Cantor Fitzgerald traded two blocks of more than 2
million shares each for buyers and sellers.
   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan is in a pact to buy
the 50.4% of Subaru it doesn't already own. Subaru rose 1/16
to 8 1/4 on 5.8 million shares.
   Telecredit tumbled 2 1/2 to 50 3/4 after the Los Angeles
provider of payment services said it agreed to be acquired by
Equifax, an Atlanta business-services concern. The agreement
calls for a stock swap valued at about $580 million. An
arbitrager at one large New York brokerage said the stock
stumbled because some investors think the proposed
combination may attract antitrust scrutiny. He added some
speculators had hoped Telecredit would be acquired in cash by
a larger, international finance or data-processing firm.
   MCI Communications, the day's second-most active stock,
continued to drift, slipping 5/8 to 41 on 3.5 million shares.
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette telecommunications analyst Joel
Gross said in an interview that shares of the Washington,
D.C., long-distance carrier reacted to a new American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph tariff regulation that gives AT&amp;T more
flexibility in competitive pricing. The regulation became
effective by default after the Federal Communications
Commission failed to act on the proposed tariff within a
mandated time. However, Mr. Gross said he expects federal
regulators to eventually rule against the new regulation.
   MCI shares also have been pressured by the pending release
of FCC market-share data, which may show AT&amp;T's market share
rising a bit. Mr. Gross added, however, that when the data is
revised it will show that AT&amp;T's market share is continuing
to decline. He continues to rate MCI a "buy."
   Apple Computer added 1 7/8 to 41 7/8 on more than 1.9
million shares, leading the technology group. Shares of the
Cupertino, Calif., computer maker apparently got a boost from
a market survey showing that the dollar value of the
company's sales in May rose 50% from the year-earlier level
and that its share of the domestic personal-computer market
rose in May from a year earlier, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Westmark International leaped 2 1/2 to 39 1/2 after the
Seattle medical-equipment maker said late Wednesday that
earnings for the second quarter ending June 30 will fall at
the low end of an estimated range of 45 to 50 cents a share,
up from 39 cents a share a year earlier. The stock recently
had weakened amid some analysts' concerns the earnings
wouldn't meet that range.
   Henley Properties added 3/4 to 6 3/4 after the Hampton,
N.H., real estate development company said it expects net
income for the second quarter ending June 30 to be about $80
million, up from $4.8 million on a pro forma basis a year
earlier. Henley also said it will sell its interests in two
trash-to-energy facilities for $10 million to Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc. That will enable Henley to reverse about
$100 million of deferred income currently included as a
liability on its financial statements and increase
shareholders' equity by that amount, the company added.
   LDDS Communications jumped 2 3/4 to 24, a new 52-week
high, apparently after Prudential-Bache analyst Charles
Nichols initiated coverage of the Jackson, Miss., provider of
long-distance telecommunications services with a "buy"
opinion, DJPIR reported.
   General Binding lost 2 1/2 to 18 1/2 after the Northbrook,
Ill., maker of business machines and supplies said it expects
second-quarter earnings will fall to 30 or 31 cents a share
from 35 cents a year earlier because of weaker markets and
higher expenses. That's below analysts' expectations of 38
cents a share.
   National Media slid 1/2 to 10 1/4 after the Philadelphia
provider of direct-marketing services reported fourth quarter
net income of 58 cents a share compared with a loss of six
cents a year earlier, adjusted for a 5% stock dividend paid
at year end. National Media also said it's "actively
investigating" the acquisition of telemarketing and "direct
response" companies.
   Drexler Technology skidded 1 15/16 to 1 5/16 after the
Mountain View, Calif., maker of optical data products said
late Wednesday that it's been unsuccessful in selling its
future license royalty payments and part of a full ownership
in its optical memory card manufacturing operation.
   Consequently, the company said its accountants expect to
issue a qualified financial report on the company for the
year ended March 31. Drexler said its cash is adequate to
fund operations for eight weeks without cash infusions of any
kind and it plans to cut executive salaries and furlough some
employees.
   Earth Technology dropped 1 to 7 5/8 after the
environmental consulting services company said fourth-quarter
earnings could be hurt if a weak backlog for its asbestos
consulting and laboratory services persists because of
project delays. The company also reported net income for the
third quarter ended May 25 of six cents a share, up from one
cent a year earlier.

   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Tandy Brands Inc. said it will spin
off one of its units early next year, creating a new,
publicly traded company under the name Tandy Brands
Accessories Inc.
   The specialty retailer said stockholders will receive one
share of Tandy Brands Accessories for each five shares of
Tandy Brands held, to be distributed "as soon as practicable"
after Dec. 31, 1990. The company said it has received a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the new shares
will not constitute taxable income.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Carson R. Thompson, Tandy Brands chairman and chief
executive, said the spinoff will provide more focused
management for two distinct businesses, as well as provide
shareholders with more clearly defined investment vehicles.
Tandy Brands Accessories, for example, makes and sells men's
and boys' leather accessories and neckwear, whereas Tandy
Brands Inc. will continue operating Bombay Co., a chain of
270 stores selling specialty furniture and home accessories.
   The Tandy Brands Accessories unit is expected to finish
the current fiscal year June 30 with about $25 million in
revenue, down from last year's $26 million, according to Mr.
Thompson. The Bombay division, however, is projected to have
revenue of $112 million, compared with $83 million in the
last fiscal year.
   After the spinoff, shareholders of Tandy Brands Inc. will
be asked to approve a name change to The Bombay Company Inc.
The company will then include a new unit, Alex &amp; Ivy, which
is scheduled to begin operations in September as a retailer
of European country-style home furnishings. Mr. Thompson will
continue as chairman and chief executive; the Tandy Brands
board also has named Robert E.M. Nourse president and chief
operating officer and has elected him to the board, expanding
the board to nine directors.
   The board also named J.S.B. Jenkins president and chief
executive of Tandy Brands Accessories, and Stanley T.
Ninemire vice president and chief financial officer.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Those `Darned' Sox Are Winning at Last

   Chicago -- There are, as everyone knows, levels of
happiness, and fans of the baseball Chicago White Sox have
been on the "up" escalator of late. At least until this week
their team has been winning, which makes them happy, and the
Chicago Cubs -- those hated North Siders -- have been losing,
which makes them happier.
   And right across 35th Street from Comiskey Park, the Sox's
superannuated home, a handsome new Comiskey Park is rising,
its concrete facing tinted a stylish, uh, pink-beige. It's
scheduled to be ready for opening day 1991, at which time it
will be the newest domicile of any major Chicago professional
sports team by 62 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "My idea of a perfect day is when the Sox win and the Cubs
lose, and we've had a lot of those this season," beamed beefy
Bill Lundeberg, a steel-warehouse superintendent from
Schaumburg, Ill., before the young White Sox -- the young,
second-place White Sox] -- played the California Angels in
old Comiskey on Tuesday night.
   He added: "I won't say I hate the Cubs, because that would
imply I pay attention to them. But I'll say this: This year
we've got the better team, and next year we'll also have the
better park. Can't get much better than two out of two."
   If Mr. L's remarks bespeak a lack of charity, let it be
recalled that a couple of seasons ago White Sox fans weren't
sure they'd have either a ballpark or a ballteam. Comiskey
Park, old but not charming like the cross-town shrine of
Wrigley Field, was crumbling beneath them, and their heroes
were off buying flowered shirts and suntan oil in preparation
for a one-way trip to St. Petersburg, Fla., where
entertainment-starved retirees and a home under a dome
beckoned.
   But the St. Pete threat blew away the political fog that
had hung over the Sox's new-stadium plans for years, and the
Illinois legislature finally agreed to let the taxpayers
spring for the thing, which is the way it's done these days.
Even more remarkably, construction got under way last May,
more or less on time, and it's stayed that way.
   The new park will accommodate 43,000 and is being built
for baseball. That means seats will face home plate instead
of the 50-yard line, and many ticket buyers will be close
enough to the field to see the game. And it won't have the
several dozen roof posts that block the view of all save the
people who sit in the first 20 rows of the present park's
main stand, or in the first eight rows of the upper deck.
   But getting a new stadium okayed and seeing it go up has
been no less startling hereabouts than the performance of the
1990 Sox. With an attendance-cutting resurfacing project on
the adjacent Dan Ryan Expressway just completed, and the new
stadium expropriating much of the nearby parking space, the
team's owners decided a few years back to launch a youth
movement, or, in other words, play on the cheap.
   Jettisoned were such high-salaried vets as pitchers Floyd
Bannister and Rich Dotson and designated-hitter Harold
Baines, traded for younger, friskier and less-demanding types
while an expanded farm system groans into production. Last
year's Sox players' payroll ranked a reported 25th among the
26 big-league teams, and this year's won't be much higher.
The upshot was a 90-loss 1988 season, and a 92-losser last
year. "Mirabile dictu", some of the kids the Sox picked up
could play. And the manner in which they were acquired
suggests a nickname for the current crew, comparable to the
slick "Go-Go" White Sox of the 1950s, the slugging "Hit-Men"
of Bill Veeck's 1977 rent-a-player year, and the "Winning
Ugly" bunch that won the 1983 American League West by 20
games. Call these guys the "Darned" Sox.
   "We patched together a team to save a sinking ship," says
Larry Himes, the ex-California Angels scout who took over the
team's general managership in October 1986. "Our goal was to
become respectable until we could develop our own players,
but it's turning out quite a bit better."
   Indeed, before last Friday the Sox's won-lost record of
36-20 was baseball's third best, behind only Oakland's and
Cincinnati's, and even five losses in seven games with the
Angels and the redoubtable A's through Wednesday didn't
disturb their second spot in the division. Last year, they
didn't win their 38th game until July 19.
   One of the trades that turned the Sox sent Bannister to
Kansas City in 1987 for young pitchers Melido Perez and Greg
Hibbard. Both are starters on a Chicago staff whose earned
run average trails only Oakland's in the league. Sox manager
Jeff Torborg, also a Himes hire, gives Carlton Fisk, his
19-year-veteran catcher, much of the credit for that
achievement. "When Carlton puts down a sign, the kids believe
it," says Torborg.
   The other key deal was a much-maligned 1989 swap that
brought in second-baseman Scott Fletcher, outfielder Sammy
Sosa and a minor-league pitcher from Texas for the beloved
but sore-kneed Baines and another player. Fletcher, 31, has
helped anchor a much-improved Sox infield, and the
21-year-old Sosa, a fleet, muscular outfielder, will be a
star once he learns to do things like touch second base
before rounding it and returning to first after a teammate's
fly out. He neglected to do that Tuesday, and was thrown out.
   The bespectacled Torborg is reputed to be patient about
such miscues, which was one of the reasons he got his job. "I
want our kids to dare to fail," he declares. "I've let 'em
know that nobody's going to jump down their throats every
time they make a mistake. And if they do something right,
they get positive reinforcement."
   They sometimes get PR even if they don't do things right.
After Robin Ventura, a promising rookie whom Himes calls "our
third baseman for the '90s" went through a 0-for-41 hitting
slump, he was moved up to second in the batting order. He's
batted .295 since.
   "We're still experimenting -- trying things -- and we'll
have our downs before the season is through," says Torborg.
"But I think we're past the point of just keeping our fingers
crossed."

   WASHINGTON -- The government nudged up its estimate of
first-quarter economic growth to a 1.9% annual rate from the
1.3% pace it previously reported.
   The revision was primarily due to new information that
showed export growth was far stronger than was estimated in a
report issued last month. The surge in exports was partly
offset, however, by consumer spending that was found to be
weaker than the previous report said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Net exports of goods and services rose at an annual rate
of 12.8% in the first quarter, compared with an earlier
projection of 7.7% growth. That was offset by a downward
revision in personal consumption, which grew at a pace of
only 1.6% in the first quarter, rather than 2.4% as projected
in last month's report.
   Although the increase in the nation's real gross national
product -- the inflation-adjusted value of all the goods and
services produced -- was larger than the fourth quarter's
1.1% rate, some economists said they were disappointed by the
latest figures.
   "On the surface this report shows a strong {export}
performance, but it really masks the weakness that is present
in the consumer sector," said Roger Brinner, chief economist
for Data Resources Inc., in Lexington, Mass. "What is
important is not only the rate of growth, but also the
composition of growth."
   The Commerce Department report said that after-tax
corporate profits also edged up more than previously
estimated, growing 1.1% in the first quarter to an annual
rate of $158.5 billion. The revision is a clear improvement
over the previous estimate of 0.2%, but is a drastic slowdown
from the fourth quarter increase of 2.8%, the department
said.
   Profits from current production rose 1.3% in the first
quarter, exceeding the government's earlier estimate of 0.7%.
This increase followed three quarters in which profits from
current production fell.
   According to yesterday's report, net corporate cash flow
fell 1.8% in the first quarter, far less than the 2.3%
decline previously estimated by the government.
   All the numbers are adjusted for predictable seasonal
variations.

   Securities Firms Oppose SEC Bid to Give
   Investors More Flexibility on Arbitration

   NEW YORK -- Wall Street has a message for Washington:
Leave arbitration alone.
   In a letter to the nation's stock exchanges, securities
executives strongly objected to a recent request by the
Securities and Exchange Commission to give investors more
flexibility in bringing arbitration cases against their
brokers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SEC is urging Wall Street securities firms to give
investors the option of bringing disputes with brokers to
independent arbitration forums, rather than limiting them to
industry-subsidized arbitration panels.
   Wall Street's position, given in a letter by the
Securities Industry Association, is sure to anger some
investors and fuel the controversy over whether arbitration
stacks the deck against the little guy. The SEC says that
giving investors flexibility would help allay investor
concerns of unfairness -- allegations long denied by the
securities industry.
   "The industry is wrong here," says David Robbins, a former
arbitration director at the American Stock Exchange who
currently works for a New York law firm. "It's bad enough
that access to court is foreclosed, let alone a forum with no
allegiance to the securities industry."
   Many investors sign a standard agreement when they open an
account that binds them to go to arbitration, instead of
court, in the event of a dispute with their broker.
Currently, most investors are required by their agreements to
take their cases to industry-sponsored forums -- particularly
the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New
York Stock Exchange. These panels are typically made up of
three arbitrators, including one securities executive and
sometimes others with ties to Wall Street.
   The SIA contends that the SEC lacks jurisdiction over
arbitration panels that aren't sponsored by the securities
industry. Moreover, the SIA says a 1987 Supreme Court
decision -- which held that securities firms could compel
investors to take disputes to arbitration -- might make cases
decided by independent panels unenforceable.
   Besides, the SIA says, the cost to Wall Street for just
changing its brokerage-account forms would approach $4
million.
   What about the perception that the industry's position
crimps the small investor?
   Industry-sponsored arbitration panels "generally produce
good results," argues John T. Shinkle, chairman of the SIA's
federal regulation committee and general counsel at Salomon
Brothers Inc., who cosigned the SIA letter. "There's no
reason to question that."
   Investors win about half the time at exchange-sponsored
arbitration forums. That compares with about 60% at the
American Arbitration Association -- the major independent
forum that is privately funded and widely perceived to be the
most sympathetic to investors.
   The SIA has long encouraged its 600 member firms to
consider using the AAA in customer agreements with
arbitration clauses. But many Wall Street firms still balk.
   For its part, the SEC declined to comment on the
industry's position because it hadn't seen the letter. The
agency only wants to make arbitration "as fair and efficient
as possible," says Mark Fitterman, associate director of the
SEC's division of market regulation.

   Australian Brewer Faces Write-Downs
   That Could Wipe Out Earnings for Year
   ----

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Massive write-downs on investments
are expected to wipe out the earnings of Elders IXL Ltd. in
the fiscal year ending this month. They could even force the
giant Australian brewing conglomerate to post hefty losses.
   Furthermore, some analysts believe Elders may have to trim
its annual dividend, which would tighten the financial noose
around the company's cash-strapped controlling shareholder,
Harlin Holdings Pty., a closely held concern associated with
John Elliott, chairman of Elders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Estimates of the write-downs vary widely, but one thing is
clear, according to Craig Drummond, an analyst at the
Melbourne brokerage firm of J.B. Were &amp; Son: There "isn't a
lot left" in terms of earnings for the year ending June 30.
   In their projections, analysts see write-downs ranging
anywhere from 500 million Australian dollars (US$391.6
million) to nearly A$1 billion. According to these estimates,
Elders at best would report no profit for the fiscal year,
after deducting taxes and extraordinary and so-called
abnormal losses. The worst scenario would be a loss of about
A$500 million. In the previous year, Elders earned A$653
million, after tax and abnormal gains.
   An Elders spokesman said company policy is not to comment
on "analysts' speculation." He also declined to discuss the
prospects of a dividend cut, saying that "dividends aren't
finalized." Elders expects to report its unaudited annual
results in September and audited accounts in October, the
spokesman said.
   However, a source close to Elders said Peter Bartels, the
recently named chief executive who is taking over day-to-day
management from Mr. Elliott, favors "taking the write-downs
all at once and ending up with a clean sheet" for
still-to-be-created Foster's Brewing Group Ltd. Foster's
Brewing Group, after a restructuring of Elders, would hold
the company's far-flung brewing interests, which now rank as
the fourth largest in the world.
   Prolonged high interest rates in Australia are undermining
asset values. That, coupled with a spate of corporate
problems partly unleashed by tight credit, is putting
pressure on company auditors to get tough with investment
valuations.
   In the first half ended Dec. 31, Elders wrote off A$123
million, partly resulting from its investment in a
stockbroking unit, against after-tax operating profit of
A$286.9 million. Several analysts forecast that Elders's
operating profit in the second half will be about A$200
million. But unless the company meets with quick success in
its campaign to sell assets, analysts expect to see hefty
write-downs on investments such as a 43% interest in Elders
Resources NZFP Ltd., which has interests in coal, gold, oil
and forest products, mainly in New Zealand.
   In March, Elders announced a major restructuring that
effectively calls for the dismantling of the conglomerate
that Mr. Elliott built from a jam maker. Now best known for
its Foster's beer, Elders is the biggest brewer in Australia
and an important brewer in Britain through its Courage Ltd.
unit, and in Canada through a joint venture with Molson Cos.
   The restructuring also calls for many of the company's
assets in agribusiness, natural resources and finance to be
sold. But divestitures have come slowly and bank lenders to
both Harlin and Elders have grown more nervous. Moreover, the
lack of high offers raises questions about the value
currently assigned to the assets on Elders's books.
   Elders had planned to raise about A$2.2 billion, or A$1 a
share, from asset sales, distributing the proceeds to
shareholders. The move was designed to relieve some of the
financial pressure on Harlin, which controls about 55% of
Elders. The first capital repayment of 50 Australian cents a
share to holders was to have been made about now and the
second in early 1991.
   But Elders announced earlier this month that it intends to
defer the payout while it restructures its debt. Elders
currently has financial arrangements with more than 100
international banks; it is trying to pare down that number
and also soothe some jittery banks by increasing their
security for certain loans. Some analysts say bank lenders
are taking a stricter line with Elders management and want to
have more say over capital outflows, such as the proposed
shareholder payout and the company's dividend payments.
   In the previous fiscal year, Elders paid an annual
dividend of 20.5 Australian cents a share. The company
already has paid a half-year dividend of 8.5 cents a share;
to maintain last year's level, adjusted for a bonus issue, it
would have to make the full-year payout at least 17 cents a
share.
   "If people are looking for 17 cents to 18 cents a share, I
think they'll be disappointed," said Viktor Shvets, an
analyst at Baring Securities (Australia) Ltd.

   Pros Put Chips on Extended Run-Up in Semiconductors

   NEW YORK -- Buying stocks that have already moved up
vigorously may sound like a dumb strategy. But in the case of
semiconductor stocks this year, it could be a bright idea.
   Semiconductor companies have been among the market's
strongest industry groups so far this year, soaring 24%.
Nevertheless, investment pros who follow the industry closely
say the advance still has a long way to run.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To an extent, semiconductor companies are rising with the
computer industry, whose stocks are emerging from an
unsettling slump. But people buying more computers is only
part of the story. The computer makers are packing their
"boxes" with more microchips than in the past. And to enhance
performance, they are using fancier microchips that cost
more.
   This trend gives the semiconductor industry three ways to
win: more boxes, more chips per box and more dollars per
chip. Because computers account for nearly half of all
semiconductor use, it adds up to a powerful case for the
bulls.
   Other uses for microchips are diverse, and several of them
are growing. They include industrial-process control
equipment, military electronics, car dashboard displays,
consumer electronics products, and medical devices such as
hearing aids and pacemakers.
   Joan Lappen, head of Gramercy Capital in New York, sees
semiconductors as a long-term growth area. "More
user-friendly computers depend on the development of more
sophisticated semiconductor chips," she says, "with ever more
processing capabilities stuffed into ever-smaller packages."
   To be sure, the stocks aren't cheap. Motorola sells for
about 23 times the past 12 months' per-share earnings. The
multiple is 20 for Intel, 19 for Advanced Micro Devices, and
18 for Texas Instruments. (National Semiconductor has posted
losses during the period, so its multiple can't be
calculated.)
   But analysts such as James L. Barlage of Smith Barney say
the multiples are reasonable because the industry's current
upswing is still in its early stages. Using estimated 1990
earnings, Mr. Barlage says, semiconductor multiples are about
typical of most stocks. Based on 1991 estimates, they trade
at a discount to the rest of the market. "I think we're about
a year into a bull market {for semiconductor stocks} that
will ultimately last three to five years," he says.
   This year will be only so-so, analysts figure. Most expect
sales to be flat or perhaps 5% higher. Patricia Cox, who
follows semiconductor trends for Dataquest Inc. in San Jose,
Calif., thinks 1990 sales will decline about 3.5%, mainly
because of weak prices for memory chips.
   But 1991 and 1992 look like solid years. Ms. Cox projects
sales growth of 16% in 1991 (about equal to the industry's
long-term trend), 21% in 1992 and 27% in 1993, which she
figures will be the cycle's peak year.
   "I think there's plenty more to go" in the semiconductor
rally, says Jill Hauser, who follows the group for the T.
Rowe Price Associates family of mutual funds. "They were
ultra-depressed to start with." She suggests investors take a
toehold now and increase their holdings during the industry's
traditional summer doldrums.
   "Individuals have to be pretty brave to buy these stocks,"
which are notoriously volatile, she says. "I think you tread
into the water now" by doing some initial buying. "You look
for that break in the summer to buy more and average down."
But she wouldn't wait until autumn because the stocks "move
so quickly."
   In its mutual funds, T. Rowe Price holds Applied
Materials, Chips &amp; Technologies, Linear Technology, Cypress
Semiconductor and Altera, among others. Applied Materials
makes equipment used to manufacture chips. It gets more than
50% of its business overseas, the bulk of it in Japan, and
the stock sells for a moderate 13 times the past 12 months'
per-share earnings.
   Linear Technology and Altera are smaller companies with
specialized niches. Linear has a strong balance sheet, and
its growth has re-accelerated after a slow period, Ms. Hauser
notes. Altera is one of a group of what the industry calls
"fab-less" companies, the ones that don't own their own
production facilities. It designs programmable chips that can
be modified by the user.
   Thomas Kurlak, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, is
encouraged because "orders in May broke out of a trend
they've been in for two years." For the 22 months through
April, he says, orders ranged from $1.1 billion to $1.3
billion. May orders were $1.38 billion.
   He favors Intel and Motorola. Intel is riding high because
it makes a specialized chip used in personal computers that
are IBM-compatible. Motorola trades more on its cellular
telephone operations than its semiconductor manufacturing,
but Mr. Kurlak likes both businesses.
   Smith Barney's Mr. Barlage also likes Intel. Its "revenues
and earnings are being driven very strongly by the transition
from 16-bit to 32-bit products," he says. A year ago, only
about 15% of new personal computers used 32-bit
microprocessors, but Mr. Barlage thinks the figure will rise
to 30% by year end and nearly 70% by the end of 1991.
   Mr. Barlage also recommends Anthem Electronics, which
distributes specialized chips made by a number of small
manufacturers, and Altera.
   Jeffrey Landle, a portfolio manager with
Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers, is another Intel fan. He
predicts Intel will earn $3 a share this year and $3.70 a
share next year, compared with $2.25 a share in 1989. The
Stovall firm runs a mutual fund in which each buy is paired
off with a short sale (a bet that a stock will decline) in
the same industry. In that fund, National Semiconductor is
the current short sale.
   "It has a broad range of products, but not a huge market
for any of them," says Mr. Landle. He expects National
Semiconductor to have earnings of around 35 cents a share in
the fiscal year that began this month, in contrast to a loss
in the fiscal year just ended. But he says, "A large part of
{the} improvements have come not from new products but from
cost-cutting."
   A National Semiconductor spokeswoman said operating losses
narrowed sharply in fiscal 1990, to less than $45 million
from $187 million the year before. She noted that the company
had record sales, and said, "You don't post record sales
without producing something that people want." She said the
company dominates some major markets, such as linear (analog)
chips and components used in local area networks that link
computers and workstations.

   Classic Planes on the Block
   ----

   Santa Monica, Calif. -- At a recent auction of classic
aircraft here, I climbed onto the wing of a Curtiss P-40K
Warhawk to check out the cockpit. My pulse was racing, but
not from the climb. As a schoolboy during World War II, I'd
thrilled to newsreel footage of P-40 Flying Tigers shooting
down Japanese Zeros, doodled P-40s in class, even built a
solid -- i.e. non-flying -- model of a P-40, with a tiny
celluloid canopy and, pasted on either side of the nose,
red-and-white decals of the Flying Tigers' fearsome
dentition.
   This P-40 was flyable, as well as buyable by any bidder
with an itch to own a 47-year-old warplane that looked as if
it had just rolled out of the factory. The propeller-driven
fighter had been found in the Aleutian Islands in 1974 --
"the pilot's body was intact," a fact sheet noted -- and
restored to apparent perfection, right down to the rear-view
mirror above the canopy and the rudimentary gun sight, with
which the pilot -- still intact, for all I know, but not
included -- aimed the airplane to aim the guns.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As I jumped from the wing back down to the ground, a young
woman who had been admiring the P-40 smiled and said hello.
She was Japanese, perhaps in her mid-20s, and, according to
her press badge, a writer for a Japanese aviation magazine.
"Excuse me," she said in careful English. "Do you know why
those small Japanese flags are there?" Her eyes went first to
six little rising suns stenciled on the fuselage below the
cockpit, then to my face, which must have revealed my
astonishment. "Each one," I answered very carefully,
"represents one airplane . . . uh . . . shot down."
   "Shot down," she repeated slowly. "Shot . . . down. Oh, I
see. Thank you very much."
   A sense of history wasn't obligatory at the auction, but
it helped. And not just military history -- though that was
evoked by such works of martial art as a British Spitfire and
a twin-engined, twin-tailed Lockheed P-38 Lightning -- but
the history of aviation, which has produced some of the most
beautiful mechanical objects since the Industrial Revolution.
   A sense of wonder helped too, in the face of time-warping
treasures such as a gorgeous two-seater 1938 Curtiss Falcon
(serial No. 1) with red leather upholstery and intricate
patterns of riveted stitchery on dazzlingly polished aluminum
skin; a 1941 Ryan trainer, with sculptured wheel pants and a
birch-and-maple propeller; a 1918 Curtiss Jenny biplane, its
canvas wings held together by wire and hope; and a pristine
red-and-white Fairchild 24, first owned in 1939 by Mary
Pickford and Buddy Rogers and hardly flown since.
   The auction, organized for the benefit of Santa Monica's
superb new Museum of Flight, was the brainchild of David
Price, a 57-year-old industrialist and pilot who also doodled
warbirds as a kid in school, and who grew up half a block
from the airport, which was then called Clover Field (after a
World War I hero named Clover; so much for bucolic
resonances). Recently Mr. Price built the Supermarine
complex, a huge aviation service facility at the airport that
houses the museum plus a chic restaurant called DC-3. (Clover
Field was the home of Douglas Aircraft during the war.)
   "So far David has been carrying this museum," said Donald
Douglas Jr., who attended the auction. "Now we've gotta get
it off his back."
   The two-day affair, which moved more than $7 million of
airplanes and memorabilia, went a long way toward relieving
Mr. Price's back strain; by every reasonable measure,
including fun, it was a resounding success. Fun may have been
the most sensible measure for many buyers. Jim Mills, an
Indiana aircraft-engine installer who bought Mary Pickford's
Fairchild for $40,000 (a record price for the model and also
a steal) extolled the pleasures of flying slow, rolling down
the window and sticking your elbow out into the slipstream.
"That's all these things are any good for anyway, havin' a
good time with."
   Flying slow sounded equally good to Morgan Merrill, an
entrepreneur who lives in Aspen, Colo. He lusted after the
Jenny, which sold to someone else for $175,000, even though
he loves flying his own British-made, fire-engine red Folland
Gnat, a modern-day supersonic jet trainer, at speeds up to
Mach 1.3.
   Fun for other people at the auction involved the calmer
pursuits of connoisseurship and stewardship. Delford Smith,
chairman of the board of Evergreen International, a large
aviation holding company, bought the P-40 for $750,000; a
DC3-built in 1936, and the oldest still flying -- for
$165,000; and a Corsair fighter, with inverted gull wings,
for a record $750,000. (Corsairs are comers in this market.)
Then, prompted by associates and advisers who knew of his
love for bare-metal airplanes, he bid on the glittering
Falcon and got it, for $335,000.
   "We believe in preserving this heritage," said Mr. Smith,
who plans to find homes for his new acquisitions in various
museums. He also urged the Falcon's former owner, Richard
Durand, to call him any time he wanted to visit the airplane,
or even to use it. The gesture was appreciated by Mr. Durand,
who runs an aviation service company in Albuquerque, N.M.,
and who had sold because of what he called a "pretty rough
business climate for us now." But it didn't make the parting
any less sorrowful. "Don't leave it out in the rain," Mr.
Durand told Mr. Smith on the flight line, while his wife
fought back tears.
   The high point of the auction was the sale of the P-38
Lightning, one of six still flying throughout the world. For
one thing, this illustrious airplane, newly painted in attack
black, had been bought and restored by the Museum of Flight,
and was the museum's main chance for earning big bucks. Most
importantly, the Lightning seemed an irresistible symbol of
this country's sovereignty and creativity at a time when
foreign competition has been calling both into serious
question.
   When the bidding began, the crowd rooted for William Lyon,
a 67-year-old retired Air Force general who'd made his
fortune in real estate and airlines, and against an
unidentified rival, represented, via telephone hookup, by
City National Bank of Los Angeles. The rival might have been
from St. Louis or Staten Island, but was instantly assumed to
be Japanese, so the crowd cheered when the bidding finally
ended with Mr. Lyon taking the trophy for a record $1.55
million. They cheered for the general, for the museum and for
the nation, which had brought the Lightning into this world
in 1939 and could now, by God, hang onto it.

   Moody's Puts Ratings of 4 Defense Firms
   Under Review for Possible Downgrades

   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it put four big
defense contractors under review for possible downgrades of
its ratings on a total of about $5.9 billion of debt,
continuing the rating concern's examination of that
industrial sector.
   The debt ratings under scrutiny are those for Litton
Industries Inc., with about $1.5 billion in long-term debt;
Lockheed Corp., also with about $1.4 billion in long-term
debt; McDonnell Douglas Corp. and its financial unit, with a
total of about $3 billion in long-term debt; and Raytheon
Co., with about $43 million in long-term debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moody's said the analysis reflects deteriorating business
prospects for defense contractors. It plans a three-step
review of the industry, said Alfred Pastore, associate
director at Moody's.
   "What we are doing is first looking at the fellows who
make the airplanes and ships, the big-ticket items that are
likely to be affected early on," Mr. Pastore said. Next, he
said, will be a review of electronics and avionics makers,
and finally, a look at major satellite and space systems
makers.
   Moody's plans to study the outlook for specific defense
programs and then consider their effects on individual
companies. Mr. Pastore said the effects of program cuts
aren't expected to be as immediate on electronics and
avionics makers -- or as easily identified.
   Investors yesterday were rocked by one company's woes. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
McDonnell shares fell $3.75, or 9.5%, to close at $35.75,
after the company on Wednesday announced a retrenchment plan
designed to save $700 million annually in operating expenses.
It is believed that this plan, which was prompted both by
military and civilian products at McDonnell, will lead to the
layoffs of thousands of employees.
   Moody's said the ratings under review are:
   -- Litton's senior debt, rated Baa-1; subordinated debt,
Baa-2; and commercial paper, prime-2.
   -- Lockheed's senior debt, single-A-3; and commercial
paper, prime-2.
   -- McDonnell Douglas's senior debt, Baa-1, and a similar
prospective rating on a shelf registration; subordinated
debt, Baa-2; and commercial paper, prime-2. Also under review
are the McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp. unit's senior debt,
single-A-2, and the same prospective rating on a shelf
registration; subordinated debt, single-A-3; and commercial
paper, prime-1.
   -- Raytheon's senior debt, double-A-2. Moody's said its
prime-1 rating on Raytheon's commercial paper isn't under
review.
   In Beverly Hills, Calif., a spokesman for Litton said that
the company was "highly surprised" by the Moody's
announcement, and that "this is obviously a top-down order to
look at the industry." He added, "We believe that, once they
{Moody's} begin to look at single companies, we will be
swiftly eliminated from the list."
   In Calabasas, Calif., a spokesman for Lockheed said the
company "knows of no basis" for Moody's credit reappraisal.
"On the basis of the current defense budget outlook,
management does not believe that a budget decline will
adversely affect the company's credit quality," he said.
   In St. Louis, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas said the
company is "unique among defense companies," in that it has a
large but currently unprofitable civilian business making
airliners.
   In Lexington, Mass., a spokesman for Raytheon noted that
the company "has the highest current rating of any company"
cited among the four by Moody's for review. He said Raytheon
has "relatively little long-term debt" of about $43 million,
compared with shareholders' equity of $2.5 billion.
   In Big Board trading yesterday, Litton shares closed at
$75.125, down 50 cents; Lockheed shares closed at $35.25,
down 25 cents; and Raytheon shares closed at $64.50, down 25
cents.
   On Wednesday, Moody's downgraded about $670 million of
General Dynamics Corp. debt, citing the slowdown in military
spending and potential major cost overruns on a Navy aircraft
contract. This two-notch downgrade on ratings of General
Dymanics long-term and subordinated debt followed one-notch
reductions earlier this year on securities of McDonnell and
Grumman Corp.

   World Markets:
   Budapest Opens a Regulated Stock Exchange
   Amid Fanfare, Much Hope and Many Hurdles

   BUDAPEST -- In the baroque Budapest Bank building in
Vorosmarty Square, the first stock exchange in post-communist
Eastern Europe opened yesterday.
   Workmen furiously put up gilded brass chandeliers, buffed
shiny marble columns, and completed the elegant effect with
luxurious, deep brown wood paneling.

   Though a struggling securities market has been operating
here for the past seven years, the Budapest Stock Exchange is
Eastern Europe's first regulated stock market. The exchange's
founders thought that the occasion warranted a lavish
ceremony, so 700 of the world's leading bankers and market
makers, including U.S. Securities and Exchange Chairman
Richard Breeden and American Stock Exchange Chairman James
Jones, were invited for a gala lunch and dinner.
   The inauguration of a proper stock exchange marks a
critical turning point in Hungary's rush toward capitalism.
Budapest's new, non-communist government says it hopes to use
the exchange to privatize much of the country's state-owned
industry and to attract foreign investment. Foreigners will
be allowed to buy shares and take profits out of the country
in convertible currencies. American brokerage firms are
preparing to open offices in Budapest.
   But many obstacles must be overcome before the exchange
becomes a serious place to do business. Only a couple of
stocks were ready for listing on opening day -- and Ilona
Hardy, the banker in charge of the Hungarian Securities
Exchange Committee, concedes there will only be about a dozen
equities quoted by the year end.
   The market's long-term future depends on how vigorously
the center-right Hungarian government, which won the
country's first free elections in more than four decades in
March, decides to pursue privatization. So far, the
government has offered only vague verbal support for selling
off state companies. The lack of concrete action leaves many
observers doubting the political will to begin listing many
companies on the exchange.
   "The opening of the new stock market is only a symbol,"
complains Zsigmond Jarai. Mr. Jarai resigned as deputy
finance minister this spring and has taken a job starting in
September with the London firm of James Capel &amp; Co. He fears
that the non-communist rulers will not prove any more
determined than the communists in risking large-scale layoffs
by selling state assets. "To really develop a market, we need
a supply of equities," he says. "That means rapid
privatization. But letting companies operate on an efficient
basis also means large-scale layoffs."
   The 38-year-old Mr. Jarai knows from experience the
daunting difficulties of establishing a capital market. In
1983, as a technocrat whiz kid at the Budapest Bank, he set
up the Soviet bloc's first bond market. On ideological
grounds, Hungary's then-ruling communists vetoed stock
trading because that meant selling equity in the people's
property. Bonds were given the go-ahead because Mr. Jarai
managed to convince the communists that they only represented
a loan.
   The bond market soon stumbled into more than ideological
problems. When it opened, yields were 11%, inflation 7%.
Hungarians rushed to buy. Four years later in 1987, the
government issued an inflation forecast of 15%. Yields still
were at 11%. Hungarians rushed to sell. Prices dropped. The
budding Hungarian bond market crashed.
   Though shaken, Mr. Jarai refused to surrender. He bravely
kept open the bond market, waiting for better times. They
came with Mikhail Gorbachev and perestroika. Suddenly, once
firm taboos no longer were so firm, and in 1988, Hungary's
reform-minded communists approved the establishment of a
stock exchange. Mr. Jarai became chairman.
   The problems of the bond market soon paled before the
problems of the nascent stock exchange. Opening sessions
were, to say the least, unimpressive. They took place once a
week in a bland modern office in the International Trade
Center on Vaci Street. A woman stood at the head of the
table, reciting the list of equities. Around the table, the
dealers from state banks sat mute. The woman would read a
name and wait for bids. Often, none came.
   Abuses under the system abounded. Unregistered sales took
place all over the country. Only about 5% of all trading
happened at the weekly Budapest meetings. In one case last
year, a provincial company sold a bundle of shares promising
to pay dividends. When the dividends didn't come, angry
shareholders called for an investigation. It found that the
company didn't even exist.
   "There were no prospectuses, no laws, no trading
committee," said an astounded Mrs. Hardy. "Can you believe
that?"
   The Hungarians now understand that a proper environment
for a stock market has to be created. On March 1, the Act on
Securities and Stock Exchange took effect, calling for a
self-regulating organization, independent of the government.
   Registered brokerage firms are required to have an initial
capital equivalent to at least $2.5 million. To be listed,
companies must offer full financial disclosure. Mrs. Hardy
has been named head of the Securities Exchange Committee, the
Hungarian equivalent of the SEC.
   "The days of no rules, no regulations are over," Mrs.
Hardy said. "We are going to use the same system as in the
West."
   Initial results are promising. This past week, Hungarians
were given a sneak preview of the market when an offering by
Ibusz, a Hungarian tourism company, of the equivalent of $7
million in shares was oversubscribed.
   Many companies plan to exploit the Budapest exchange's
strong ties with the nearby Vienna Stock Exchange. Ibusz, for
example, will be listed in Vienna.
   It will take time until the Budapest market reaches the
level of its Viennese neighbor. Before 1948, when it was
closed, the stock exchange was housed in an impressive and
imposing building across the street from the American
Embassy. Today that building serves as headquarters for
Hungarian television. In any case, Mrs. Hardy says, the new
market no longer needs such large premises; one room will
suffice for the time being.
   "We're just getting started," she said. "We have to get
technicians, specialists, rules and regulations; we have to
learn this business all over again."
   Meanwhile, Tokyo stock prices ended essentially flat in
light trading.
   For the third day in a row, the Nikkei index bounced up
after falling below 32000 points, to finish above 32000
points.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues inched down 0.49 point at
32087.27. The index gained 47.38 points Wednesday.
   At midmorning in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index was down
363.18 points to 31724.09.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
400 million shares, in line with 415.4 million shares
Wednesday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 501-433, while 193
issues were unchanged. The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues in the first section fell 5.24 points to 2361.56.
   In London, shares finished narrowly mixed amid very little
investor interest with few fresh trading signals.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
0.9 point, while the Financial Times 30 Share Index was up
4.9 points to 1908.3. Volume eased to 415.4 million shares
from 436.8 million shares Wednesday.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Stockholm and Madrid; lower in Brussels and Milan; and mixed
in Amsterdam and Zurich. South African gold stocks closed
higher.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Manila
and Seoul, lower in Taipei, and mixed in Singapore and
Wellington.

   Defense in Chicago Futures Trial Blames
   `Ambiguous' Trading Rules, Assails U.S.

   CHICAGO -- A defense attorney blamed "ambiguous" trading
rules for any alleged problems in this city's futures trading
pits and criticized the government for singling out three
futures traders for prosecution under those rules.
   If federal prosecutors don't like the way futures trading
is conducted, "let them change the damn rules; don't put Bob
Mosky in jail because of it," said Elliot Samuels, an
attorney for Robert Mosky, one of three Swiss franc futures
traders charged with fraud who are on trial here in federal
court.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys for all three traders also maintained
that futures trading is so complex and hectic that the
undercover federal agent who posed as a trader in 1988
regularly bumbled his own trades and frequently misunderstood
what was going on around him.
   They also attempted to raise questions in the jurors'
minds about the integrity of the agent, Randall Jannett,
saying he appeared to ignore evidence that the three accused
traders had abided by the rules of their profession. The
attorneys made their comments in closing arguments to the
jury in the seven-week trial.
   Prosecutors argued that the defendants repeatedly stole
from customers to avoid costly trading errors and to pad
their incomes. Fraudulent trading in the Swiss franc pit by
the defendants was "systematic and longstanding," said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Gillogly.
   Mr. Mosky and the other two traders, Danny Scheck and
David Zatz, were indicted last year for allegedly stealing
from futures trading customers in the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's Swiss franc futures trading pit.
   Forty-five other individuals also were indicted last year
as a result of a federal undercover investigation of futures
trading at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. The three
Swiss franc futures traders are the first of the indicted
traders to go on trial.
   The central issue of the trial is the "open outcry" rule,
which requires that all futures trades be made "openly and
competitively" in an exchange trading pit, Mr. Samuels said.
But the lack of a concise definition for this rule has left
the defendants open to prosecution for following pit customs
and practices that allow traders to survive in the frantic
trading atmosphere, he said.
   Throughout the trial the defense attorneys hammered away
at Mr. Jannett's repeated claims that he observed and at
times covertly tape-recorded the defendants making
non-competitive trades. They also assailed as unreliable
evidence given by two traders who earlier pleaded guilty to
reduced fraud charges in return for providing evidence
against the three accused traders.
   The defense attorneys maintained that many of those
alleged non-competitive trades were actually two traders
confirming the details of trades made earlier that the agent
had failed to notice or record. Other examples of alleged
illegality were instances of traders resolving errors by
following pit practice of so-called local or independent
traders, resolving errors in favor of brokers who handle
customer orders, the attorneys said.
   The government contends that locals were passed
non-competitive winning trades to compensate for absorbing
such losses from brokers.
   Commodity regulations are "vague rules subject to
different interpretations," Mr. Samuels said. "This is life
in the pits. It's not pleasant, it's not serene, its not
pretty, but things get done."
   To try to underscore their argument that futures trading
is a frenetically paced business and difficult for outsiders
to comprehend, the defense attorneys offered a 20-minute
videotape of trading in the Swiss franc pit as their sole
defense. The unnarrated tape showed numerous examples of
traders leaping over each other to complete transactions and
frantically sorting through piles of orders.
   "The very complexity of the issues raised in this case
raises a reasonable doubt all by itself" as to the guilt of
the defendants, said Alan Blumenthal, Mr. Zatz's attorney.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Fleissner described such an
argument as a "Wizard of Oz" defense. It suggests "mere
mortals" such as federal agents or jurors will never be able
to understand the workings of a futures pit, he said. Accept
that, he told the jury, and "being a member of the Merc means
you can never be convicted" of fraudulent trading.

   Is El Presidente
   A `Mufa,' a Bearer
   Of Very Bad Luck?

   Argentina's Leader Is Linked
   To Mayhem and Mishap;
   He Says He Isn't Cursed

   BUENOS AIRES -- President Bush is going to do something
extraordinarily brave on Sept. 19. He is going to sit down in
the same room with Argentina's president, Carlos Menem.
   Whoops] Sorry. Don't say that word. Make it "Mendez," as
many Argentines do. Or be vaguer still. "El Presidente" will
do. "Just don't call him by his name," warns publishing
executive Carlos Ferrando. "It brings bad luck."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And if just uttering the name is dangerous, imagine the
peril of actually being in the man's presence. Ask tennis
star Gabriela Sabatini or speedboat racer Daniel Scioli, both
of whom have been touched by the supposed Menem curse. "That
man," says taxi driver Cesar Rojas, artfully avoiding the
obvious trap, "has bad vibes. All he has to do is go
somewhere, and terrible things happen."
   In superstitious Argentina, such a man is a "mufa," a
cursed individual, and Mr. Menem's mufa-ness, having become
legend (and a joke), is also a political liability.
   "Menem's bad luck" is the cover story of last week's issue
of newsweekly "Noticias." And Humor, the satirical biweekly,
ran a cover story just before the soccer games of the World
Cup began. "If we want to win," the magazine advised, "he
shouldn't go to the `Mundial.'"
   The sports-loving Mr. Menem ignored Humor's advice and
flew to Italy to attend Argentina's opening match with
Cameroon. "I know people think I'm a mufa," he told an
Argentine radio station hours before the game. "But, today,
we'll show them it's not true. Today, this streak will end."
   Famous last words. Cameroon, a 500-to-one shot, beat
Argentina, the defending world champion, 1-0. Humor felt
vindicated. The pro-Communist daily "Sur" was no more
charitable. It attributed the loss to: "the Mendez effect."
Argentina might have done better had Ramon Diaz been playing.
But just days after Mr. Menem had publicly suggested that Mr.
Diaz be included on the Argentine squad, he hurt himself and
was out of action for six weeks. Of course, once el
Presidente had gone home, Argentina defeated the Soviet Union
and tied Romania, so it squeaked through to the second round,
fortunately without Mr. Menem in the cheering section.
   Argentina's soccer loss is but the latest in a string of
events that have won Mr. Menem his reputation as a mufa.
Updating the list of mufa-related mishaps, some of them quite
tragic, has become a national pastime.
   Some posited examples?
   Last July, Mr. Menem played a soccer game with Argentina's
national team, following which the team failed to win a game
for months. Sergio Batista, who sat out the game so Mr. Menem
could play, saw his $1 million contract to compete for an
Italian team fall through.
   Switching to tennis, Mr. Menem played a benefit game with
Gabriela Sabatini. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Sabatini,
Argentina's No. 1 woman player, twisted her knee and was
idled for weeks.
   In September, el Presidente went for a boat ride with
outboard racer Daniel Scioli. The next day Mr. Scioli lost an
arm in an accident.
   To take his mind off Argentina's economic woes, Mr. Menem
went to the races. In the following week, four jockeys were
injured.
   Having passed like a tornado through the sports world, Mr.
Menem piloted an Argentine Pucara jet. Bad for business. A
few days later, Brazil rescinded a contract to buy 30 of the
planes.
   Mr. Menem named Miguel Roig to be his economics minister.
Five days later, the businessman had a heart attack and died.
A few weeks later, Julio Corzo, the minister of health and
social action and the president's closest friend, was killed
in a plane crash.
   Tango singer Hugo del Carril was recovering in a Buenos
Aires hospital from a cardiovascular illness. Mr. Menem paid
a visit and, two hours later, Mr. del Carril was dead.
   Days after Mr. Menem went to the Olmos penitentiary to
inaugurate modernization work, 33 inmates died in a blaze.
   Just as he was about to board his plane to Kuala Lumpur
earlier this month, a truck carrying a crane crashed into the
aircraft.
   Must more evidence be adduced? Taxi driver Carlos
Brachetti thinks not. "I hate to believe this stuff," he
says. "But one has to face facts: The man is a mufa."
   Mr. Menem, of course, doesn't buy the line. Pressed by
reporters upon his return from his ill-fated trip to Italy
about the bad luck he seems to sow like Johnny Appleseed, an
irascible Mr. Menem said all this mufa talk is "sheer
nonsense."
   He certainly didn't assume blame for Argentina's loss to
Cameroon. "I wasn't on the playing field," he said, adding
that no one blames Mikhail Gorbachev because Romania beat the
Soviet Union. "Argentina was never as lucky as {it has been}
under this government," he said.
   With the nation in deep economic crisis, many Argentines
can't quite fathom that claim. But there is a rough consensus
that Mr. Menem has been a source of amusement.
   Mufas, they say, bring bad luck to others but lead charmed
lives themselves. Mr. Menem's own luck hasn't been all that
terrific lately. He might wish to point that out next time
someone says he's a mufa. Mr. Menem's personal life has been
in considerable disarray. The reason: what Argentines call
"la crisis matrimonial," a domestic battle royal between Mr.
Menem and his wife of 23 years, Zulema.
   The two have been on the outs, on and off, for years but
were reconciled in 1988 during the presidential campaign. No
sooner had Mr. Menem assumed the presidency, however, than
the spats resumed -- more this time over politics than over
Mr. Menem's alleged philandering, which had been an issue.
Mr. Menem, a lip-service Peronist, clashed with his wife, who
is more orthodox. She, who consorts with her husband's
critics, said Mr. Menem's entourage is corrupt. "She is my
biggest opponent," Mr. Menem grumbled.
   Mrs. Menem moved out of the president's official
residence, saying that the phones were bugged. She moved back
in, then he moved out. He slept at the office or at the homes
of friends. She denied him access to his sash and scepter.
   Unable to persuade his wife to leave the Quinta de Olivos,
the 59-year-old Mr. Menem issued a decree ordering her to go.
She came home one day to find that she had been locked out.
   "Corruption is taking hold of the country," she said.
"This is much more than the breakup of a marriage, this is a
political problem."
   Mr. Menem has handled the matter rather more firmly than
he has handled hyperinflation, and public opinion seems to
respect his actions vis-a-vis Zulema. But does that mean he
isn't a mufa? Hardly. It proves only that he's no luckier in
love than he is on the soccer field or in the cockpit. And
some Argentines, unamused by any of this, don't just refuse
to utter his name, they don't want to talk about the Menems'
cat fight at all.
   And he, known for flamboyance, is for once lying low.
Courting the danger of meeting up with Mr. Menem, this
reporter out of a sense of professional duty and diligence
requested an interview for this story. Much to his relief, he
got no reply.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A federal court jury here awarded
damages of $18.5 million to the city of San Jose in its
lawsuit against two brokerage houses and an auditing firm
that the city blamed for a $73 million bond-market loss six
years ago.
   Including interest, the award totals almost $30 million.
Previously, the city settled out of court with 11 other
brokerage firms for $12.1 million. The jury verdict,
following a six-month trial, included a $9.3 million judgment
against Paine, Webber, Jackson &amp; Curtis Inc., and an $8.7
million judgment against E.F.Hutton Inc. The jury also
ordered Price Waterhouse &amp; Co., the auditing firm, to pay
damages of about $500,000.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its suit, the city contended that the brokerage firms
led the city into engaging in risky and speculative
transactions while lending the city money to undertake those
transactions.
   The deals involved so-called reverse repurchase
agreements; city traders, instead of taking losses on
long-term bonds, used those bonds as collateral to borrow
from its brokers to buy more bonds in hopes of recouping
losses. Seven city employees were fired as a result of the
bond fiasco.
   The jury also determined that Price Waterhouse was
negligent in failing to report the loans by the brokerage
houses in its city audits. The city argued that such a report
would have alerted city officials to the growing bond losses.
   A spokeswoman for PaineWebber Group Inc., the New York
securities firm, declined to comment. Jackson &amp; Curtis was a
predecessor of Paine Webber.
   A spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., also a New
York securities firm and successor to E.F. Hutton, said the
firm doesn't "believe the facts justify this ruling and we
will ask the court to set aside the verdict. We also are
considering an appeal."
   Price Waterhouse's attorneys, Heller Ehrman White &amp;
McAuliffe in San Francisco, said: "We had said all along that
the accounting was appropriate but that in any case the
losses were substantially attributable to the city's
inattention to what was going on, not to any accounting or
auditing failure." Under the law, the attorneys said, the New
York accounting and consulting firm will benefit from any
settlements paid by other defendants in the case, and it may
not have to pay even the $500,000 award.

   FLEMING Cos. (Oklahoma City) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it assigned a Prime-2 rating to the commercial
paper programs of this food wholesale distributor, affecting
$400 million in a program administered by Merrill Lynch Money
Markets Inc. and $200 million in a program administered by
First Boston Corp. The rating concern also affirmed the Baa-2
rating on the company's unsecured senior securities, citing
its leadership position in the industry, its adequate
debt-service measurements and the expectation that its
improving operating performance over the past few quarters
will continue through the next year.

   Acquisition Report
   Suspends Trading
   Of Jacobs Suchard

   Jacobs Suchard AG, a giant Swiss chocolate and coffee
company, suspended trading in its stock amid reports that
Philip Morris Cos. plans to acquire all or part of Suchard.
   Zurich-based Suchard plans an announcement after a
scheduled board meeting today, which comes on the heels of a
report in the Swiss newspaper Cash that Suchard Chairman
Klaus Jacobs plans to sell his 60% voting stake to Philip
Morris.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The report, which said Philip Morris would also make a bid
for the remaining Suchard shares, sparked a 2.3% rise in
Suchard shares in hectic trading on Zurich's stock exchange.
   Acquiring Suchard would cost roughly $4.5 billion,
analysts say.
   Neither Suchard nor New York-based Philip Morris would
comment on the report. But many analysts and investment
bankers said they believed it to be accurate.
   Such a move would advance Philip Morris's strategy of
continuing to reduce its reliance on tobacco by expanding its
international food business following two giant U.S. food
acquisitions. Philip Morris bought General Foods Corp. in
1985 for $5.7 billion and bought Kraft Inc. for $13 billion
at the end of 1988.
   Though Philip Morris was cited as the most likely bidder,
Mars Inc. of McLean, Va., also was mentioned as a possible
buyer. Other speculation is that Suchard will announce a
partial sale of its chocolate interests, or announce a merger
with Cadbury Schweppes PLC of the U.K. Another rumor has it
that Suchard will sell E.J. Brach, the Chicago-based candy
manufacturer which was acquired in 1987. Brach caused the
company an operating loss in the U.S. of $50 million in 1989.
   The Suchard suspension strengthened the shares of other
European food-products companies. Cadbury Schweppes rose
sharply in a flat U.K. market, closing up 17 pence at 364
pence ($6.27). Rumors about a combination between Cadbury and
Suchard have swirled around the companies for more than a
year.
   Cadbury spokesman Chris Milburn declined to comment, but
said the British consumer-goods company continues "to look at
opportunities for building both our confectionery and
soft-drink businesses."
   In its report, Cash suggested that Suchard's Mr. Jacobs
had incurred 700 million Swiss francs ($495.7 million) in
debt through the buy-out last year of other family members
who held a stake in his private holding company Colima,
making him subject to rising interest rates. Mr. Jacobs has
not been available for comment.
   However, analysts say it has been known for some time that
Mr. Jacobs wished to withdraw from the running of the Jacobs
Suchard group, which had sales of 6.7 billion Swiss francs
and a net income of 275 million Swiss francs in 1989. It
employs over 16,000 people world-wide.
   "A takeover isn't so surprising if you recall that Mr.
Jacobs had not wished to stay around forever," said Swiss
Volksbank analyst Urs Brunner.

   Marketing:
   Super-Cheap and Midpriced Eateries
   Bite Fast-Food Chains From Both Sides

<LP>
   McDonald's Corp. and many other fast-food chains are
caught in a vise.
   Squeezing them on one side are casual restaurants that
appeal to aging baby boomers who are losing their appetite
for burgers and fries on the run. These diners are opting for
restaurants that offer a healthier menu, table service and a
more relaxed atmosphere -- at prices not much different from
McDonald's.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On the other side are the super-discounters, such as
Mexican chains and no-frills hamburger outlets that offer
drive-through service only. These chains are drawing
bargain-hungry fast-food customers who have little brand
loyalty. Low prices and speedy service are their main
demands, with less concern about food quality.
   To maintain customer counts, the big fast-food chains are
cutting prices where necessary while trying to keep up their
service standards. At the same time, they're expanding their
menus to compete with the casual dining establishments. It's
a tricky juggling act.
   Long a ho-hum segment of the $150 billion-a-year
restaurant business, midpriced restaurants too often
symbolized nonchalant waitresses and forgettable food. Today
they boast nutritious-sounding menus and staffs that stress
service.
   As a result, many are experiencing sales gains unseen
elsewhere in the industry. National Restaurant Association
figures show casual dining traffic climbing 8.4% last year
compared with the 1.2% level eked out by quick-service
operators and a 1.4% rise overall.
   Typical of the revival is Perkins Family Restaurants, once
a "cake `n' steak" outfit heavy on pancake breakfasts and
chopped beef dinners. Its something-for-everyone menu now
features sandwiches and salads. Many of its 382 outlets have
bakeries on the premises. Senior citizens can order
small-portion meals at cheaper prices. Kids can eat for
$1.99. And although the restaurants are selling comfort over
speed, they promise free food if lunch isn't served within 10
minutes.
   "We want to attract the person graduating out of fast
food," says Perkins Chairman Donald N. Smith, himself an
alumnus of both Burger King and McDonald's, where he helped
develop McBreakfast. Perkins is a unit of Tennessee
Restaurant Co., Itasca, Ill.
   The average Perkins check runs $4.70 per person. That is
higher than the McDonald's-type tab, but the gap is
shrinking. Since 1986, McDonald's prices have outpaced the
government's Consumer Price Index. Meanwhile, food costs have
declined in recent years; they represented 40% of McDonald's
company-operated outlets' overhead in 1979, but only 34% in
1989.
   "It means that the customer is getting less food for each
dollar spent," says Michael Mueller, a restaurant analyst for
San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities. Ticking off a
number of casual dining chains, he says: "You can eat at
Chili's or Denny's or Shoney's for slightly higher prices
than McDonald's -- and in some cases a lower price."
   "Our commitment is to value pricing," a McDonald's
spokesman says, contending that covers speed and accuracy of
service as well as the food. But in broadening the menu from
the original burger, fries and Coke, "it's probably
inevitable that pricing of large sandwiches or entree items
move in the direction of the {sit-down} restaurants."
   By its own count, McDonald's feeds 22 million people a
day, but Barbara Sekowski isn't one of them. "You think you
can take the kids and eat cheaply and you can't anymore. I'd
rather pack my son a sandwich," says the 33-year-old suburban
Chicago sales representative who shuns fast-food outlets.
   Dinner-house operators think they have a good chance of
serving people like Ms. Sekowski, whose generation was weaned
on fast food and now, as it approaches middle age, represents
a growing demographic segment. Ten years ago, 14% of the U.S.
population was between the ages of 30 and 39. Today that
figure is 16.5%. By contrast, the 15- to 29-year-olds -- the
primary fast-food target -- have shrunk a full five points,
to 22.5%.
   The graying of America is likely to favor the casual
dinner house. "Senior citizens, by virtue of their increased
purchasing power, will have more say in menu offerings and
service," says Leslie Steppel, who follows the trade for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   She notes that older people often regard eating out as a
social occasion, and thus are unlikely to meet at a fast-food
restaurant. Still, the chains are trying to bring them in.
Some Florida McDonald's outlets offer Senior Citizen Bingo
during slow morning hours. And the McDonald's spokesman says
the company is experimenting with what he terms "a more
sophisticated dinner ambiance" at some outlets as it seeks to
woo evening-hours patrons.
   In part to broaden their appeal to customers who might
otherwise choose a midpriced restaurant, fast-food
restaurants are offering extensive menu choices. For example,
the McDonald's in Chicago's Northwestern train station food
court sells seven sandwiches, four salads, two soups, 13
beverages and eight desserts. The desserts include four types
of cookies, two of which are fresh-baked. Serving-size
alternatives balloon the options. Besides three sizes of
French fries and Chicken McNuggets orders, various cups make
for 30 drink possibilities.
   Nutritional concerns are also contributing to heftier
menus. McDonald's recently added yogurt, cold cereals and an
apple-bran muffin. It also is working on a grilled chicken
sandwich to rival a popular Burger King item.
   But by offering such an array, fast-food operators are
experiencing service slowdowns at peak hours. More selections
mean a greater burden on the preparation crew. And indecisive
customers can slow down the lines.
   That wide selection, though, may not have much appeal to
another group of customers. "Price is more important to a
heavy fast-food user," says Bob Sandelman, whose Sandelman &amp;
Associates research firm tracks the West Coast quick-service
scene. Speed is nearly as important as price, while food
quality is less so, he says.
   In fact, many drive-through customers seem to buy lunch
much the way they do gasoline; location and price are the
criteria. "They look at it more as a fuel stop than a dining
experience," says Mr. Sandelman. Heavy users tend to be
young, single males.
   PepsiCo Inc. has been able to cash in big on the bargain
hunters. Its Mexican chain, Taco Bell, boosted sales 27% and
earnings 45% last year, and Wall Street is expecting gains
again this year, largely from the chain's 59-cent entrees.
   Wendy's International Inc. is fighting to retain business
by offering low-prices on a "super value menu." McDonald's
resists discounting, seeking to use it only as a local-market
tactic. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly necessary. A
company executive says discounting could account for nearly
18% of McDonald's sales again this year, slightly below the
industry average.
   Mr. Mueller, the Montgomery analyst, suggests that
McDonald's offer "everyday low prices" as retailing giant
Sears does. "That convinces people you're not overpriced on
every item," he says.
   Perhaps fittingly, as McDonald's domestic business slows,
the Oak Brook, Ill., behemoth is increasingly investing in
new restaurants overseas. Not only is American fast food
still a fad in many countries and dining out a special
occasion, but meals often cost substantially more.
   That means McDonald's can realize a fatter return abroad,
where growth potential is tremendous. In the U.S., McDonald's
has 8,400 restaurants serving a population of 250 million.
But in Japan, a country of 140 million, there are only 700
Golden Arches.

   Manhattan, inc. and M Plan to Unite
   As New Capital Cities-Owned Magazine

   NEW YORK -- Manhattan, inc. and M magazine, battered by
losses and an industrywide advertising slump, are banding
together in an unusual merger to form a new magazine dubbed M
inc.
   Financial terms of the merger weren't disclosed, but the
new magazine will be owned by M publisher Fairchild
Publications, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.; it will
target affluent male readers, something both magazines have
done with only limited success.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   D. Herbert Lipson, chairman of Metrocorp, publisher of
Manhattan, inc., will be president of M inc, and will retain
what he called a "significant" interest. Clay Felker, a
veteran magazine editor who is editor of Manhattan, inc., has
been given the title of editor-at-large. He will work on
developing the new magazine under Jane F. Lane, who will be
the new editor of M inc. Ms. Lane had been editor in chief of
M.
   Magazine mergers are rare, and this one was greeted with
skepticism by advertising agency executives. "It sounds weird
to me," said Valerie Muller, media director of Pedone &amp;
Partners agency. "Neither has had tremendous success. Just
how many readers from each magazine will follow the new one?"
   Advertising executives also noted that M inc is just the
latest entry in a rush of new men's general interest
magazines. "There is a lot of attention now on the male
reader, but there is no research yet to show that real reader
support is there," said Paul DuCharme, media director at Grey
Advertising. "This is not a marriage made in heaven."
   Mr. Lipson said the new magazine will combine both "the
life-style features of M and the business orientation of
Manhattan, inc." Both companies claim the new magazine will
deliver the "best upscale male demographics in publishing
today." The average income of the M magazine reader is
$138,000; of Manhattan, inc., $226,000.
   "If we do this thing right, maybe we can kickstart the new
magazine," added Phillip J. Meek, president of Fairchild
Publications.
   But M inc represents a marriage of publishing also-rans.
Neither magazine is profitable, and both have suffered steady
declines in advertising pages for more than a year. M,
launched by Fairchild in 1983, is largely a fashion and
life-style magazine that has been a perennial third behind
Hearst Corp.'s Esquire, and Conde Nast Publications Inc.'s
GQ. M's circulation is currently about 152,000.
   Manhattan, inc. was launched by the Philadelphia-based
Metrocorp in 1984; it was considered a promising, savvy new
magazine under its founding editor Jane Amsterdam. But after
her departure, which followed disputes with Mr. Lipson,
Manhattan, inc. has steadily lost advertising since 1987. Its
circulation has risen to more than 110,000, due largely to
direct mail campaigns offering the magazine at cut-rate
subscription prices.
   Manhattan, inc. won't publish an August issue. Fairchild
will introduce the first combined issue in September with a
guaranteed circulation base to advertisers of 200,000.
   The merger follows rumors that Mr. Lipson would be faced
with closing down the money-losing Manhattan, inc. "I have
lost a lot of money on Manhattan, inc.," Mr. Lipson
acknowledged, adding that he had been seeking an investor.
   Industry experts estimate Mr. Lipson has lost as much as
$10 million on the magazine in recent years. The merger
doesn't affect Mr. Lipson's other Metrocorp properties, the
profitable Boston and Philadelphia city magazines.
   While M inc was portrayed by executives from both
companies as an equal merging of the magazines' staff and
editorial content, it appears to be weighted heavily toward
Fairchild's M. Michael F. Coady, Fairchild senior vice
president, said details of merging the sales and editorial
staffs are still being worked out, but sources close to the
magazines said the Manhattan, inc. editorial staff of about
27 would be cut in half.
   One of M inc's competitors is being started by a
Manhattan, inc. editor. Peter W. Kaplan, editorial director
of Manhattan, inc. will be the editor of Men, a new magazine
from Norris Publishing scheduled to debut by the end of this
year.

   To Lower by $1.1 Billion
   Fees in Next 12 Months

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
ordered the nation's local telephone companies to cut the
access rates charged to long-distance companies by $1.1
billion, a move that will give consumers a break on their
long-distance bills.
   The reductions in the year starting July 1 -- $696 million
more than the local companies proposed in April -- apply to
the rates that long-distance companies pay for the
origination and termination of interstate phone calls. The
FCC estimates that interstate-access revenues total about $19
billion annually.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. spokesman said the
company is studying the FCC order and plans to expand the
$160 million in rate cuts scheduled to take effect July 1. He
said it was too early to say how much of a savings customers
will see, but emphasized that "this means more reductions for
consumers and small businesses."
   Spokesmen for MCI Communications Corp. and United
Telecommunications Inc.'s US Sprint Communications unit said
their companies would remain competitive with AT&amp;T. In the
past, most access-charge reductions have been passed along to
long-distance customers.
   The FCC said its common carrier bureau found that
inaccurate projections of demand and costs would result in
excessive returns for local phone companies. The agency
figured that by underestimating the likely demand for
service, the local companies would have collected $105
million more than they should have.
   The bureau slashed more than $289 million in access costs
after finding that many local phone companies forecast
"unusually high growth rates in their costs without providing
adequate explanation or justification." It said it cut an
additional $302 million for other inflated costs. Further,
the agency said that some phone companies made exorbitant
forecasts of depreciation expense.
   In an interesting twist, the commission found that several
Bell companies had misallocated lobbying expenses to
operating-expense accounts in 1989, wrongly passing on
several million dollars of lobbying costs to phone-company
customers. The agency cited Ameritech, BellSouth Corp., Nynex
Corp. Pacific Telesis Group and Southwestern Bell Corp. The
agency said that although the Baby Bells "are entitled to
engage in lobbying, the commission's rules make clear that
associated expenses must be excluded from rate-making."
   Don Evans, MCI's director-technical regulatory affairs,
said, "We're excited that the FCC investigated lobbying
expenses, but I hope this isn't the end of it," he said.
"This is only the interstate part and only what local
exchange carriers admitted to."
   MCI had asked the FCC to investigate whether the Bell
companies were lobbying Congress at customers' expense.
Washington-based MCI made its request earlier this year after
the Bells earmarked $21 million -- $3 million apiece -- for
an enormous campaign to persuade Congress to ease
restrictions in the consent decree that broke up the Bell
System. The decree bars the Baby Bells from providing the
content of information services, manufacturing
telecommunications gear and providing long-distance service.

   Bell Atlantic Sees New Zealand Interest
   As Base for Expanding Pacific Business

   PHILADELPHIA -- Bell Atlantic Corp. views its joint
acquisition with Ameritech of New Zealand's Telecom Corp. as
a base for expanding operations in the Pacific, said Raymond
W. Smith, Bell's chairman and chief executive officer
   Mr. Smith characterized the $2.5 billion purchase as "a
very important strategic move for us." Noting the economic
vitality of the Pacific Rim region, he said Bell Atlantic is
exploring possible business opportunities in such countries
as South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and
Australia.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview, Mr. Smith also indicated that the New
Zealand telephone operation, which already has a mostly
digital network, could become a hub for providing corporate
telecommunications services to the region. He noted that New
Zealand makes an attractive base for many reasons, including
its location in the region, its stable democratic government
and its English-speaking population.
   This week, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech filed court papers
seeking a waiver from U.S. District Judge Harold Greene to
permit the two Bell companies, as owners of New Zealand's
Telecom, to retain their interest in long-distance phone
traffic between New Zealand and the U.S.
   Hyde Tucker, president of Bell Atlantic's international
unit, said that, without such a waiver, New Zealand's
long-distance phone circuits will have to be reorganized at a
cost of as much as $10 million. He expressed hope that Judge
Greene would respond to the request quickly.
   Armed with about $550 million in available cash at the end
of the first quarter, Bell Atlantic has been on an
international shopping spree. This month, for example, the
company has teamed up with US West Inc. of Denver; the two
have been selected to build a cellular telephone system and a
public data network in Czechoslovakia.
   Bell Atlantic's Mr. Smith said business opportunities for
the company in the Pacific Rim area could range from
consulting and operating-system contracts to acquiring part
or all of country phone systems that may be privatized. He
declined to identify specific targets or disclose the
progress of any ongoing talks. But he noted that Bell
Atlantic recently signed a "memorandum of understanding" with
the government of South Korea regarding possible joint
ventures.
   Mr. Smith also acknowledged that Bell Atlantic's recent
successes in landing the New Zealand and Czech business
ventures have the effect of reducing the likelihood that his
company would also take on the purchase of another large
national telephone system, such as those of Mexico and
Argentina.
   Peter Troughton, who will remain Telecom's managing
director and chief executive, said the New Zealand company's
total work force has been slashed recently to about 16,000
employees from a peak level of about 26,500. He predicted
that the total would be reduced to about 12,000 over the next
two years.
   For the fiscal year ended March 31, Telecom earned $148
million on revenue of about $1.3 billion. Profits were
reduced by heavy capital spending on network improvements.
   Mr. Troughton didn't make any predictions about how
profitable Telecom could become, but he said he doesn't see
why it should be "any less profitable" than the regional Bell
companies, including Ameritech and Bell Atlantic.
   Until the late 1980s, New Zealand's telephone company was
government-owned, heavily regulated and generally regarded as
a poor performer in responding to consumer needs. For
example, the network frequently "crashed" and went dead in
the middle of a business day because network capacity was
inadequate. Moreover, customers typically waited up to eight
minutes for a dial tone, and about 50% of
directory-assistance queries weren't answered correctly.
   But many improvements have been made in the past two
years. Indeed, the agreement last week to sell Telecom to
Ameritech, Bell Atlantic and two New Zealand companies
represents a sustained effort by the government to address
such market needs by taking the phone system private.
   Mr. Troughton noted that the company has realized strong
growth in demand for telephone services, since rates on toll
calls were cut 50% and international-call prices were also
reduced substantially.

   Law:
   Court Rules News Media Aren't Immune
   From Libel Suits Over Editorial Opinions

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled the First Amendment
doesn't make the news media immune from libel lawsuits based
on statements of opinion.
   The high court said opinions expressed in newspaper
columns and editorials and in television and radio
commentaries are entitled only to the constitutional
protections that the news media already receive for stories
based on facts, and not more.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Writing for the court, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
said many expressions of opinion will still have
constitutional protection. The high court, he explained, has
previously ruled that those who file libel lawsuits against
the news media must be able to prove that the disputed
statements were wrong; it is difficult, if not impossible, to
prove that statements that are clearly opinion are wrong.
   Given the other protections that are afforded the news
media, Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe said, "The
absence of a general immunity for opinions is not terribly
threatening."
   But the ruling was seen as a significant defeat to some
lawyers who represent the news media in libel actions and
other First Amendment matters. Robert Sack, a New York lawyer
who represents Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street
Journal, said newspaper editorial pages "are going to be less
free to say what they have to say." He said that lawyers who
review newspaper articles before they are published to avoid
possibly libelous statements will no longer be able to ignore
the editorial pages.
   Mr. Sack also said the ruling will likely cause the news
media to face more libel trials; until now, media lawyers
have been successful in asking judges to dismiss lawsuits
based on statements of opinion.
   In justifying the decision, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted
that libel law is intended to protect the reputation of
individuals, not merely the airing of ideas by the news
media.
   Technically, the vote was 7-2, with Justice William
Brennan dissenting, joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall. But
although the dissenters didn't join the majority opinion,
they said they agreed with the court's conclusion that there
is no special libel exemption for opinion statements. Their
dissent was based on the court's application of this
principle to the facts of the case.
   The case, which now returns to an Ohio court for a trial,
is a 15-year-old dispute pitting the former high school
wrestling coach in the Cleveland suburb of Maple Heights
against the Lake County News-Herald, published by Lorain
Journal Co., a unit of Community Newspapers Inc. After a
melee at a wrestling match, state athletic officials
disciplined the team, but a judge overturned the sanctions in
1975. The News-Herald ran a story saying the coach and local
school superintendent lied to the judge.
   The case bounced up and down in the state courts,
including two prior appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, but an
Ohio appeals court finally ruled that the statements were
opinions that were absolutely immune from libel lawsuits.
   The high court said the accusation that the coach had lied
is a statement that can be proved or disproved at a trial.
Justice Brennan's dissent argued that the statements were
like conjecture that can't be disproved, and that there was
no reason for another trial.
   The high court's ruling, Mr. Sack said, contradicts the
position adopted by virtually all of the 12 federal appeals
courts in the country and by three-quarters of the state
supreme courts -- that statements of opinion can't form the
basis of libel lawsuits.
   Mr. Sack also said that the decision may chill the free
speech rights of persons who speak publicly, not in the news
media, at town meetings or protest rallies, for example
accusing local companies of polluting waters. Those people
may be more susceptible to libel lawsuit, he said. (Milkovich
vs. Lorain Journal Co.)
                                                                                                       

   State Gas Lawsuits
                                                                                                       

   The justices ruled 5-4 that states may not sue in behalf
of consumers to recover overcharges that public utilities
were charged by their suppliers of natural gas and that the
utilities passed through to their customers in the form of
price increases. The decision, written by Justice Anthony
Kennedy, rebuffed the arguments of Kansas, Missouri and 32
other states.
   The high court ruled that only the utilities themselves
are legally considered injured parties under federal
antitrust law. The states and consumers are indirect
purchasers with economic injuries too ambiguous to allow
antitrust liability, the court said.
   Missouri and Kansas officials were seeking the right to
sue several producers of natural gas in Wyoming and an
interstate pipeline company for alleged overcharges in the
sale of gas to three retail gas distributors.
   The producers, Amoco Production Co., an Amoco Corp. unit,
and Cities Service Oil &amp; Gas Corp., an Occidental Petroleum
Corp. unit, and the pipeline, Williams Natural Gas Co., a
Northwest Energy Co. unit, were initially sued for alleged
overcharges by the retail utilities, Kansas Power &amp; Light Co.
and UtiliCorp United Inc. The lawsuit alleged that the
overcharges were the result of price-fixing.
   A federal court dismissed the lawsuit by the states,
leaving the claims by the utilities in place. A federal
appeals court in Denver said the retail companies, not the
states, were the proper parties to file the lawsuit.
   After the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal, Kansas
Power &amp; Light dropped out of the case.
   The high court upheld the appeals court ruling yesterday.
Justice Byron White dissented, joined by Justices Brennan,
Marshall, and Harry Blackmun (Kansas vs. UtiliCorp United
Inc.)
                                                                                                       

   Court-in-Brief
                                                                                                       

   In other action yesterday, the high court:
   -- Ruled 7-2 that the Interstate Commerce Commission
doesn't have the legal authority to allow shippers of goods
and truckers to agree on rates that are lower than those
officially filed by the truckers. Federal law requires
truckers to formally file their rates with the ICC and to
charge those rates. The ICC, however, has broadly permitted
shippers and truckers to negotiate lower rates. The ruling,
written by Justice Brennan, reverses the decision of a
federal appeals court in St. Louis and is a major defeat for
the ICC. Justice John Stevens and Chief Justice Rehnquist
dissented. (Maislin Industries, U.S. Inc. vs. Primary Steel
Inc.)
   -- Ruled 9-0 that nonprofit social clubs may not generally
offset investment income for federal income purposes with
losses incurred in sales of food and beverages to nonmembers.
Only when the sales to nonmembers were intended to make a
profit may a club claim the loss against investment income,
the court said in an opinion written by Justice Harry
Blackmun. (Portland Golf Club vs. Commissioner)

   WASHINGTON -- The Soviet Union is quietly moving nuclear
warheads out of the Baltics and its volatile southern
republics and into parts of the Russian republic considered
politically stable, strategic experts and Sovietologists here
and abroad say.
   The unobtrusive shift of weapons is taking place not out
of fear of foreign attack but because of worries that a
nuclear warhead could fall into the wrong hands internally.
That is exactly the scenario that U.S. Defense Department
officials and leaders of the military committees on Capitol
Hill have been worrying about lately.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But no one is more concerned than the Soviets themselves,
who have been telling U.S. officials and experts that the
U.S.S.R. has moved to consolidate its control over its
estimated 33,000 nuclear warheads.
   Rising levels of crime, thefts of conventional weapons
from military bases, attacks on military units, accidents and
personnel problems within the military have accelerated the
effort. It appears to focus, at least in part, on bringing
tactical nuclear weapons such as short-range missiles,
nuclear artillery and bombs into the Russian republic.
   "The irony is that here we are in a day and age when the
threat of nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of an
inadvertent release or an accidental war increases," says
Sen. Timothy Wirth, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and one of a number of U.S. officials who have been
told about the consolidation and the fears driving it.
   The move isn't thought to include strategic nuclear
weapons, and so doesn't constitute a major change in the
balance of superpower nuclear weaponry. But it does
underscore the Soviet government's concerns about its own
internal situation.
   The Soviet Embassy in Washington didn't have any comment
yesterday. Several Bush administration officials also
declined to comment, citing the extreme sensitivity of the
situation. However, one senior U.S. official, confirming the
movement, said: "I don't regard it as an act of desperation,
I regard it as an act of extraordinary caution."
   There appear to be two basic Soviet concerns about their
nuclear warheads.
   The first involves the potential for a breakdown of
central authority in the Soviet Union and the specter of
civil war that could follow. History is punctuated with civil
wars, but none has yet occurred in a nation with a vast and
most potent nuclear arsenal sprawled in hundreds of sites
across its vast landscape.
   Until now the Soviet Union has been regarded by many U.S.
experts as having more-thorough safeguards protecting its
nuclear weapons than does the U.S., partly because the
Soviets have a secret police force and a strong tradition of
central command and control.
   But what happens if the central control breaks down? That
is a worry that Sen. Wirth says he first began hearing a year
ago during a meeting with Soviet scientists in Boston,
several of whom have worked in the Soviet nuclear weapons
program. "Who controls nuclear weapons? That was their
concern. The command structure is controlled by a handful of
people in a committee. What happens if that committee is
fighting each other?"
   The second concern involves the theft of one or more
nuclear weapons that could occur if an isolated Soviet
storage site were overrun by rebel forces. This became more
than a speculative possibility in late January, when the
Kremlin suddenly dispatched elite Russian airborne units to
stop fighting between armed Azerbaijani and Armenian groups
around the Caspian Sea city of Baku.
   "I was meeting with Marshal {Sergei} Akhromeyev {the
former Soviet military chief of staff} in the Kremlin in
January and I was aware they had some very important nuclear
storage sites outside of Baku," recalls William J. Perry, a
former U.S. undersecretary of defense. "I asked him whether
they were putting extra troops around there. He said they
were." Mr. Perry is now co-director of Stanford University's
Center for International Studies on Arms Control.
   Marshal Akhromeyev, according to Mr. Perry, further
explained that Soviet nuclear weapons are protected with
special locks, believed to be similar to the "permissive
action links" on U.S. weapons. The locks must be opened with
an electronic code before the weapons can be armed and fired.
Mr. Perry says he's not sure how much protection the Soviet
locks would provide in the case of a nuclear theft. "The only
consolation I have is that I know they're worried," he says.
   Since last winter's Baku incident, according to Stephen M.
Meyer, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Soviet officials have said they are moving
nuclear weapons from sites south of the Caucasus, from the
Baltic republics and from more isolated bases to consolidate
them in larger, more protected sites in the Russian republic.
   "What you are seeing is prudence," says Mr. Meyer, an
expert on the Soviet military who recently returned from
interviews with government officials in Moscow. "You wouldn't
want the Azerbaijanis taking one of these {nuclear weapons}
and turning it over to the Iranians. That's what they worry
about."
   Soviet worries about control over nuclear weapons begin
inside the military, where the custody of nuclear weapons has
historically been given to elite forces that once consisted
almost entirely of ethnic Russians. The largest is the
298,000-man Strategic Rocket Force, a separate service, which
commands intercontinental ballistic missiles and other
longer-range nuclear weapons with some 9,300 warheads in all.
   In a recent interview with Moscow News, Col. Gen. Igor
Sergeyev, deputy commander of the Rocket Force, unburdened
himself, indicating that the elite image of his units has
begun to fade. "On the one hand, in our rocket forces there
are regiments which have not seen a single injury in the past
15 years, not a single scandal with equipment or any breaches
of the regulations. On the other hand," he added, "the number
of recruits with previous convictions doubles in every
call-up."
   Largely because college-bound students are now exempt from
the draft, he said, more accidents are happening. "We have
more than 2,000 specialties," he added; "try and master them
when some soldiers do not even understand Russian."
   Crime within the military, according to Gen. Aleksandr
Katusev, the chief military prosecutor, has risen by 14.5%
over the last year. One of the major problems is the theft of
small weapons, which are later sold in a burgeoning black
market.
   This leads to more ambitious schemes. The Internal Affairs
Ministry of the Armenian republic announced last month that
two groups of armed men had stolen 21 tanks, surrendering
them to pursuing army units only after a firefight followed
by "negotiations." In a separate incident, according to an
account in the Soviet military newspaper Red Star, 40 armed
men attacked an Air Force base near the Armenian capital of
Yerevan and tried to break into a barracks before being
driven off.
   Later reports from Armenia talk about ambushes on military
units and, in one case, a night attack on a military base
involving as many as 300 armed "terrorists." All of this,
according to Prof. Meyer of MIT, has changed the security
threat that Soviet nuclear forces must plan for. "The
political landscape has changed so dramatically that now they
have to think about what a mob of 5,000 to 10,000 people
could do," he says.
   What could such a mob do with a stolen nuclear weapon?
According to Fred C. Ikle, under secretary of defense during
the Reagan administration, it would have great difficulty
trying to launch or explode the device.
   He and other U.S. experts assume that the locks on most
Soviet nuclear weapons are much like U.S. technology. Without
the proper code, a weapon cannot be armed. If somehow it was
armed, electronic sensors inside the weapon would destroy it,
harmlessly, if it was not launched exactly the way it is
designed to be launched in wartime.
   What is more likely, Mr. Ikle believes, is that the weapon
could be used as a powerful negotiating tool in a hostage
situation or sold to a nearby foreign power, such as Iran or
Iraq. "The Iranians would put it in a laboratory and fool
around with it until they figured out how to use it or blow
themselves up, whichever comes first. It's not something that
anybody in Moscow would ever want to happen," says Mr. Ikle.
   The last line of defense for Soviet nuclear weapons in a
civil-war setting would be the KGB, according to Bruce G.
Blair, a Brookings Institution researcher who has studied
Soviet nuclear weapons since the early 1970s, when he headed
a U.S. Minuteman missile launch crew as an Air Force officer
in Montana.
   During the 1960s and early 1970s, KGB officers assured
security by maintaining separate physical custody of nuclear
warheads, which they mated to Soviet missiles only during
nuclear alerts. More recently, he says, the KGB has begun to
rely more on automation, maintaining a separate
communications network that would electronically control
launching and arming once the codes were released from
Moscow.
   On the eve of a civil war, he points out, the codes
themselves might be in danger. "The questions," he says, "are
whose fingers are on the button? Will those lines of
authority remain clear? Will they be exercised rationally?"
   There are some strange scenarios here. For example, if the
Soviet Union were to break up into independent republics,
Kazakhstan, with its large Moslem population, could
conceivably become one of the world's most potent nuclear
powers. It is the site of two bases for SS-18s, the heaviest
ICBMs -- some of which are believed to be aimed at the U.S.
-- and a major long-range Bear bomber base.
   Thus far the Soviet central Asian republics have seen far
less turmoil than either the Baltic republics, such as
Lithuania, or the southwestern republics of Georgia, Armenia
and Azerbaijan. But that could change. Earlier this week, for
example, the parliament of Uzbekistan, while not calling for
independence, proclaimed control over the republic's domestic
and foreign policy.
   Leon Goure, a veteran Soviet analyst at Science
Applications International Corp., a California-based research
firm, believes that the predominantly Russian missile and
bomber crews would be unlikely to use nuclear weapons in an
internal struggle for control. "All these forces are
peculiarly dependent, particularly in a state of collapse, on
local authorities for food supplies," he notes. Also, Soviet
commanders would be unlikely to use nuclear weapons against
opposing units that possessed nuclear weapons of their own.
   The U.S., with its long experience in safeguarding nuclear
weapons, may be able to provide some help to the Soviet
military in the scary period that lies ahead. Meanwhile,
congressional leaders are pushing for a re-evaluation of U.S.
nuclear controls, particularly in the Navy, which isn't
believed to have the lock mechanisms used by other services
on their nuclear weapons.
   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, is exploring an offer by Yevgeny Velikhov, a
member of the counterpart committee in the Supreme Soviet, to
hold joint hearings next year to explore more effective ways
to control nuclear weapons.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, is pushing a plan to have both the U.S. and the
Soviet Union agree to hold internal reviews of their
nuclear-weapons safeguards procedures. In fact, he says, he
will try to force the issue here if the Pentagon doesn't
agree to such a review on its own.
   The U.S., he believes, must do whatever it can to help
assure that "the evolution in the Soviet Union takes place
peacefully. I'm not one who subscribes to the theory that
civil war in the Soviet Union is in our interest. I think it
would be a very dangerous time for our world."

   Media Group Urges
   Congress to Reject
   Ban on Exclusivity

   NEW YORK -- A group of 12 media companies with interests
in broadcasting and cable are asking Congress not to ban the
sale of television programs on an exclusive basis to program
distributors, principally cable operators.
   The move by the Media Group, which includes Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., Cox Communications Inc., Viacom Inc. and
Times-Mirror Co., is the latest round in the increasingly
heated debate over so-called program-exclusivity rights. That
debate intensified earlier this week when Tele-Communications
Inc., the nation's largest cable operator, asked the NBC
network if Tele-Communications' cable systems could receive
programming now provided exclusively to NBC broadcast
affiliates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   National Broadcasting Co, a subsidiary of General Electric
Co., hasn't responded to the request. But the 12 companies
who made yesterday's appeal to the House subcommittee on
telecommunications are fighting provisions in proposed cable
re-regulation legislation that would eliminate the
exclusivity rights and instead require cable programmers to
sell shows to any entity willing to pay for them.
   If the bill passes, for example, Cable News Network, the
all-news cable network owned by Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., would be required to sell its two services, CNN and
Headline News, to cable's budding competitor, direct-to-home
satellite TV.
   Under current legislation, cable programmers can make
exclusive arrangements, declining to sell shows to other
program distributors. A cable operator serving an assigned
area can secure the exclusive rights for such popular cable
programming as Home Box Office or TNT, Turner's all-movie
channel, for that region.
   NBC has been lobbying heavily to eliminate the exclusivity
rules, largely because it is a partner in Sky Cable, a
venture that would deliver programs via satellite directly to
homes. Cable companies want to keep the exclusivity rules in
place, and are opposed to Sky Cable because it would deliver
programs now exclusive to cable. One NBC executive speculated
that Tele-Communications' request to let cable systems carry
programming now provided exclusively to NBC affiliates is a
"ploy" to pressure the network to drop its legislative
efforts to eliminate the exclusivity rules.
   A Media Group spokesman said the group was formed in March
"in an attempt to resolve the differences between the
broadcasting and cable industries."
   Asked why Capital Cities/ABC, which owns a TV network, TV
stations and stakes in three cable networks, sided with the
Media Group, Mark MacCarthy, the company's vice-president of
government affairs, said, "It made good political sense. As
broadcasters, we benefit everyday by program exclusivity,
either by entertainment shows or sports. Program exclusivity
is a common practice that we want to promote."

   Bonn Offers Moscow Huge Credit,
   Seeking to Ease Unification Jitters

   Pledge of $2.98 Billion
   Made as Germans Ask
   Political Concessions

   BONN -- West Germany's pledge to give Moscow a five
billion-mark credit and Bonn's pursuit of Soviet political
concessions highlight the link between German dreams of
reunification and the Soviet Union's desperate need for
Western economic help.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher will
be seeking historic political concessions from the Soviets
today in Berlin, in negotiations involving the two Germanys
and the four victorious World War II powers. At the same
time, his government will be approving the five billion-mark
($2.98 billion) bank credit to Moscow.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It will be the largest single credit ever granted the
Soviets, and the conditions are far better than commercial
banks are willing to give a nation grappling with serious
repayment difficulties. The credit, managed by Deutsche Bank
AG, will be government-guaranteed and offered at market
interest rates. The Soviets will have 15 years to repay after
a grace period that is still being negotiated.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, who recently returned
from negotiations in the Soviet Union, believes the generous
credit terms will ease Soviet nervousness about the
accelerating pace of German unification. He also thinks they
help avoid a potentially dangerous isolation of Moscow from
the Western world. His government views the credit as an
emergency bridging loan until Chancellor Helmut Kohl can
convince his allies to join a more comprehensive program.
   The Bush administration has been deeply skeptical about
plans for direct Western aid to Moscow, although it
reluctantly has begun to consider such proposals.
   In a meeting with a small group of reporters in Washington
yesterday, President Bush reiterated that he isn't likely to
endorse any direct U.S. aid "at this time." But, he also said
he wouldn't discourage the allies from going forward with
their own plans to prop up the Soviet economy. "If some of
the neighbors want to go forward, fine. I think that that
comes under the heading of their business," the president
said.
   "I noticed on my trip that the Soviets are adjusting to
the prospect of our monetary union on July 1," said Mr.
Haussmann in an interview yesterday. "The combined economies
of the Germanys will make us, by far, the most important
economic trading partner for the Soviet Union." With the
Soviets determined to make the transition to a convertible
currency, he said, "We must and we will put the Soviets in
the position to modernize their industry with German
machinery and capital goods."
   The five billion-mark credit is part of a far broader and
more costly West German effort to reasssure Moscow that it
can count on a unified Germany to be its most important
trading partner far into the future.
   The steps already agreed to include assuring Moscow that
East German companies will continue to deliver militarily
important goods, that Bonn will subsidize East German
companies to ensure they don't fail to fulfull obligations to
the Soviets, and that the West Germans will assume most of
the payments East Germany has been making for the stationing
of 380,000 Soviet troops and more than 100,000 dependents on
East German territory.
   American officials say that the two-plus-four talks
between the two Germanys and the four powers -- the U.S., the
Soviets, the French and the British -- are slowly focusing on
more private negotiations between Moscow and Bonn.
"Two-plus-four is really becoming one-on-one," said one
Western diplomat here. "The game is really now between the
Germans and the Soviets."
   Yet West German officials insist that their economic
assistance isn't an effort to buy unification, but rather a
means to find common ground with the Soviets, who still won't
abandon objections to a reunified Germany in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization unless they are satisfied with a
new European security structure.
   "The issue isn't to throw money at them in an Ethiopian
relief program," says one foreign-ministry official here.
"The idea is to integrate them into the world economy and
make sure they do not feel isolated."
   Nevertheless, the new credit raises concerns among some
Western officials that Bonn has been too ready to meet Soviet
economic and political demands. They charge that Chancellor
Kohl is particulary anxious to get a deal, hoping to show
voters that he is the man who achieved reunification and
arranged Soviet troop withdrawal. Mr. Kohl is preparing for
the first all-German elections at the end of this year.
   Bankers in Western Europe complain that Bonn is pressuring
European commercial bankers to extend credits despite jitters
about the Soviet economy. "It's a nice political gesture,"
said one British banker. "But there are still gigantic
ongoing problems that are bound to increase uncertainty and
short-term disorder."
   Senior West German officials have been engaged in the most
numerous and intensive meetings with Soviet counterparts they
can remember. Since the beginning of the year, Foreign
Minister Genscher has met Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze for nearly 40 hours of talks in eight cities,
including more than seven hours of talks this week.
   Economics Minister Haussmann's schedule has also been
filled with Soviets. His staff was shocked when, during one
session, Soviet officials Nicolay Ryzhkov and Minister
President Ivan Selayev focused almost entirely on Moscow's
fears that monetary union would cause disruptions or higher
prices for already-contracted East German deliveries.
   Senior Soviet economic officials in Bonn this week had a
laundry list of projects they wanted protected. Atop the list
was the production of satellite optics and guidance systems
provided by the East German company Carl Zeiss Jena. These
are thought to be used in the Soviet Union's nuclear defense
program.
   The West Germans consented to fulfill all standing
contracts. "The status quo will be protected," said Mr.
Haussmann. "East Germany can't immediately end its military
cooperation with the Soviet Union. . . . If the East Germans
have to deliver spare parts, they will."
   Mr. Haussmann stresses, however, that West Germany has
promised its allies to expand its export controls to East
German territory. He says this poses less of a difficulty,
now that the West is loosening export controls. He insists,
however, that West Germany won't allow East German companies
who are supplying the Soviets to modernize their systems
using Western technology to further upgrade these military
products.
   Mr. Genscher has already promised that a unified Germany
will pay -- in hard currency -- East German subsidies for the
Soviet soldiers and dependents still on East German soil.
Although estimates vary, two Bundestag members estimate the
cost to the West German government for the second half of
this year will exceed 1.3 billion marks.
   These Bundestag members say another two billion marks are
being set aside in a fund to help keep afloat even
unprofitable companies that have contractual obligations with
the Soviets through 1990 and perhaps 1991. Government
officials have assured parliamentarians that these subsidies
will disappear after three years.
   "I think that's wishful thinking," says Wolfgang Roth, the
economic spokesman for the Social Democratic Party in the
Bundestag. "The question is how you tell taxpayers they have
to pay for Soviets that they don't even want in their
country. It's a problem, but what's the alternative?"
   At the East German Economics Ministry officials want to do
their Bonn counterparts one better. State Secretary Martin
Dube says that they would allow the Soviets to move to the
Soviet Union any company or parts of companies they consider
particularly sensitive. If the Soviets offer favorable-enough
conditions, they can even invite the workers along. He says
50 of East Germany's 8,000 companies provide the Soviets
sensitive military equipment.
   Mr. Dube is vague about the details of how such a plan
would be executed, and a Bonn spokesman denies that West
Germany has agreed to such a step.
   Moscow's interest in clearing up even the smallest details
of its relationships with German partners is obvious. East
Germany, its largest Warsaw Pact trade partner, provides 10%
of its imports, and West Germany, its largest West European
counterpart, provides 6%. Together, however, both Germanys
expect their combined role to grow to more than one-fourth of
all imports because of new German bank loans and greater
production uncertainties in East European countries.
   Some West Germans wonder whether they can afford such a
relationship. West German officials have already appealed
privately to their bankers not to begin writing off bad
Soviet debts, for fear that such action might set off a
broader panic.
   "There is growing contradiction between growing political
interests of cooperating with the Soviets and the escalating
economic difficulties of doing so," says Heinrich Machowski,
an expert on the Soviet Union at the German Economic Research
Institute.

   PITTSBURGH -- Japonica Partners failed to get enough votes
to confirm its plan to reorganize Allegheny International
Inc., giving the current edge to a company-sponsored plan.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Joseph L. Cosetti said that in
light of the thwarted Japonica effort, the court would
"address its energy to the confirmation of the debtor plan."
Japonica, based in New York, proposed paying creditors about
$655 million in cash, much of it borrowed from banks.
Allegheny's plan would repay creditors with stock.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still, Japonica, which has purchased enough bankruptcy
claims to give it more than 50% ownership of the reorganized
company, won't likely give up. If it can woo the company's
banks -- which rejected the plan by 62% -- with a sweetened
offer, Japonica could ultimately prevail.
   Indeed, there is growing concern about Allegheny's ability
to finance its own reorganization plan. Allegheny's lenders
are concerned that the management team tapped to run the
reorganized company won't want to stay, given rival
Japonica's controlling stake. They are also concerned that
Japonica will appeal confirmation of the company plan. At the
same time, Japonica's lenders aren't finished conducting due
diligence and won't be ready to finance the group's plan for
another six to eight weeks.
   Allegheny's senior unsecured creditors and common
shareholders also voted against Japonica's plan. However,
after the votes were cast, Japonica purchased $25.1 million
of the senior unsecured claims from a group of insurance
company holders.
   Allegheny filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy code in February 1988. The company has
presented 10 reorganization plans, the most recent one
approved earlier this year by all creditors except Japonica.
The court has indicated that it would invalidate Japonica's
blocking vote.

   GM's Roger Smith
   May Yet Fulfill Vow
   To Drive Saturn Car

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith
may yet fulfill his vow to drive GM's long-awaited Saturn car
off the assembly line before his Aug. 1 retirement. But now
it appears Saturn will conduct this ceremony in private.
   Saturn officials worry that television footage of Mr.
Smith smiling from behind the wheel of one of Saturn's
compact coupes or sedans might undercut the unit's efforts to
woo back import buyers hostile to GM. That is one of the main
purposes of Saturn, which is wrestling with how to be part of
GM but yet appear apart.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As recently as the GM annual meeting May 25, Mr. Smith
reaffirmed his longstanding pledge to drive the first Saturn
off the assembly line.
   So-called drive-off ceremonies are traditional in the auto
industry; auto makers usually view such occasions as free
publicity for a new model.
   But a Saturn spokesman says the GM subsidiary may not
invite reporters because it doesn't want them to see the car
and scoop the subsidiary's plans for a launch late this fall.
   Another reason that may be more critical, Saturn officials
concede, is that Mr. Smith could be a marketing liability.
   "You could build a case for that," acknowledges Donald
Hudler, head of Saturn's sales, service and marketing
operations. He says Saturn will benefit from the fact that
outside auto industry circles, most people don't know who Mr.
Smith is or what Saturn is. "I view that as good because we
don't have to change something," he says. Privately, Saturn
executives are more blunt.
   California Saturn dealer Russell Hand says the whole issue
of Mr. Smith's drive is an unwelcome distraction.
   "Saturn's emphasis should be in talking about what's new
and different and not getting bogged down with any baggage
from the past," he says.
   A GM spokesman says Saturn officials have never mentioned
any concern about linking Mr. Smith to their car. He says GM
doesn't go much for drive-off ceremonies anyway, no matter
what the product is.
   But the awkwardness over Mr. Smith highlights one of
Saturn's thorniest marketing problems: how to establish an
identity separate from a parent company whose image is
anathema to the new car's target buyers. It would be an issue
with any GM chairman, but is especially so with Mr. Smith.
   Mr. Smith is the most visible GM chairman in years, and
his stewardship of GM has been controversial. GM's market
share has plunged 10 points during his tenure. He was
portrayed as a villain in a recent film about the decline of
Flint, Mich. Several books about GM in the 1980s have offered
unflattering portraits as well. Mr. Smith recently drew fire
from some big GM holders for backing a revised pension plan
that almost doubled his annual retirement pay to $1.2
million.
   Saturn officials say they don't plan to feature the GM
connection in advertising. "We probably will not align too
much with GM," a spokesman says.
   Just when the drive-off ceremony -- public or private --
will occur isn't clear. "I can't answer that," the spokesman
says. "We don't have a date."

   LANSING, Mich. -- Maxco Inc. expects to report profit from
continuing operations for the year ended March 31 of about
five to six cents a share, or between $300,000 and $400,000.
But earnings "absolutely" will improve in fiscal 1991, Max
Coon, chairman, president and chief executive, said.
   In the fourth quarter, Mr. Coon said seasonal losses in
the company's construction materials business may have more
than cut in half the $737,000, or 13 cents a share, profit
from continuing operations accumulated in the first nine
months. In fiscal 1989, profit from continuing operations was
$425,000, or six cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A one-time gain of $650,000, or 13 cents a share, from an
accounting change will put net income for fiscal 1990 at
about 18 cents to 19 cents a share, or about $1 million,
compared with a year-earlier net loss, including losses from
discontinued operations, of $1.4 million, Mr. Coon said.
   For fiscal 1991, Mr. Coon said Maxco expects improved
profits to come primarily from an anticipated sale gain of
20% or better in its auto refinishing paint distribution
business, improved margins in its construction materials
operations, and profits from a 40%-owned factory automation
subsidiary, Medar Inc. Maxco had losses related to its Medar
stake fiscal 1990, Mr. Coon said.
   "We don't have the negatives we've been through for a
period of years," Mr. Coon said.
   Mr. Coon expects profit from continuing operations in the
first quarter ending June 30 to show "an improvement" from
the year-earlier $305,000, or six cents a share.
   Maxco recently expanded its auto paint supply distribution
operations into Chicago, and expects revenues from that
business to grow to $33 million in fiscal 1991 from $27
million in fiscal 1990.
   The auto refinishing business "is our main area of
expansion," Mr. Coon said.

   John Maynard Keynes had a reputation for fickleness. A
British politician joked that when a Royal Commission asked
advice from five economists, it got six opinions -- two from
Keynes. So why should anyone be surprised that at the age of
39, after several affairs with men, Keynes fell in love and
married a petite woman?
   One initially might suspect that Keynes faked his
affection for Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova in order to
settle into respectable British society. But the love letters
now reprinted in "Lydia and Maynard" (Scribners, 367 pages,
$24.95) will erase the suspicion that Keynes was faking it.
Keynes did not need to gain entree into high society. Before
he even met Lydia he held a tenured chair at Cambridge and
hobnobbed with London's rich, famous and titled.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Keynes's snobby Bloomsbury friends couldn't understand
what Keynes saw in Lydia. Rather birdlike in appearance, she
was not extraordinarily pretty. Lytton Strachey called her a
"half-witted canary." Her looks didn't even attract Keynes at
first, who called her a "rotten dancer -- she has such a
stiff bottom." In fact, Keynes first met her backstage after
a performance -- while he was searching for her more
attractive leading man.
   The letters in this book, edited by Keynes's niece and
nephew, Polly Hill and Richard Keynes, show that Lydia turned
her biggest drawback, her poor English, to her advantage. She
charmed Keynes through malapropism, neologism and creative
spelling. An elegant and careful writer, Keynes delighted in
Lydia's remarks, such as, "I send you a chirp from under the
left breast."
   To get even with the overeducated Bloomsbury friends,
Lydia referred to her divorce decree from a ballet manager as
a "degree" granted by the court.
   The closing lines of Lydia's letters often are bizarre,
including "Mucous membrances to you" and "Gobbles of peaceful
order to you." In addition, while everyone else saw her as a
bird, Lydia apparently saw herself as a canine and signed her
letters "Your dog," "Your complete dog" and "Your true
underworld dog."
   Though they show affection and devotion, Keynes's letters
disappoint. With his wit and charm, Keynes couldn't be boring
unless he tried very hard. In some of these letters he tried
pretty hard. He describes numerous administrative meetings at
Kings College. While I'm sure that the students of 1924 were
happy to hear that the college was adding two baths, readers
today probably will find that to be dull news. During the
early 1920s Keynes also acquired an intellectual curiosity in
ancient Babylonian weights. Lydia demonstrated her devotion
to Keynes by feigning interest in this hobby.
   Although the details of Keynes's letters don't sparkle,
his dilettantism shines through. While juggling public
lectures, editing obligations at the Nation, lunches with
Churchill, investment advising, dinners with the Kings
College wine and musical committees, and Lydia's tax returns,
Keynes squeezed in some economics. Had Keynes been born 50
years later, he couldn't have kept up this schedule and also
excelled at economics, which has become too specialized for
nine-to-fivers, much less part-timers.
   Keynes's dilettantism and his genteel Cambridge rearing
led him to promote bigger governments without warning that
strong incentives drive politicians and bureaucrats to expand
government programs endlessly. Keynes spent most of his days
with high-minded public servants and professors, most of them
educated at Oxford or Cambridge. He never asked, though,
whether the British intellectual aristocracy could fill all
of the positions he envisaged in a more interventionist
government.
   Perhaps we can forgive Keynes's naive view of government.
After all, the British postal service would deliver Lydia's
letters from London to Keynes in Cambridge the same evening]
   When Virginia Woolf called Lydia a "poor little parakeet,"
she couldn't imagine why Keynes would need an emigre
ballerina to fulfill his life. Woolf should have known that
Keynes reached out, intellectually and emotionally, for all
kinds of stimulation. Just as Great Britain had spread its
influence to nearly every culture and pursuit, so did Keynes.
Lytton Strachey composed a poem in tribute to Keynes's
farranging ambitions:
   ". . . Both penetrating and polite, a liberal and a
sodomite.
   An atheist and a statistician, a man of sense without
ambition.
   A man of business without bustle, a follower of Moore and
Russell.
   One who, in fact, in every way, combined the features of
the day."
   Since then, many have written about the witty and erudite
Cambridge don. While this collection adds to the literature,
the love letters between two people usually lose their luster
when exposed to outside eyes. A book like this makes one hope
that Milton and Rose Friedman are not planning to release
their most private correspondence.

   Korean Democracy Reaches the Awkward Age

   SEOUL -- Foreign Minister Choi HoJung leans back in his
chair in his elegant office in downtown Seoul and recalls his
first diplomatic mission: "to negotiate for surplus
agricultural products from the U.S." South Koreans were
hungry after three devastating years of war, and selling free
food was a key source of revenue for the government.
   From this unpromising beginning, South Korea has become
one of the wonders of the developing world. Its per-capita
income has increased from less than $90 in 1953, when the
Korean War ended, to nearly $5,000 today. National pride,
devastated by the division of the peninsula and 35 years of
brutal Japanese colonization, has rebounded. Most important,
massive popular demonstrations in June 1987 against the
dictatorship of Chun Doo Hwan forced his protege, Roh Tae
Woo, to concede to demands for political liberalization. The
Seoul Olympics in 1988 were the high-water mark of national
hubris. Here we are, South Korea could boast, with an elected
government, 12% economic growth, and we beat Japan in the
medal count.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But these days the talk in Seoul, a tidy high-rise city of
10 million people, is not of achievements, but of national
angst. In 1989, economic growth slipped to 6.7%, in part
because of crippling strikes, and crime surged. This year,
though growth has picked up, the stock market has been
unsteady, exports have slowed and inflation hit a nine-year
high in April.
   Among the public, the fact that democratization has not
meant that things are better every day in every way has been
difficult to accept. The student left has picked up on this.
"Yes, I want the present government to fall," says a Mr. Lee,
a forestry student in a Seoul university attending an
anti-government demonstration. "We can't wait for an election
because a fair election is not guaranteed."
   Mr. Lee is untroubled by the contradiction of encouraging
democracy by bringing down a freely elected government. And
he is not alone in his somewhat skewed perspective of how
democracy works. It is not unusual to hear middle-class
Koreans say that what the country really needs is a strong
leader to get things cracking, sort of like a dictator, but
nicer.
   It was in this context that Mr. Roh, elected president in
December 1987, announced this January the merger of the
Democratic Justice Party with the second- and third-largest
opposition parties, respectively led by Kim Young-Sam and Kim
Jong-Pil, a Chun ally and founder of the Korean Central
Intelligence Agency. Their merger into the Democratic Liberal
Party (DLP) was supposed to guarantee political stability.
With 220 of the National Assembly's 299 seats, the idea was
that the party could work its will.
   It hasn't worked out that way; the ruling party did poorly
in two by-elections against the upstart Democratic Party,
composed of assemblymen opposed to the merger, and the DLP's
approval rating has sunk as low as 8.9% in opinion polls.
This month's agreement to establish diplomatic relations with
the Soviet Union could be the first step toward turning the
tide, but for now the DLP is about as popular as Chun Doo
Hwan, who is in self-exile in a remote Buddhist monastery.
"Everything has ups and downs," says Lee Hong-Koo, the
president's senior political adviser. "In this case we had
the downs first."
   While five months is far too short a time to judge the
merger experiment -- the appropriate tests are this year's
local elections and the 1992 national elections -- the gap so
far between expectations and reality illustrates the promise
and the problems of Korea's nascent democracy.
   "We had to merge to create one party in order to pass the
laws and execute the policies" the country needs, says DLP
chairman Kim Young-Sam, who ran second to Mr. Roh in the 1987
elections. Not everyone sees such altruism in the merger,
noting the decision was made secretly and announced suddenly.
Just three years ago, Mr. Kim accused Mr. Roh of stealing the
election; his willingness to join his former rival is widely
seen as a ploy to position himself for the presidency in
1992.
   Much of the popular unease is derived from that fact that
having long lived under dictators, people are wary of what
looks like an attempt to create a one-party system. The
problem is that the four-party system that preceded the
merger did not work. By winning only 125 of the 299 seats in
the 1988 elections, President Roh's party was easily blocked
in the National Assembly. The DLP sees itself as a natural
way to break this logjam; the public does not yet trust it.
   The natural response would be to create a strong
opposition force. Along these lines, the Democratic Party has
proposed merging with the Party for Peace and Democracy,
which has 70 seats in the National Assembly. The problem is
that the Democratic Party is demanding that Kim Dae-Jung step
down from the leadership as the price of merger. Not
surprisingly, Mr. Kim is unwilling to commit political
hara-kiri to accommodate the DP, which has only eight
National Assembly seats.
   These maneuverings are being played out against a
background of popular uncertainty whether the country will be
able to manage the simultaneous transition to a more
sophisticated economy and a democratic political order. "The
welfare of the average citizen is deteriorating," says a
Daewoo factory worker.
   Some of that frustration finds an outlet in
anti-Americanism; it's easier, and for students anyway, more
fun, to blame the Yanks for everything from North Korea to
farm problems. "The unification of the DLP is done by U.S.
control," says a Korean student of German literature.
"Control of the military is also done by the U.S." This kind
of thinking is a minority attitude, but nonetheless
influential, if only because activists kick up a fuss with
such methods as attempting to firebomb the U.S. cultural
center in Kwangju at its reopening earlier this month. At
bottom, it is rooted in the idea that everything on the
peninsula is within America's power to change. That
perception is flawed -- the trade hawks in Congress only wish
it were true -- and as insulting to South Korea as it is to
the U.S.
   South Korea is going through a period of economic and
social uncertainty these days, but these are natural problems
generated by the startling progress it has made. The issue is
not only what policies Koreans should adopt, but what
process. Under dictatorial presidents Park Chung Hee and Chun
Doo Hwan, who ruled consecutively from 1961 to 1987, Korea
enjoyed 8% growth and not nearly enough freedom. Of late,
there has been less growth and more freedom. It can have both
-- but it will require staying the democratic course, even
when, as now, the going gets rough.

   RICHMOND, Va. -- Reynolds Metals Co. said 1991 pretax
earnings will increase about $150 million as a result of
capital projects completed this year.
   In 1989 the aluminum producer had pretax earnings of
$758.3 million. Last year's net was $532.7 million, or $9.20
a share, on revenue of $6.21 billion.
</LP>

   In addition, the aluminum producer said orders and prices
began to turn up at the end of the first quarter. "We should
see improvement in our second quarter report," the company
said. It wasn't more specific.
   In the 1989 second quarter the company had net income of
$150.7 million, or $2.55 a share, on revenue of $1.68
billion.
   The company said 1992 pretax earnings would rise about
$200 million as a result of capital expenditures.
   "We are investing more in this company now than at any
time in our history," the company said. In the current year
Reynolds Metals will spend about $900 million on capital
projects, up from the annual average of about $700 million
spent over the past three years, the company said.

   LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Earth Technology Corp. reported
sharply higher results for the fiscal third quarter and nine
months, but cautioned that a slowdown in part of its business
may "slightly" affect fourth-quarter results.
   Jack J. Schoustra, chairman and chief executive, said he
is "comfortable" with earnings projections of about 50 cents
a share for the current fiscal year, which ends Aug. 25.
Earth Technologies is involved in waste management consulting
and specialized analysis of potential industrial sites.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the third quarter ended May 25, net income totaled
$190,000, or six cents a share, more than five times the
$33,000, or one cent a share, posted in the year-earlier
quarter. Revenue jumped 62% to $14.5 million from $9 million
on the strength of both acquisitions and growth of existing
business.
   Mr. Schoustra said the sharp earnings increase was due
mainly to depressed results in the year-earlier quarter,
stemming from an office closure and relocation. Moreover, he
said the latest period included "well in excess of $100,000"
of preparation and proposal costs for two, multiyear Air
Force contracts awarded during the period totaling $97
million.
   The executive said recent softening in backlog for
asbestos consulting and laboratory services might lower
fourth-quarter profit by "a cent or two." He said the problem
was a "hole" in an otherwise busy asbestos-removal work
schedule.
   For the fiscal nine months, Earth Technology had net
income of $1 million, or 32 cents a share, more than double
the $456,000, or 16 cents a share, in the year-earlier period
on fewer shares. Revenue rose 49% to $40.3 million from $26.9
million. Included in the latest period was about $100,000 of
"non-operating" costs related to a restated loss by a
subsidiary and a valuation change in deferred compensation
related to an acquisition.
   Mr. Schoustra said the company "never said it was
comfortable with one analyst's forecast that net income will
total about 55 cents a share this fiscal year" and that it
was "more comfortable" with an estimate of about 50 cents.
The executive said possible softening in the fourth quarter
might mean a drop of one or two cents from that 50-cent
figure.
   In the fiscal year ended Aug. 25, 1989, Earth Technology
had net income of $518,000, or 18 cents a share, on revenue
of $37.8 million.

   Genentech Drug
   To Combat AIDS
   Gets Mixed Review

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Genentech Inc.'s designer antibody for
acquired immune deficiency syndrome so far appears to be
nontoxic to patients, but it has yet to show signs of
effectiveness against the disease.
   That is the view of Lawrence Corey of the University of
Washington, Seattle, who presented unpublished data on the
antibody, the compound CD4-IGG, to an audience of several
thousand here at the Sixth Internatonal Conference on AIDS.
Progress reports on other drugs also were mixed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CD4-IGG links a synthetic version of the virus's target to
an all-purpose antibody, to lure the virus to bind to the
decoy molecule instead of human cells. By fusing it to the
antibody, scientists hoped to rally active immunity against
the virus particles.
   However, the new drug has yet to produce any consistent
improvement in patients' immune cells or in their virus
levels, Dr. Corey said.
   Researchers plan to escalate the dose levels of the
compound. But for now, Dr. Corey said the experience
illustrates that "even the best {test-tube} ideas won't come
to easy fruition" in treating AIDS patients.
   In a study conducted at Brown University, the Bristol
Myers-Squibb Co. drug D4T, effectively reduced the levels of
a viral protein, p24. However, it also caused toxic
reactions.
   The most severe side effect was neuropathy, or tingling
and painful sensations. Patients also experienced some
drug-induced hepatitis, anemia and nausea while taking the
drug, said Dr. Robert Yarchoan, a researcher at the National
Cancer Institute, who summarized the study.
   Dr. Yarchoan also reported results of a study on a drug
called azidouridine (AzdU) by researchers at the University
of California at Los Angeles.
   Some patients on AzdU enjoyed a boost in their
infection-fighting T4 cells, and a drop in levels of virus.
But no such improvements occured in patients who had
previously taken the drug AZT. This suggests that resistent
viruses that arose during AZT therapy may have lost their
ability to respond to the newer drug.
   AzdU is made by the Triton Biosciences Inc. subsidiary of
Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group.

   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc.'s multibillion-dollar debt
refinancing plan won some praise from Moody's Investors
Service Inc., which downgraded the food and tobacco company's
bonds in January.
   The refinancing plan's "impact on leverage and {interest}
coverage ratios appears positive," the rating concern said.
It didn't say whether it is considering changing its single-B
ratings on most of RJR's high-yield, below-investment-grade
"junk" bonds. When Moody's lowered some RJR ratings, prices
of RJR and other junk bonds plunged as much as 10% in a week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   RJR and its main shareholder, the New York leveraged
buy-out firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., are developing a
plan to retire more than $4 billion of junk bonds, interest
rates for which must be reset by next April. Terms of the
reset agreement could require RJR to pay substantially higher
interest rates on these bonds, which would add to its debt
burden and weaken its financial health.
   Separately, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. affirmed its ratings
of double-B on RJR's senior debt and single-B-plus on
subordinated debt. It said these ratings had already
reflected S&amp;P's belief that RJR would successfully address
the reset requirement.
   If RJR does refinance its debt, said S&amp;P, "The increased
near-term requirement for cash interest and preferred
dividends would largely offset the longer-term benefits of a
reduced but still quite sizable total debt and interest
burden."
   Nonetheless, S&amp;P said: "The potential for an upgrade over
the next few years remains. An upgrade would be predicated
upon continued strong operating performance and cash-flow
generation growth. This would likely require RJR's domestic
cigarette market share to stabilize, ongoing industry volume
declines to remain near current levels, and an anticipated
near-term excise tax increase on tobacco to be of moderate
size or be deferred."
   Meanwhile, several bankers reported progress in raising a
$2.25 billion bank loan to help RJR refinance its junk-bond
debt. The loan is being led by units of Manufacturers Hanover
Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and Bankers Trust New
York Corp., each of which is expected to contribute $350
million. Bank commitments for the full amount should be
gathered in a week or two, an officer at one of the four lead
banks said. "We're in pretty good shape," he said.
   Two Japanese banks said they are interested in joining the
loan, though other Japanese banks have pulled back
substantially from their previously brisk role in lending to
highly leveraged companies.

   IT'S SUMMERTIME, but the leaving won't be easy.
   A pair of runway projects, combined with the season's
usual thunderstorms and throngs of travelers, will result in
worsening flight delays and increasingly frustrated fliers,
prognosticators fear.
   Trouble spots, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration, include Cleveland Hopkins airport, where the
main runway, which is equipped with the airport's most
sophisticated instrument landing system, is closed for a
once-a-decade overhaul. "We've taken it on the chin" in foul
weather, groans airport spokesman Mark Courtney. During a
recent hellish week, several pilots had to abort landings,
then try again. Some were diverted to other airports.
   Prepare for delays, too, at Minneapolis-St. Paul, where a
construction project has temporarily shortened an 8,200-foot
runway to 5,600 feet, too short to handle big passenger jets.
   Construction is an excuse that New York airports don't
have. In the five months through May, air-traffic-control
delays surged almost 50% from a year earlier at Kennedy and
LaGuardia airports. And so has fingerpointing. The FAA, which
attributes two-thirds of delays to bad weather, is reviewing
its procedures, but says things would go more smoothly if
airlines moved some flights from peak periods.
   For their part, airlines are complaining to Congress that
the FAA isn't moving aggressively to solve the problem. They
recently got Sen. Frank Lautenberg, (D., N.J.), and Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, (R., N.Y.), both on the transportation
appropriations panel, to urge the agency to beef up
controller staffing. One suggestion: temporarily blocking
controllers from transferring out of New York jobs.
   Industry officials speculate that the FAA, stung by
criticism that controllers were juggling too many flights the
night Avianca Flight 52 crashed last January, may become more
conservative, ordering more New York-bound planes held on the
ground at departure airports.
                                                                                                       

   DC-10 Hydraulic Plan
   Doesn't Satisfy Pilots
                                                                                                       

   THE AIR LINE Pilots Association, the main pilots union, is
raising concerns about the "fix" proposed for the McDonnell
Douglas DC-10's hydraulic system in the wake of last July's
crash of a United Airlines jet in Sioux City, Iowa. The
accident, in which 112 people died, occurred after the rear
engine exploded, severing all three hydraulic lines on the
jet and wiping out most flight controls.
   In March, the FAA proposed ordering airlines operating
DC-10s to install shut-off valves developed by the
manufacturer to safeguard against the catastrophic loss of
hydraulic fluid. But the union has doubts. Although the valve
would give a pilot some control over a crippled plane, "we
aren't sure that the airplane will be capable of being flown
to landing," says Harold Marthinson, director of ALPA's
accident investigation department. He concludes: "This is
something that they have ginned up but nobody knows whether
it will really work."
   The union, in a letter to the FAA, says that it would have
preferred that the DC-10 be outfitted with an independent
backup system for flight controls.
   Elayne Bendel, manager of commercial communications for
Douglas Aircraft, a division of McDonnell Douglas, says such
a step is unnecessary because of redundant systems built into
the DC-10. Besides, she says, the proposed modification "has
been flight tested and it works beautifully." The FAA says it
is reviewing ALPA's comments.
                                                                                                       

   Space in Coach to Save
   Lives as Well as Knees
                                                                                                       

   SOLVING a safety problem may pay dividends in comfort for
the squashed airline passenger.
   In recent years, the "pitch" between coach-class seats --
the distance between the back of one and the front of another
-- has shrunk to a measly 21 inches from 34 inches, according
to Richard Livingston, a spokesman for the Airline Passengers
Association of North America. Besides causing leg cramps, the
situation raises serious questions about whether passengers
sitting in window-exit rows have enough room to operate the
bulky exits in a crisis.
   A tragic illustration of the hazard occurred in
Manchester, England, when a British Airways' charter jet
caught fire in 1985, killing 55. Investigators blamed some of
the deaths on the fact that passengers couldn't get out the
window exits fast enough.
   "It's such close quarters . . . that it makes it very
hard" to maneuver the apparatus, Mr. Livingston says. His
group plans to petition the FAA to order airlines to remove
the seat closest to each window exit. The Association of
Flight Attendants has been pressing for some sort of new
safety rule, too.
   But the FAA says it already has plans to direct carriers
to provide more space in rows that have emergency-window
exits. "We are within inches of a final rule on that," says
Anthony Broderick, an FAA official. Removing seats next to
the windows, he says, isn't necessary for safety and would
hurt airline finances. "We think the way to get around it is
to add six or 12 inches or whatever" in space to those rows,
he says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   FORTY-THREE percent of Westerners flew at least once last
year, compared with about 33% for other U.S. residents,
according to a Gallup poll conducted for the Air Transport
Association. . . . Almost half of all interstate
highway-pavement is in "fair or poor" condition, the General
Accounting Office says, resulting in a ride that is "barely
tolerable or worse."

   HOME SAVINGS BANK directors halved the quarterly dividend
to 18.75 cents a share, payable July 19 to stock of record
July 6. The move stems from "continued pressure on earnings,"
which in turn has resulted from weak real estate markets, the
New York-based savings bank said. Home has reported that
first-quarter earnings fell 32% to $4.1 million, or 34 cents
a share. The payout cut on Home's more than 12 million shares
outstanding is unrelated to, and should not affect, the
bank's plan to be acquired by H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. of Los
Angeles for $300 million of stock, Home said. In national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, Home Savings shares fell
50 cents to $19.50.

   U.K.-based Caspen PLC exchanged half of its 70% stake in

exploration company, PRC Technologies Inc. The swap gives
Churchill 5.1 million shares of Caspen Oil, which has 14.9

   Stepping down as chairman of Caspen Oil was Delo H.

Mr. Carroll, and intends to pursue offshore expansion
capital.
   Mr. Carroll said he specializes in reorganizing companies
and in four years at Churchill increased shareholder equity
fourfold, to $2.1 million. In its third quarter ended April

   CINCINNATI -- Chiquita Brands International Inc. said it
called for redemption on July 26 all of its outstanding 5.5%
convertible subordinated debentures due Feb. 1, 1994.
   Approximately $34.7 million principal amount of debentures
is currently outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company will pay $1,002.50 per $1,000 principal amount
plus accrued interest to the date of redemption (which
amounts to $26.736 per $1,000 principal amount). Interest on
the debentures won't accrue after July 26.
   The debentures are covertible at the rate of $18.333 a
share or about 54.5 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
debentures.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Chiquita closed at $26.75, up 37.5 cents.
   Based on the current market price of the company's capital
stock (which currently exceeds the conversion price by nearly
46%), the company said it expects debenture holders to
convert their debentures into capital stock prior to the
redemption date. The right to convert expires at 5 p.m. EDT,
July 26. If all of the debentures are converted, an
additional 1.9 million common shares will be issued. The
company said issuance of these additional shares wouldn't
affect the computation of fully diluted earnings per share
because the debentures have already been treated as converted
for purposes of this computation.

   Japan, Switzerland and U.S. Are Said
   To Have Most-Competitive Economies

INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC NEWS AND STATISTICS (IEN)
</IN>
<LP>
   LONDON -- Japan, Switzerland and the U.S. ranked as the
world's three most-competitive economies, according to an
annual study by the World Economic Forum and the
International Institute for Management Development.
   The study, based on more than 300 criteria ranging from
tax structures to levels of social alienation, attempts to
rate countries according to how conducive they are to running
successful businesses. The study also included the subjective
but important measure of how much confidence business
executives had in the nations where they did business. Here,
West Germany, which placed fourth in the overall scoreboard,
ranked first -- apparently because of enthusiasm generated by
pending reunification with East Germany and investment plans
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The survey compiled a separate roster for economies that
have recently industrialized. In this group, the top three
were Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
   Growth expectations appear to be the strongest in Asia,
with South Korea leading the category of "rising stars."
Another contender in this group was Ireland, which won high
scores for expected industrial growth. According to the
survey's authors, Ireland "is developing a Far Eastern
country profile, which is reflected in the optimism of Irish
entrepreneurs."
   The survey's competitiveness rankings don't reflect the
difficulties international companies have breaking into
particular markets. Japan, which held the No. 1 ranking, is
considered one of the least-hospitable nations for foreign
corporations to invest in. The prominent position extended
Switzerland, where both the report's sponsors are based,
reflected the favorable tax policies there, along with
political stability.
   The U.S. ranked first for its human resources, a category
that includes the age, skills and size of the work force. The
survey also showed that in 1986, 59% of U.S.
20-to-24-year-olds were enrolled in some form of higher
education. Ranking relatively low in this survey was Britain,
where only 22% of this age group took part in higher
education.
   However, the U.S. came in sixth place in "future
orientation." In this category, which covers such items as
research funding and patents, Japan took first place.
   In worker productivity, Sweden and Singapore claimed the
highest ranking, with Japan coming in second place, and the
U.S. placing third. Germany took fifth place in the
productivity rankings, France seventh and Italy ninth. Of the
seven major industrial countries, Britain showed the lowest
worker productivity: It ranked 16th of the 34 countries
included in the survey.
   The study added several new categories this year. One was
a ranking of 23 countries according to how effectively they
prevented corruption. Here, Denmark and Singapore tied for
first place, while Italy came in 23rd. The U.S. fell close to
the middle, holding down the 13th place.
   While the report said that national economic competition
is a reality, it warned that "obsessive" rivalry between the
U.S., Japan, and Europe would be destructive. This "triad,"
the report said, controls about 60% of the world's gross
national product, with only 15% of its population. Trade wars
could leave the rest of the world in the cold, it warned.
However, the report predicted that over time, such nations as
Mexico, India, Brazil and China would gather greater economic
clout.
   Among the Eastern European nations, East Germany stands
the greatest chance for a successful transformation, the
study said, because of "the massive resource transfer" from
West Germany. The report gave Czechoslovakia and Hungary the
next best prospects. Poland got a gloomier review. "Having
the most tattered economy and being battered by a huge
foreign-debt burden, Poland's problem will be to ensure sheer
survival," the report said.
   In a discussion of Japan's success, the report emphasized
the nation's persistence. It noted that, in the Japanese
view, Western business executives expect "too much too soon."
Contentment -- or perhaps complacency -- is slower coming in
Japan. The study cited a Japanese survey that found that 52%
of the new generation of Tokyo residents believed they were
living in an affluent society, compared with 70% of a like
group living in Los Angeles.

   Big Board Figure Up 2.6%

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Short interest reached record levels for the
month ended June 15, rising 2.6% on the New York Stock
Exchange and inching up 0.3% on the American Stock Exchange.
   For the first time in 15 months, Texas Air Corp. was
supplanted as the leading short-interest issue on the Amex,
as short volume in the Houston airline holding company
plunged.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Energy Service Co., a Houston energy services concern, led
the Amex; the company is facing delays in completing a $50
million hazardous-waste incinerator complex near Mobile,
Ariz. Varity Corp., a Toronto manufacturer of farm equipment
and auto parts, led the Big Board. Short selling of Varity
shares has been linked to a type of arbitrage involving the
company's preferred stock.
   Additionally, a closely watched indicator of negative
sentiment, the short interest ratio measured on the Big
Board, plunged at mid-June.
   New York exchange short interest climbed to 661,212,877
shares at June 15 from 644,549,698 shares at mid-May. On the
Amex, short interest edged up to 72,277,893 shares from an
adjusted 72,033,106.
   At mid-June 1989, short volume was 528,985,908 shares on
the Big Board, indicating a 25% increase, and 49,054,037
shares on the American exchange, indicating a 47% advance.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio sank to 3.86 from last month's 4.61. The
ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange's average
daily trading volume that would be required to convert the
total short interest position. Some analysts suggest,
however, that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator
because options and other products can be used to hedge short
positions.
   Many investors in Varity have chosen to hold the company's
convertible preferred shares while shorting the common stock
to hedge their investment.
   Earlier this month, Varity said it will seek shareholder
approval for a plan to allow it to "pay inducements" in cash
or common shares to holders of preferred shares. The move,
aimed at reducing Varity's hefty preferred-share dividend
payments, ultimately could substantially pare the number of
preferred shares outstanding and reduce the short position in
the common.
   The American depositary receipts of Empresa Nacional De
Electricidad S.A. showed the largest short-volume increase on
the Big Board, climbing to 4,372,850 shares from 190,022.
Late last month, the Madrid utility said Spain's Ministry of
Industry and Energy wouldn't permit it to include $317
million of expenses relating to necessary repairs and
required modernization of the Vandellos I Nuclear Power Plant
in the base rate for electricity.
   Panhandle Eastern Corp., a Houston natural gas-pipeline
concern, saw short volume drop to 504,548 shares from
5,832,010, leading the Big Board decliners.
   Texas Air was the biggest volume decliner on the Amex,
with 4,570,106 shares compared with 8,547,761 a month
earlier.
   Fruit of the Loom Inc., a Chicago apparel concern, led the
Amex volume increases, rising to 4,357,279 shares from
2,896,033.
   The bellwether issue International Business Machines
Corp., the Armonk, N.Y., computer company, saw short interest
rise 22% to 4,908,645 shares, while closely watched New York
oil major Exxon Corp.'s volume eased 0.9% to 5,471,865 shares
from 5,519,394.
   The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in
which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares
existed at mid-June or in which the short position had
changed by at least 50,000 shares since mid-May (see
accompanying tables -- WSJ June 22, 1990).

   CONTINENTAL AIRLINES HOLDINGS Inc. short interest volume
was 7,532,266 shares for the month ended June 15, making it
the largest-volume issue and bringing total American Stock
Exchange short volume to 75,240,053 shares. Because
Continental recently changed its name from Texas Air Corp.,
some brokerage firms neglected to report some of the
company's short positions, the Amex said.

   ENERGY SERVICE Co., a Houston energy services concern,

involved in a hazardous-waste facility.

   CHICAGO -- Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. paid
$30,000 to settle Chicago Board of Trade allegations that it
violated exchange trading rules.
   Under the settlement, the brokerage unit of Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co., New York, didn't admit or deny the violations. The
CBOT said it had "reason to believe" Merrill Lynch floor
clerks disclosed "the possibility of a customer order" to a
trader for the company's Government Securities unit before
the order was initiated and entered in the trading pit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prior knowledge of a big pending order can enable traders
to profit from the market effect of the order, and is known
as "front running."
   Merrill Lynch said that it settled the action to avoid the
expenses of a protracted legal proceeding, and that it is
"confident that the trade at issue was executed competitively
and in a manner consistent with the best interests of our
customer."
   In December, Merrill Lynch paid a $250,000 CBOT fine,
without admitting or denying the allegations, for executing
non-member trades as trades for the firm, a practice that
reduced the fees it paid the exchange. In that case, Merrill
Lynch also agreed to pay the CBOT "certain fees and
expenses," which one source said totaled $2.9 million.

   WASHINGTON -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said a
discount package of long-distance services went into effect
for Resort Condominiums International after the Federal
Communications Commission allowed a suspension period to
lapse.
   The FCC had suspended the special discounts for the
vacation time-share company in January while the commission
investigated the legality of cut-rate custom-tailored
packages. At the time, the agency said it was also
investigating an equivalent offer from MCI Communications
Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The FCC could still declare the AT&amp;T offer, known as
Tariff 15, illegal, but the decision to let the suspension
expire signaled that the agency may allow AT&amp;T to offer
special discounts to meet competition.
   "We find it very exciting because we fought so hard for
it," said Joseph Nacchio, AT&amp;T vice president-marketing for
business communications services. Nevertheless, he
acknowledged that he would have preferred an affirmative
decision from the agency. The tariff for Resort Condominiums
was originally filed nine months ago.
   The company has made about six other filings under Tariff
15, including discount services for CBS Inc., PepsiCo Inc.,
and La Quinta Motor Inns Inc.

   NEW YORK -- Citing a lack of evidence presented by
prosecutors, a federal judge dismissed 11 of the 41 counts
against John A. Mulheren Jr.
   Mr. Mulheren, the former chief of Jamie Securities Co.,
has been on trial since early last month. He has been charged
with conspiracy, securities and mail fraud and keeping false
records. The government has alleged that Mr. Mulheren
conducted numerous illegal securities trades with Ivan F.
Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum dismissed many of the
counts that charged Mr. Mulheren with mail fraud. The judge
said there was no showing that Mr. Mulheren had defrauded his
limited partners by many of the actions he is accused of in
those counts.
   Thomas Puccio, attorney for Mr. Mulheren, said he is
pleased the judge dismissed the charges. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Alfred Pavlis wouldn't comment on the matter. A
federal jury is likely to begin deliberations in the case
late next week.

   WASHINGTON -- An unforeseen glitch in accounting for $30
billion of zero-coupon bonds sold this year to Mexico ensures
that the federal government's $3.12 trillion debt ceiling
will expire in early August.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is expected to tell
congressional leaders that the ceiling must be raised in
early August. The debt cap had been expected to expire some
weeks later, but in any event, the Treasury needs a
debt-limit increase before Congress starts its August recess.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury's wiggle room was diminished by an immediate
addition of some $27 billion to the amount of debt subject to
the ceiling. That addition occurred when it was discovered
that the zero-coupon bonds sold by the Treasury to Mexico as
part of a debt-restructuring package don't qualify for a new
method of calculating zero-coupon bonds subject to the debt
ceiling. A Treasury spokesman said the department has
notified Capitol Hill of this development.
   The Treasury had been calculating the Mexico deal as
adding about $3 billion to the amount of debt subject to the
limit.
   The need to act on the debt bill before the August recess
could become a key pressure point for the current White
House-congressional budget summit. It also could cause
uncertainty in the financial markets regarding the Treasury's
August refunding, whose details are to be announced Aug. 1.

   Sets $15.8 Billion
   For Foreign Bill

   WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved
a $15.8 billion foreign operations bill for fiscal 1991 that
would cut U.S. military aid outside the Middle East and
impose new curbs on funds for El Salvador and non-Communist
forces in Cambodia.
   The measure reflects a temporary accord between the Bush
administration and the committee's Democratic leadership,
which agreed to soften cuts in foreign military aid in return
for Republican promises of support on the House floor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Total foreign military assistance would fall to $4.63
billion in the budget year beginning Oct. 1, down 4% from
current levels but $144 million more than was proposed by a
House subcommittee last week. Limits on military aid to
Turkey and Greece would be relaxed, but Democrats succeeded
in preserving the thrust of their proposal to begin to roll
back arms expenditures and focus more on economic development
in a post-Cold War era.
   The committee trimmed some of its own initiatives in
development and economic programs, but aid to Eastern Europe
would still grow to almost $490 million, $189 million above
the administration's request. An estimated $800 million in
aid would be preserved to sub-Saharan Africa. And in
negotiations this week, the Treasury won a commitment of $50
million in new capital for the World Bank.
   Senior State Department and White House advisers
participated in negotiations over the bill, reflecting
concern in both the administration and Congress about
deteriorating support for foreign aid. The $15.8 billion
total would come on top of recent supplemental appropriations
for Panama and Nicaragua. When compared with the comparable
foreign operations bill last year, the measure would
represent a nearly 7% increase in aid and related
export-credit programs.
   The El Salvador and Cambodia provisions remain divisive,
and military aid to Turkey and Greece still would be cut by
almost 14%. Report language attached to the legislation is
sharply critical of the Turkish-backed government in northern
Cyprus, and taken as a whole, the readjustment in aid
represents a victory for the pro-Greece lobby.
   In the case of El Salvador, 50% of future military aid
would be withheld in line with a House vote this spring.
   And while spending would be continued for the
non-Communist resistance fighters in Cambodia, restrictions
attached yesterday were written so broadly that they
effectively would bar aid for military operations directly or
indirectly supportive of the anti-government Khmer Rouge.
   The $50 million in new capital for the World Bank is less
than half of what the Treasury Department requested. And
while the bill would provide $70 million sought by the
administration for the new European Development Bank,
restrictions were attached in an effort to put leverage on
Western governments -- particularly West Germany -- to
forgive Poland's immense debt.
   Apart from the foreign operations bill, U.S. contributions
to the United Nations and affiliated health and nutrition
organizations would increase significantly under a separate
$10.5 billion fiscal 1991 measure pending before the full
House. Contributions to international organizations generally
would grow by 28% to an estimated $787.6 million, and $115
million would be provided for peacekeeping organizations -- a
41% increase from fiscal 1990.
   The same bill would provide for an expanded State
Department budget for the new fiscal year. It is accompanied
by a report that touches on the continued conflict in
Afghanistan and U.S. representation in Kabul. When Soviet
troops withdrew from Afghanistan more than a year ago,
Washington withdrew its personnel from the U.S. Embassy in
the capital. Report language inserted by Rep. Silvio Conte of
Massachusetts, the ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee, calls for a review of this policy.

   RENO, Nev. -- Syntech International Inc. said it will miss
a sixth consecutive dividend payment on its preferred stock,
and may have to seek bankruptcy-court protection if it fails
to win restructuring of two existing lottery contracts.
   Loss-plagued Syntech is one of a handful of makers of
transaction-processing equipment used in state-supported
lotteries. The company said omitting of the preferred
dividend triggers provisions in its certificate of
incorporation that allows preferred holders as a class to
select two members on the company's four-member board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Syntech couldn't be reached for comment on whether those
holders had yet demanded those seats.
   Syntech said it omitted the latest payout, due in
September, because of its deteriorating financial condition.
The company said its "ability to continue as a going concern
and remain in existence" hinges upon restructuring of the two
lottery contracts. It provided no details about the
contracts.
   "If such new arrangements cannot be worked out promptly
the company will have no alternative but to consider seeking
relief" under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
Thomas A. McChristy, Syntech's chief executive, said in a
news release. Under Chapter 11, a company seeks protection
from its creditors while working out a plan to pay its debt.
   Syntech posted a loss in fiscal 1989 ended Sept. 30 of
$15.1 million, or $2.78 a share, on revenue of $11.3 million.
In the first quarter ended Dec. 31, the company had a loss of
$2.1 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $6.6
million.

   Strike Devastating Blow
   To Vestiges of Machines

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The last door at Tammany Hall just slammed
shut.
   The Supreme Court dashed more than 200 years of American
political tradition in just 16 pages, ruling that party
affiliation can no longer be used to determine who is hired
or promoted for most government jobs. The high court ordered
the virtual elimination of the practice of patronage -- the
spoils system where public jobs were parceled out to the
party faithful by victorious politicians.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "No longer are people going to have to show party
registration cards for jobs," says Gary LaPaille, Democratic
Party chairman of Illinois, the state whose system prompted
the ruling.
   So job applicants who hoped their vote in the last
election might get them their next job on a road crew or as a
prison guard, or who hoped their party loyalty might win them
a promotion from rehabilitation counselor to supervisor, are
going to be disappointed.
   In short, the court voted 5-4 to repeal the Law of
Tammany's George Washington Plunkitt:
   "First, this great and glorious country was built up by
political parties; second, parties can't hold together if
their workers don't get offices when they win; third, if the
parties go to pieces, the government they built up must go to
pieces, too; fourth, then there'll be hell to pay."
   Justice Antonin Scalia cited Plunkitt, the patron saint of
patronage, in his dissent. But Justice William Brennan, in
the majority opinion, had a succinct answer: "To the victor
belong only those spoils that may be constitutionally
obtained."
   The court said the First Amendment rights of government
workers are violated if they are denied promotions, transfers
or recalls from layoffs because of their party affiliation.
The court said turning away applicants because of their party
affiliation also violates the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of speech.
   That means that job-seekers who want to work in a state
garage in Springfield, Ill., will have shorter job
applications to complete. They no longer have to say whether
they voted in the Republican primary, whether they
contributed to the party and whether they have the support of
local political potentates.
   From here on in, promotions in government no longer depend
on promoting a political party.
   The decision will have a major impact in Illinois, where
Republican Gov. James Thompson has held a tight grip for a
decade on state employment practices for public jobs at every
level.
   It is also likely to have a significant effect on numerous
other states in which patronage has been widely practiced,
including New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. (The
ruling won't have a significant effect on the federal
government, which does its hiring through the civil service
system rather than by patronage.)
   The ruling also will force county and city officials to
change their ways. It means, for example, that government
facilities like Westchester County's Playland Rye Amusement
Park may no longer be staffed primarily by Republicans with
political clout. The park was cited last week by New York's
Commission on Government Integrity, which found a "blurred
line" between the GOP and the Westchester County government.
   "Partisan politics is a factor if not the dominant factor
in hiring in some situations both in Westchester and in New
York City," says Timothy Brosnan, counsel to the chairman of
the commission. "That is bad. It has an impact on the civil
service work force -- it is morale-damaging -- and we think
partisan political considerations should be removed from the
process."
   In New York City, for example, "no-skills-required" jobs
and highway-repair jobs are routinely handed out on the basis
of political considerations.
   The court's ruling eliminates the last vestiges of a
political employment system that was rich in color but often
steeped in corruption.
   As recently as a dozen years ago, Indiana public employees
were pressured to contribute to political parties directly
from their paychecks. The system, which Indiana Democratic
Chairman Michael Pannos says was "not really voluntary,"
operated much the way payroll deductions were made for union
dues or U.S. Savings Bond contributions in the private
sector. Moreover, license plates, title transfers and
drivers' licenses were until 1987 controlled by party bosses
who made a profit on their operations. The jobs, however, are
still filled by appointees chosen with heavy input from the
state political organizations.
   "There are still a lot of jobs that are being passed out
to party faithful," says John Hammond, who was senior
executive assistant to former GOP Gov. Robert Orr in Indiana.
"But current practices are probably going to have to be
changed."
   The changes were welcomed tentatively by party leaders who
recognized that the sunset of traditional patronage was
inevitable and probably not so terrible.
   "The parties have got to begin to move away from patronage
as the vehicle from which they derive their volunteers and
their activists," says Thomas Druce, executive director of
the Pennsylvania Republican party. "There was the idea around
that you could build a party through patronage, but it hasn't
worked in years anyway. We've got to build our political
apparatus around ideas, not jobs."
   The full impact of the ruling still is unclear. "It's
question time in Ohio," says Brian Berry, executive director
of the state's Republican Party. "We don't know whether, if
we win the gubernatorial election, we'll be stuck with all
the people the Democrats gave jobs to."
   The court ruling doesn't mean that public officials are
going to have to surround themselves with high-level policy
makers from the opposition party. "I couldn't run my office
if it was unresponsive to my political beliefs," says
Democratic Rep. Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, another
gubernatorial candidate.
   Some political experts think that George Washington
Plunkitt might have been onto something in the first place.
   "This is a real blow for the strong, local political party
machine," says Richard Winters, a Dartmouth College
specialist on state government. "There are very important
benefits that strong local parties bring to government, and
that may be in jeopardy."
   The decision wasn't a complete surprise to state and local
officials because the Supreme Court, in two previous
decisions in 1976 and 1980, ruled that government officials
couldn't fire public employees because they weren't loyal to
the party in power. That ruling eliminated the widespread
practice of new administrations -- from governor to fire
commissioner -- coming into office and ousting legions of
workers who were carried over from prior officeholders.
   The high court said the reasoning of the earlier rulings
-- that patronage firings forced workers to support and work
for candidates and parties that they preferred not to support
-- applied to decisions to hire and promote.
   The case arose as a challenge by five Illinois residents
to the patronage practice initiated when Gov. Thompson
imposed a hiring freeze on state jobs in 1980. The lawsuit
charged that the freeze was used to give the governor's
office, in conjunction with the Illinois Republican party,
control more than 60,000 state jobs. The five who sued
alleged they were denied promotions, layoff recalls, or a
chance to be hired because they lacked Republican
credentials.
   A federal court in Chicago dismissed the lawsuit before a
trial, saying patronage-based transfers, promotions, and
hiring didn't raise any constitutional problems. An appeals
court in Chicago agreed, ruling that only employment
decisions that have the same effect as a discharge violate
the First Amendment.
   The high court reversed the appeals court ruling and sent
the cases back to the district court for a trial.
   Joining Justice Scalia in dissent were Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, and Justices Sandra O'Connor and Anthony
Kennedy.
   In a concurring opinion, Justice John Stevens said the
patronage system has transformed President Kennedy's charge
to serve the nation into, "Ask not what job applicants can do
for the state -- ask what they can do for our party."

   Your Money Matters --
   The '80s Thrill May Be Gone:
   Bright Aura Fades for S&amp;P 500

   When it came to winning investment strategies in the
1980s, buying the stocks that make up Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index was at the top of the charts.
   Investors whose portfolios matched the index not only beat
the vast majority of professional stock-pickers, but they
also outperformed all other broad market indexes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By the end of the decade, many investment managers were
dancing to the S&amp;P tune -- chasing its performance as "closet
indexers" by weighting their portfolios toward these stocks.
Now individual investors, eager to join the party, are
snapping up S&amp;P-index mutual funds.
   But what worked best in the '80s, may not be the smartest
move in the '90s. Says Charles Clough, chief investment
strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.: "I think investors can
make two mistakes today -- staying in cash and buying
S&amp;P-index funds -- and right now they're making both."
   No one disputes the convenience, low costs and other
advantages of index-fund investing in general. And no one
expects to see a mass exodus of money from S&amp;P funds. But
some money managers and market analysts do expect the S&amp;P
index to lose at least some of its magic in the years ahead.
   "I can confidently say that the broader indexes like the
Wilshire 5000 or the Frank Russell 3000 will sharply
outperform the S&amp;P 500 this decade -- though I'm not at all
confident of saying that's going to happen this year or
next," says Robert Arnott, president of First Quadrant Corp.,
a Pasadena, Calif., money manager.
   Institutional investors are already starting to hedge
their bets. "The new cash flow (from index customers) is
going elsewhere than the S&amp;P," says Patricia Dunn, president
of Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors, a large index-fund
manager for institutional clients.
   During the 1980s, S&amp;P stocks clearly had an edge. Of
course, there were some good reasons: This elite stock group,
dominated by big blue-chip companies, had some of the
strongest earnings and other fundamentals in the market. But
even after allowing for size, growth, yields, value, foreign
income, liquidity and other factors, the S&amp;P stocks still
produced a bonus return just for belonging to the index.
   Martingale Asset Management, a Boston-based investment
firm, and Barra, a Berkeley, Calif., consulting firm,
calculate this "membership effect" to have added an average
of 3.4 percentage points a year to investors' returns in the
1980s. Over the decade, that meant a cumulative gain of about
40 percentage points that could be explained only by the
importance of being the S&amp;P.
   "There's no market share, monopoly or macro argument that
justifies (the bonus return) -- which means it probably can't
be sustained over the long term," says John Freeman, Barra's
manager of consulting services.
   Instead, many analysts concluded that the S&amp;P stocks
benefited from their popularity with index-fund investors,
program traders, closet indexers, corporate restructurers, as
well as foreign buyers of U.S. stocks, who used the index as
a shopping list.
   Now, there are signs that fashions may be changing. So far
this year, the membership effect doesn't seem to be working.
"There's no trend one way or the other," says William
Jacques, Martingale partner and chief investment officer. "We
may have seen the bulk of the growth in this already."
   That possibility appears to be supported by changing
attitudes among some of the S&amp;P's biggest fans. For instance,
some big institutional investors in index funds are shifting
their emphasis.
   Ms. Dunn of Wells Fargo Nikko says customers who in the
past relied solely on S&amp;P funds aren't adding new money there
now and are instead dipping into indexes comprising smaller
stocks. Meanwhile, customers who already have a diversified
index-fund portfolio, and who find themselves too heavily
weighted in stocks after the market's strong run-up of the
past year, are rebalancing their portfolios by "selling the
S&amp;P and holding steady in the smaller stock indexes," she
says.
   Other big sources of demand that helped drive the S&amp;P's
outperformance in the 1980s -- corporate restructurers and
foreign investors -- are also likely to be less important
factors in the market in the years ahead, many analysts say.
   "And unless these incremental buyers continue buying at
the same levels they did in the past, then the S&amp;P pricing
bubble will tend to deflate," says Martingale's Mr. Jacques.
He figures the S&amp;P stocks as a group "could give up about 20
percentage points of relative performance if this pricing
bubble reverses itself."
   All this is music to the ears of active managers, the
professional stock-pickers who have had to struggle mightily
to match the S&amp;P-performance benchmark in the last several
years. "The S&amp;P has dominated the performance of active
managers for 10 years -- that's probably unrepeatable," says
Ms. Dunn.
   As less money flows to the S&amp;P compared with the rest of
the market, "there will be a period when all the active
managers will look smart again," says Laurence Siegel,
managing director at Ibbotson Associates Inc.
   The shift is probably good news for the brokerage firms,
too, as "good old-fashioned stock-picking and securities
analysis will become a more important factor in portfolio
performance" in the years ahead, says Steven Einhorn,
co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co.
   That doesn't mean investors should banish the S&amp;P 500 from
their portfolios. "Particularly, given the importance of the
global economic arena, the larger companies that make up the
S&amp;P may have a bigger opportunity" for growth than their
non-S&amp;P rivals that have less international exposure, says
Stephen Nesbitt, senior vice president at pension consultants
Wilshire Associates.
   `Maybe the S&amp;P is a fad, maybe it's seen its best years,
but it's not a stupid investment; it's still a fine
portfolio," says Ibbotson's Mr. Siegel. "Long term, if (S&amp;P
index funds) get people out of cash and GICs (guaranteed
investment contracts), that's fine -- however, if people are
focusing on the S&amp;P as some kind of panacea, that's not
fine."

   NEW YORK -- Forbes magazine ended its association with a
free-lance reporter whose activities regarding a recent
article about Merv Griffin were questioned by a federal
judge.
   A spokesman for Forbes said that John Connolly was "a
free-lancer who is no longer with Forbes." He declined to
comment further. Mr. Connolly, who Forbes said is a former
policeman and stockbroker, shared credit for an article about
Mr. Griffin's purchase of Resorts International, the hotel
and casino concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Griffin article, in the June 11 issue, said that
Michael Nigris Jr., the former president of Mr. Griffin's
Griffin Co., had ties to organized crime. Mr. Nigris sued Mr.
Griffin last November for breach of contract after he was
fired.
   Federal Judge Dickinson Debevoise in Newark, N.J., asked
the U.S. attorney last month to investigate whether Mr.
Connolly had misrepresented himself as a police officer to
obtain sealed affidavits in Mr. Nigris's lawsuit. The judge,
in letters to parties in the suit, said he had granted Mr.
Connolly's request for access to the affidavits but
subsequently learned Mr. Connolly's police identification was
outdated.
   Mr. Connolly, who said he was a New York City policeman
from 1965 to 1976, last month denied he showed a police badge
in getting the affidavits. He said he never spoke to the
judge and that he had access to the documents before they
were sealed March 9.

   $450 Million `White Squire' Fund

   BURBANK, Calif. -- Can an heir to the Magic Kingdom work
alchemy for companies whose fortunes have turned to lead?
   Roy E. Disney and the principals of his private investment
vehicle, Shamrock Holdings Inc., are hoping to do just that
with a $450 million partnership, Trefoil Capital Investors
L.P. (Trefoil is French for shamrock).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Disney, vice chairman of Walt Disney Co. and Walt's
nephew, joins the growing ranks of so-called "white squires"
trying to profit from rescuing companies whose appetite for
debt in the 1980s is devouring them in the '90s. The venture,
which stopped soliciting new funds and closed the partnership
last month, has already attempted bail-out deals with
Southland Corp. and Ames Department Stores Inc., people close
to those talks say. Those transactions didn't materialize.
   The partnership intends to do "two or three deals," says
Stanley P. Gold, Shamrock's president and chief executive
officer and its chief strategist. The transactions would mark
the first major deals for the Shamrock principals since their
failed run at Polaroid Corp. two years ago.
   Mr. Gold says Trefoil has "a couple of candidates under
the microscope" and should complete a deal by the end of the
year. Although he declines to identify candidates, he says
Trefoil would be looking at industries where Shamrock already
has experience, particularly "retailing, one area hard-hit by
the overleveraged situation." Shamrock owns the 71-store
Music Plus chain of music and video stores in Southern
California and the 140-store Sound Warehouse chain in Dallas.
It also owns 15 radio and three television stations, holds
about a 15% stake in oil field equipment maker Enterra Corp.,
and has various real estate holdings.
   Shamrock quietly started bringing in partners for Trefoil
last fall, calling on investors from its prior ventures and
soliciting new money as well. Mr. Gold won't identify any of
the investors, except to say they include both big
institutions and private individuals, "but no pension funds."
The Shamrock principals take a 1% fee for managing the
partnership.
   Though the amount raised for Trefoil is shy of the $500
million that Shamrock was seeking, "given the environment
that's out there, we feel very good to have been able to
raise $450 million," says R. Rudolph Reinfrank, a Shamrock
executive vice president who spearheaded the fund-raising
efforts.
   The Shamrock partnership is entering an increasingly
crowded field of fund operators who specialize in offering
cash to companies in need. The new funds have taken a variety
of forms: Some, like the $1.6 billion Corporate Partners
organized by Lazard Freres &amp; Co., buy into healthy companies
facing a particular cash need. Ironically, Corporate Partners
bought new Polaroid securities that helped the company elude
Shamrock's hostile overtures.
   Other partnerships are raising money with the aim of
investing in distressed and even bankrupt companies. These
restructuring funds include one with a minimum goal of $500
million being organized by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and another
for $750 million headed by Chicago investors Sam Zell and
David Shulte.
   While overleveraged companies could provide many
investment opportunities in the 1990s, Shamrock has an edge
in that it has already secured financing amid what could
become a glut of proposed funds. Plans for a few white squire
funds, including one by LBO specialist Theodore Forstmann,
have been scrapped, and raising money for several other funds
is proving harder than expected.
   Shamrock executives concede that they were drawn to the
idea of establishing their own white squire fund because it
makes a kitty readily available to them when they spot a
target. "It removes from us the need on a deal-by-deal basis
to focus on funding," says Robert Moskowitz, a Shamrock
executive vice president and corporate counsel.
   The exact form Trefoil's investments will take will be
determined case by case, but most will be in the $50 million
to $100 million range, for deals ranging up to $1 billion or
more in size. Trefoil might acquire companies outright, or
inject capital in exchange for large stakes.
   "We prefer going into a situation where there's strong
existing management, and we insert new equity into the
company," Mr. Gold says. "But there's no cookie-cutter
approach." The partnership has broad powers to pursue various
transactions, including leveraged buy-outs if the buy-out
market rebounds. The fund can also be used for hostile
takeovers, although Mr. Gold says he doesn't plan any.
   One thing Trefoil won't be is a passive investor. "We
think we have some management talent to add to the
enterprise," Mr. Gold says.
   Earlier this year, Trefoil had an agreement to invest
"several hundred million dollars" in Southland, the
Dallas-based operator of the 7-Eleven chain, people close to
that deal say. But Southland instead opted to sell a 75%
controlling interest for $400 million to the Japanese
operators of its stores in Japan, Seven-Eleven Japan Co. and
Ito Yokado Co. Trefoil received a breakup fee from Southland.
   Trefoil also approached Ames just prior to that retailer's
bankruptcy filing in late April, people close to Ames said.
Trefoil was to have provided debtor-in-possession financing
in exchange for an equity position in the company.
   Mark Siegel, who heads Shamrock's media and communications
businesses, says that Trefoil is unlike other squire funds in
that "a lot of those investment partnerships feel a strong
need to do a certain number of transactions" because of the
fees generated. "We want to make a good investment. If we do,
everyone will profit."
   Shamrock is generally credited with having a good track
record for investing. Mr. Disney formed the company in 1978
as an investment vehicle for himself and his wife, Patty,
bringing on Mr. Gold as the financial mastermind. In 1979,
they bought Staar Broadcasting Group Inc. and used it as a
base for Shamrock's extensive broadcasting operations. In
1985, Shamrock bought Central Soya Co., turned around
operations and sold the company two years later at a profit
of about $125 million. Though Shamrock failed to acquire
Polaroid, it earned a $40 million to $50 million profit on
its stock in the instant-camera maker, Mr. Gold says.
   Mr. Gold and Mr. Disney also engineered the 1984 ouster of
former management at Walt Disney Co. and appointment of the
current team of Michael Eisner and Frank Wells, who have
brought the entertainment company quarter after quarter of
record earnings and allowed Mr. Disney to profit handsomely
on his stock holdings.

<LP>
   NORTHBROOK, Ill. -- General Binding Corp., hurt by "soft"
markets and higher expenses, said it expects second quarter
earnings to fall short of analysts' expectations.
   Rudolph Grua, president and chief executive officer, said
the office products company expects to report profit fell to
30 cents or 31 cents a share from 35 cents a year earlier. He
said that would put net income at $4.8 million to $5 million,
down from $5.6 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Grua said analysts and the company had projected
earnings around 38 cents a share. He said higher expenses,
along with slower sales growth in May and June, forced the
lowering.
   In addition, Mr. Grua said soft markets mean flat gross
margins in its basic business of making machines and supplies
to laminate and bind paper. And he said margins are down in
the company's three-ring metal binder business.
   The news sent General Binding shares down $2.50 to close
at $18.50 in over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   The expected earnings would mark the second consecutive
quarterly shortfall for General Binding after a 16-quarter
string of higher earnings.
   But Mr. Grua said he expects that modestly higher earnings
in this year's final two quarters should help the company
meet or slightly exceed $18.8 million, or $1.18 a share,
which the company reported last year before an income tax
refund made net $20.1 million, or $1.26 a share.
   General Binding expects second quarter sales to increase
about 11% to $80 million from $71.9 million a year earlier.
But excluding the Loose Leaf Metals unit acquired last
August, comparable sales are expected to rise about 9% --
below the company's earlier expectation of double-digit
growth.
   Mr. Grua attributed the lower-than-expected sales to
softer international markets for office products. The sales
shortfall is mainly on the machine side, Mr. Grua said. He
said the company's sales of supplies for those machines
remain healthy.
   Despite the earnings setback, Mr. Grua said he doesn't
plan to stop looking for acquisitions or interrupt the
company's annual dividend increases.

   WASHINGTON -- Democrats continued to grouse about the Bush
administration's new $51-billion deficit-reduction plan, but
they didn't walk away from budget talks with the White House.
   While uniformly critical of the plan, Democrats appeared
split on how to proceed. Senate Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser (D., Tenn.) complained the new plan "doesn't
give us any foundation on which to build." But his House
counterpart, Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), deemed it "a
starting point" that ought to lead to more give-and-take at
the White House-Congress budget summit. Democrats plan to
huddle on strategy this weekend before rejoining the talks
Monday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The administration says its new blueprint would shrink the
projected fiscal 1991 deficit by $50.7 billion. That isn't
nearly enough to avoid across-the-board spending cuts under
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The new proposal
includes $11.7 billion in spending cuts in addition to ones
President Bush proposed in January.
   President Bush told reporters he is ready to allow the
automatic budget cuts required by law to go into effect if an
agreement isn't signed. He also said he expects interest
rates to decline if a budget agreement is signed.

   BETHPAGE, N.Y. -- Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co. said they
settled their dispute over costs for the U.S. defense program
called Joint Stars.
   "The settlement eliminates substantial claims by both
parties concerning responsibility for the costs of completion
of the first two Joint Stars aircraft," the companies said. A
Grumman spokesman said no details of the settlement would be
released.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a joint statement, Grumman Chairman John O'Brien and
Boeing Vice Chairman Malcolm Stamper said, "This settlement
will improve our mutual concentration on other important
assignments on which we are working together."
   In 1985, Grumman won a $657 million contract for a
five-year development program for the Joint Surveillance
Target Attack Radar System, which will identify ground
targets and guide aircraft and missiles. The value of the
contract has since been increased to $850 million, Grumman
said.
   Meanwhile, Boeing won an $80.2 million subcontract to
modify two aircraft for the radar system's "aerial platform,"
but late in 1987 Boeing requested a $122.5 million price
increase. Boeing alleged that Grumman's demands on the
subcontractor had departed from the contract and driven up
costs.
   For its part, Grumman then sought an undisclosed sum from
Boeing "for damages caused by deficiencies in performance of
the subcontract."
   Grumman said Joint Stars is "in the final phases" of
flight testing by Grumman, with a U.S. Air Force evaluation
planned for this year.

   GORBACHEV'S WOES threaten hopes for fast accords on
Germany and arms.
   Political infighting in Moscow puts pressure on Bush and
Kohl to snare Soviet signatures on historic East-West
treaties soon. Pacts uniting Germany on Western terms and
rolling back the 40-year Soviet edge in conventional forces
are slated for signing by December at a 35-nation summit. But
the Soviet hardliners' attacks on Gorbachev send chills
through the White House.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A fear of losing the treaties is behind Bush's new
willingness to consider a Western economic-aid package for
the Soviets. It is also leading to other concessions,
including a likely radical softening of NATO's military
doctrines at next month's Western summit. Bonn may want to
move up the treaty signing to November.
   But Kremlin confusion slows talks; Soviet arms bargainers
complain privately that they lack clear post-summit
instructions.
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS SEEK to make political hay from a Bush veto of
family leave.
   The promised veto of the leave bill gives Democrats a
potent issue. Bush made a campaign promise to protect women's
jobs, and his wife championed the idea in her Wellesley
speech. But it would be a mistake to try to argue that Bush
"hates children," advises Democratic pollster Celinda Lake,
and better to say he's "too tied to big business" to help
working families.
   The White House stresses Bush's support of voluntary
leave. But critics note federal mandates already exist for
military-reserve and jury duty. Some GOP lawmakers fear a
veto will hurt the party's pro-family image. Democrats are
"going to use it against Republicans and probably very
successfully," frets Pennsylvania Rep. Weldon.
                                                                                                       

   BOTH PARTIES SCRAMBLE to deflect political blame for the
S&amp;L debacle.
   Fearing voter outrage this fall, lawmakers propose more
than a dozen bills to crack down on thrift fraud. North
Carolina Rep. Neal, under fire from his GOP opponent for
opposing a 1987 S&amp;L cleanup measure, is the prime sponsor of
two bills; one with 90 sponsors would require the Justice
Department to investigate at least half its pending 21,000
S&amp;L cases by year end.
   Democratic Rep. Annunzio of Illinois, a longtime friend of
the S&amp;L industry, proposes a commission to probe financial
crime. More than 130 House members co-sponsor a similar bill
by GOP Rep. Smith of Vermont. "Everyone would love to take
{an S&amp;L bill} home to their district and say it will never
happen again," says David Danovitch, a thrift lobbyist.
   Fifteen House Democrats write thrift regulators demanding
that all charges against Bush's son, Neil, regarding a Denver
thrift's failure be made public.
                                                                                                       

   MANDELA'S VISIT with Bush on Monday will lead to financial
aid, the South African's backers hope. Randall Robinson, the
TransAfrica organizer of Mandela's U.S. tour, has urged that
the U.S. grant $30 million to $50 million to groups pushing
South African democracy. The extraordinary welcome for
Mandela raises hopes for aid.
                                                                                                       

   OREGON SURPRISE? Democrats start thinking that challenger
Harry Lonsdale has a chance to pull off a big upset against
GOP Sen. Mark Hatfield. Among reasons for their growing
optimism: Hatfield is on the defensive on three big issues:
abortion, log exports and PAC money.
                                                                                                       

   NUKES SALE: The Soviets seek to sell space nuclear
reactors for up to $10 million each. Possible uses include
nuclear-powered communications satellites, says Space Power
Inc., a California company. "There's a fire-sale sense" to
the Soviet offer, says Steven Aftergood of the Federation of
American Scientists.
                                                                                                       

   SUMMIT PLEA: World Bank President Conable writes Bush and
other leaders urging him "to remember the state of the
developing countries" at next month's Houston summit of the
seven industrialized nations. Conable warned that the world's
poor stand to lose the most if the talks to greatly expand
the world's trade treaty should fail.
                                                                                                       

   ABORTION RULINGS by the Supreme Court will deepen splits
over the issue.
   Anti-abortion forces anticipate that the court, in rulings
expected next week, will uphold state laws requiring minors
to tell their parents before getting abortions. They will try
to use the decisions to regain strength going into the fall
elections. But pollsters say a ruling for parental
notification probably wouldn't reverse the political momentum
of abortion-rights activists.
   The abortion strife spills over into other arenas. The
American Bar Association prepares for a divisive push at its
August convention in Chicago to repeal a pro-abortion-rights
stance adopted in February. More than 1,000 lawyers already
have resigned from the 360,000-member group. Similar discord
faces the AFL-CIO as its directors grapple with the issue.
   New legal battles loom as courts in Pennsylvania and Guam
get set to review their strict anti-abortion laws.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Patriotism meets protectionism: Reps. Bryant
and Staggers seek to ban imports of foreign-made American
flags, which account for up to 17% of the U.S. market and
exceeded 300,000 in this year's first four months. . . . A
Concord (N.H.) Monitor cartoon shows White House Chief of
Staff Sununu giving management advice to Gorbachev: "I keep
my bullwhip in this drawer. . . . brass knuckles are up by
the Rolodex." . . . Jay Leno says one new Crayola crayon

   BIG VENTURE CAPITAL partnerships grow while others find
pickings lean.
   New Enterprise Associates, which already manages $470
million in venture capital funds, last week raised another
$200 million from such investors as Chicago's Brinson
Partners and the pension fund of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. And Canaan Partners, Rowayton, Conn., raised
$200 million this month to add to the $240 million it already
manages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The venture partnerships mostly are "getting their money
from pension funds who want to have a small portion of their
assets in venture capital," says a San Francisco
institutional investor. "The pension funds are playing it
safe by going with the large ones."
   But the big funds also have been able to separate
themselves from others with specific strategies. New
Enterprise, for example, has adopted a national investment
strategy, establishing a network of regional and
industry-specific "feeder funds" to provide candidates for
investment, says Richard Kramlich, a New Enterprise managing
partner. Canaan is focusing on providing capital for
expansion and acquisitions of small companies.
   Still, most funds formed in the '80s will face an uphill
struggle raising new money, investors say. "Their prior funds
haven't fulfilled their promise," says Anthony Hoberman, head
of venture capital investing for Alliance Capital Management
Inc.
   Only a handful of recent deals have produced returns
comparable with a Genentech or Apple Computer, he adds.
   ---
   A RECENT SECURITIES rule could give small firms a new way
to raise money.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission's 144a rule, which
was approved in April, could allow small entrepreneurial
companies to raise capital cheaply and effectively, says
attorney Joseph Bartlett, partner in Gaston &amp; Snow, New York.
   Under the rule, institutions with investments of $100
million or more can buy and sell previously restricted,
privately placed stocks and bonds. In effect, more investors
could be interested in the restricted shares of small firms
because they could be traded more easily. Restricted shares
have restrictions on trading, commonly delimiting the
category of buyers or the minimum period the stock must be
held.
   Mr. Bartlett and others think that small companies,
especially those that already have some revenues or are
profitable, could significantly benefit from the rule. "It
would allow them to sell stock cheaper and faster and perhaps
with less potential liability," he says. The liability risk
in issuing these stocks is reduced because the buyers are
so-called sophisticated investors, he notes.
   These investors include pension funds, insurance companies
and banks -- concerns that traditionally have acquired stock
in closely held businesses through venture capital pools but
increasingly want to buy stock directly. Still, for the rule
to really have an impact on closely held concerns, investment
bankers will have to make a market in the 144a stock. That
means they must put up their own capital to provide a trading
market, says Mr. Bartlett.
   The test for 144a for smaller entrepreneurial firms will
be whether there are enough qualified institutional investors
willing to buy and sell these shares, says Edward Smith,
managing director of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   ---
   KEY INVESTMENTS in computer-related businesses slip.
   Venture capital placed in computer-related businesses
declined 38% in the first quarter of 1990 to the lowest
quarterly total in five years, says Technologic Computer
Letter, an industry newsletter in New York. Such capital is a
major source of funding for new technology concerns.
   Only $225 million went to computer-related venture deals
in the first quarter of 1990, compared with $362 million a
year earlier, the newsletter notes. The decline follows a
year in which investments in computer ventures were flat.
Computer-related ventures received $1.24 billion in 1989,
compared with $1.26 billion in 1988.
   Entrepreneurs aren't successfully exploiting new
technology ideas, venture capitalists contend. "There's only
been a small increase in new concepts. Most entrepreneurs
keep churning out the same old ideas," complains Westport,
Conn., venture capitalist Stewart Greenfield.
   "Venture capitalists aren't seeing the deals or the
quality of deals they like," says Richard Shaffer, editor of
Technologic. And having been burnt by over-competition in
areas such as disk drives, computer systems and personal
computers, "they're resisting the me-too company," adds Mr.
Shaffer.
   Nonetheless, some venture capitalists believe the decline
could have some benefits for entrepreneurs. "The few
companies that do get money now will get more money and
attention," promises one East Coast venture capitalist.
   ---
   AN IRS VICTORY in a real estate partnership case troubles
venture capitalists.
   A U.S. tax court recently ruled that an individual who
receives a "carried interest" in a partnership is required to
pay taxes on projected profits at the time he receives that
interest rather than when he actually pockets the gains. Many
investment partnerships grant a carried interest -- an
interest that the partner doesn't pay for -- to help
compensate partners who manage the program. The tax court
decision could affect partnerships beyond the real estate
field, tax attorneys say.
   Most experienced tax lawyers previously believed that
there was little risk of a general partner's owing taxes on
profits that haven't been earned, says attorney James Dreyfus
of Fulbright Jaworski &amp; Reavis McGrath, New York.
   Even though a 1974 court case established a precedent for
collecting taxes on projected carried-interest profits, the
Internal Revenue Service had never attempted to apply it.
   "If they begin to enforce the {new} ruling, it will take a
lot of the financial incentive out of forming such
partnerships," Mr. Dreyfus says.

   Slam Wall Street's
   `Soft-Dollar' Deals

   WASHINGTON -- Two major Wall Street firms fired a missile
at a prevalent institutional stock- and bond-trading
practice, asking federal officials to curtail sharply the way
pension funds direct their transactions.
   The letter, from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley
Group Inc. to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, takes on a
lifeblood of Wall Street -- "soft dollars." A barter form of
payment, soft dollars are credits that pension funds and
mutual funds receive from brokerage firms for trading
commissions. The funds use those credits instead of cash to
pay for such things as research, computer services,
economists and client referrals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Backers say they help institutions pick and choose the
services they want and allow star Wall Street analysts to
form their own boutique firms. But critics counter that the
soft-dollar business is a quagmire, rife with fraud that
forces pensioners to pay for services that fund managers
should be paying themselves. Moreover, Goldman and Morgan
contend that soft dollars hurt overall market liquidity and
create excess volatility.
   The letter from the two firms points up Wall Street's rift
over the soft-dollar question. Most other brokerages have
reluctantly set up their own soft-dollar units on the
assumption that failing to do so would force business to
other firms. Morgan and Goldman have steadfastly refused to
enter the fray, and now appear to be hoping for regulatory
relief.
   The debate over soft dollars has heated up again in the
past few years as volume since the October 1987 stock-market
crash has remained at sharply lower levels than during the
mid-1980s. Because large institutions, such as mutual funds
and pension funds, have to reimburse soft-dollar brokers for
services no matter how much volume they do, Wall Street firms
without soft-dollar operations are getting a proportionately
smaller share of the pie.
   The two firms asked the Labor Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to: require pension plans
to disclose the extent of soft-dollar deals; clarify the
types of soft-dollar accords that fall outside pension rules;
and then take enforcement action.
   The soft-dollar issue isn't likely to fade soon. "This
goes to the very heart of what's going on on Wall Street,"
said Lee Pickard, a Washington lawyer who represents many
soft-dollar firms. "It's a competitive turf battle."
   The letter and an accompanying report, copies of which
were obtained by this newspaper, were sent several months ago
by Robert Rubin, Goldman's vice chairman, and Richard Fisher,
Morgan Stanley's president. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said
the Labor Department hasn't formally responded. She said that
the letter was a follow-up to an SEC roundtable held last
year on soft dollars, and that Morgan Stanley wanted to
express concern about the use of soft-dollar accords in
fixed-income investing. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
   "It's an area we have been interested in for a number of
years and an area we continue to have interest in," said
Charles Lerner, director of enforcement at the Labor
Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. He
declined to say what the agency might do.
   But the reception from the SEC doesn't appear to be
particularly warm. Robert Colby, chief counsel for market
regulation, said the agency has taken a wait-and-see attitude
toward changing the rules on soft dollars. "There's no
timetable for deciding when to move on any of these
complaints," he said.
   "Obviously for these firms there are competitive concerns
that mingle with altruism and their concerns for the
clients," Mr. Colby said. "That really calls for caution."
   Goldman and Morgan contend in their report that soft
dollars are a major problem for the markets. They estimate
that 30% to 50% of the total trades on the New York Stock
Exchange use soft dollars.
   "The overall consequence of soft-dollar practices on the
securities markets is a decrease in market liquidity, which
can lead to increased market volatility and general
disruption of trading," the report said. Moreover, soft
dollars are hurting the return that pension funds are getting
"because investment managers are not obtaining best execution
of securities trades in transactions involving soft dollars."
   At the heart of the firms' argument is a securities-law
provision called Section 28e, which allows money managers to
use soft-dollar practices if they receive research in return.
If the arrangement meets Section 28e guidelines, practices
that otherwise would violate Employee Retirement Income
Security Act laws are protected from Labor Department
enforcement action.
   But Morgan and Goldman said that pension-plan sponsors
aren't being told how soft dollars are being used. Moreover,
they added that some soft dollars are being used for futures
transactions, in violation of Section 28e, which covers only
securities trades.
   Some soft-dollar firms argue that Goldman and Morgan are
simply engaged in a misguided campaign of sour grapes. "It's
an attempt to restrict competition by lobbying the
regulators," said Don Potts, president of Capital
Institutional Services Inc., a large independent soft-dollar
firm based in Dallas. "The real problem we're dealing with
here is the overcapacity of Wall Street."

   Industrials Gain 6.43 on Late Rally;
   End-of-Quarter Buying Is Factor

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed higher on the strength of
a late rally, attributed to end-of-quarter buying by
institutions and futures-related buy programs. Trading was
subdued.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which spent most of the
session drifting at lower levels, moved back above the 2900
level by gaining 6.43 to 2901.73.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Today represents the end of the second quarter for many
money managers. Under normal procedures, any trades made
today would be settled next Friday, the final session of the
quarter.
   Analysts cited "window dressing," or last-minute
adjustments that institutions make with an eye toward
presenting the best possible quarterly reports to clients, as
a major factor fueling the market's late recovery.
   Buy programs tied to stock-index arbitrage, in which
traders purchase baskets of stocks and sell index-futures
contracts in order to profit from the price differential
between them, also surfaced near the close to give stocks a
boost.
   The arbitrage buying helped offset earlier waves of sell
programs, which had knocked back the market at the opening
and again at midday. The industrial average hit bottom with a
loss of about 20 points.
   Trading activity has been sluggish all week, and the
latest session continued that pattern. Some 138,570,000
shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared
with 137,420,000 Wednesday.
   Advancing issues led decliners on the Big Board by 774 to
696. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 1.37 to 360.47,
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.65 to
196.49 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index went up 1.11 to
335.33.
   The Big Board's list of most active issues included a
number of stocks that have recently been under pressure,
including:
   -- United Telecommunications, which dropped 1/4 to 39 in
Big Board composite trading of 1.5 million shares. The stock
moved lower last week after PaineWebber reduced its earnings
estimates for the second quarter and 1990.
   Its latest fall took place as American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph put a price plan into effect that allows it to
offer special rates to individual customers in response to a
competing proposal by another carrier. AT&amp;T rose 1/2 to 43
5/8.
   -- Occidental Petroleum, which rose 1/8 to 25 7/8 on 1.3
million shares after trading as low as 25 1/4 during the
session. Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded its ratings on the
company's debt earlier this week.
   -- Limited Inc., which slid 5/8 to 22 3/4 on 1.1 million
shares. Retail sales have fallen in each of the past three
months, and apparel sales have been especially sluggish,
sparking concern about earnings prospects for those
companies.
   Another issue to slide in active trading was Du Pont,
which said it has allocated funds for the design of four
plants that would produce alternatives to
chlorofluorocarbons. The stock fell 1 to 38 1/8 on 1.1
million shares. Du Pont said it expects to spend more than $1
billion to develop and produce the alternatives, including
$240 million already invested and additional projected costs
over the next 10 years.
   American Cyanamid rose 1 1/4 to 57 1/8 after agreeing to
sell the household-products business of its Shulton unit to
Clorox for $465 million. Analysts told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report they expect Cyanamid to use the sale proceeds
mainly to buy back common stock; Leonard Bogner of
Prudential-Bache Securities estimated that the company would
purchase about five million of its 94.4 million shares
outstanding.
   A spokeswoman for Cyanamid acknowledged that the company
is considering a buy-back, but added that it hasn't yet made
a decision to proceed. Clorox tumbled 1 3/4 to 42 1/8; the
company estimated that the acquisition would dilute its
earnings by 30 cents to 40 cents a share in the first year
and 10 cents a share in the second year.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson advanced 2 to 66 5/8 after the Food and
Drug Administration approved the use of Levamisole, a drug
made by the company's Janssen Research Foundation to treat
advanced cases of colon cancer in combination with another
drug. Separately, Dean Witter Reynolds increased its
estimates of the company's 1990 and 1991 earnings.
   Upjohn, which climbed two points Wednesday on takeover
speculation, eased 1/4 to 41 7/8 as 1.5 million shares were
traded. Schering-Plough and American Home Products had been
mentioned as possible suitors; both declined to comment, as
did Upjohn.
   Equifax, which agreed to acquire Telecredit in a stock
swap, tumbled 2 5/8 to 19 1/2. The company will exchange 2.69
of its common shares for each Telecredit share.
   Delta Air Lines fell 1 1/4 to 75 3/4. Wertheim Schroder
lowered its investment rating on the stock, along with its
earnings estimates for the company's fiscal fourth quarter,
ending this month, and calendar 1990. Analyst Candace
Browning said lower-than-expected domestic air traffic will
affect its results.
   VF retreated 2 1/4 to 25 following its forecast that
second-quarter earnings per share would be about 47% lower
than a year earlier, when it posted net income of 67 cents a
share.
   Molecular Biosystems dropped 5/8 to 18 3/4. The company
said it expects to report earnings between 20 cents and 25
cents a share for the fiscal year ending next March, well
below most analysts' projections, as it emphasizes growth
over profits.
   Caterpillar dropped 7/8 to 64 1/4 after Prudential-Bache
lowered its investment rating and 1990 earnings estimate,
citing weak orders for the company's large machines in May.
   CPC International went up 1 1/2 to 80 1/4 and set a new
52-week high by peaking at 80 1/2. Michael Metz, a market
strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., told the investor report he
recommended the stock and said it "acts like it's under
accumulation" by a major corporate buyer.
   Liggett Group added 5/8 to 11 3/4. The company said it
plans to restructure its tobacco and sports-marketing units
as separate companies and said it may repurchase as many as
one million of its common shares.
   WMS Industries climbed 1 1/8 to 9 1/2. Newsletter writer
Charles LaLoggia commented favorably about WMS in a
television interview; he told the investor report it is
"reasonable" to consider the company as a possible takeover
target for Viacom. Sumner N. Redstone, Viacom's chairman,
holds a 28.9% stake in WMS.
   Vishay Intertechnology declined 7/8 to 21 3/8. The
company, which has about 12.4 million common and Class B
shares outstanding, said it is considering a public offering
of two million common shares.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
0.59 to 360.22. Volume totaled 10,550,000 shares.
   AT&amp;E rose 1 1/8 to 22 5/8. Bell Atlantic disclosed that it
had accumulated a stake in the company and plans to purchase
additional shares; it declined to provide the size of its
holding.
   Bolar Pharmaceutical, which said a lawsuit filed last week
by SmithKline Beecham would have a "material adverse effect"
on the company if the British-based firm wins the case, fell
3/4 to 5 7/8. The suit charges Bolar with fraud in obtaining
federal approval for a generic version of Dyazide,
SmithKline's blood-pressure drug.

   Mandela Plans to Reassure U.S. Business
   About Protection for Private Investments

   NEW YORK -- Nelson Mandela plans to reassure the American
business community today that a South Africa led by his
African National Congress would protect private investments.
   A number of business people and politicians have expressed
concern about talk within the ANC of nationalizing segments
of the South African economy as part of a plan to redress
inequities between that country's black and white
populations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a draft of a breakfast speech Mr. Mandela is scheduled
to give to business leaders at the World Trade Center, the
South African leader says, "We are sensitive to the fact that
as investors in a post-apartheid South Africa, you will need
to be confident about the security of your investments, an
adequate and equitable return on your capital and a general
climate of peace and stability."
   All investors, he continues, "should know it as a matter
of fact that the investment they make today, whether in the
house they build, the child they educate or the savings they
put into a bank, is not likely to vanish tomorrow because of
some arbitrary government action or a social upheaval
generated by continuing social injustice."
   In the draft speech, Mr. Mandela, deputy ANC president,
goes into no detail about the economy of a new South Africa.
He does say the economy will be mixed but adds, "we have no
blueprint as to the makeup of that mix."
   More specific material on the ANC's vision for South
Africa's economy is contained in a document developed by
economists from the ANC and the Congress of South African
Trade Unions. The document says the first responsibility of
the new government would be to meet basic food, housing and
employment needs, and it asserts this should be done through
a policy of promoting economic growth, rather than
supplementing incomes.
   Espousing positions not unlike those of the Republican
Party in the U.S., the ANC paper calls for battling
impoverished conditions by "creating new production capacity
through employment linkages rather than in the form of simple
income supplements." It also recommends imposing user charges
for some government services. The proposals were printed in a
newspaper edited by a top aide to Mr. Mandela.
   The paper calls for a halt to current efforts by the South
African government to turn some industries over to private
ownership and to deregulate others. And it recommends "as a
matter of fundamental policy," that an ANC-led government
should be prepared to "renationalize privatized state
assets." That might refer, for example, to the transportation
industry, which until recently was state-owned but has been
privatized by the government of President F.W. de Klerk.
   In a recent speech to corporate executives in
Johannesburg, Mr. Mandela said it is "eminently wrong" for
the government to restructure the economy "precisely at the
moment when the whole country and the world expect that
fundamental political change is in the offing. It would seem
only reasonable that so important a question as the disposal
of public property should be held over until a truly
representative government is in place."
   In the Johannesburg speech, which was made available by
ANC officials, Mr. Mandela said it is a mistaken view "that
the only words in the economic vocabulary that the ANC knows
are nationalization and redistribution." He said these are
among "many issues" to be considered as South Africans
discuss "the democratization and deracialization of economic
power."
   Mr. Mandela said a new South African government could
study antitrust laws in the U.S. and Great Britain "to
address the issue of how to ensure that there is no unhealthy
overconcentration of economic power."
   The policy recommendations of the economists from the ANC
and the Congress of South African Trade Unions urge "a
leading role" for the state "in the reconstruction of the
economy." The current state of land distribution is a
"central national grievance," according to the document.
   Both the recommendations and the Johannesburg speech say
that corporations in South Africa would have to bear a
greater tax burden. "The aim would be to reduce the burden of
direct and indirect taxation on sections of the community
least capable of looking after themselves," Mr. Mandela told
the South African corporate leaders, "and to shift more of
the load onto the corporate sector, without, of course,
producing a situation of diminishing returns."

   Conde Nast May
   Close or Sell Off
   Woman Magazine
   ----

   Conde Nast Publications Inc. may close its struggling
Woman magazine or sell the mass-market monthly to its editor,
Pat Miller, according to company executives.
   Conde Nast, a unit of S.I. Newhouse's Advance Publications
Inc., declined to comment on its plans for Woman. But the
company executives, who requested anonymity, said Conde Nast
has been frustrated in its attempts to boost advertising at
the unprofitable Woman, which is sold mostly at checkout
counters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The magazine, acquired in 1988, was Conde Nast's first
move beyond its upscale magazines, such as Vanity Fair, Vogue
and GQ, which are aimed at affluent readers. Conde Nast wooed
Ms. Miller from her post as editor of News Corp.'s New Woman
and charged her with improving the look and editorial content
of Woman.
   But Woman has had difficulty finding its place in the
Conde Nast empire; its editorial improvements haven't put it
in the class of other Conde Nast magazines, but at the same
time, the changes may have alienated the original readership.
And Woman has been particularly hard hit as national
advertisers cut their budgets in such magazines. In the first
quarter, Woman's ad pages dropped 16% from the like period in
1989. "The magazine is having trouble making money in this
milieu," said one Conde Nast executive.
   Woman is still a newsstand and checkout-counter powerhouse
-- selling an average of 440,000 copies a month -- and is
patterned after established titles such as Hearst Corp.'s
Cosmopolitan and New Woman. Woman's editorial matter focuses
on "self help and relationships," Ms. Miller said, "though in
a more cheerful way than it once did. It's about women's
problems and what they could do about them." Ms. Miller
declined to comment on reports that she may purchase the
magazine or that it may be closed.
   Industry executives noted that Conde Nast may want to
unload Woman to focus its efforts on a new magazine, Allure,
which it plans to launch next March. Allure would be the
first launch since the company successfully started Conde
Nast Traveler in 1987. More in the mold of Conde Nast's other
sophisticated titles, Allure will be "devoted to beauty,"
with stories on health, fitness, food and culture "as they
relate to beauty," according to company press releases.
   And observers noted that Woman's editorial approach under
Ms. Miller is alarmingly similar to that of another, far more
successful, Conde Nast magazine, Self. Self's new editor,
Alexandra Penney, as part of recent changes, now emphasizes
self-help articles over stories on fitness. "The new
direction of Self is moving very close to what Woman does,"
said one Conde Nast executive.
   Under former owner Harris Publications, Woman was
considered a cheap digest of reprinted stories. Ms. Miller
publishes largely original stories, with some book excerpts.
In her tenure, Woman's subscriptions have grown from almost
nothing to about 270,000 as of this coming September. But the
more-profitable area of circulation, newsstand and
checkout-counter sales, dropped 14% in the 1989 second half
from a year earlier. Total circulation in the 1989 period
fell 3.2% to 502,397.
   Advertising results have been mixed, too. Publisher
Rebecca Darwin has campaigned to rid the magazine of shoddy
direct-response ads, focusing on national advertisers. But
advertisers, many of whom don't consider Woman their primary
advertising buy, have been slow to react.

   PARIS -- France's seasonally adjusted industrial
production index rose 1.4% in April from March but showed a
0.3% drop from a year earlier, the National Statistics
Institute said.
   The figure was much better than previous forecasts by
economists, who were calling for a flat result. But the
latest data were heavily influenced by one-time factors that
boosted energy production by 15.2% during the month, while
all other sectors showed flat or lower output.

   Serious obstacles remained in talks between Donald Trump
and his bankers, as attention temporarily shifted to an
Atlantic City courtroom where the developer and casino owner
was dealt a setback.
   New Jersey Superior Court Judge Anthony Gibson denied a
motion by Mr. Trump to dismiss claims by the Pratt Hotel
Corp. that he violated antitrust laws. The decision paves the
way for a fall trial pitting Pratt against Mr. Trump and
Penthouse International Ltd.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pratt claims that Mr. Trump improperly interfered with its
contract with Penthouse to build a casino next to the Trump
Plaza casino. If Mr. Trump loses that antitrust case, he
could be subject to treble damages. Pratt officials have said
the total damages could be as high as $600 million.
   An attorney for Mr. Trump said the developer intends to
submit another motion for summary judgment, after pre-trial
fact finding is completed.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's bankers grew more pessimistic in
what has developed into marathon restructuring talks. Seven
banks have agreed to advance Mr. Trump $65 million, and about
70 smaller creditors are being asked to forgo some interest
payments on $2 billion in loans to Mr. Trump.
   But a full day of negotiations has yet to persuade a group
of four foreign banks who have purchased portions of loans
issued Mr. Trump by Chase Manhattan Corp. to approve certain
aspects of the deal. The four banks, Mitsubishi Trust &amp;
Banking Corp., Sumitomo Bank Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
and Dresdner Bank AG, have senior secured positions on Mr.
Trump's $75 million first mortgage on Trump Tower in New
York.
   The banks are scheduled to meet with Chase again today.
   Thursday, two banks that purchased parts of Chase's $200
million loan secured by Mr. Trump's West Side rail site, also
balked at the deal, according to a person close to the
negotiations. Those banks are said to be Yasuda Trust &amp;
Banking Co. (Japan) and Canada's Societe General de
Financement du Quebec.
   In order for the deal to go forward, the lenders with
secured loans must approve junior liens that would be put on
their properties. The addition of junior liens to fully
secured properties is still the proposal's largest stumbling
block.
   Many of Mr. Trump's unsecured foreign lenders are also
said to be still communicating with their home offices, and
have not yet definitively gone along with the proposal,
though they are considered less troublesome than the secured
lenders.
   With each passing day, time has become Mr. Trump's
greatest enemy, as he must finalize the restructuring
proposal by Tuesday night. At midnight Tuesday, he will be in
default of $43 million in bond payments and would almost
certainly lose control of Trump's Castle. The default could
also trigger defaults on some of Mr. Trump's other
properties.
   Lawyers and bankers are now working to put the papers in
order, so they will be prepared in case the deal is agreed to
by Tuesday.

   WILMINGTON -- Du Pont Co. said it plans to design four
"world scale" plants to produce its line of
hydrofluorocarbons, the diversified chemical company's
nonozone-depleting alternative to chlorofluorocarbons.
   The plants, planned for Corpus Christi, Texas; Louisville,
Ky.; Dordrecht, the Netherlands; and Chiba, Japan, are to
become operational between 1992 and 1995, Du Pont said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman said the plants will be capable of producing
more than 140 million pounds of hydrofluorocarbons annually
and could supply most world-wide needs through the end of the
century. Hydrofluorocarbons are used in refrigeration
products. The plants are to produce hydrofluorocarbons 134a,
152a and 125 for auto air conditioners, appliances and
commercial refrigeration.
   Du Pont said its overall costs of commercializing its line
of chlorofluorocarbon alternatives could total more than $1
billion in research, development and capital projects,
including $240 million invested through 1990 and projected
costs over the next 10 years. The company wouldn't say how
much it plans to invest in the four plants.
   The sites in the Netherlands and Japan would add to Du
Pont's alternatives plants in Maitland, Ontario, and
Humberside, Britain, the company said.
   Du Pont had 1989 sales of $750 million from its freon
products division, which produces hydrofluorocarbons.

   TOKYO -- As Donald Trump's empire crumbles, the real
estate mogul is turning up his sales pitch to cash-rich
Japanese investors. But Mr. Trump's debt crisis is turning
off Japanese already repelled by his exorbitant prices and
high-handed attitude, Tokyo real estate agents say.
   Mr. Trump's representatives have been frequent fliers to
Japan of late. Earlier this year, Trump saleswomen set up
shop in the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo to promote the Trump
Palace, his condominium project presently under construction
in New York. His luxury cruiser Trump Princess is sailing
Japan's shores, looking for a buyer at an asking price of
$115 million. Mr. Trump himself came to Japan a few months
ago trying unsuccessfully to get help to refinance the Plaza
Hotel, and he personally launched a sales campaign during his
visit.
</LP>

   But Japan's investors, who in the past rushed to buy into
Trump Tower and Trump Parc for their prime location and
guaranteed name value, are no longer impressed. "There will
be nobody buying now," says a Tokyo real estate agent who
sells Trump real estate.
   Moreover, as Mr. Trump's debt woes deepen and he struggles
to refund some $2 billion of debt, some who already have
bought from him are rethinking their investments. "People
who've actually purchased are quite concerned about what will
happen in the future" to property values, says Wataru
Iwamura, a sales representative for overseas projects at
Haseko Corp., a major Japanese real estate company promoting
Trump properties. "We tell them that if they let go now, that
would be thinking of real estate investment on a much too
short term basis," he adds.
   Even before Mr. Trump's financial troubles came to a boil
this year, his name alone was no longer enough to lure
Japanese investors to pay his high prices in the slumping New
York market, Tokyo agents say. Prices of the Trump Palace
condominiums, which start at around $350,000, are about 50%
more expensive than the average prices of property in the
area.
   "The Japanese have started to study" U.S. real estate
trends, says Seishi Matsuo, general manager of the
international marketing department of Kyodo Advertising
Agency Co. Mr. Trump, he says, "probably hasn't realized
that." The Tokyo company publishes a quarterly magazine
giving tips on foreign real estate investment.
   Others say that Mr. Trump's anti-Japanese rhetoric also
has discouraged Japanese investors from buying his property.
"He sweet-talks the Japanese buyers {in Tokyo} and then
criticizes them in New York," says a Tokyo real estate agent
involved in the sales who declines to be identified.
"Japanese investors aren't stupid. They know what's going
on."
   On a practical level, the agent says, Mr. Trump's
organization has alienated Japanese investors by not
translating contract forms into Japanese, or promptly
answering investors' questions, the agent says.
   To be sure, Japanese investors are still leading the pack
in purchasing Trump Palace property. About 70% to 80% of the
buyers so far have been Japanese, Tokyo agents estimate.
Still, Japanese sales are much lower than the agents'
original estimates, and most of the investors are owners of
small private companies who have little experience in foreign
property. Only a third of the 283 Trump Palace condominiums
have found buyers since going on sale at the end of last year
-- much lower than agents' initial expectations.
   The Japanese hesitancy to invest isn't confined just to
Trump properties or even New York. In the past year, as New
York has fallen out of favor, investors have focused more on
smaller U.S. cities -- particularly Seattle and other West
Coast locales. Still, the magnitude of Japanese investment
has dropped. Although the number of Japanese investments in
U.S. real estate increased in 1989 from the year before, the
total amount invested dropped nearly 11% to $14.77 billion,
according to statistics compiled by Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co.
Europe is also increasingly popular.
   The enormity of Mr. Trump's troubles probably is going to
make investors even more careful about the U.S. real estate
market. "They feel that if someone as big as Trump is going
to fall, they better be cautious about investing in the
U.S.," says Michisaburo Hayashi, president of the Real Estate
Management Research Center in Tokyo.

   Mitek Systems Inc., a San Diego-based computer concern,
said that it expects to report a wider loss for its third
quarter ending June 30, but that profit for the year ending
Sept. 30 should still be "significantly higher" than that a
year earlier.
   In the fiscal 1989 third quarter, Mitek had a net loss of
$423,000, on revenue of $3.3 million. For fiscal 1989, it
earned $403,000, or six cents a share, on revenue of $18.1
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mitek said earnings and revenue in the current quarter
have been hurt by stretch-outs in its government contracts, a
slowdown in spending, and costs related to its acquisition in
March of Tempest Products Organization, a unit of New
York-based Sequa Corp. But Mitek said it is experiencing a
high level of bidding activity that could be reflected in
improved fiscal fourth-quarter performance.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Mitek shares were
quoted at $1.625, bid, up 6.25 cents.

   Coniston
   To Disband

   Colder Environment
   For Debt Financing
   Caused the Decision

   NEW YORK -- Coniston Partners, one of the best known
corporate raiders of the 1980s, will soon be no more.
   Keith R. Gollust, Paul E. Tierney Jr., and Augustus K.
Oliver, three Ivy leaguers who once terrorized huge
corporations from Allegis Corp. to Gillette Inc., are
disbanding their main $700 million investment pool and
returning the money to their investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Coniston executives said they are making the move to
reflect the new environment of the 1990s, in which companies
can't easily obtain debt financing for the type of highly
leveraged transactions Coniston often advocated. Also, they
said, the stock market's recent record gains have made
undervalued companies more difficult to find.
   Although the partners were loath to say so, their decision
is the latest sign of the end of the 1980s acquisition era.
"The very favorable environment that encouraged this type of
activity has changed," said partner Keith R. Gollust, adding:
"The business that we used to be in, we don't plan to be in
anymore."
   Coniston began informing its investors yesterday that
while it plans to maintain its two existing investments in TW
Services Inc. and United Airlines parent UAL Corp., it
intends to return the rest of its cash to investors early
next month.
   Instead of using the Coniston pool to bankroll its raids,
the partnership of Gollust, Tierney and Oliver will raise
financing as needed on a deal-by-deal basis. Although they
may seek some acquistions, they plan to branch out, using
their own funds, into venture capital, real estate, and
restructuring of troubled companies.
   Formed in February 1982, Coniston typically would buy 10%
to 20% of the stock of a target company, then use that block
of stock as a club to press for drastic action -- a breakup,
asset sale, or even a takeover that would enable Coniston to
sell out at a profit.
   In its investment style, Coniston often acted like
corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn or Irwin Jacobs. Yet the
partnership was formed by three Wall Streeters who previously
provided legal and investment banking advice to corporations.
Mr. Gollust and Mr. Oliver have undergraduate degrees from
Princeton and Yale, respectively, and Mr. Tierney has a
business degree from Harvard.
   The Coniston partnership generated returns of more than
40% annually to its investors before subtracting the
partners' 20% share of profits. Yet in the wake of the
collapse of the junk-bond market last year and banks' current
reluctance to make loans for highly leveraged transactions,
it was confronted with the fact that its past strategy
wouldn't work as well.
   "Any form of restructuring or sale of the business
generally involves creating highly leveraged companies," said
Mr. Gollust, adding: "Obviously, financing for highly
leveraged companies is harder to obtain."
   One example of that difficulty is Coniston's $400 million
investment in an 11.8% stake in the stock of UAL, where
Coniston is supporting an uphill union effort to obtain
financing for a $4.38 billion leveraged buy-out. At UAL's
current stock price of $156.50 a share, Coniston has a slight
loss on an investment made last October in the wake of the
failure of the unions' first buy-out attempt.
   By comparison, an earlier 1987 investment in Allegis,
which forced the sale of the company's hotel and rental-car
units, resulted in a $175 million profit.
   Last year, for the first time since at least 1985,
Coniston's investment returns lagged the stock market by a
wide margin. One its main funds returned 14%, compared with
31.7% for the Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. 500 stock index.
   The partners said they recognize that time horizons to
achieve their goals in each investment will have to be
longer. Coniston has already become a long-term investor in
TW Services. "Coniston in particular really wasn't well
suited to the investment horizon we think is going to be
necessary in the 1990s," said Mr. Oliver.
   "By not having that fund under management, we don't have
the pressure of having to engage in that sort of investment
activity," Mr. Oliver added. He said the three executives
plan to engage in a broader range of activity with their own
capital, seeking outside funds only as needed.
   Coniston also plans to reorganize its $200 million fund
for risk arbitrage, which invests in takeover stocks and in
securities of troubled companies, such as junk bonds trading
at a big discount from their issue price. That fund will be
reconstituted as two funds to reflect those two goals.
   Mr. Oliver said the changes won't result in any job losses
among Coniston's 15 employees. Nor, he said, will the three
partners necessarily reduce the amount of time they spend on
business.
   "This is just a recognition of the fact that times have
changed, and we want to change with them."

   Amendment
   To Protect Flag
   Killed by House

   Vote of 254-177 Falls Short
   Of Two-Thirds Majority;
   Legislation Also Fails

CONGRESS (CNG)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The House killed a proposed constitutional
amendment barring flag desecration, an outcome that seemed
unlikely when the Supreme Court threw out the federal
flag-protection law 10 days ago.
   After a long day of speeches defending the flag, the
Constitution or both, the lawmakers voted 254-177 in favor of
the amendment, but that was more than 30 votes short of the
two-thirds majority required.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Proponents of the amendment were confident last week that
they would muster the votes for passage. This week, however,
the amendment lost momentum when the House Judiciary
Committee sent it to the floor without a recommendation. Then
on Wednesday, the Rules Committee voted to bring the measure
to the floor yesterday, denying proponents time they said
they needed to round up additional votes.
   Also helping opponents of the amendment was the
introduction of a bill that would outlaw flag desecration
likely to cause violence. The proposed statute was narrowly
drafted to try to fall within exceptions to the First
Amendment that the Supreme Court has already carved out.
While it was ultimately defeated, 236-178, after the
amendment failed, it gave opponents of the amendment a chance
to cast a vote for the flag.
   Charges of political maneuvering were leveled by both
sides. "What is at stake," said Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas),
an opponent of the amendment, "is the self-respect of every
member of the House." Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said
"history will regard this as a paroxysm of fear" should the
amendment pass.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.), a sponsor
of the amendment, said that the measure should be voted "up
or down" without considering the proposed statute.
   Opponents pointed out that the amendment would be the
first substantive change in the Bill of Rights since its
incorporation into the Constitution 200 years ago. But Rep
Lynn Martin (R., Ill.) countered: "You would think we were
burning the Bill of Rights. Nothing could be further from the
truth."
   But the strength of the anti-amendment vote indicates that
the opposition strategy -- to paint the issue as the flag vs.
the Bill of Rights -- was successful.
   The negative votes reached 145, the number necessary to
defeat the measure, 10 minutes into the 15 minutes allotted
for the vote. When a vote passes or fails well before the
time allotted, undecided members are given a political
windfall, allowing them to take the safer political route.
   Addressing the House late in the day, Speaker Thomas Foley
(D., Wash.) encouraged opponents of the bill to resist
political pressure to pass the amendment. He pictured the
vote as a non-partisan issue and appealed directly to
Republicans for support. "If it is not conservative to
protect the Bill of Rights," he said, "I do not know what
conservatism is today."
   Mr. Foley's appearance in the well of the House
underscored his direct involvement in the fight. From the
outset, President Bush's demands for a constitutional
amendment have provoked an almost visceral opposition from
the speaker. The son of a judge, Mr. Foley is steeped in
tradition and by nature cautious. While these qualities
contribute to a sometimes frustrating, often passive style,
they served him well in the fight against the amendment.
   Rank-and-file Democrats watched with a certain joy to see
Mr. Foley assert himself openly. Behind the scenes, the
speaker called members personally and was an early advocate
of a strategy to take on the issue squarely on the floor. "It
is a clear victory for the speaker," said Rep. Matthew McHugh
(D., N.Y.). "It validates not only his substantive position
but his strategy in bringing it up early."
   Rep. Foley received a standing ovation from both
Republicans and Democrats after his address.
   The debate, centering on questions about basic American
values, allowed members to quote liberally from sources such
as the Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance, Thomas
Jefferson, James Madison and Voltaire. But contemporary
figures weren't left out, as John Lennon, Andrew Dice Clay
and Norman Rockwell were also among those cited.
   The proposed statute, introduced by Reps. Jim Cooper (D.,
Tenn.) and Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), called for fines of as much
as $100,000 for desecrating the flag in a manner that was
likely to incite violence and fines of as much as $250,000
for the destruction of publicly owned flags on federal
property. The bill was designed to agree with previous
Supreme Court decisions on free speech. In 1969, the high
court suggested that speech may not be protected if it is
intended to incite imminent violence.
   While failure in the House kills the amendment, the Senate
is likely to go ahead with a vote if only to give members a
chance to go on record on the issue. A constitutional
amendment requires a two-thirds vote of both houses of
congress, plus the approval of the legislatures of
three-fourths of the states.

   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- MGM/UA Communications Co. and Pathe
Communications Corp. revised and extended their agreement for
the movie studio to be acquired by Pathe, writing another
chapter in MGM/UA's two-year saga to sell itself.
   The two companies reached a $1.31 billion merger agreement
under which MGM/UA holders wouldn't receive the bulk of the
payment for their shares until October. A small interim
payment is designed to partly compensate for the latest
delay.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A $20-a-share tender offer launched in March for all of
MGM/UA's 61 million shares was set to expire tomorrow after
being set back several times.
   Under the new agreement, holders of common and preferred
would receive a total of $21.50 a share, of which $4 would be
paid July 20. Closing of the transaction and payment of the
remaining $17.50 a share is expected on or before Oct. 23.
Time Warner Inc. said its agreement with Pathe to guarantee
or provide outright $650 million of the original $1.2 billion
purchase price remains intact. Pathe has been trying to
persuade the New York-based entertainment and publishing
giant to ease the terms under which the financial backing was
promised.
   "We assume the purpose of Pathe's obtaining the {deadline}
extension is to continue our discussions, and we are
continuing them," a Time Warner spokeswoman said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
MGM/UA shares fell 12.5 cents to $16.50, Pathe shares were
unchanged at $3.875, and Time Warner shares fell $1.75 to
$104.
   It appeared this week that Pathe's acquisition of MGM/UA
was near collapse amid reports that negotiations between
Pathe and Time Warner were deadlocked. Pathe has had trouble
raising about $450 million in equity to meet terms of its
agreement with Time Warner. Pathe is arguing that loans it
has obtained from Comfinance S.A., a Luxembourg-based
affiliate of Pathe principal Giancarlo Parretti, meet Time
Warner's requirement.
   Analysts have raised serious questions about the
Comfinance financing package, which includes a mix of asset
sales and short-term loans from overseas lenders.
   For example, Banque Arabe et Internationale
d'Investissement is supposed to provide a $75 million
one-week line of credit to Comfinance and a $10 million
credit line to a Pathe affiliate. A further $50 million is to
come from an advance by Amsterdam-based PAN-ASS B.V. from a
proposed sale of certain assets by Comfinance to a PAN-ASS
affiliate. And $91 million would be advanced to a Pathe
affiliate by Deepbridge B.V., Amsterdam.
   Under the revised pact, holders will keep the $4-a-share
payment they receive in July even if the merger isn't
completed, a Pathe spokesman said. The payment will be made
in part from an escrow account into which Pathe has already
deposited $200 million. Pathe is required to deposit into the
account an additional $53 million by July 16; $50 million
more by Aug. 21; and a further $50 million by Sept. 20.
   Tracinda Corp., a holding company through which financier
Kirk Kerkorian controls MGM/UA, has agreed to vote for the
modified Pathe acquisition, which is structured as a merger
rather than a tender offer.
   MGM/UA announced in April 1988 that it formed a committee
to consider the company's possible sale. Since then, several
deals have collapsed. Later that year, talks with Sony Corp.,
the Japanese consumer electronics giant, fell apart over
price. Last September, MGM/UA turned down a $1.4 billion bid
from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. in favor of a $1.5 billion
offer from Qintex Australia Ltd. That deal foundered in
October after Qintex failed to deliver a $50 million letter
of credit.

   LONG GROVE, Ill. -- Kemper Corp. said it named Allan L.
Sher chairman and chief executive officer of its Bateman
Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. brokerage unit.
   Mr. Sher, 58 years old, has served as vice chairman of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. since January. The brokerage firm
Mr. Sher is leaving is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
proceedings, and virtually all its operations have been
liquidated.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kemper said Richard Capalbo, 43, chairman and chief
executive of Bateman since February 1988, resigned "to pursue
other interests." Mr. Capalbo couldn't be reached.
   James R. Boris, chairman of Kemper Securities Group
Holdings, said: "Rich Capalbo and I just have different
management styles. We both came to realize that." Mr. Boris
said he expects Mr. Sher to "help us improve profitability"
at Bateman, which Mr. Boris said had operating losses last
year and so far this year.
   Bateman, based in Los Angeles, is one of five regional
securities brokerage firms owned by Kemper, an insurance and
financial services firm. Late last month, Kemper said it
would take a $126.5 million charge to pare its brokerage
operations.
   A Kemper spokesman said the chairman of its Blunt Ellis &amp;
Loewi Inc. brokerage unit in Milwaukee resigned May 24, and a
successor hasn't been named.

   DURHAM, N.C. -- Liggett Group Inc. said it is dividing its
business into two subsidiary companies and renaming the
parent company.
   The tobacco company also said that Bennett S. LeBow was
elected chairman, succeeding William Weksel. Mr. Weksel said
his resignation is connected to the restructuring of BSL
Partners, a New York-based partnership consisting of himself
and Mr. LeBow. BSL Partners owns a majority interest in
Brooke Partners L.P., also based in New York, which in turn
controls Liggett.
</LP>

   Liggett said its president and chief executive officer,
K.V.R. Dey Jr., will retire effective June 30. A spokesman
said any decisions about Mr. Dey's successor will be left to
the board.
   Liggett, which will rename itself Brooke Group Ltd., said
it will separate into Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co. and Impel
Marketing Inc. The former will be renamed Ligget Group Inc.
after the parent completes its name change.
   A company spokesman said the moves are designed to allow
the two subsidiaries to focus on their respective businesses:
tobacco products, and sales and marketing of sports and
entertainment products. Moreover, changing the name of the
company, Liggett said, will enable it to expand into other
businesses.
   Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco's headquarters and manufacturing
facilities will remain in Durham, together with its
administrative and factory personnel. Impel Marketing will
also have its headquarters in the Durham area.
   Liggett also said it may periodically purchase as many as
one million of its common shares in the open market, in
private transactions or otherwise, depending on market
conditions.

natural-gas contract disputes, citing similar litigation with
other companies, but it did say that it will recover most of
its settlement costs from customers and has already
established adequate reserves for the rest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some of the other lawsuits arose out of PS New Mexico's
1985 purchase of Gas Co. of New Mexico from Southern Union, a
natural gas distribution company based in Dallas. Southern
Union sold the unit as part of its own settlement of a
price-fixing suit filed against it in 1979 by consumer groups
who were later joined by PS New Mexico and the state of New
Mexico.

   AIDS Researcher Believes Virus Needs
   Second Microbe Before Becoming Lethal

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute,
widely considered to be the discoverer of the AIDS virus, now
believes the virus needs an accomplice to become deadly.
   His theory may prove to be the loneliest scientific battle
of the French researcher's career.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Montagnier believes a second infection by a microbe
called mycoplasma may turn the AIDS virus from a lazy
organism into a voracious killer of human cells. At a news
conference at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS
here, he said he hasn't performed certain tests that may be
important in proving his theory.
   The scientist suggests that mycoplasma can be treated with
tetracycline-type drugs, perhaps allaying the effects of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He has published
test-tube studies supporting his theory.
   Mycoplasma is a tiny bacterium that oozes around without
cell walls and causes one of the most common forms of
pneumonia. More than a year ago, Dr. Shyh-Ching Lo of the
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington said he had
discovered a second virus implicated in AIDS. It turned out
not to be a virus but a novel strain of mycoplasma.
   Dr. Montagnier has cast his lot with Dr. Lo. He said he
thinks the accomplice mycoplasma acts directly to turn on and
rev up the virus, transforming infected people into people
with AIDS. "We think the difference between the slow,
low-reproducing virus we've isolated in {symptom-free}
patients, and the fast, high-reproducing virus in AIDS
patients, may be due to mycoplasma," he said.
   At a question-and-answer session, Dr. Montagnier was asked
to suggest a dose of the antibiotic tetracycline. He said it
was "too complicated" to discuss.
   Laurie Garrett, a reporter for Newsday, asked whether Dr.
Montagnier had checked his experiments to rule out the
possibility that mycoplasma wasn't directly accelerating the
AIDS virus, but only nudging the immune system to churn out
cell-growth factors long known to gear up AIDS infection.
   "I haven't done that test," he said.
   Dr. Montagnier's assertions about mycoplasma were met with
skepticism by one U.S. government official in an interview.
"It's hard for me to believe in it as a serious primary
pathogen. . . . I can't see it as the necessary co-factor"
for making AIDS a killer, said Dr. James Curran, head of AIDS
activities at Atlanta's U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
   Though all hypotheses are still open, Dr. Curran said he
rather sees mycoplasma as a fellow traveler, "the equivalent
of a maggot."
   At the AIDS conference, Dr. Montagnier received a
relatively minor speaking slot. The American Medical
Association stepped in to co-sponsor his news conference,
which drew AIDS activists, journalists, scientists and
community physicians.
   Dr. Curran said, "Dr. Montagnier and Dr. Lo are
approaching each other on a limb. Dr. Lo was out there, but
Dr. Montagnier is crawling out to meet him."

   The troubled retailer, operating under a Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization, also received clearance to resume
construction on a distribution center in Leesport, Pa., and
to make vacation payments to former employees who left the
company before April 25, the date of the bankruptcy filing.
The case is being heard by Judge Howard C. Buschman III in
federal bankruptcy court in New York.

<TEXT>
   Judge Buschman reserved judgment on the closing of two
Ames stores in Cincinnati and Bloomsburg, Pa., pending
further testimony from affected employees and Ames management
at a hearing July 11.
   The 219 stores will be shut in August and September after
inventories and clearance sales, an Ames spokesman said. The
company has said it needs to close the stores and let go
their 18,000 employees to stem losses and regain
profitability.
   "While we recognize the impact this will have, we had to
take this action to preserve the jobs of the majority of the
Ames employees," said Stephen L. Pistner, Ames chief
executive officer.

   In April, Hanson acquired 45% of Peabody for $504 million

company from Newmont Mining Corp. A move by Amax Inc. to top
the bid was quickly countered by Hanson with a new price of
$725.6 million. The remaining Peabody shares will be closed
to new bidders after June 25, and Newmont holders are to vote
on the sale June 27; the acquisition is expected to be
completed within five days of the vote.

   The real estate holding company also said it expects to

nearly half of the 1989 loss was sustained by Tadiran, its
consumer and defense electronics subsidiary. Tadiran and
another subsidiary, Soltam, which makes artillery and other
weapons, were hurt by cutbacks in Defense Ministry purchases.
   The 1989 loss compared with red ink of 430 million shekels

   Apple Says Top U.S. Sales Aide to Work
   Part Time; Dionne to Succeed Coldrick

   Apple Computer Inc. said its top U.S. sales executive is
moving to part-time status barely a year after the computer
maker gave him a huge compensation package to keep him from
bolting to a competitor. The move is part of a continuing
shake-up of Apple's domestic sales and marketing
organization, which has been under fire this year because of
weak revenue growth.
   Apple said Michael Dionne, vice president of Apple's
Southwestern sales operations, will succeed William B.
Coldrick as senior vice president, sales, for Apple USA. Mr.
Coldrick has been with Apple since 1982.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   People familiar with the situation said Mr. Coldrick had
been eased out of his job by Michael H. Spindler, who took
over daily management of Apple in February and is said to be
disappointed with the company's domestic sales and marketing
performance.
   Only a year ago, Mr. Coldrick was considered so valuable
to Apple that the Cupertino, Calif., company gave him a $2.1
million compensation package rather than lose him to a
competitor.
   However, in an interview Mr. Coldrick denied he had been
stripped of his position, saying he informed Apple 18 months
ago of his plans to reduce his workload. "After 25 years in
the computer industry, I came to the decision that my
personal life and my family were going to take priority,"
said Mr. Coldrick, 48 years old.
   Mr. Coldrick declined to comment on why Apple would offer
him a huge compensation package last year if it knew of his
intentions.
   Apple is looking to hire a president of Apple USA, its
domestic sales and marketing organization. In January, Allan
Z. Loren was ousted from that position, and it has been
vacant since.
   Mr. Loren's departure and the diminution of Mr. Coldrick's
role raise questions about the scope of the role played by
John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer. Recently, Mr.
Sculley said at a software conference that he planned to
spend the next two years overseeing Apple's
product-development activities, indicating that Mr. Spindler
would sort out the company's sales and marketing problems.
   Messrs. Loren and Coldrick were loyalists of Mr. Sculley,
himself a marketing whiz during his tenure at PepsiCo. But
successive years of lackluster marketing campaigns by Apple
have prompted Mr. Sculley to turn to Mr. Spindler, credited
with energizing Apple's European business, for sales sizzle.
Mr. Spindler, who is considered likely to go outside Apple
for a new president of Apple USA, is likely to bring more
change to the company.
   But change is something senior executives at Apple are
used to. As Mr. Coldrick observed in a personal note to Mr.
Sculley in February: "Change is always difficult. Change
without chaos is even more difficult to achieve."

   Hog, Pork Belly Futures Contracts Continue Fall
   On Signs of Markets, Food Firms Cutting Purchases

   CHICAGO -- Prices of hog and pork belly futures contracts
continued to sink from their superheated levels amid
scattered signs that supermarkets and food companies are
cutting back their purchases.
   Because of soaring wholesale prices this winter and
spring, retailers have had to push up the price of many
pork-related food items to record levels. Demand initially
remained strong for pork despite the higher prices because
consumers had little alternative for a red meat; beef prices
have also been setting record highs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In recent weeks, however, some grocery store chains have
begun promoting cheaper meats, such as turkey, as an
alternative to high-priced pork and beef.
   In trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday,
the pork belly contract for July delivery dropped its maximum
daily limit of two cents a pound to settle at 61.4 cents a
pound.
   The price for a pork belly, which is sliced to make bacon,
is still high. Yesterday's settlement price is 83% higher
than the price that the July contract was trading at a year
ago.
   Prices of hogs and pork bellies climbed through the winter
and spring because the supply of hogs ready for slaughter had
shriveled, kicking off fierce competition among
slaughterhouses to buy them.
   All this was the delayed effect of drought-related damage
to the 1988 grain harvests. The profitability of feeding hogs
shrank as grain grew more expensive. Producers began trimming
the number of piglets born on their farms, resulting in a
tight supply of mature hogs this year.
   Because of the backlash from consumers, many analysts are
reasoning that hog and pork belly prices have peaked for the
year. However, many of those same analysts are predicting
that hog and pork belly prices might regain some ground this
summer because it is the season in which the supply of fat
hogs is tightest.
   Where prices go after that hinges on how fast hog farmers
rebuild their herds. One indication of that will come next
Friday when the Agriculture Department is slated to release
its quarterly survey of hog farmers.
   Some analysts expect the government to report that the
number of new pigs born this spring continued a year-to-year
decline that started several quarters ago, which would signal
that hog prices might remain relatively high for several more
months. It takes about six months to raise a hog for
slaughter.
   Tom O'Hare, a livestock analyst at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co., said he expects the government to report that
the total number of hogs on June 1 was down 3% from a year
earlier.
   Prices of cattle futures contracts settled mixed and
slightly changed.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices fell. The September contract was off
$59 a metric ton to $1,204. Trading was largely on a
technical basis, according to one analyst who said selling by
dealers depressed prices. As the September contract fell
below $1,240 and then $1,220, the drop accelerated as selling
orders waiting at those levels were touched off, the analyst
said. However, at its low of $1,201, the September contract
leveled off as demand developed. Concern about the 1990-91
season's supplies has eased, the analyst said, as growing
weather in West Africa and Brazil, the major growing areas,
continues to be excellent. Another analyst observed that the
market has resumed its downward trend because of abundant
supplies, after climbing in reaction to the Ivory Coast's
political turmoil. The Ivory Coast is the world's leading
cocoa producer, but the turmoil never disrupted the cocoa
industry.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices recovered after two days of
declines. The July contract was up 0.75 cent a pound to
$1.1060. In the previous two sessions, July dropped a total
of 4.05 cents. Wednesday's sell-off of over three cents a
pound was exaggerated as traders overreacted to estimates
that London Metal Exchange warehouse supplies of copper might
rise as much as 30,000 tons over the next three weeks, one
analyst said. Estimates now are that exchange copper
inventories to be announced today will be practically
unchanged, the analyst said. The U.S. gross national product
for the first quarter was a little better than expected,
rising 1.9%, vs. a gain of about 1.3% generally forecast, he
said. However, overall, the economic picture doesn't continue
to favor copper at the moment, he said. In particular, he
noted slowdowns in the automotive and housing industries,
major users of copper.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: The July contract extended Wednesday's
strong advance, and deferred months rebounded from recent
declines. July ended with a gain of 5.15 cents a pound at
$1.7915, which increased the July contract's premium over
September by two cents to 7.30 cents. September was up 3.15
cents to $1.7185. With the cash price for the concentrate at
over $2 a pound, well above the futures market, processors
who have bought contracts may seek to take delivery against
July contracts, said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. The first day for the issuance of delivery notices is
July 2. Many traders who previously sold contracts short in
anticipation of price declines are speculators and
computer-guided funds, neither of which are likely to deliver
the commodity and instead may have to buy back contracts, she
said.

   Foreign Exchange:
   Dollar Ends Trading Mostly Higher;
   Yen Is Sold for Pound, Australian Unit

   NEW YORK -- The yen was the loser as Asian investors moved
their money from the low-yielding Japanese currency to the
British pound and Australian dollar, both buttressed by high
domestic interest rates. The flow of international capital
left the U.S. dollar higher against most other major
currencies.
   The market's devotion to interest rate differentials among
nations stems from a recent lack of clear exchange-rate
trends. Its propensity for non-dollar cross-trading has
increased as dealers seek to exploit momentary profit
opportunities in an unfocused market.

   "Some are of the opinion that the summer market has begun,
which is very appropriate," because summer began yesterday,
said Carol Callanan, assistant vice president for Credit
Lyonnais in New York.
   But Ms. Callanan said talk of summer doldrums really
should wait until after German monetary union takes effect
July 1.
   The foreign exchange market lacks "guts" amid political
changes around the world, said Peter Connelly, foreign
exchange manager for Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, so
participants are taking refuge in short-term cross-trading
positions.
   In Asian trading, Japanese investment trusts and life
insurance companies were seen buying Australian dollars and
British pounds with yen. Both the Australian dollar and the
pound are attractive because of domestic interest rates of
15%.
   The Australian dollar reached an intraday high of 79.10
U.S. cents by midday in New York after crossing two
resistance levels.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6778
marks, down from 1.6785 marks late Wednesday in New York. The
U.S. currency also was changing hands at 154.80 yen, up from
153.93 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.7200, down from
$1.7215.
   At midmorning in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at
154.90 yen; it closed Thursday in Tokyo at 154.60 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6770
marks, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6780 marks.
   Pat O'Brien, chief dealer for Australia's State Bank of
Victoria in New York, said Thursday that the Australian
currency's appeal spread to other currency sectors throughout
the global day. "With the problems in Canada, a lot of people
are taking the money they once put in the Canadian dollar and
moving into the Australian dollar and the pound," he said,
referring to Canada's constitutional dispute over Quebec.
   Sterling also benefited from yen selling, but its gain
against the dollar was halted in Asian trading at $1.7265. By
the end of the global trading day, the pound had given up all
its early gains against the dollar and more.
   The British currency continues to be aided by speculation
about the U.K.'s entry into the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System.
   The proposal Wednesday by U.K. Chanchellor of the
Exchequer John Major for a "hard" European currency unit was
interpreted by the foreign exchange market yesterday as
showing new seriousness about European cooperation.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $350.70 an ounce, up 20 cents. Estimated
volume was a light 1.7 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $349.75 an ounce.

   Degussa AG, a West German metal and chemical company, said
RWE AG, West Germany's largest utility and energy concern,
agreed to boost its interest in Nukem G.m.b.H. to 90% from
55% by acquiring a 35% stake from Degussa. Financial details
weren't disclosed.
   The deal would complete the reorganization of the West
German nuclear fuel-processing company, which ran into
trouble in 1987, following charges of bribery of government
officials and breaking rules in shipping and storing nuclear
materials. In early 1988, Degussa took management control of
Nukem, but RWE subsequently became the parent of Nukem when
RWE raised its stake in the company to 55%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Degussa said the reorientation of Nukem away from the
nuclear industry and toward environmental, solar energy and
process-engineering technology has been successful, but has
strengthened the company's affinity to the activities of RWE.
For that reason, Degusa said, both companies agreed that "RWE
should take more shares in Nukem."

   Pier 1 Imports Inc. said it achieved record sales and
earnings in its first quarter ended June 2.
   The Fort Worth, Texas, specialty retailer recorded net
income of $7.7 million, up 15% from the $6.7 million reported
in the period ended May 27, 1989. Per-share net, after
payment of preferred dividends, rose to 22 cents from 19
cents a year earlier. Sales increased 22% to $138.4 million
from $113.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Clark A. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that sales were hurt by bad weather in many consumer
areas and by a softness in demand for furniture and
home-related items. But the company's financial results were
helped by "strong expense control and a successful
inventory-balancing program."
   Pier 1 said it opened 16 new stores during the quarter,
while closing two. The company expects to open 68 more stores
by year end.

   National Mercantile Bancorp expects a second-quarter net
loss of about $1 million after a $3.1 million pretax charge.
   In the year-ago quarter, the Los Angeles bank holding
company reported net income of $919,000, or 36 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   National Mercantile said the charge reflects severance
costs related to the April resignation of the company's
former president, the write-off of a personal loan to a
former thrift executive, and an increase in the loan-loss
reserve.
   Shareholder equity at the end of the quarter will be $29.8
million, compared with $22.9 million a year earlier. Loans
outstanding rose to $270 million from $198 million.
   William T. Hughes, the new president, said that "the
second half of 1990 will be very profitable" with the
entertainment banking division showing positive returns and
the commercial banking division demonstrating healthy growth.
   For the first half, the company expects a net loss of
$350,000. A year earlier, net was $1.7 million, or 67 cents a
share.

   The economy grew at a 1.9% annual rate in the first

   Allowing Bonds to Snap a 4-Day Losing Streak

   NEW YORK -- The bond market snapped out of a four-day
losing streak yesterday as investors brushed aside negative
economic reports and pushed prices moderately higher.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 3/8 point
higher yesterday, a gain of $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, eased slightly to 8.49%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Trading, however, was bumpy. Prices were higher in early
trading due to modest buying on the part of Japanese
investors. But the market moved lower briefly after the
government reported that first-quarter gross national product
was stronger than previously estimated. That was bearish for
bonds because a stronger economy reduces the likelihood that
the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates.
   The market had recovered from the GNP report when the
government reported that the budget deficit widened to $42.55
billion in May from a $25.43 billion deficit a year earlier.
   Traders expected the market to decline sharply on the
news, but instead "the number came out, the market went down
briefly then came right back," said Raymond Stone, a managing
director at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates, Princeton,
N.J. "That suggests that there was a strong underlying bid in
the market," he said.
   Speculators who had established "short" positions earlier
in the day, betting prices would slip in response to the May
budget deficit report, were forced to scramble to cover those
positions. That helped to push prices even higher. In a short
sale, dealers and professional traders sell borrowed
securities and later seek to make a profit by replacing what
was borrowed with cheaper securities. Yesterday, that
strategy backfired for some traders.
   Analysts caution against reading too much into yesterday's
rally. "Bond prices can move up and down almost on whim
because of low volume," said Brian Fabbri, a managing
director and chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities
Inc.
   Mr. Fabbri believes notes and bonds will remain stuck in
tight trading bands, continuing the recent pattern, at least
until the release of the June employment report on July 6.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The payment-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. stumbled
after enjoying a robust run-up on Wednesday. Payment-in-kind
bonds, which are extremely volatile, pay interest in the form
of more securities instead of cash.
   Junk-bond traders attributed the declines to light
profit-taking and some investor skepticism about plans to
refinance the debt-burdened company.
   Prices of both RJR payment-in-kind issues, which rose more
than six points Wednesday on news that the company's major
shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., is considering
retiring a "significant amount" of its high-yield bonds,
finished down more than one point.
   RJR Nabisco 14.07% convertible payment-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, finished down 1 1/2 points at 95 5/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the
14.07% exchangeable payment-in-kind debentures, maturing in
2007, ended 1 1/4 points lower to close at 79 3/8. Trading in
the RJR payment-in-kind issues was relatively light after
Wednesday's frenzied pace.
   In the broader junk bond market, most high-yielding,
high-risk bonds finished the session little changed. In the
investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade corporate
bonds ended unchanged to 1/8 point higher.
   Meanwhile, the junk bonds of Trump Castle Funding Inc. and
related issues weakened slightly on a report that a $65
million loan package for real estate developer Donald Trump
is being held up by a consortium of four foreign banks.
   Trump Castle's 13.75% first-mortgage bonds, due in 1997,
ended at 59 1/2, down 1/2 point from Wednesday, while Trump
Taj Mahal Funding Inc.'s 14% first-mortgage bonds, maturing
in 1998, were down 1/2 point at 52.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 23/32
compared with 102 13/32 on Wednesday. The latest 10-year
notes ended at 102 9/32 to yield 8.51% compared with 102 4/32
to yield 8.53% on Wednesday.
   Short-term rates were mixed. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.77% for a
bond-equivalent yield 8.02%, slightly higher than Wednesday.
The discount rate on six-month bills ended at 7.65% to yield
8.05%, slightly lower than Wednesday.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds

   The British government bond market, growing increasingly
volatile, broke a sharp two-day advance yesterday and ended
lower.
   Traders said that prices of British government bonds,
which are called gilts, were higher during early trading. But
they began to slip as investor caution took hold ahead of
today's release of the May current account and trade
deficits. Economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets
Report expect, on average, that the current account deficit
-- a broad trade measure -- narrowed to #1.4 billion ($2.41
billion) in May from #1.78 billion in April.
   In trading, Britain's 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 fell 13/32
to 102 27/32 to yield 11.32%.
   Elsewhere:
   -- West German bond prices ended lower after another day
of listless trading.
   -- Japanese government bonds ended modestly lower as money
market rates rose.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt securities ended narrowly mixed after a
sparsely traded session.
   New-issue activity was also extremely light.
   A $257 million Palm Beach County, Fla., criminal justice
facilities revenue bond issue was tentatively priced to yield
from 6.30% in 1994 to 7.32% in 2011 by a Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. group.
   No new offerings are expected to be priced today.
   In secondary activity, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were off 1/8 point at 97 3/4 to
yield 7.39%, compared with a 7.35% yield Wednesday.
                                                                                                       

   Asset-, Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   An abundance of supply and a maturity perceived to be
unpopular were behind the wider yield spread quoted for $1.25
billion Citicorp credit-card securities priced and freed to
trade yesterday.
   That is the view of several traders of asset-backed
securities, who quoted the yield spread on the seven-year
Citicorp securities at 0.91 to 0.92 percentage point above
seven-year Treasurys.
   First Boston Corp. and its affiliate Credit Suisse First
Boston Ltd. were the lead underwriters of the issue.
   The Class A certificates, backed by Visa and MasterCard
credit-card receivables, were priced as 9 3/8% securities at
99.585 to yield 9.456%.
   With this sale, nearly $4 billion of asset-backed
securities have been priced this week. Just over half of
those securities are backed by credit-card receivables.
   Not only is there a supply crunch, but there is said to be
some investor resistance to a seven-year maturity. The
preference is for the shorter maturities that have been seen
in the other offerings earlier in the week.
   In the market for secondary mortgage-backed securities,
Government National Mortgage Association securities for July
delivery were 3/32 firmer at 98 7/8. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were 1/8 firmer at 98 6/32 and
Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were
also up 1/8, at 98 22/32.

   First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, said it ended a
nearly nine-year old agreement to acquire Banks of Iowa Inc.
and plans to sell back to the Des Moines banking concern
550,197 Class B nonvoting shares for about $38 million, or
$69 a share.
   The 1981 agreement called for First Bank to acquire Banks
of Iowa for at least 1.5 times its shareholders equity, when
permitted by Iowa banking law, which at the time didn't allow
interstate acquisitions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both companies have gone through some big changes since
then, however. First, the depressed farm economy battered
nearly all Iowa banks. And more recently, First Bank itself
was hurt by some big bond and loan losses.
   Interstate banking powers come to Iowa Jan. 1, and Banks
of Iowa said it plans to seek another buyer. With about $2.6
billion in assets and shareholders equity of $214 million at

   Abitibi-Price Inc., a Toronto-based forest products
concern, said it plans to build a US$56 million de-inking
plant at its 50%-owned newsprint mill in Claiborne, Ala.
   Abitibi-Price, 82%-owned by the Reichmann family's closely
held Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., said the plant will
process 125,000 metric tons of wastepaper annually. The
newsprint mill has an annual capacity of 220,000 metric tons
and is scheduled to begin operations next month. A metric ton
is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   The Claiborne newsprint mill, Alabama River Newsprint Co.,
is jointly owned by Abitibi-Price and Parsons &amp; Whittemore
Inc. of New York, a woodpulp maker and builder of pulp and
paper mills. By the end of next year, newsprint made at the
mill will contain as much as 40% recycled paper,
Abitibi-Price said.
   Construction of the de-inking plant, which could begin
next month, is subject to completion of financing agreements
with Alabama River Newsprint's creditors. The Alabama State
Teachers' Retirement Fund agreed in principle to lend US$15
million to the project, Abitibi-Price said.

   AN EARTHQUAKE SHATTERED northern Iran, killing thousands
of people.
   Iranian officials said at least 25,000 were killed and
tens of thousands injured, adding that the toll probably will
rise as rescuers reach remote areas. The quake demolished
towns in the densely populated Caspian Sea region and buried
people asleep in their homes. The temblor measured as high as
7.7 on the Richter scale. A dozen or more aftershocks hit the
region within two hours of the initial quake, which was at
least as bad as the one that struck Iran in 1978. Landslides
obstructed rescuers on the ground, and bad weather hindered
airlift operations. In Tehran, the quake sent people fleeing
into the streets, but no deaths were reported there.

   The White House sent condolences to Iran's leaders and
expressed U.S. willingness to give "appropriate humanitarian
assistance should it be requested."

   THE JUSTICES RULED hiring decisions can't be made on the
basis of party ties.
   In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court said party affiliation
can no longer be used to determine who is hired or promoted
for most government jobs. The court, in a devastating blow to
patronage, said First Amendment rights of government workers
are violated if they are denied promotions, transfers or
recalls from layoffs because of party ties. The justices said
partisanship may play a role in employment decisions only
when party affiliation is an appropriate requirement.
   The court, in an Ohio case, ruled that the First Amendment
doesn't make the news media immune from libel lawsuits based
on statements of opinion.

   Indosuez Asia to Revamp Mutual Funds
   Of Gartmore, Expand Into Pension Funds

   HONG KONG -- Indosuez Asia Investment Services Ltd. said
it will merge three mutual funds run by Gartmore Fund
Managers (Far East) Ltd. into Indosuez funds and re-register
numerous other Gartmore funds under the Indosuez nameplate.
   Indosuez Asia's parent company, Banque Indosuez of Paris,
bought Gartmore's London parent, Gartmore Investment
Management Ltd., last March for $230 million from British &amp;
Commonwealth Holdings PLC, a troubled British
financial-services company. Gartmore had been up for sale
since November 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indosuez Asia officials said that Gartmore's Hong Kong
operation will be closed, and that its remaining employees
will be given the option of staying on with Indosuez Asia.
Gartmore funds that are administered in Europe will continue
to carry the Gartmore name as part of Gartmore Indosuez Asset
Management Ltd., the newly created holding company for all
Gartmore-Indosuez fund-management activities world-wide.
   The absorption of Gartmore's Asian-Pacific operations by
Indosuez Asia marks the end of what once was one of the
region's highest-profile fund managers. Under the leadership
of managing director Duncan Mount, now a director at CEF
Investment Management (Bermuda) Ltd. in Hong Kong, several
top-performing Gartmore funds attracted droves of investors
during the bull market of the mid-1980s.
   Then the equities crash of 1987 hit Gartmore's funds hard.
Its Oriental Ventures Trust, a diversified Asian-Pacific fund
that was heavily publicized, lost more than half its value.
Since then, Gartmore has taken a more conservative approach
to managing funds, but the tarnish from the crash never wore
off, according to fund managers and brokers in Hong Kong.
   Indosuez Asia, with more than $1 billion under management,
will pick up about $150 million by absorbing Gartmore's
regional funds, said Robert Lloyd George, managing director
of Indosuez Asia in Hong Kong. World-wide, the merged
Indosuez-Gartmore operations will have about $25 billion
under management.
   Bernard Simon Barboux, a Paris-based executive vice
president of Banque Indosuez, said the acquisition of
Gartmore has given Indosuez new prowess in pension-fund
management. "Gartmore brings us more pension-fund expertise,"
he said. "Indosuez has primarily been involved in unit trusts
and mutual funds. We now plan to expand into the pension-fund
area."
   The move into pension-fund management marks a shift in
corporate culture at Indosuez Asia. Under Mr. Lloyd George,
the company has concentrated on conservatively managed,
diversified retail funds invested in the Asian-Pacific
region. Indosuez Asia also has been a pioneer in the region's
emerging markets; it launched the first international equity
fund that invests in Indonesia, and this month its Himalayan
Fund became the first to invest in India, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh and Nepal.
   Mr. Lloyd George said the new emphasis on pension-fund
money won't come at the expense of retail clients,
particularly those now holding Gartmore funds.
   Gartmore funds that will be merged into Indosuez Asia
Funds or re-registered with Hong Kong authorities under the
Indosuez name are: Gartmore International Bond Fund, which
will be merged with Indosuez Asian Income Fund; Gartmore
Singapore &amp; Malaysia Trust, to be merged with Indosuez FIF
Singapore, a Banque Indosuez fund managed by Indosuez Asia;
and Gartmore Precious Metals Trust, to be merged with
Indosuez Pacific Gold Fund.
   These Gartmore funds will carry the Indosuez Asia
nameplate: Japan Fund, Oriental Ventures Trust, Hong Kong
Fund, Managed Trust, New Zealand Fund, North American Trust,
Pacific Trust, and Pacific Warrant Fund.

   VF Expects 47% Drop

   WYOMISSING, Pa. -- VF Corp., suffering from a weak apparel
market, said it expects to report a drop of about 47% in
second-quarter per-share earnings, or 35 cents to 36 cents a
share.
   In the year-earlier quarter, VF posted earnings of $45.5
million, or 67 cents a share. In addition, the company said
it expects to post slightly lower sales for the quarter. In
the year-ago quarter, sales were $611 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The apparel manufacturer said the projected results
include two special charges: a charge of about three cents a
share related to the cost of closing several jeans production
facilities, and another charge of about two cents a share to
cover potential liabilities connected to the sale of the
company's Wrangler Canada operations.
   VF's chairman and chief executive officer, Lawrence R.
Pugh, attributed the earnings decline to continued weak
clothing demand, particularly for the company's Lee jeanswear
and its Jantzen sportswear.
   "Apparel sales are not vibrant," Mr. Pugh said. He added
that low consumer demand for jeans was compounded by cutbacks
in advance orders by retailers, who are increasingly relying
on "at-once" orders to keep inventories down.
   However, Mr. Pugh said he expects jeans orders to pick up
in the third quarter with the back-to-school rush. In
addition, Mr. Pugh said he is confident that the Lee division
will show improved results in the second half of the year as
it reaps the benefits of internal reorganization, more
focused product lines and a new advertising campaign directed
at women 25 to 35 years old.
   Mr. Pugh emphasized that other VF units, including Vanity
Fair lingerie and Red Kap occupational apparel, are doing
better than last year.

   Eureka Project's Critics Are Confounded

   European Research Program
   Crosses 19 Borders

   ROME -- When French President Francois Mitterrand launched
the Eureka project in 1985, skeptics dismissed it as more of
a public-relations exercise than a serious scientific
initiative.
   Five years later it appears to have confounded the
critics, establishing itself as a multibillion-dollar
research program bringing together industrial companies and
universities from 19 European countries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cross-border high-technology research projects
proliferating under the Eureka banner are designed for
commercial application. They include the hugely expensive
European bid to develop high-definition television as well as
work on the mass propagation of virus-free artichokes or the
design of an automatic platform for deep-sea oil drilling.
   Eureka was conceived as a European response to the
research drive generated in the U.S. by the Strategic Defense
Initiative, or Star Wars, but was aimed at the civilian
rather than military sector. European governments have
repeatedly argued that U.S. military research spending has
had direct commercial benefits for U.S. companies -- whether
in aeronautics, computer technology or microelectronics --
and contend that state support for European civilian research
has to be seen in this context.
   In contrast to publicly funded commercial research in the
U.S., which has become the object of a fierce political
struggle, Eureka is one of the few pan-European projects that
enjoys support across the political spectrum. Both right- and
left-wing governments, interventionists and free marketeers
see it as one of Europe's best arms in the struggle against
Japanese and American high-tech supremacy.
   Over the past year, 91 research projects have been added
to the existing Eureka list, bringing projects approved under
the scheme to 385 over the past five years at a value of 7.8
billion European currency units ($9.5 billion).
   "What we're trying to encourage is collaborative research,
not single-company product development," said British
Industry Minister Douglas Hogg during a break at a
ministerial meeting on Eureka here earlier this month.
   When Eureka was launched, there was some concern within
the European Community Commission over whether it might
compete with the EC's own science-funding program. But
officials involved with Eureka say it has firmly established
its role as financing projects designed to produce
commercially viable results, while EC programs are designed
for more fundamental research.
   "There is a general philosophy of complementarity between
the EC framework program and Eureka," Italian Scientific and
Technological Research Minister Antonio Ruberti told
journalists here. The 19 Eureka members include the 12 member
EC states, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Austria and Turkey.
Senior EC Commission representatives also take part in Eureka
discussions.
   Eureka projects are proposed by industry and largely
financed by it, with no central source of financing available
for the program. Instead, companies seeking support approach
their national governments with proposals. The governments
decide whether the proposal qualifies as a Eureka project and
then decide about financing on a project-by-project basis.
Typically, governments pay about one-third of the cost,
sometimes providing additional loans, with industry financing
the rest.
   Eureka projects approved over the past five years have
fallen into nine main categories: medicine and biotechnology,
communications, energy technology, the environment,
information technology, lasers, new materials, robotics and
transportation.
   One of the highest-profile projects has been aimed at
setting a European standard for high-definition television,
the new technology that will radically enhance picture and
sound quality in the next decade.
   "HDTV is a complete revolution -- it's an even larger step
than that from black-and-white to color television," said
Koos Andriessen, the Dutch economics affairs minister. Mr.
Andriessen will play a pivotal role in Eureka over the next
year; the Netherlands has recently taken over the rotating
one-year presidency and he has made it clear that HDTV will
be given top priority.
   "HDTV is reaching a critical stage" he said. "Japan has
done work on HDTV and we think it's important that Europe
should be there."
   The Dutch electronics company N.V. Philips is leading the
research, in conjunction with other major European
electronics concerns including Bosch G.m.b.H., Thomson S.A.
and Oy Nokia. The group already has managed to stop the
Japanese from achieving a monopoly position for their MUSE
high-definition standard. Last month, the International Radio
Consultative Committee placed the European standard MAC on an
equal basis with MUSE.
   Eureka ministers responded June 1 by approving the second
phase of HDTV development. It calls for spending almost $600
million over the next five years, of which a third to half
will be public funds. During the second phase, experimental
HDTV sets will be produced to demonstrate their reception of
major public events, including the 1992 Olympic Games in
France and Spain. By 1995, the Europeans hope to be marketing
HDTV sets, along with such other HDTV products as receivers,
laser disk players and videocassette recorders.
   "For Eureka, HDTV is definitely the high-visibility
project," said Thomson's Patrick Sandoly. It pits the group
"directly against the Japanese."
   Another high-profile project is Jessi, the Joint European
Submicron Silicon Initiative, an eight-year program relating
to silicon-based microelectronics and its industrial
application.

   MILAN, Italy -- The Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti
scored a victory in his battle to regain control of Italy's
largest publisher, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., when an
arbitration board awarded him the right to a contested 25.7%
stake in the parent, AME Finanziaria S.p.A., called AMEF.
   The board ruled that a contract between Mr. De Benedetti
and the Formenton family, providing for the sale of 13.7
million AMEF ordinary shares to Mr. De Benedetti by the end
of 1991, is valid and must be honored. The Formentons said
they would appeal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Formentons' 25.7% interest has played a pivotal role
in the battle with the media baron Silvio Berlusconi for
control of Mondadori, because AMEF controls 50.3% of
Mondadori's ordinary share capital. The Formentons ended
their pact with Mr. De Benedetti late last year to ally
themselves with Mr. Berlusconi, which tipped the power
balance controlling the publishing group and led to Mr.
Berlusconi's appointment as Mondadori president in January.
   The arbitrators's decision, which was expected, was viewed
as a boost to Mr. De Benedetti's ability to negotiate a
settlement to keep the publishing house intact. He rejected a
proposal by Mr. Berlusconi's Fininvest S.p.A. earlier this
week to split Mondadori into two separately controlled units.
   With the Formenton package, Mr. De Benedetti's AMEF stake
will be lifted to 52.65%, while his control of Mondadori's
total share capital will rise to 78.5% from 51.3%. His
holding company, Cie. Industriale Riunite S.p.A., already
owns 26.9% of AMEF; Fininvest holds 40%. Fininvest holds 13%
of Mondadori's total share capital, while minority holders
own the remainder.

   Canada's constitutional wrangle is coming down to the
wire.
   Whether or not Quebec gets the recognition it seeks as a
"distinct society," the fight probably will launch a bitter
debate about Canada's Constitution and the structure of the
nation.

   If the Meech Lake constitutional accord is ratified, a
round of constitutional negotiations will begin July 15. The
issues will be as controversial as the "distinct society"
debate that has preoccupied Canadians and Canada's financial
markets for several months.
   If the accord isn't ratified, nothing will change
overnight. But Canadian politics will turn surly as the hunt
begins for somebody to blame for the failure. And talk of at
least partial independence in French-speaking Quebec will
quickly hit a higher pitch.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said yesterday that
failure to adopt the Meech Lake accord will result in
"constitutional paralysis, sadness and dismay across the
country (and) negative signals to international markets." Mr.
Mulroney also said there is a "growing probability" that
failure to adopt the accord will result in a "rising sense of
rejection in Quebec and growing support of
sovereignty-association," or political independence. A poll
conducted last week found that 57% of Quebecers support
sovereignty for their province.
   Mr. Mulroney was making a last-minute pitch to the 52
members of the Newfoundland House of Assembly yesterday. This
morning, the Newfoundland Legislature is expected to vote on
the Meech Lake accord.
   The final tally is uncertain, but rejection appears
likely. Even if Newfoundland ratifies the accord, it may die
in Manitoba. Procedural obstacles in the Manitoba Legislature
delayed debate on the accord, and Manitoba politicians say
there isn't enough time left to vote before tomorrow's
deadline for ratification. Eight provinces have ratified the
accord, which must be passed by all 10 provinces to take
effect.
   There's only a "slim chance" the accord will go through,
Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa said for the first time
Wednesday. Relentlessly optimistic until now, Mr. Bourassa is
expected to make a statement to Quebecers this weekend if
Meech Lake collapses, an aide said.
   The Meech Lake accord was negotiated at Meech Lake,
Quebec, three years ago. It recognizes Quebec as a "distinct
society" within Canada and grants certain powers to all
provinces. The accord satisfies Quebec's minimum conditions
for signing the 1982 Constitution.
   Equities analysts see little movement in the Canadian
stock markets if the accord doesn't pass. "The market's
already reacted to the uncertainty," said John Ing, president
and chief executive of Maison Placements Canada Inc. "If it
doesn't pass, we'll just see more of what we've been seeing."
   If the accord is ratified, analysts expect a rise in the
Canadian dollar, which has been under severe downward
pressure, along with a rally in the bond market and a
subsequent rally in the stock market, although the latter
will be "more of an emotional reaction than it will be based
on fundamentals," Mr. Ing said.
   Michael Boulter, a portfolio strategist with Research
Capital Corp., said he sees the Toronto stock market rallying
by about 100 points from its current level of about 3520 if
the accord passes. He said interestrate sensitive stocks,
such as banks and utilities, will see the most benefit.
   Yesterday, the Canadian dollar closed in Toronto at 85.01
U.S. cents, down 0.29 cents. Canadian government bonds closed
down about 1/8 of a point, or C$12.50 for each C$1,000 face
amount. The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index finished at
3526.24, down 4.24.

   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service, citing Centel
Corp.'s "aggressive expansion of its cellular operations,"
lowered its ratings on about $1.2 billion in debt issued by
the telecommunications concern and two subsidiaries.
   The rating concern said the "capital expenditure
requirements, external financing burden, and earnings
pressure" accompanying Centel's cellular-telephone expansion
strategy will result in "increased business risk and debt
protection measures."
</LP>

   Moody's added, however, that it thinks the cellular
telephone business "can provide Centel with considerable cash
flow and profit potential over the longer term."
   Centel's first mortgage bonds, debentures and notes were
marked down to Baa-3 from Baa-1; its commercial paper rating
was reduced to Prime-3 from Prime-2.
   The company's Centel Capital unit had ratings on its
debentures and notes reduced to Baa-3 from Baa-1, and its
commercial paper was lowered to Prime-3 from Prime-2.
   Ratings on the company's Central Telephone Co.'s first
mortgage bonds were lowered to single-A-1 from double-A-2,
and its debentures reduced to single-A-2 from double-A-3.
Moody's said Central Telephone is entering a series of
regulatory hearings that may result in soft earnings
performance in the "intermediate term."
   A Centel spokesman said the company is "disappointed" with
Moody's move. "We remain very optimistic about cellular and
its long-term potential," and will continue the expansion
effort, he said. The spokesman specifically disagreed with
Moody's markdown of the company's commercial paper, saying
that Centel's "short-term liquidity situation is strong,"
particularly after it recently boosted a revolving credit
agreement with lenders.
