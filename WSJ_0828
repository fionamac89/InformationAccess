   Utilizing Options
   As Hedge Against
   Drops in Market

   In uncertain times like these, a lot of stock-market
investors wish they had some sort of security blanket.
   What many of them don't realize is how easily they could
make that wish come true. By using options to hedge
individual stocks or an entire portfolio, they can cushion
the blow of further market drops.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And days like yesterday and last Friday, when stock prices
rose sharply, are perfect for putting a hedge strategy into
place. Higher prices not only increase the value of an
investor's shares, but they also reduce the cost of
protecting those shares with options.
   Stock options give holders the right -- but not the
obligation -- to sell (a put option) or to buy (a call
option) individual stocks or indexes that approximate an
entire portfolio at a fixed "exercise" price for a specified
period. Put options gain in price when the underlying stocks
or indexes decline in value, while call options increase in
price when the underlying stocks or indexes appreciate.
   The simplest type of option strategy is to buy put
options. The strategy makes sense for those investors who
"feel good about the companies in which they are invested but
are nervous about the market backdrop," says Bernard
Schaeffer, editor of the Option Advisor, a Cincinnati-based
newsletter. While such investors don't want to sell, he says,
they also don't want to see their portfolios decimated if the
sell-off continues.
   Harrison Roth, option strategist for Cowen &amp; Co. in New
York, says that to some extent using put options to hedge a
stock-market investment is similar to buying homeowner's
insurance. "The exercise price can be considered the value of
the policy in case disaster strikes," Mr. Roth says. "The
life of the put, between the date of the put and its
expiration, can be considered the term of the policy. The
amount paid for the put is the premium," he adds.
   Investors can purchase individual stock options on more
than 700 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
American Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter market. Each
option protects 100 shares of the stock.
   Investors can also buy index put options, which give
holders the right to receive cash depending upon how much the
index on which the option is based has dropped relative to
the option's exercise price. The four most popular indexes
that have options are the Standard &amp; Poor's 100 Index, the
S&amp;P 500 Index, the Major Market Index and the New York Stock
Exchange Index.
   Mr. Schaeffer says that he believes investors would be
better off now hedging their portfolios with individual
equity put options rather than index puts. "Index put options
have become extremely expensive in the last couple of weeks,
just as they always do after any major pullback," he says.
   Say an investor owns 500 shares of a stock and wants to
protect the entire holding against falling prices. To do so,
the investor could buy five puts with a strike price close to
the current stock price.
   Yesterday afternoon, for example, with Digital Equipment
Corp. stock selling for $64.50 a share, an investor could
have bought October 60 put options at 2 1/8, or $212.50 per
100-share option. These puts would reduce the investor's loss
if DEC shares fell below $57.87 (the strike price of the put,
less its cost) before the options expire on Oct. 20. If DEC
shares are at $50 when the put expires, a put owner would
make a profit of $787.50 per October 60 put. That would
offset more than half of the $1,450 loss on 100 unprotected
DEC shares.
   Mr. Roth of Cowen &amp; Co. says that buying put options may
be less expensive than it looks. "Frequently, the dividends a
stock pays during the put's life are sufficient to cover the
cost of the put," he says.
   Mr. Schaeffer notes that investors could help pay for
individual put options by selling calls with strike prices
above the current price of the stock. If the stock declines
the money received from the call's sale will help pay for the
put purchase.
   If the stock rallies an investor who has sold call options
will most likely have the stock called away at a price equal
to the exercise price of the call. But that investor will
also have received the proceeds from the sale of the call,
thus raising the effective sale price.
   Using index puts makes protecting an entire portfolio
about as simple as protecting an individual stock. Michael
Schwartz, senior vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New
York, says that while index puts have become expensive, it is
still more convenient and probably would involve fewer
commissions to hedge a portfolio with such puts. He says that
this assumes that the value of an investor's portfolio moves
up and down in line with the index on which the option is
based. He adds that index puts shouldn't be used on a
continuing basis because of their cost.
   The first step is to figure out how many index puts are
needed. Suppose an investor wants to protect a portfolio with
a current market value of $100,000 with the S&amp;P 100 index
standing at 307.63. The aggregate exercise price of put
options with a strike price of 305 is $30,500, the strike
price times $100. Dividing the value of the portfolio
($100,000) by $30,500 equals 3.27, which can be rounded off
to three options. Recently, a put option that expires in
October with a strike price of 305 cost $1,112.50; the total
gross cost, excluding commissions, for three options was
about $3,337. (Commissions at a discount broker should be
less than 2% of the value of the options.)
   If the market declines by 15% from its level yesterday of
307.63 as measured by the S&amp;P 100 index to 261.49, index put
options with a strike price of 305 would have a value of
$4,351 at expiration. An investor who had purchased three of
them would have a profit of $9,717 after deducting their
cost. This would make the value of his hedged portfolio
$94,717 for a 5.3% drop in portfolio value. The unhedged
investor would have lost the full 15%.

   HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp. reshuffled
top management at two subsidiaries, Carrier Corp. and Otis
Elevators.
   When the changes take place Saturday, Karl J. Krapek,
president and chief operating officer at Otis, will become
chairman, president and chief executive officer at Carrier.
He succeeds William A. Wilson, who will become a senior vice
president at United Technologies until he retires at the end
of March. Jean-Pierre van Rooy, president of Otis's North
American operations, will succeed Mr. Krapek.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The reorganization comes as Carrier, a maker of air
conditioning and heating units, is coming under intense
competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers. United
Technologies' second-quarter results reflected an $18 million
after-tax charge for a Carrier compressor-plant closing.
Also, Carrier's profit dropped sharply because of a weak U.S.
market for residential air conditioners.
   In 1989, Carrier contributed about $4 billion of United
Technologies' $19 billion in revenue. The unit is United
Technologies' second largest subsidiary in terms of sales,
after aircraft-engine producer Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   A spokesman for United Technologies said Mr. Wilson "made
his own decision to take early retirement." The spokesman
wouldn't speculate as to why Mr. Wilson, who is 56 years old,
wants to step down and he said he had no idea what Mr. Wilson
will do afterward. Mr. Wilson's decision to retire early
prompted the changes, the spokesman said.
   Struggling to keep ahead of the competition in heating and
cooling systems, Mr. Wilson has been pushing Carrier to
improve its product line. In the past three years, Carrier
has introduced 93 products, which now account for 70% of the
company's North American sales, the spokesman said.
   United Technologies makes high-technology products and
provides services for the aerospace, automotive and building
systems industries. Otis makes elevators and escalators.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
United Technologies rose 62.5 cents to $49.375.

   A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, granted a request by
American Airlines to prohibit United Airlines from making any
immediate changes to its flight schedules at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport. American alleged that the planned
changes violated a federal agreement and would give United an
unfair advantage in Chicago.
   Judge John McBride issued a temporary restraining order
barring United, a unit of UAL Corp., Chicago, from changing
its schedules before the court can hold a full hearing on the
matter next Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Because of the high volume of traffic at O'Hare, the
federal government restricts the number of takeoffs and
landings per hour. As a result, the government in the past
has given United and American permission to coordinate their
flight schedules to ease delays and prevent overburdening the
air traffic control system.
   American, a unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth, alleged that
United planned to move up the departure times of many of its
flights as of Oct. 1. American said that United had already
filed a notice stating its plans and that the changes would
put American at a competitive disadvantage.
   United called American's complaint "without basis in
fact." The carrier said it was only responding to changes
American had said it was planning to make in its Chicago
flight schedules as of Sept. 15. United also said the proper
forum for solving the dispute is the Federal Aviation
Administration, which regulates air traffic at O'Hare.
   The FAA could step in if it believed any of the changes
contemplated would result in worse delays or additional
problems for air traffic controllers. United and American are
the dominant airlines at O'Hare. United operates 729 flights
daily out of Chicago; American operates 581. Most of the
changes contemplated affected flights departing between 7
p.m. and 8 p.m.

   DALLAS -- Triton Energy Corp. said it will consider the
request of a major shareholder that Triton sell its three
biggest partly owned units.
   The request came from Industrial Equity Ltd., which holds
a 10.4% Triton stake and has said it might seek control. In a
letter filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Industrial Equity said it had encouraged Triton
to dispose of its interests in Triton Europe, Crusader Ltd.
and Triton Canada -- assets that Industrial Equity called
mature and no longer strategic. Industrial Equity is
controlled by New Zealand investor Robert Brierly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Michael P. McInerney, Triton vice president, said the
company's first priority was the completion of its previously
announced restructuring program. "But after that, the sale of
those subsidiaries is something we would consider," he said.
   He declined to estimate the value or size of the three
units. But previously the company estimated that its stake in
Triton Europe -- the largest of the three -- was worth $180
million.
   In the SEC letter, Industrial Equity said it generally
approved of Triton's restructuring plan, which calls for the
sale of aviation operations, a securities portfolio and a
seismic-equipment subsidiary. The plan is designed to
redirect the company's focus toward oil and gas exploration.
   Industrial Equity also said in the letter that it had sold
110,000 Triton shares, lowering its stake to 10.4% from
10.9%.
   As previously reported, Triton took a $31.1 million fiscal
fourth-quarter charge for the write-down of certain assets in
connection with the restructuring plan. For the year ended
May 31, the company recorded a net loss of $54.2 million, or
$2.93 a share, on revenue of $260.1 million, after a
$593,000, or three cent a share, extraordinary gain from a
tax-loss carry-forward.

   Economy:
   U.S. Personal
   Spending Rose
   By 0.5% in July

   But Fears About Economy
   May Curb Consumers'
   Purchases in the Future

   WASHINGTON -- Americans spent money at a fairly healthy
rate in July, the Commerce Department reported, but many
analysts believe subsequent jitters over the economy and
spiraling oil prices will fetter purchases in the months to
come.
   Personal spending grew 0.5% in the month before Iraq
invaded Kuwait, to a $3.667 trillion annual rate, the
department said. The increase came on top of a 1% jump in
spending in June.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, Americans' incomes increased 0.6%, to an
annual rate of $4.672 trillion, following gains of 0.5% in
June and 0.4% in May. Wages and salaries, the bulk of most
people's income, grew 0.6%.
   "There was no recession in these numbers," said Allen
Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., in New York. "But I do
think it's the last hurrah for consumers." Higher oil prices
generated by the Middle East crisis will squeeze Americans'
discretionary income, he predicted. At the same time, growing
concern about job security could lead consumers to pinch
spending further, analysts said.
   Already, said Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical
Bank in New York, "We're hearing reports from major retailers
that they're starting to see a pronounced slowdown in
buying."
   Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of
the nation's economic activity, has been quite weak for much
of this year. But in June and July it picked up a bit,
reports show. Most of the growth has been in spending on
services; earlier this month the Commerce Department reported
that retail sales of goods edged up only 0.1% in July
following a 1.1% advance in June.
   Most economists believe the gains are now immaterial in
light of the Middle East crisis.
   After adjusting for inflation, personal spending still
grew 0.2% in July following a 0.6% gain in June and a 0.1%
dip in May. Spending on services and durable goods --
big-ticket items such as home appliances, expected to last at
least three years -- grew both before and after inflation.
But spending on nondurable goods dropped in both cases,
surprising some analysts.
   Generally, durable goods are the first to drop from
consumers' shopping lists during uncertain times because they
are costly and often must be financed. But purchases of
nondurable goods, which include staples such as food and
clothing, tend to hold steadier.
   According to the report disposable income -- income after
taxes and other payments to the government -- grew 0.5% in
July, after rising 0.6% in June and 0.3% in May. After
adjusting for inflation, disposable income increased 0.3% in
July, following a gain of 0.2% in June and no change in May.
   Americans saved 4.9% of their disposable income in July,
the same rate as June.
   All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal
variations.

   Tracor Proposes Debt Restructuring,
   Raises Bankruptcy-Filing Possibility
   ----

   AUSTIN, Texas -- Tracor Holdings Inc., overwhelmed by
interest expense taken on in its 1987 leveraged buy-out,
proposed a plan to restructure $730 million in debt and said
it may seek Bankruptcy Court protection if the plan isn't
approved by the defense contractor's bondholders.
   Under the complex proposal, Westmark Systems Inc., the
holding company for Tracor, would be separated into three
independent companies, to be divided among shareholders and
creditors. Tracor's operations will be divided up into those
three companies. While calling the plan "unusual" and
"ingenious," an analyst familiar with Tracor's creditors said
their approval was far from guaranteed and that the company
might be forced to carry out a bankruptcy filing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The restructuring proposal came only days before Friday's
deadline for a $16 million interest payment on the company's
14% senior subordinated notes -- a payment the company is
certain to miss. Tracor already is in default on its bank
debt, and in late July those lenders issued a blockage notice
preventing the company from making payments to bondholders,
Tracor said.
   The bankruptcy threat illustrates just how far Tracor has
fallen. While selling about $400 million in Tracor junk
bonds, Merrill Lynch praised Tracor as having the brightest
of futures. At its helm was Navy Adm. Bobby R. Inman --
former head of the National Security Agency -- and on its
board sat a host of other luminaries. Under their leadership,
Merrill predicted, Tracor would post steadily higher
earnings, make strategic acquisitions and convert its
contacts at the Pentagon into rich government contracts.
   It didn't happen. Sales, which Merrill predicted would
grow 15% in 1989 and at double-digit rates after that,
started falling as defense contracts dried up, the victim of
friendlier relations between the U.S. and the Soviets. Mr.
Inman, instead of winning big contracts at the Pentagon,
started speaking out publicly on the perils of LBOs, in which
a small group of investors acquires a company largely with
debt that is ultimately paid with funds generated by the
acquired company. Finally, late last year, Mr. Inman
resigned, and to make debt payments the company began selling
off assets.
   The proposal calls for the creation of three companies:
Westmark Systems Inc., a fuse and electrical devices
manufacturer; Tracor Aviation Inc., a commercial aircraft
modification and maintenance services concern; and TDH Inc.,
a defense contractor.
   Under the proposed program, Tracor's public bondholders
would exchange about $458 million of notes and debentures for
all of the common of two of the companies, Westmark and
Tracor Aviation, plus $48 million face amount of zero-coupon
convertible subordinated notes of Westmark due February 1,
1998, and $45.3 million face amount of zero-coupon senior
secured notes of Tracor Aviation, to mature either in five
years or upon the sale or disposition of Tracor Aviation's
operations, whichever came first.
   Lenders would exchange about $272 million in debt for $125
million in senior secured debt of Westmark, $32 million face
amount of the zero-coupon convertible subordinated debt of
Westmark, $75 million of a senior secured revolving credit
facility of TDH and $22.7 million face amount of the
zero-coupon senior secured notes of Tracor Aviation.
   Existing holders of Westmark common, THI warrants, Tracor
warrants and Tracor common would receive all the common of
TDH, the defense contractor.
   The proposal requires the approval of the company's banks
as well as of bondholders representing 95% of each of two
Tracor issues. Tracor Chairman James B. Skaggs said that if
"less than 95% but more than two-thirds in principal amount
and a majority in number" of the Tracor bondholders approve
the recapitalization plan, the company will file a
"pre-packaged" Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law petition and
reorganization plan.
   By entering Chapter 11, which provides protection from
creditor lawsuits, with its reorganization plan pre-approved
by creditors representing two-thirds or more of its debt, the
company would solve the problem of holdouts, Mr. Skaggs said.
"In that event, 100% of bondholders would be bound by the
recapitalization plan," he said.

   NEAR THE IRAQI BORDER, Saudi Arabia -- Saddam Hussein has
hundreds of powerful tanks poised to attack, but many of the
heavy U.S. tanks are still chugging their way here by ship.
U.S. troops don't even have a dependable hand-held antitank
weapon; one under development may be available in a few
years.
   If a war starts, U.S. ground troops will be dependent on
the protection of helicopters noted for performing poorly in
harsh Third World weather conditions. Much of remaining
hardware badly needed by U.S. forces is still weeks away from
delivery. The Navy has too few cargo ships, and many are just
too slow.

   The U.S. military is a lumbering beast slouching toward
the Middle East. It doesn't have enough airlift capacity. Its
heavy tanks are too heavy to be moved easily; the Sheridan
light tanks, which can be airlifted, date from the 1960s.
"The threat remains very high," says Brig. Gen. Turki bin
Nasser, commander of a major Saudi air base. Until additional
forces are deployed, he says, the Iraqis "could go on the
offensive at any time."
   No one is suggesting that Saddam Hussein or anyone else
could overrun the U.S. military, which, in terms of total
firepower (and especially air power) remains incomparably
more powerful. Capitalizing on aircraft carriers and a
gigantic aerial refueling operation, the Pentagon poured in
an impressive force of more than 300 frontline jet fighters
in a matter of days.
   But planners for the Joint Chiefs of Staff are counting
the hours until specially built cargo ships will disgorge
hundreds of tanks and other weapons to shore up U.S. ground
positions in Saudi Arabia. The monumental military buildup of
the 1980s, in which defense spending doubled, was intended to
meet the threat of a well-known, monolithic Soviet enemy.
Now, the Cold War is fading -- and much of the buildup in
Europe is to be brought home.
   Overall, the mighty U.S. military isn't designed for
fighting in this Middle Eastern desert or in many of the
other Third World hot spots where war is most likely to
erupt. Along the India-Pakistan frontier, for example, where
two of the world's largest armies and most bitter enemies are
arrayed, similar logistical problems would hamper U.S.
military involvement. The same would be true if the U.S. were
suddenly dragged into a war in the politically volatile
deserts of Africa or jungles of South America.
   The shortcomings of today's military are only part of the
problem. Defense experts generally agree on a wide range of
reforms that the U.S. must begin right away, but the
political and military bureaucracies are getting in the way.
Congressional logrolling, bitter service rivalries and
massive bureaucratic inertia are the enemies of military
preparedness, blocking reforms that are desperately needed to
prepare the military for the 1990s and beyond.
   "The services are defending budget priorities that simply
have been overtaken by events," says Jacques Gansler, a
prominent defense analyst. Democratic Rep. Les Aspin,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, adds that the
U.S. "is still shaping and sizing our forces on the Soviet
threat," blocking the transformation of the military into a
smaller, more agile force with a "much quicker reaction
time."
   The longtime polarization of the defense-spending debate
in stark left-vs.-right terms is a big part of the problem.
Hawks, convinced that almost any significant Pentagon cuts
will decimate U.S. readiness, continue staunchly defending
Star Wars anti-missile research, the B-2 Stealth bomber and
the breakneck modernization of the nation's nuclear arsenal
-- all designed to meet a Soviet threat that is waning.
Doves, meanwhile, insist on fast and deep cuts in Pentagon
expenditures, resisting the kind of difficult choices
necessary to reshape Pentagon priorities.
   The White House insists the crisis means the U.S. must
maintain a big defense budget. "I think it means just the
opposite," Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska
countered Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. While the U.S. has
been building up for a big land war in Europe, "the first
post-Cold War crisis has occurred in the Middle East," he
said. "Our military strategy has to be evaluated."
   The Mideast conflict, erasing any doubt about the kind of
changes the military must make, is "likely to establish the
type of forces that will be required for the rest of the
decade," says Gen. Edward Meyer, a retired Army chief of
staff.
   But even if the military adapts, the political structure,
a labyrinth of special interests overlaid with a cumbersome
committee structure on Capitol Hill, may not evolve so
readily. Despite Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait, "the
politics of cutting the defense budget have changed only
slightly," Rep. Aspin says.
   Just what kind of a force do the 1990s demand? How should
the U.S. shift its focus away from a powerful, monolithic
enemy toward a diversity of smaller -- though highly
dangerous -- threats? And, just as important, what obstacles
are blocking the path of reform? Following are some of the
broad areas in which government, industry and other defense
planners see the need for change, and some of the factors
standing in the way.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. land forces must become lighter, more mobile and more
versatile.
   Although the situation in Saudi Arabia might make this
seem painfully obvious, it is hardly a novel concept. One of
the fathers of the light-forces philosophy is Robert Komer,
the Pentagon's senior policy official during the Carter
administration. As a young aide to President Kennedy in the
1960s, he persuaded the U.S. to lease Diego Garcia, a
strategically located island in the Indian Ocean, to provide
a jumping-off point for U.S. forces to potential trouble
spots in the region. It turned out to be a godsend in the
present crisis: The first wave of heavy armor to reach here,
Marine M-60 tanks, came from that island. In crises like the
present one, "We have a military that is much larger than one
we could get somewhere within three months," says Mr. Komer.
"That's kind of silly."
   Since the oil crisis of the early 1970s, the notion of
light forces has gotten little more than lip service. The
problem is buried in the Pentagon's Byzantine arms-buying
bureaucracy.
   Consider the saga of the 20-ton tank. Irving Wolf, a
marketing official at a unit of United Industrial Corp., says
his firm spent more than 10 years trying unsuccessfully to
entice the Army into building this "Rapid Deployment Forces
Tank." Designed so half a dozen could be carried in a C-5
transport, it would be mounted with a high-velocity, 75mm
cannon developed by Pentagon researchers to penetrate Soviet
tank armor -- precisely the kind of weapon now needed against
Iraq's tanks.
   But the Army always remained cool to the idea, Mr. Wolf
says. Its officers were a "little bit concerned about whether
or not a light tank would affect {funding for} the M-1 tank."
   Defending the M-1 is a religion in the Army. Even though
officials admit that they could use a good, light tank for
fast deployment, they cannot abandon their 100% commitment to
the 60-ton M-1, only one of which could be carried by a C-5
to places this far away. The Army has been promoting
development of a much heavier tank -- versions of which are
estimated to weigh a whopping 80 tons. This proposed
behemoth, development of which has been slowed up by budget
pressures, simply couldn't fit into any airplane or travel on
most roads. It would collapse bridges even in developed
countries such as West Germany, let alone ones in the Third
World.
                                                                                                       

   Airlift and sealift capacity must be upgraded.
   Historically, efforts to enhance cargo-carrying capacity
have been relegated to the back burner by gung-ho generals
and admirals, who tend to focus instead on more sexy combat
equipment. Lawrence Korb, who helped oversee President
Reagan's trillion-dollar military buildup, says civilian
officials had to force the Navy to develop the fast roll-on,
roll-off ships now carrying M-1 tanks and Bradley Fighting
Vehicles toward the Persian Gulf. "The Navy didn't want to
spend all the money to fix these ships so that they could be
used to put Army stuff on," he says flatly. The first batch
of the long-awaited heavy armor is expected to reach the
field later this week.
   Spurred by the crisis in the Middle East, the Army's top
brass now appears committed to trying to solve the problem by
advocating creation of a stronger, unified "Transportation
Command." It would have a big budget. It would have a lot of
clout. There's just one problem: It would dilute Air Force's
authority to buy transport planes.
   The outlook for the C-17, the Air Force's next-generation
cargo plane, is also bleak, but for other reasons. Built by a
McDonnell Douglas Corp. unit, the project is beset by delays,
cost overruns and nagging manufacturing problems that
threaten to keep it mired in low-rate production for years.
   Meanwhile, much of the Air Force's present cargo fleet is
almost ready for retirement, because many of the planes have
been flying since the 1960s. The strain of moving immense
quantities of weapons, food, and other supplies to Saudi
Arabia -- equivalent to relocating a U.S. city of about
40,000 -- is beginning to show on pilots. "Many of us are up
to our maximum {monthly} flying hours," says Air Force Lt.
Steve Jank of Lexington, Mass.
   Improving ship transport, while a goal everyone supports
in the abstract, also faces problems. Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney, committed to improving nuclear defenses and
buying new aircraft, opposes such spending. "Everyone gives
the issue pious approval," fumes Rep. Charles Bennett, the
veteran Florida Democrat who has fought for fast sealift as
chairman of an armed services subcommittee. "But nobody wants
to pay for it."
   The Navy, for its part, saves its clout for backing ships
with guns, not cargo ships.
   Summing it up, Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, who is in charge of
the unprecedented supply operation for Desert Shield, says
his crews are "doing the job with host-nation support the
best they can." But the acute shortages of cargo ships and
planes, he says flatly, "have both been documented" during
the crisis.
                                                                                                       

   As nuclear needs decrease, the Pentagon must transfer high
technology to conventional weaponry.
   Here, the situation isn't nearly so glum.
   Just look at Star Wars, the high-tech venture conceived as
a shield against annihilation by Soviet missiles. The
Pentagon lately has been researching a proposed anti-missile
system dubbed "brilliant pebbles," a swarm of small rockets
in space that would guard against Soviet or even Third World
missiles.
   As Iraqi troops were rushing into Kuwait, the Senate
reversed years of solid, bipartisan support for Star Wars,
and voted to delay brilliant pebbles for at least a decade.
Little noticed at the time, though, was a move by lawmakers
to beef up funding for a less ambitious anti-missile system,
called the Arrow, which the U.S. and Israel are jointly
developing with Star Wars money. It may be an archetype for
applying outsized technology to a new array of enemies.
   Researchers say the Arrow, with a speed of approximately
17,000 miles an hour, is designed to intercept ballistic
missiles at such a height that their warheads -- carrying
nerve gas, for instance -- would be destroyed in the
explosion or evaporated before inflicting damage on the
ground. It's intended to protect smaller areas than the
original brilliant pebbles concept. As political backing for
other Star Wars projects fades, support for the Arrow, says
an Israeli official, "is as safe as sun coming up tomorrow in
the Middle East."
   Other more down-to-earth weapons could eventually help
U.S. forces surmount Third World conflagrations. One example
is the FOG-M, a fiber-optic guided missile being developed by
Boeing Co. and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft unit.
Classified Army reports brag that it will "dominate"
battlefields when it is introduced, sometime in 1996.
   Army officials describe the missile, light enough to be
launched from a Jeep, as exactly what the troops in Saudi
Arabia need right now. It is guided through a thin
fiber-optic filament that, unlike the weapons they have now,
allows soldiers to shoot at tanks while keeping their cover.
Not everyone in the Army is so enthusiastic, however. Some of
the service's acquisition officials, resentful of anything
that might make tanks look bad, have insisted on deployment
of the FOG-M only as an anti-helicopter weapon.
                                                                                                       

   Weapons must be developed and produced much faster.
   All this technology transfer is meaningless without rapid
development, something the military establishment has been
notoriously bad at. Take, for example, the FOG-M missile. It
was first demonstrated in an Army laboratory in 1984, yet
remains nowhere near production. The French and the Japanese
have meanwhile swiped the idea for the weapon, and are likely
to field it first. Another example is the AAWS-M, a potent
light anti-tank weapon scheduled to replace the LAW, the
bazookalike missile that U.S. soldiers are carrying here.
Since Vietnam, the LAW has been widely regarded as
ineffectual. Unfortunately, the Pentagon has just started to
develop its replacement, which won't be available for at
least a few years.
   From leathernecks in the field to John Betti, the Defense
Department's top acquisition official, everyone agrees that
the current average of eight or nine years to bring a
relatively simple piece of hardware from the drawing board to
the combat zone is simply too long. Some major Army and Navy
programs take twice that long to become reality.
   The military could field many more weapons by also
improving the ones it has now; with up-to-date radar,
computers and missile-guidance systems, for example, current
fighters and warships could be used instead of altogether new
models. The Air Force and Navy have started down that road,
but the lure of new weapons systems continues to distract
them.
   Pentagon planners proudly boast, for instance, that the
Air Force F-15s and F-16s rushed into Saudi Arabia are more
agile, better maintained and more sophisticated than Iraqi
jet fighters, half of which are believed to be aging
Soviet-built MiG-17s, MiG-21s and Su-7s. But at the same
time, senior Air Force generals have been telling Congress
that U.S. air superiority will diminish in the next decade
unless Congress preserves nearly $100 billion in spending on
new fighters and ground-attack planes.
   Maneuvers such as that are used by all sides in the
defense debate -- a game, says Rep. Aspin, in which all seek
to "argue for their past positions." Iraq's military threat,
he says, "won't be decisive" in shaping the Pentagon's plans
for spending next year. "You don't turn around the U.S.
defense establishment overnight."

   Is Dr. Sakai Garlic
   Better for Breath?

   Sniff at Low-Odor Brand,

   Looking for some reason to feel thankful? Then feel
thankful that you were nowhere near La Plume, Pa., when Lili
Zeigler, then a teacher at Keystone Junior College, ate a
bunch of garlic and tested her breath on innocent people.
   "I went around the college and asked people, `Would you
mind if I blew in your face?'" she says, explaining: "You can
do things like that in an academic community because
everybody loves experimenting."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What Ms. Zeigler was experimenting with was Dr. Sakai
Garlic, a Japanese innovation that promises "no more garlic
breath." This is important for Ms. Zeigler, since she is a
speech teacher.
   Kotaro Sakai, a 58-year-old doctor of agriculture in
Tokyo, touts his garlic bulbs as a leap forward in oral
hygiene, thanks to the pickling solution he has concocted.
The aroma and taste of garlic survive, but, he says, the odor
leaves the breath especially fast. He attaches a caveat for
people with "less-than-common body chemistry."
   Mr. Sakai is the president of Sanko Chemical Institute, a
small research center, and he shows up in a Japanese version
of Who's Who as a soil researcher. But his real passion for
20 years has been garlic. He has peeled so many bulbs, he
says, that one time his fingernails fell out.
   His product is being handled in America by 56-year-old
Taeko Bybee. A U.S. resident but a Japanese citizen, she is
president of Jewel Rina Inc., a small company in Strausstown,
Pa., controlled by a few Japanese investors.
   She had been casting about for her break in business when
she met Mr. Sakai in 1986, the same year his garlic won a
prize at an inventors' convention in Tokyo.
   Two of Ms. Bybee's previous entrepreneurial outings,
though flops, appeared to be on-point: breath mints called
ABB (for "anti-bad breath") and a breathalyzer that
supposedly worked as a "bad-breath detector." Ms. Bybee
explains: "We Japanese are quite odor conscious."
   Ms. Bybee wanted U.S. marketing rights and Mr. Sakai was
impressed by her zeal, so they clove together. "There will
soon come an age of large garlic consumption," predicts Mr.
Sakai, who talks of potential uses in coffee, in chocolate
and in vitamin drinks.
   Voluptuous, parchment-skinned and chemically complex, the
garlic bulb has evoked mystery as well as scorn since the
time of the pharoahs. It's not only found in Caesar salads,
but was found in King Tut's tomb. It's used not only to ward
off vampires, but illness. This week, scientists from several
continents will meet in Washington to ponder garlic's alleged
aid in preventing cancer and heart disease.
   Robert Lin, a researcher at Nutrition International Co.,
an Irvine, Calif., consulting firm, explains that a
perplexing cascade of chemical reactions gets under way once
the volatile compounds in garlic are exposed to certain
enzymes. "I would say we're at the kindergarten stage" of
understanding, he says.
   But what is well understood is garlic's social liability.
Mr. Sakai argues that the digestion of garlic releases sulfur
compounds known as mercaptans. That's what skunks spray.
   It is Mr. Sakai's mission to solve this problem. The
outcome of his labor is the pickling solution. Its recipe is
a secret, of course. But the U.S. patent hints that it
includes an acid commonly found in plants and also a form of
silica, which is the glassy stuff that's in sand and quartz.
The bulbs are soaked, then cooled and dried.
   In a test involving five persons, their breath showed
lower levels of mercaptans after consumption of treated
garlic than of untreated, the patent asserts.
   In Strausstown, a rural spot in southeastern Pennsylvania,
Jewel Rina's nine workers soak about a ton of bulbs each
week, operating out of a converted chicken hatchery. The
company buys the solution from Mr. Sakai. It orders garlic
from wherever the herb is in season, usually South America or
Gilroy, Calif., "The Garlic Capital of the World."
   Quality control is done by a woman on the packaging line,
who periodically chews a slice of the finished product, moves
face-to-face with a co-worker and then gently puffs.
   Ms. Bybee drives all over the country in her Toyota trying
to sell the garlic. And she is not easily dissuaded. A former
colleague recalls the time she popped into the office of the
head buyer at a grocery chain. "He'd say, `I'm in a meeting.'
She'd say, `Meeting? Yes, that's exactly what we want.' He'd
say, `No I'm in a meeting with other people.' She'd say,
`Yes, they can listen, too.'"
   Some buyers may have needed the hard sell. "It was the
butt of a joke here -- garlic that doesn't smell?" says Ted
Glowiak, a broker at Calkins &amp; Co., a Des Plaines, Ill., food
broker. But now, he says, Calkins has helped distribute the
bulbs to about 300 Chicago-area stores. Elsewhere, too,
various chains -- Acme, Giant Food and Safeway among them --
have signed on for distribution, though sometimes in spotty
quantities.
   It sells for about $1.50 for a two-bulb package that
proclaims on the outside that garlic "has been doing
unsociable things to breath for 7,000 years."
   The product still must overcome much skepticism. Eric
Block, a professor at the State University of New York at
Albany, has long studied the chemistry of garlic. Of late he
has gotten queries about Dr. Sakai Garlic, so he tested a few
bulbs for a compound called allicin, whose breakdown products
contribute to garlic breath. He says he found "no striking
diminution" in allicin. Pending further investigation, he
questions the doctor's claims.
   Eating Well, a food journal with a nose for news, had its
doubts about Dr. Sakai Garlic, too. So a staffer smothered
bread with it for six volunteer eaters and conducted an
informal smell test. The surprise, reported among Eating
Well's product reviews: In five of the six, brush-'em-back
breath "disappeared" within an hour. But the journal noted
that the product was "slightly milder" than ordinary garlic
and cost three times as much.
   A Buddhist priest swears by it. He wrote Mr. Sakai a
thank-you note. Finally, he said, he could eat garlic before
his daily chanting sessions without fear of alienating
worshippers.
   But whether it works or not, a lot of people put no-smell
garlic in the same league as colorized movies or alcohol-free
wine. Lloyd Harris is author of the Book of Garlic and
founder of a Berkeley, Calif.-based club called Lovers of the
Stinking Rose. He says bulb tinkering smacks of the "white
bread syndrome."
   "It's the aftermath of garlic that helps to make it a
celebrated experience, that enables you to linger over it, so
to speak," he sniffs.
   Despite such nay-sayers, Ms. Bybee expects to break into
the black for the first time this year, on sales of about $1
million. Mr. Sakai hopes for even faster sales, but Ms. Bybee
says he may underestimate the breadth of the country. "To
conquer every state takes time," she says.
   New York has been a hard market to crack, she says, but
sales are brisk in Chicago. "Our product is like a cult
product," says Jack Kazanchy, a manager at Jewel Rina. "It's
sort of underground. People hear about it," appropriately,
"by word-of-mouth."

   MORE CONFRONTATION is assured in labor relations.
   That's the outlook for the year ahead as Labor Day nears,
labor and management people agree. Fights will heat up
further over job cuts, manufacturers doing work abroad or
employers pushing harder to compete in world markets, say
union locals and many companies. Unless more job security is
achieved, at a time of big layoffs, "it's gonna come to an
all-out war," says James "Whitey" Hale, head of UAW Local 326
in Flint, Mich.

   Unions will resist sales quotas as production goals become
"a forced condition" for employment, says Carter Hawley Hale
Stores. Unions will try to change labor laws, and both sides
will debate paying health care costs, says Tenneco. The Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers union sees worker training and
the skills of temporary workers as "critical battlegrounds."
The union says, "It's still us and them."
   Relations will be more strained for a while, but "the
survivors will get over it," a Federal-Mogul official says.
                                                                                                       

   A NEW CONNECTICUT LAW targets construction-firm cheaters.
   Companies that lose contracts can sue winning bidders who
evade paying unemployment and workers' compensation, under a
law taking effect Oct. 1. James Lohr, director of the
Carpentry Industry Partnership, a labor-industry group based
in Norwalk, says such practices are "a severe problem for
legitimate contractors" who make the required payments.
   "I can now make the enforcement people do their job," says
Michael Hobbs, a New Canaan contractor. The IRS says that at
least $1.6 billion a year in tax revenue has been lost
nationally; it estimates that 38% of employers misclassify
workers as contractors, avoiding unemployment, workers'
compensation and Social Security taxes. Joint union-industry
groups in California and Illinois show interest in similar
legislation.
                                                                                                       

   MANY EMPLOYERS refuse to pay reservists' health costs.
   Fully 18 of 29 employers polled by consultant Hewitt
Associates said they won't continue medical benefits for
employees called to military duty in the Middle East crisis,
or will do so just for dependents. Over half of 52 firms
surveyed by consultant Towers Perrin will halt medical
benefits for both reservists and dependents.
   The IRS, whose tax rulings influence federal benefits
policy, will decide soon whether an employer must continue
dependents' health coverage if the reservist wants, as
benefits law ordinarily requires when an employee leaves a
firm. The Pentagon insists employers have the same obligation
for called-up reservists, but the IRS has argued that the
military's Champus medical plan must pick up the dependent
costs, says consultant William M. Mercer.
   Champus is cheaper for reservists than continued employer
coverage, but doesn't cover the cost of dental work, among
other problems.
                                                                                                       

   IRV FLETCHER GOES EAST: The Oregon AFL-CIO president,
seeking support of labor leaders for old-growth-timber
cutting, hits New York this week. He'll warn that federal
policy to protect the northern spotted owl may mean reduced
lumber supply, higher housing costs in New York and other
places, and lower government timberland sale revenues.
                                                                                                       

   SOME 154 TEAMSTERS officials made over $100,000 in
salaries, bonuses and expenses in 1989, and 20 topped
$200,000, a dissident group says, citing reports to the Labor
Department. The leader was Harold Friedman of Cleveland, who
got $1.4 million for five union posts; he was convicted last
year of racketeering and embezzling union funds.
                                                                                                       

   WORRIED OVER COMPETITION, the insurance industry works
hard to curb labor costs. In a study by consultant Hay Group
including 615 companies, 70% of 47 insurance firms raised
their workers' share of health-care premiums, compared with
44% overall. Some 30% of insurers cut work forces by 5% or
more last year; only 13% of companies generally made such
cuts.
                                                                                                       

   EXECUTIVE RECRUITERS scramble, in a more competitive
market.
   Search firms boost the time during which they'll find a
replacement, at no fee, for a placed manager who doesn't work
out, to an average of over nine months, says the National
Association of Executive Recruiters. More fired financial and
other executives are job-hunting these days. Many send
resumes directly, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons and Super Valu Stores
say. Simon &amp; Schuster often skips searchers for midlevel
jobs.
   Less business means firms must "fight harder" to satisfy
employers, says Colin Hanna, president of the Cheshire Group,
a searcher. "Hungry" firms "call me every day," some offering
fee cuts, a BellSouth official says. They're "pushier," says
Quantum Chemical. Dennis Mummert, a Tampa, Fla., recruiter,
forgoes some added fees that he usually gets when a placed
executive's salary exceeds the estimate.
   But placement consultant James Challenger says fired
managers are getting new jobs at near-record speed.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Postal Service bargaining with its biggest
unions on a new, three-year contract starts today. . . . A
total of 85% of 501 human-resource executives polled by
consultant Right Associates foresee a worker-supply crisis,
up from 76% last year. . . . The Commonwealth Fund pays for
joint business-nursing degrees at 10 colleges, aimed at
easing a shortage of nurses in management jobs.

   Appeals Court Agrees to Review Reversal
   Of Chestman's Insider-Trade Conviction

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Responding to law-enforcement officials'
claims that future insider-trading prosecutions were at risk,
the federal appeals court in Manhattan agreed to a rare,
full-court review of the reversal of former stockbroker
Robert Chestman's conviction.
   The reversal decision, issued May 2 by three members of
the appeals court, essentially gutted two major laws used by
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice
Department in fighting insider trading. The U.S. Second
Circuit Court of Appeals typically doesn't grant a full
review of decisions by its three-judge panels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In asking the court to rehear the appeal, the SEC said,
"The panel decision, unless set aside, could undermine the
ability of {authorities} . . . to police insider trading,
which has been one of the most important areas of
securities-law enforcement in recent years."
   The U.S. attorney's office, which made the formal request
for a rehearing, said in its brief that the panel's "decision
may well be viewed by the securities industry as providing a
safe harbor within which to trade on inside information."
   Richard A. Kirby, the SEC's senior litigation counsel,
called the decision to rehear the case "a positive step for
the SEC."
   The decision reversing Mr. Chestman's conviction focused
on two areas: whether a fiduciary duty has to be violated for
an insider-trading law to apply, and whether someone who
trades on a stock tip violates the law if the tipper didn't
specifically say that the information was confidential.
   The appeals court announced that a majority of its judges
had voted to reconsider the decision. Oral arguments on the
appeal will be heard by the court at 1 p.m. on Nov. 9. The
court could decide to uphold the panel's decision, which
resulted in Mr. Chestman's release from prison, or it could
rule that the conviction before the trial judge was proper.
   The court said it will address issues raised regarding a
securities regulation called Rule 14e-3, which makes it a
crime to trade on misappropriated information involving a
tender offer. The SEC commonly relies on Rule 14e-3 in
pursuing insider-trading cases against defendants who aren't
company insiders.
   The court also will look at Rule 10b-5, which makes it a
crime to trade on a stock tip that is nonpublic information.
Law-enforcement officials said the earlier decision would
prohibit the use of circumstantial evidence in showing that
someone who received a tip knew or should have known that the
stock information was confidential.
   Already the appeals-court panel's reversal of the Chestman
conviction has been cited in at least one lower-court
decision in a federal insider-trading case. And Thomas
Newkirk, the SEC's chief litigation counsel, said the panel's
decision is being cited by defense attorneys in cases across
the U.S. In its brief, the SEC said, "The impact of the panel
decision is enhanced by the pre-eminent role of this circuit
in the development of the law of insider trading."
   "The original decision was potentially very damaging for"
the SEC's law-enforcement division, Mr. Newkirk said. "The
fact that this circuit is where all our good cases have
historically originated makes it even more important."
   The court's agreement to review the reversal means the
decision now is not binding on federal district judges in the
circuit.
   Mr. Chestman's attorney couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Chestman, formerly a broker with Gruntal &amp; Co., was
found guilty in March 1989 of 31 counts related to alleged
insider trading in Waldbaum Inc. stock just before the
company's takeover in 1986 by Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea
Co.
   The trading was based on information that Mr. Chestman
received fourth-hand, from an in-law of Waldbaum's
then-president. The court reversed the conviction on the
ground that Mr. Chestman hadn't been told that the
information was confidential.

   New Breed of Consultant Aims to Boost
   Fliers' Chances of Surviving a Disaster

AIRLINES (AIR)
</IN>
<LP>
   Linda Pearson, a former flight attendant turned
consultant, is giving a roomful of 100 business travelers her
latest safety tip: Polyester can kill.
   In a plane crash, she says, polyester can melt on skin and
hamper a prompt escape. So she advises wearing cotton or wool
when flying. She also suggests bringing smoke hoods, wearing
seat belts snugly, and making frequent trips to the bathroom
-- because, she explains matter of factly, "a full bladder
can burst on impact."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Pearson is giving a course on how to survive an
airline disaster -- a new and somewhat bizarre breed of
consulting. In seminars and books, a handful of specialists
explore the best ways to prepare for the worst. Some students
even go through eerie evacuations on mock-ups of planes,
complete with stage smoke and screaming flight attendants.
   So far, the tutelage hasn't attracted leisure travelers.
But businesses are taking a keen interest: J.C. Penney Co.,
Primerica Corp., and MCI Communications Corp. have used or
plan to hire these consultants to train some of their
executives and corporate jet crews. "We figure it gives us a
leg up in a disaster," says Milton Bickle, director of
aviation services for Primerica.
   But along with clients, the advice is attracting some
controversy. Critics think the consultants, who charge as
much as $1,600 a day, may be profiting from, or at least
preying on, paranoia, noting that on average there is only
one accident resulting in fatalities for every two million
U.S. flights. They also say some tips -- such as bladders
bursting -- are based more on theory than empirical evidence.
"Some of it is overkill," says Denis Day, a travel management
consultant in Oak Brook, Ill. Adds a spokesman for the Air
Transport Association, an airline trade group: "It may just
scare people more than anything else."
   Still, even skeptics say these specialists are addressing
some important safety issues. The flight attendants main
union, for example, has been pushing airlines to tell
passengers more about preparing for crashes. And there are
many cases of people perishing because of inadequate safety
education. In 1986, 23 people died on a smoking Air Canada
jet that made a forced landing in Cincinnati; many of the
victims sat in their seats instead of evacuating, whereas
most survivors had memorized exit locations.
   "Just having a plan worked out in your mind can make all
the difference in the world," says Ken Burton, president of
Stark Survival Co. in Panama City, Fla., which has trained
executives at more than a dozen companies.
   The training isn't for the squeamish. Students tend to
squirm in their seats when Mr. Burton explains how travelers
who don't wear seat belts properly (tight and around the hip)
can be sucked under the belt in a crash. Ms. Pearson, who has
set up a company in Dallas called SafeAir, gets similar
reactions when she describes how unrestrained babies can
become "deadly projectiles," or how hairspray can act as
lighter fluid for hair. Forget to remove a loose pen before a
crash, she adds, and it may "take off part of your face."
   Ms. Pearson says her lectures are meant to be dramatic.
"The shock of the information helps people to remember it,"
she says.
   But executives say the lessons, while memorable, can be
disturbing. "It gave me flashbacks to my days in Vietnam,"
says D.J. Downing, corporate travel manager for Phillips
Petroleum Co., who recently attended a seminar Ms. Pearson
gave before the National Business Traffic Association, a
trade group for corporate travel managers. But Mr. Downing
says he found the seminar useful.
   The training can also be scary. On a recent afternoon in a
hangar at Westchester County Airport in New York, Mr. Burton
shows five Primerica executives how donning a life vest the
wrong way can cost them their lives, because it won't inflate
properly. Then, he asks the five to crouch into brace
positions on board a parked corporate jet. Slowly, the cabin
fills with stage smoke. "Evacuate]" he yells.
   Even in these controlled conditions, there is panic. To
their dismay, the executives are so blinded by the smoke they
can't see their outstretched hands, and must crawl to find a
window exit. Opening the exit door turns out be tricky, too,
and the group takes more than five minutes to get out.
   Safety experts from the Federal Aviation Administration
and the National Transportation Safety Board haven't attended
any of the classes, but they have mixed reactions to the
concept. On the one hand, they say, most travelers are far
too lax about safety preparations; they ignore the briefing
sessions flight attendants give and rarely read the safety
cards. "I'm for anything that gets people to think in advance
about airline safety," says Tom McSweeny, an FAA deputy
director.
   But Mr. McSweeny doesn't think the traveling public needs
to go quite so far as some consultants suggest. Synthetic
clothes can melt, he says, but that's even rarer than plane
crashes. "I wear polyester when I fly all the time," he says.
   The programs are definitely not cheap: Mr. Burton charges
as much as $1,600 a day to train executives and corporate jet
crews, and a 20-minute video offered by Ms. Pearson costs
$495. There is a cheaper alternative: a book called "Just in
Case," by Daniel Johnson, president of Interaction Research
Corp., an Olympia, Wash., company that makes airline safety
cards. (Curiously, while the consultants say their business
is brisk, Mr. Johnson says his book has sold only 3,000
copies in five years.)
   If the Association of Flight Attendants has its way, the
airlines will be dispensing some of these tips for free. The
union argues that the safety briefing airlines give
passengers needs to have more details on such things as
operating exit doors, using oxygen masks and wearing life
vests. So far, the industry contends it's doing enough. "You
shouldn't have to take some class to learn about airline
safety," says Matt Finucane, safety director for the union.
"But the industry doesn't want to frighten people."

   Earnings Fell 78%
   In Third Quarter

<LP>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. -- General Cinema Corp., citing lower
attendance at summer movies and reduced interest income,
posted a 78% drop in fiscal third-quarter profit.
   The specialty retailer and operator of cinemas reported
that earnings for the quarter ended July 31 fell to $5.7
million, or 8 cents a share, from $25.6 million, or 35 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3% to $506 million from
$491.3 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said its lower profit for the latest quarter
reflected a 46% drop in earnings from interest and dividends,
to $22.3 million from $41.4 million a year ago. The drop
stemmed from a reduction in the company's investable funds to
$1.1 billion from $1.7 billion, which resulted from a
capital-gains tax payment of about $600 million that General
Cinema made in January. The company said the tax payment
related to the sale of its soft-drink bottling business.
   General Cinema said revenue rose but operating earnings
fell slightly from its 60%-owned Neiman Marcus Group unit.
The company added that its Horchow Mail Order business had a
"substantial loss" in the third quarter, and that its
Bergdorf Goodman unit had lower operating earnings due to "a
softening retail environment in New York City" and expenses
associated with opening a new store.
   The company said that during the third quarter, revenues
and operating earnings from its General Cinema Theatres
division fell to $1.3 million from $12.2 million a year
earlier. The division's results reflected lower attendance
levels at summer pictures, which "this year did not attract
the number of patrons which the industry had been
anticipating," the company said.
   General Cinema said the theater division's "situation will
likely continue" through the fiscal fourth quarter,
"resulting in a substantial operating loss by the theater
division for that period and for the full year." In fiscal
1989, the division had operating earnings of $9.2 million, a
spokesman said.
   For the nine months, General Cinema earned $55.6 million,
or 75 cents a share, from continuing operations, compared
with $98 million, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier. In the
period a year earlier, revenue of $10.8 million from
discontinued operations and a gain of $855.1 million from the
sale of the operations made net income $963.9 million, or
$13.06 a share. Revenue rose 14% to $1.67 billion from $1.47
billion.

   Less M.B.A. Demand
   As '80s Tide Ebbs

<TEXT>
   EAGER corporate climbers are still mobbing business
schools' front doors, but demand at the other end -- for new
M.B.A.s -- looks as though it's slowing.
   Several top schools report that recruiting fell off this
past spring, as some companies lowered hiring goals and
strung along prospects longer. As a result, job hunts for
many graduates "were much more stretched out and tougher to
manage," says Jeanne J. Husain, director of placement at the
University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.
   And when decisions did come in, "people tended not to sit
on their offers as long as they had in the past," adds James
J. Beirne of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,
where 309 companies came calling this academic year, down
from 335 a year earlier.
   The biggest slide occurred among struggling computer
makers; at Carnegie Mellon's business school, Apple Computer
Inc., Data General Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. canceled
campus interviews this year, while International Business
Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Inc. halved the number of
jobs they offered. "We were just trying to match our
recruiting efforts with what we felt our anticipated needs
would be," says Hewlett-Packard's R. Kemp Bohlen.
   The slump in the real estate industry and among Wall
Street investment banks also hurt. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., for
one, hired 49 new M.B.A.s this spring, down from 62 last
year.
   Recruiting activity wasn't down universally. Commercial
banks, consumer-products makers and consulting firms
maintained strong interest in M.B.A.s.
   At the University of Rochester's Simon School of Business,
the number of recruiting companies even rose -- to 109 from
101 last year. The school credits tougher application rules
that have boosted the work experience -- and allure -- of its
graduates. But the news isn't all good. Starting pay for
Simon graduates rose just 3.2%, to nearly $44,500, following
a 9.2% jump last year.
                                                                                                       

   Widely Used Test Gets
   More Flunking Grades
                                                                                                       

   AFTER BEING used to screen millions of job applicants in
recent decades, a government workplace test is rapidly
falling out of favor.
   The U.S. Department of Labor is proposing suspension of
the General Aptitude Test Battery, which it developed in the
1940s for state and local employment offices. The offices
have used the test to help place people in government and
private jobs, including blue-collar positions with many
Fortune 500 companies.
   Criticism of the test began in the 1980s, after the
department implemented a new grading system that effectively
boosted the scores -- and job chances -- of minorities. The
Justice Department challenged that arrangement, charging it
could result in reverse discrimination against whites. Last
year, the National Research Council endorsed the scoring
practice, but questioned the GATB's structure and validity.
   At its height five years ago, the exam was taken by nearly
two million people annually in 44 states. Some 35 states were
using it when the suspension was proposed last month, but a
handful have since dropped it and more may follow. Pending a
final decision by year end, the department is planning to
review the exam -- and perhaps overhaul it.
   "We're going to mount a vigorous look at what this
instrument is doing in today's labor market," says Robert J.
Litman, deputy director of the department's Employment
Service.
   Government job offices have other tests to gauge skills
like typing, but without the GATB they are expected to rely
more on those mainstays of assessment, interviews and
reference checks.
                                                                                                       

   Where the Jobs Are:
   At Troubled Firms
                                                                                                       

   AS SAVINGS and loans fail and leveraged buy-outs go sour,
the demand for executives to help run troubled companies is
growing.
   This year, says Windle Priem, a recruiter with Korn/Ferry
International, half his searches involve distressed
institutions, mostly banks and thrifts. That's up from 20%
two years ago. But the industry's turmoil is reducing
executives' enthusiasm for moving. As a result, Mr. Priem
adds, troubled organizations are successful only if they
offer prospects a higher-ranked position, a minimum 30%
increase in cash compensation, "three or four times" annual
salary in stock options and an employment contract.
   Some look for restless targets, someone "with a troubled
company himself, or one of hundreds of senior staff people"
made redundant by mergers, says J. Gerald Simmons, president
of recruiter Handy Associates.
   When recruiting new managers for Western Union Corp.,
which is embroiled in labor disputes and has flirted with a
bankruptcy-law filing, Chairman Robert Ammon sought
risk-takers. "I tended to take people who started their
careers in large companies, but who were also {heads} of
start-ups . . . and maybe had some experiences that got their
noses bloodied a bit."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends

   BOISE, Idaho -- Albertson's Inc. reported net income
increased 16% to $52.9 million, or 40 cents a share, for its
second quarter ended Aug. 2.
   Sales rose 14% to $2.07 billion, although year-earlier
results were slightly depressed by a strike by workers at 34
of its stores in the Seattle, Wash., area. The company
estimated that sales would have increased by only 7.7% if the
strike had not occurred.

   In the year-earlier period, the company earned $45.6
million, or 34 cents a share, on sales of $1.8 billion.

   Hasenfus Loses Bid for Contra-Role Cash

   Eugene Hasenfus, a crew member on a plane shot down over
Nicaragua in 1986, lost his bid to be compensated for his
role in the White House-sanctioned Contra supply mission.
   After indicating they were deadlocked late last week,
jurors in a federal district court in Miami yesterday
rejected the former mercenary's claims. The setback followed
a blow to Mr. Hasenfus's case earlier this month, when
federal Judge C. Clyde Atkins tossed out a major portion of
his claims. That action whittled down Mr. Hasenfus's request
for compensation to only $500, according to Brian Strange, an
attorney with Strange &amp; Hoey, the Los Angeles law firm that
represented Mr. Hasenfus.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Almost two years ago, Mr. Hasenfus sued people he claimed
had been his employers, alleging that they failed to
adequately equip the aircraft and abandoned him after his
capture by the Sandinista government.
   The suit, filed in Miami, sought unspecified damages from
Southern Air Transport, a Miami-based cargo airline, and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a key figure in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   The suit alleged that Mr. Hasenfus was nominally employed
by a Pennsylvania carrier, but that Southern Air and Mr.
Secord "substantially ran the Contra resupply operation." The
jury found in favor of Mr. Hasenfus on that charge, but then
found that he wasn't eligible to be compensated.
   Mr. Hasenfus, sole survivor on the plane downed by a
heat-seeking missile, said he was "captured, imprisoned and
mentally tortured for three months" because the plane was
ill-equipped. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison by the
Sandinista government, but pardoned several weeks later and
permitted to return to the U.S.
   But even before the case went to the jury, Judge Atkins
ruled that the jurors couldn't consider damages for mental
stress suffered by Mr. Hasenfus and his wife. The judge also
threw out claims of negligence and punitive damage claims by
Mr. Hasenfus and the family of the late Wallace Sawyer Jr.,
another crew member who died on the ill-fated mission.
   Defense attorneys had argued that Mr. Hasenfus was aware
of the risks involved in the covert flight. But attorneys for
Mr. Hasenfus and the Sawyer family contended that the
couriers deserved to be compensated for working on behalf of
a White House-approved operation to support the Contra
rebels.
   Mr. Strange said he thought the judge erred in dismissing
some of the claims. "If we can raise the funds, we will
appeal the case," he said.
   Despite the jury's finding that Mr. Secord and Southern
Air had ties to Mr. Hasenfus, David Kirstein, an attorney
with the Washington, D.C., law firm of Beckman &amp; Kirstein
that represented Southern Air, said: "The bottom line is they
didn't find any liability."

   REPORTERS CAN BE FORCED to disclose nonconfidential
information.
   A Michigan appeals court in Lansing ruled that news
organizations must turn over unpublished photographs and
notes to people involved in civil lawsuits.
   It was the first time that a Michigan court has considered
whether the First Amendment protects reporters from having to
disclose nonconfidential information. And lawyers involved in
the case said they believed that the Michigan court is among
the first in the nation to refuse to recognize that any
constitutional privilege exists for nonconfidential
information.
   The decision involves the Ann Arbor News, which is owned
by Booth Newspapers Inc. of Grand Rapids and which appealed a
lower court order that it turn over 20 unpublished
photographs of a 1986 fire at an Ann Arbor video business.
   The photographs had been sought by American Employers'
Insurance Co. for use in a lawsuit brought by the business's
owner after the company rejected his insurance claim.
American Employers, a unit of Commercial Union Corp. of
Boston, contended that arson was involved.
   Most courts have ruled that the First Amendment protects
journalists from turning over information unless it is
critical to the prosecution or defense of a claim and
unobtainable elsewhere, said Thomas Leatherbury, a First
Amendment lawyer with the Dallas firm of Rocke Purnell Rain
Harrell. (Reporters are often compelled to turn over
materials in criminal cases.)
   But the appeals panel refused to recognize a qualified
privilege. In its decision last week, the panel ruled that no
privilege exists for nonconfidential information under the
First Amendment, the Michigan Constitution and the Michigan
Press Shield Law, which protects journalists from having to
disclose confidential information to grand juries.
   The panel found that journalists' traditional argument
that their ability to gather news depends upon the right to
protect confidential sources does not extend to
nonconfidential materials. And the panel said that there is
no evidence that having to produce such information would
disrupt reporters' news gathering activities.
   "The rationale for the privilege simply breaks down in a
nonconfidential situation. The source has no expectation of
privacy," said Richard Winter of the Chicago firm Clausen
Miller Gorman Caffrey &amp; Witous, a lawyer for American
Employers.
   Lee Levine, a media defense lawyer with the Washington
firm of Ross, Dixon &amp; Masback, argues that First Amendment
protections should still apply in cases involving
nonconfidential information.
   "Newspapers make editorial judgements about what to
include or exclude. Once they have decided to exclude
something, to be required to disseminate it against their
will intrudes on First Amendment freedoms," Mr. Levine said.
   The Ann Arbor News' lawyer, Jonathan Rowe of the Ann Arbor
firm of Dykema Gossett, said his client had not decided
whether to appeal.

   IMMIGRATION LAW changes to ease nursing shortage gain
ground.
   The changes are part of an immigration bill approved by
the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month to allow
more skilled immigrants into the U.S. The immigration package
hasn't been voted on by the full House.
   The rules affecting nurses are meant to correct problems
in a law passed last year to ease the severe shortage of
nurses in many U.S. hospitals. The 1989 law was expected to
enable 16,000 foreign-citizen registered nurses to remain in
the U.S. as permanent residents. But immigration lawyers and
health-care groups said many of the nurses were being
disqualified under rules adopted by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to enforce the law. For instance,
foreign nurses who did unauthorized work, such as for a
hospital other than the nurse's work-visa sponsor, were
disqualified.
   The changes adopted by the House committee would remove
that disqualification, said a spokesman for Rep. Charles
Schumer (D., N.Y.), who added new language to the bill. The
changes also would allow the nurses' families to become
permanent residents, removing another hurdle for many of the
nurses.
   The immigration package approved by the House committee
also would remove a clause that had been used to ban some gay
immigrants. An amendment introduced by Rep. Barney Frank (D.,
Mass.) would remove a list of health-related reasons under
which foreigners can be banned, including sexual deviance,
mental retardation, insanity and chronic alcoholism.
   The measure would substitute two conditions: Immigration
would be barred for drug abusers or addicts, and for anyone
with a physical or mental disorder that endangers the
individual or others.

   MERGER CONTEMPLATED by two Boston law firms.
   Gaston &amp; Snow, with 260 lawyers, is negotiating a merger
with Csaplar &amp; Bok, a Boston firm that hopes to establish a
national presence. Like many law firms of its size, 48-lawyer
Csaplar &amp; Bok decided that "we couldn't call ourselves a
national firm and be in competition with people on Wall
Street at that size," said partner Richard C. Csaplar Jr. The
law firm has shrunk by nearly 20 lawyers since the partners
decided to stop working for small local clients two years
ago.
   Gaston &amp; Snow has grown rapidly in recent years, and now
has offices in New York, Washington, San Francisco, and
Phoenix.
   The firms have been talking for two weeks and are hoping
to make a final decision by the end of September.

   Stocks Post Biggest Advance Since 1987
   But Low Volume Makes Traders Cautious

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks rallied in their
biggest one-day gain since shortly after the October 1987
market crash, but traders remained wary of the recovery.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 13.94 to 381.27, a 3.79%
gain. That's the largest one-day percentage gain for smaller
stocks since Oct. 30, 1987, and the fifth largest in history.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, volume fell to 129.4 million shares from 161.1
million Friday. Advancing stocks swamped decliners, 1,560 to
543, but only 19 stocks hit new highs while 107 fell to new
lows.
   Encouraged by falling oil prices and hopes for a
negotiated settlement in the Middle East, small investors
joined institutions in snapping up shares battered by last
week's market plunge, traders said. The day's relatively
light trading made many traders nervous about the strength of
the revival.
   "I think it will be like a rally in a bear market --
sudden, sharp and short," said Peter Da Puzzo, co-head of
world-wide equities for Shearson Lehman Brothers. Without
further bad news from the Middle East or on the economic
front, he suggested OTC stocks could extend their gains the
next few days, but would succumb to profit-taking late in the
week.
   "There's a lot of uncertainty out there," agreed E.E.
"Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc., New
York. "I think it's all still up in the air until we get
something definitive out of the Middle East."
   Emboldened by buoyant markets overseas, investors rushed
to buy shares on the opening. The recovery in foreign
financial markets "set the stage" yesterday morning, said
William Sulya, head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons,
St. Louis. However, Mr. Sulya said that as the day closed he
saw investors taking some profits. "I wouldn't be surprised
if they take the market down tomorrow," he added.
   The day's largest gainers included some of the OTC's
biggest stocks or, as Mr. Da Puzzo described them, "our Nifty
50." Among the day's leaders, Nike sprinted 6 1/2 to 68,
Microsoft jumped 4 3/4 to 60 3/4, Apple Computer added 2 to
37 3/4, MCI Communications advanced 1 to 33 7/8 and the
American depositary receipts of Reuters Holdings PLC leaped 3
to 51 3/4.
   Corporate plans to buy back stock continued to boost
shares. Liz Claiborne rose 1 3/4 to 27 1/2 after the clothing
retailer said it would buy back an additional $50 million of
its stock -- about 1.9 million shares at Friday's price.
   Intel, the day's most active stock, added 1/4 to 36 1/4,
extending Friday's gains. Thursday, the Santa Clara, Calif.,
semiconductor maker said it will buy back as many as 20
million of its 195.6 million shares outstanding.
   Sun Microsystems surged 1 1/4 to 28 7/8. Friday, the
Mountain View, Calif., computer workstation maker confirmed
it dropped a planned public offering of 5.9 million shares of
common.
   Among other technology shares, 3Com Corp. jumped 1 to 12
7/8 and SynOptics Communications added 1 to 26 1/4. The two
California makers of computer networking systems announced a
strategic alliance designed to integrate the management of
certain products.
   Novell eased 1/4 to 24 after trading as high as 25 1/2.
After the market closed, the Provo, Utah, maker of personal
computer network systems reported net income for its third
quarter rose to 38 cents a share from 18 cents a year
earlier.
   Trans World Music leaped 3 1/2 to 23 after the Albany,
N.Y., retailer of records, tapes and videos reported net
income for the second quarter, ended Aug. 4, rose to 18 cents
a share from 11 cents a year ago.
   Scitex jumped 3 to 32 1/2 after the Israeli maker of
computer imaging products declared a 2-for-1 stock split.
Ordinary shares of another Israeli computer concern,
Optrotech, added 1 to 5 1/2.
   Medical-related issues also rebounded. Summit Technology
gained 1/4 to 11 3/4 on nearly 1.6 million shares, more than
six times average volume. The Food and Drug Administration
told the Watertown, Mass., developer of laser surgery
products it can proceed with the second phase of tests of a
Summit laser for the treatment of nearsightedness. Among
other medical products issues, Marquest Medical Products
gained 1 1/8 to 8 1/4.
   Chiron surged 3 1/2 to 35 1/4 after Ciba-Geigy AG, the
Swiss pharmaceutical company, said that a two-year human
trial of an experimental AIDS vaccine produced encouraging
results, but was only a limited success. The experimental
vaccine is being developed by Biocine Co., a joint venture of
Chiron and Ciba-Geigy's U.S. subsidiary. Human trials of a
new experimental vaccine, using knowledge gained in the
Geneva study, will start in the U.S. before the end of the
year, Ciba-Geigy said.
   Among biotechnology issues, Cetus rose 7/8 to 7 5/8. The
Emeryville, Calif., company said the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office will issue certificates reaffirming the
validity of all claims of two Cetus patents. Cetus said the
move supports its position in a lawsuit with Du Pont Co.
involving the patents.
   Bullish comment by analysts boosted other issues. Centocor
catapulted 6 3/4 to 37 after Labe Simpson &amp; Co. analyst
Joseph Edelman repeated a "buy" opinion on the Malvern, Pa.,
biotechnology concern, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report. Mr. Edelman also repeated a "buy" rating on
Chiron.
   Ryan's Family Steak Houses added 7/8 to 6 1/8 after
Prudential-Bache analyst Leslie Steppel upgraded her
investment opinion on the Greer, S.C., restaurant operator to
"buy" from "hold," PIR said. Ms. Steppel estimates Ryan's
will earn 47 cents a share in 1990 and 55 cents in 1991,
compared with 41 cents in 1989.
   Maynard Oil rose 7/8 to 7 5/8 after Barron's magazine gave
the Dallas oil company a favorable review. Maynard, which has
a book value of $6 a share, is expected to earn 65 cents a
share this year, up from 44 cents in 1989; 1990 cash flow is
estimated at $1.40 a share.

   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. -- Amwest Insurance Group Inc. said
it will post a fiscal third-quarter gain of $797,000, or 34
cents a share, in the wake of a state measure signed into law
Sunday.
   The law exempts certain types of insurance, including
surety bonds, from rate rollbacks and other major provisions
of Proposition 103, a controversial initiative that passed in
1988. Amwest is an insurance holding company that specializes
in surety bonds.

   Amwest had established a $1.4 million pretax reserve for
potential premium rebates in its second quarter, ended June
30. The $797,000 gain reflects a reversal of the reserve in
the current quarter, ending Sept. 30.

   The Bush administration had managed the Gulf crisis with
great skill, deploying a large military force in the region
and winning international backing for the use of weapons, if
necessary, to enforce the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq.
They've adeptly increased the pressure around Saddam Hussein.
But now the Bush team's backing for a "peace mission" to
Amman by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
mainly confuses matters.
   We wonder exactly what it is that Mr. Perez de Cuellar
plans to discuss Thursday with Tariq Aziz, Saddam's
smooth-talking foreign minister. A face-saving way for Saddam
to retreat from Kuwait? That doesn't begin to solve the Gulf
problem.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. initiative runs the danger of muddling the point
of the entire Gulf undertaking. Yesterday, for instance, the
Bush folks in Maine were on various sides of Spin Street. On
the one hand there is Marlin Fitzwater saying "we are
pleased" with the U.N. effort, while the President himself
threw lukewarm water on it, saying he doubted that Saddam
would deal. But what if Saddam actually started to play the
U.N. card? Does Mr. Bush truly want to become bogged down in
some U.N.-sponsored "negotiation" with this character?
   The Gulf problem has a name: Saddam Hussein. George Bush's
initial instinct, that ridding the Middle East of Saddam
Hussein should be his minimum goal, was the correct one. If
the Iraqi survives this confrontation, he will simply lay low
for a while, building bigger rockets, concocting more poison
gas and working toward his most cherished goal, a nuclear
warhead.
   If removing Saddam still is the President's minimum goal,
what is there for the mild-mannered Secretary-General to
negotiate? He no doubt would win an amused smile from Tariq
Aziz if he demanded that Saddam Hussein step down. "Please,"
Tariq would say. "Do you think I'm foolish enough to carry
that message back to Baghdad? Saddam personally shoots people
for less."
   On the generous side, we suppose it's possible here that
the Administration is displaying its occasional tin ear in
matters of public perceptions. The most visible U.S. weekend
supporters of the Perez de Cuellar mission were National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and the State Department's
John M. Kelly. Mr. Scowcroft conducted his own poorly timed
goodwill mission last year, traveling to Beijing not long
after Deng Xiaoping and colleagues had killed several hundred
Chinese students and democrats in Tiananmen Square on the
night of June 4. Mr. Kelly is the Mideast expert who assured
Congress of Saddam's likely good behavior a few days before
the Iraqi sent his tanks rolling toward Kuwait City.
Embracing the U.N. mission just doesn't ring true in the
current context of events.
   Allied commanders say that forces are now in place to
punish Saddam in a way he understands, by destroying his air
force, his missiles, his tanks, his poison-gas factories and
his nuclear installations. After Saddam's generals and other
assorted accomplices are cleaned out, Iraq could be put under
the suzerainty of an Arab leader the West and Iraqis
themselves could trust. That means someone who does not
habitually murder Kurds and Shiites, threaten peaceful
neighbors or harbor terrorists who prey on Europe and Israel.
   Will military action against Hussein receive support from
the American people? As with all military actions against
tyrants, it will win support if it succeeds and if its
purpose is made clear. Successful actions against Moammar
Gadhafi, Castro-backed forces in Grenada and Manuel Noriega
in Panama were applauded. If the operation falls apart,
George Bush will be skewered by both his natural enemies and
frequent supporters. Events in the world often force
Presidents to take those kinds of risks. They are minor
compared with those his troops run. The odds this time are in
his favor.
   The alternative is to leave U.S. and British troops
sweltering in the desert while Mr. Perez de Cuellar shuttles
back and forth trying to do a deal with Saddam. High-tech
airplanes designed for such jobs as neutralizing the Iraqi
air force on the ground will be threatened by sandstorms and
corrosion. After Labor Day, Congress will return and start
compromising the Commander in Chief's authority. Mr. Bush
should not leave himself in that position.

   NEW YORK -- When Iraqi television began beaming videotape
of a grinning Iraq President Saddam Hussein visiting with
grim British hostages last Thursday -- a meeting the U.S.
State Department condemned as "shameful theatrics" --
executives at NBC News agonized over whether to air the
footage immediately.
   They decided against it. "There was a spirited discussion
and debate around here about airing this propaganda
unedited," says NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw. "The consensus
was we could see all the footage, collect our thoughts and
air it within the hour on a regularly scheduled news digest."

   NBC officials were afraid of being used in the "propaganda
machine" of the Iraqi government, says Steve Friedman,
executive producer of "NBC Nightly News." But some critics
complain that in the first few weeks of the crisis in the
Middle East, the three major broadcast networks and the
24-hour Cable News Network have been less successful in
resisting the propaganda of the U.S. government.
   In terms of getting the news and reaching the public,
television has been highly successful in its coverage: Two
weeks ago, the rating for the nightly newscasts for the first
time surpassed that for prime time. For the week of Aug. 13,
the three networks' newscasts drew a combined 59% of the
available audience, according to A.C. Nielsen Co.'s latest
figures, topping a combined 54% of the prime-time audience.
   But critics say the broadcast coverage has yet to provide
much of the counterbalance, the usual skepticism that
accompanies such actions as the Bush administration's move to
deploy one of the country's largest buildup of troops and
weapons since World War II.
   "Television coverage hasn't been bad, but at the same time
there hasn't been a lot of critical detachment," says Marvin
Kalb, a former correspondent with CBS News and NBC News who
now is a professor at Harvard College. "There is a flavor of
jingoism," he says, that has at times overwhelmed the factual
story.
   Ken Bode, a former NBC News political correspondent who
now is director of the Center of Contemporary Media at DePauw
University, says television isn't exhibiting the kind of
skepticism it should.
   "If this turns into a war, we're going to look back and
ask ourselves how this got started," says Mr. Bode, who also
is a part-time correspondent for CNN, which is owned by
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. "And what we're going to see
is {there were} lots of network reports quoting joint
newspaper-network polls saying how popular the president is."
   It is somehow odd that television -- the medium that
helped turn popular opinion against the war in Vietnam in the
late 1960s and which pointed up the impotence of the Carter
presidency during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979 -- is this
time being criticized for cheerleading as the U.S. risks
heading into a war in the Middle East.
   But the Vietnam conflict was a highly unpopular war, and
the polls reflected it. And the Carter presidency was at or
near an all-time low in popularity as the hostage crisis
worsened. This time around, however, President Bush continues
to enjoy broad public support, even as thousands more
soldiers set down in the deserts of Saudi Arabia with each
passing day.
   "It's difficult to play devil's advocate, especially
against such a popular president as Bush," says ABC
correspondent Sam Donaldson, who is considered one of the
most aggressive network reporters. But playing devil's
advocate is the press's proper role, he adds. "I was
surprised and dismayed by the jingoistic tone of some of my
colleagues. . . . I don't think the media have been as
skeptical as it could be."
   But Ted Koppel, anchor of ABC News's "Nightline," says the
Iraqi situation is a "lengthened" version of "what always
happens when a government agency says something on deadline.
You run with it and play catch-up the next day. During the
first few days, the coverage was unquestioning. But as the
dust settles, journalists are striking out on their own and
bringing back questions that need answering."
   One problem the news teams have is that they air only what
people say -- and in the Iraq face-off, even rival
politicians aren't questioning President Bush's policy.
"They've been struck dumb," says Mr. Bode, the former NBC
correspondent. "We need the strength of loyal opposition, and
we're not getting it. It's up to the media to put this in
perspective -- and television isn't doing it."
   Moreover, Iraq's unprovoked invasion of Kuwait and its
holding of foreigners as "detainees" brought unified outrage
around the world. That makes it more difficult to cover the
Iraq conflict down the middle.
   Indeed, television seems to be having the toughest time
appearing objective when it comes to the hostage issue, the
most inflammatory aspect of the crisis.
   On Aug. 21, the "CBS Evening News with Dan Rather" offered
riveting television as Mr. Rather, on his last day of
reporting from the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, interviewed
individuals he described as "hostages . . . a group of
Americans who were forced to seek what they hope will be a
safe haven in U.S. diplomatic housing in Baghdad." The CBS
Inc. anchorman ended the broadcast by staring intently into
the camera and declaring: "Americans in peril."
   And over a week ago on "Nightline," Capital Cities/ABC's
TV network correspondents Mr. Koppel and Barbara Walters
grilled the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations. "All this
nonsense about using euphemisms like detainees and
restrictees is . . . something that belongs in the garbage
can," Mr. Koppel declared on the air. "These people are
hostages, they're being treated like hostages and they're
going to be used as hostages."
   Such combative words from the stars of television news
alarm some critics.
   "I'm worried the networks are whooping up war fever," says
Tom Shales, television critic for the Washington Post. "The
media has played up the hostage angle because it's easy and
tugs at the heart of America. It's a little scary when
journalists try their hand at diplomacy, like on
`Nightline,'" he adds.
   But some network news executives disagree. Don Browne, the
No. 2 executive at General Electric Co.'s NBC News, says the
"overall" television coverage has been "excellent." He
contends the networks haven't dwelled on the hostage story.
"We were pretty restrained until the President used the term
himself," says Mr. Browne. "Then we eased into it."
   Whether the networks continue merely to "ease into it,"
however, is another matter, particularly if the Iraqis start
parading Americans before TV cameras.
   American TV camera crews and correspondents were allowed
to return to Baghdad this weekend, so viewers can expect more
aggressive coverage on the situation in the region. Even NBC
News and CNN, which had been locked out of the first wave of
visas in the first two weeks of the crisis, were allowed
entry.
   Already, "the glow has started to fade" in the networks'
coverage, says Robert S. Lichter, the head of the Center for
Media and Public Affairs in Washington D.C. "Television is
searching for negative stuff on Bush," he adds. Last
Thursday, for instance, reporters could be seen on the air
questioning President Bush about his dedication to energy
conservation given his use of a speedboat for fishing during
his vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Also last Thursday, "NBC Nightly News" aired one of
television's first probing pieces that Mr. Lichter
characterizes as "very strong anti-war." The story focused on
a father whose son, a U.S. Marine, had been ordered to the
Middle East. It was introduced by anchor Tom Brokaw this way:
   "So far, President Bush's decision to launch this massive
military operation in the Persian Gulf is solidly backed by
the American public. But as it goes on unresolved, how long
will that support last?"

   CHICAGO -- Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing lack of
growth in demand for containerboard products, said it lowered
its ratings on about $550 million in debt issued by Stone
Container Corp.
   The rating concern said "overcapacity and declining
prices" in the containerboard market will mean that Stone's
"internal cash generation will be insufficient to allow for
meaningful debt reduction this year or next."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moody's said that "rising containerboard capacity, against
a no-growth demand background, is producing overcapacity and
declining prices." This, Moody's said, could reduce Stone's
internal cash generation below the level of its capital
spending in 1990 and 1991, allowing the company, the largest
containerboard producer in the country, to reduce its debt
only by selling assets.
   The production facilities that Stone operates are more
expensive to run than those of its main competitors, Moody's
said, and "significant investment" is needed to bring
production costs down.
   Moody's downgraded $350 million in 13.625% subordinated
notes, due 1995, to single-B-3 from Ba-3, and $200 million in
11.5% senior subordinated notes to single-B-2 from Ba-3.
   Arnold Brookstone, Stone senior vice president and chief
financial officer, disputed Moody's assessment. "We believe
that the containerboard industry is not operating in a
no-growth demand background," he said. "It's our opinion that
linerboard today is in a relatively tight supply-demand
relationship, and whatever new capacity is coming on is being
absorbed without difficulty."
   Mr. Brookstone said: "We feel there is an excellent
opportunity for prices in linerboard to be going up rather
than declining. Prices are due to increase overseas, and we
hope that will be a prelude to price increases domestically."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Stone shares closed at $13.125, up 37.5 cents.

   U.S. Expels Most of Baghdad's Envoys,
   Keeps a Hard Line on Talks With Iraq

<LP>
   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine -- The U.S. turned tougher in its
diplomatic maneuverings toward Iraq, as the State Department
expelled some Iraqi diplomats and President Bush staked out
an uncompromising position for talks with Baghdad.
   The developments indicate that, while international
attention remains focused on diplomatic rather than military
developments in the Persian Gulf crisis for now, the
prospects that diplomacy can succeed appear bleaker than they
looked over the weekend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its first direct diplomatic retaliation against Iraq,
the U.S. ordered the size of Iraq's diplomatic contingent in
Washington slashed by two-thirds. The step was taken in
response to Iraq's attempt to shut down the American embassy
in occupied Kuwait by surrounding it with troops and shutting
off its electricity and water.
   Meanwhile, President Bush voiced little hope that new
efforts to resolve the confrontation through negotiations
will bear fruit. Mr. Bush endorsed plans by United Nations
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to meet Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz this week, but indicated that the
U.S. doesn't want the U.N. official to discuss anything
except an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   "Saddam Hussein has been so resistant to complying with
international law that I don't yet see fruitful
negotiations," Mr. Bush told reporters at his vacation home
here after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney. Asked whether he is more hopeful there will be a
diplomatic solution to the crisis than he was two weeks ago,
Mr. Bush replied: "I don't particularly see more hope now,
because it's so clear what the world is demanding of Saddam
Hussein. Clearly the objectives remain the same."
   The president said it is "inconceivable" that Mr. Perez de
Cuellar would discuss anything beyond Iraqi compliance with
United Nations resolutions demanding an unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait and release of foreigners being
detained in Iraq and Kuwait. "Clearly we would oppose any
compromise on these fundamental principles that have been
laid down by the United Nations," Mr. Bush said.
   Despite the increased diplomatic tensions, there continued
to be signs that the U.S. and Iraq are trying to avoid
military conflict for the moment. Iraq ordered at least one
captain of an oil tanker in recent days not to defy the
international naval blockade of trade with Iraq, according to
U.S. officials. But they said they were unsure that the
incident reflected any broader Iraqi decision on how to
handle the blockage.
   For his part, Mr. Bush indicated again that he hopes
economic sanctions against Iraq will inflict so much pain on
Saddam Hussein's regime that it will choose to withdraw from
Kuwait to ease the pressure. "My policy is to do everything
we can, working with other nations, to enforce the
sanctions," he said.
   The administration's order expelling Iraqi diplomatic
personnel represented an attempt to lodge a highly visible
protest against Iraq's treatment of American diplomats in
Kuwait -- without going so far as to block avenues of
communication with Baghdad. The State Department announced
that it is ordering Iraq to cut the staff at the Iraqi
embassy in Washington to 19 from 55. Seven diplomats,
including all those who deal with commercial affairs, and 29
non-diplomatic staff members are being forced to leave, said
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   In addition, the U.S. is prohibiting the Iraqi diplomats
who remain in Washington from traveling beyond a 25-mile
radius of the city. The Bush administration clearly hopes
that other nations will follow its lead and expel some Iraqi
diplomats, but Ms. Tutwiler said only that the U.S. has
"indications" other nations will follow suit.
   The U.S. is particularly angered by Iraq's treatment of
American diplomats after Iraqi officials ordered embassies in
Kuwait closed last week. A small group of diplomats remaining
in the embassy in defiance of that order are basically under
siege, and another group of diplomats who left the embassy
for Iraq are being refused the right to leave Iraq to return
to the U.S. A group of 52 dependents of American diplomats
based in Iraq were allowed to leave Iraq this week, but three
male dependents over the age of 18 were stopped at the
Iraqi-Turkish border as they were about to leave and forced
back to Baghdad.
   In addition, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that 63 other Americans are missing or being held by Iraqi
officials -- 41 in Iraq and 22 in Kuwait.
   Mr. Bush clearly wants to keep diplomatic channels to Iraq
open. After his meeting with Mr. Mulroney, he insisted that
Iraq is free to discuss the Gulf crisis with America's top
diplomat in Baghdad. "I'm not saying we're not going to
talk," Mr. Bush said.
   But the president also suggested that there's little to
talk about until Iraq withdraws its troops from Kuwait and
the ousted Kuwaiti government is restored to power. "The
position of the international law is not negotiable," he
said. "The United Nations has spoken, country after country
supporting the action taken by the Security Council. So
there's no room for compromise or negotiation on that point."
   All told, Mr. Bush's comments and remarks by his aides in
recent days suggest that the administration is willing to let
others explore the possibilities of a diplomatic solution to
the Gulf crisis for a while, now that the U.S. has helped
assemble a significant military force and won sweeping U.N.
legal sanctions against Iraq. But Mr. Bush's tough tone about
the limits of diplomatic discussions is a signal that the
U.S. won't be drawn for now into any bargaining with Saddam
Hussein.
   It's likely that Mr. Bush plans to underscore his views
personally to the U.N.'s Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The president
is scheduled to talk with the secretary-general by phone
before Mr. Perez de Cuellar meets Iraq's foreign minister in
Jordan on Thursday.
   Mr. Bush plans to take a break from his Maine vacation
today for meetings in Washington on the Gulf crisis. He is
due to meet with some 150 members of Congress to discuss the
crisis, and he then plans to spend Wednesday and Thursday in
meetings and briefings on the Gulf situation as well as
coming budget negotiations with Congress. He is set to return
here Thursday night for the long Labor Day weekend.

   In Manipulation of Stock
   Tied to 1986 Acquisition

   LONDON -- The longest-running financial scandal of the
Thatcher era neared a conclusion as a London jury convicted
the former chairman of Guinness PLC and three co-defendants
of charges arising from the company's 1986 takeover of
Distillers Co.
   After a three-year investigation and a trial of more than
100 days, a Southwark Crown Court jury found former Guinness
Chairman Ernest Saunders, 55 years old, guilty of 12 of 13
charges against him. Mr. Saunders, who resigned from Guinness
in 1987 after the scandal broke, allegedly conspired to
inflate the company's stock price to help win its #2.53
billion ($4.91 billion) bid, made in late 1986, for
Distillers, a Scottish spirits company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Saunders's son, James, said his father plans to
appeal.
   Much like the separate U.S. proceedings against arbitrager
Ivan Boesky and "junk bond" king Michael Milken, in Britain
the Guinness Affair -- as it was called -- came to symbolize
the excesses of the 1980s bull market and economic
prosperity. As the investigation dragged on and targeted a
few big Conservative Party contributors, the case also became
a political embarrassment to the Conservative government of
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The guilty verdict, though nearly four years in the
making, will enhance the oft-tarnished reputations of British
financial regulators. After the scandal broke, Mrs.
Thatcher's government accelerated adoption of a broad series
of reforms in U.K. legislation on financial crime, insider
trading and corporate law. The Guinness case was the most
far-reaching undertaken by the government's new white-collar
crime squad. And in London's financial district, it became a
major test of the government's mettle.
   "It is an important case because it demonstrates the
authorities' intention to prove that the new legislation . .
. actually sticks and is made to work," said Peter Smith,
partner in charge of the London office of management
consultants Coopers Lybrand Deloitte.
   "Had there not been a guilty verdict, it might have been
open house for quite a lot of undesirable practices" in
London's financial district, Jonathan Guinness, a former
Guinness director, told the British Broadcasting Corp. A
spokesman for the London-based spirits company, which was
never implicated in any of the charges, declined to comment.
   But the case was hardly a resounding victory for British
prosecutors or the legal system. The criminal inquiry didn't
get very far until some help came in 1987 from the U.S.,
where investigators found a link between the Guinness and
Boesky cases.
   Even then, the trial's start was repeatedly delayed, and a
mistrial was declared after some jurors pleaded that they
couldn't withstand what promised to be a six-month hearing.
And the trial that ended yesterday, after six days of jury
deliberations, is only the first of two: Mr. Saunders and
three other defendants are expected to go on trial in October
on related charges.
   Mr. Saunders, who now claims to be impoverished, faces a
maximum penalty of 90 years in prison from yesterday's jury
verdict. His sentencing is scheduled for today.
   Convicted along with Mr. Saunders on the conspiracy
charges were British financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, and Gerald
Ronson, 50, chairman of Heron International PLC, a big
British property concern. A fourth defendant, stockbroker
Anthony Parnes, 45, was found guilty of false accounting and
theft charges. Sir Jack faces a maximum penalty of 45 years
in prison; Mr. Ronson, 31 years, and Mr. Parnes, 68.
   The charges all stem from the tactics Mr. Saunders and his
colleagues used to ensure Guinness's victory in the 1986
takeover battle for Distillers. By the then-decorous
standards of British takeover fights, the Guinness contest
against rival bidder Argyll Group PLC was unusually nasty.
Under Mr. Saunders, the once-sleepy Guinness company in the
1980s had embarked on a spending spree to become a global
force in the brewing and spirits business.
   Because both Guinness and Argyll were offering their own
shares for Distillers, the success of the takeover battle
depended partly on how well Guinness and Argyll shares
performed on London's stock exchange. During the trial,
prosecutors alleged that Mr. Saunders and colleagues tried to
inflate Guinness's share price.
   Among other things, prosecutors said he authorized payment
of #5.8 million to Mr. Ronson, partly to indemnify him
against losses on the #25 million of Guinness stock that he
bought.
   The prosecutors also alleged that Sir Jack received a fee
of #3 million from Guinness, and Mr. Parnes #3.4 million, for
their help in arranging the illegal share-support scheme. The
defendants maintained that the payments were normal business
transactions.

   CHERRY HILL, N.J. -- Subaru of America Inc. said its
shareholders approved an agreement under which Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. of Japan will buy the 50.4% of the auto
distribution company that it doesn't already own in a
transaction valued at about $208 million.
   Under the accord, holders of Subaru, the U.S. distributor
for cars made by Fuji, will receive at least $8.50 a share --
$6 from Fuji and an additional amount equal to at least $2.50
that is expected to come from proceeds of the sale of
Subaru's portfolio of vehicle leases.

   Trendy Restaurants Work Hard Shooting for the Hip

   Celebrities, Oddities Help in New York,
   But Ads Don't, the Experts Say

RESTAURANTS, FAST-FOOD, CATERING (RES)
</IN>
<LP>
   It's scary enough to open a new restaurant anywhere. But
one of the toughest acts of all is starting a restaurant
aimed at New York's hip young trend-setters.
   If you're not chic there on day one, you're deserted on
day two.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Every year, though, a few places make it big. Three months
ago, Coffee Shop on Union Square didn't exist. Today, police
barricades control the lines of young hopefuls waiting
outside for a chance to be in the right place. Actor Matt
Dillon has eaten there. So has television personality Julie
Brown. New York magazine calls it "this summer's place to
be."
   Unfortunately, there's no simple formula to create this
sort of success. "You just know it when you see it," says
Frank Zagat, editor of Zagat's Restaurant Survey.
   But experts on New York hipness have developed a few rules
of the trade. First is: Don't worry about the food. "Terrible
food is almost a prerequisite," says Mimi Sheraton,
restaurant critic for Time Magazine, although she cites the
currently fashionable TriBeCa Grill, whose partners include
Robert De Niro, as an exception.
   Hip restaurateurs agree that ambiance counts for more than
cooking. "We see ourselves as designers as much as
restaurateurs," says one owner of Coffee Shop, "because the
restaurant business today is a total entertainment package."
Though Coffee Shop has a stylish, informal modern interior,
its nondescript exterior has a touch of down-market chic: a
neon sign saying "Coffee Shop."
   In other respects as well, the more novelty the better,
owners say. For instance, Coffee Shop employs models to work
as waiters and waitresses. Even the bouncer at the door is a
model. Owners Eric Petterson, Carolyn Effer and Charles
Milite have made this gimmick a trademark; they also used it
successfully at their first restaurant, Live Bait.
   Bernard's Cafe, on the other hand, benefits from the
novelty of an incongruous setting. On Avenue A, the French
brasserie brings to Manhattan's Lower East Side a very
different crowd from the poor artists and the just plain poor
who live nearby.
   Another rule, experts say, is that advertising doesn't
really work. "If you start to advertise, people assume you
must be herding," says Coffee Shop's Mr. Petterson.
   Instead, much depends on word of mouth -- and on the
connections and associations of the restaurant's owner. Thus
the owners of Coffee Shop, all with backgrounds in the
modeling business, attracted a professionally good-looking
crowd they already knew.
   And Rick Wahlstedt, co-owner with Ulrich Troejerborg of
the equally trendy Punsch restaurant, brought with him the
fashionable crowd that used to frequent Indochine, the
restaurant where he worked as manager until last year.
   Owners go to many lengths to attract the "right" crowd.
Before it even opened, Punsch hosted four private parties,
including fashion designer Thierry Mugler's birthday
celebration. The parties brought in celebrities and society
writers, says Mr. Wahlstedt.
   In some cases, newly opened restaurants can't keep up with
their own success.
   By the time La Coupole opened in January 1982, it couldn't
have generated more excitement with the fashionable set.
Following a two-page spread in New York Magazine, the
240-seat restaurant was packed. Says James Devine, who left
River Cafe to work there, "We couldn't bang the food out fast
enough."
   But that was just the problem. The restaurant just
couldn't handle "240 people sitting down at the same time"
and the food wasn't good enough to make people want to come
back again, he says. Slammed by the same critics who had
hyped it only 14 months earlier, La Coupole closed in March
1983. Says Mr. Devine, "It would still be alive today if
everyone had been prepared for the onslaught of people."
   But even if restaurants survive the onslaught, they can't
expect to keep the "in" crowd forever. Says Brian McNally,
whose creations include Indochine, Canal Bar and 150 Wooster:
"That's inevitable. It's in the nature of trendiness."
   Mr. Petterson of Coffee Shop remembers a friend's warning
at the opening night of Live Bait in September 1987: "It's
like modeling. . . . You start at the top and then it's all
downhill."
   Some restaurateurs seem to thrive on shooting-star
businesses. Mr. McNally's formula has been to take places
that are already restaurants and to spend comparatively
little on them. Of Canal Bar, in which he invested less than
$100,000, he says, "We made a lot of money and then we got
out."
   But for most restaurants-of-the-moment, the safest bet is
to become the kind of restaurant where people actually go to
eat -- where quality of service and food count.
   It also helps to attract a neighborhood crowd. Says Gael
Greene, restaurant critic for New York Magazine, "If you
don't have something to give the neighborhood when the heat
cools, you've had it." Coffee Shop may also thrive as a
neighborhood restaurant, says Chip Fisher, a corporate
catering executive and an authority on the restaurant
business. He believes the place will benefit from catering to
a specific group -- models and photographers who work around
Union Square.
   Drew Nieporent, managing partner of the chic TriBeCa
Grill, hopes his restaurant will develop into a family
restaurant. If so, it may be part of yet another restaurant
trend -- toward more moderate, family-oriented places.
   Says Michael Musto, columnist at the Village Voice,
"People are just getting bored of spending a lot of money on
something which isn't really satisfying."
   Even Brian McNally seems to be abandoning the spirit of
the '80s. He says he wants to be "almost obsessively
egalitarian" about letting people into his next creation, a
brasserie in the recently opened Paramount Hotel.
   But he still may get a hip crowd. Judging by all the
publicity, the Paramount Hotel itself has just become chic.

   Banks Toughened Lending Standards

   WASHINGTON -- Banks continued to tighten their lending
standards in recent months, largely out of foreboding over
the economic future and the state of certain industries, a
Federal Reserve Board survey of top lending officers found.
   The results of the August survey may give the Federal
Reserve ammunition to ease interest rates slightly. The most
recent rate cut, engineered by the Fed in July, came after
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said he was worried that banks
might be turning away some worthy borrowers, thus putting an
unnecessary drag on the economy. But as reported, last week's
meeting of Fed policy makers apparently gave Mr. Greenspan
leeway to reduce short-term rates if the financial markets
settle down.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the Fed's survey, the first since a May report that
also found tightening credit standards, bankers reported that
they had tightened standards for loans not related to
mergers, with medium-sized businesses feeling the worst
pinch. Fully 43% of the 60 domestic banks surveyed said they
had toughened their criteria for lending to medium-sized
companies, while more than a third reported more stringent
hurdles for large and small borrowers. The Fed defines
medium-sized companies as those with annual sales of between
$50 million and $250 million.
   No banks reported easing standards for business borrowers
of any size.
   Amid the current real estate slump in nearly every region
of the country, the survey found bankers again toughening
their criteria for commercial real estate loans. About 75% of
the banks said they had imposed stiffer standards for loans
to finance commercial office buildings. In the May survey,
80% said they had tightened those standards.
   However, few banks appear to be forcing consumers applying
for home mortgages to meet tougher requirements. Only six
banks said they had tightened their standards since May, and
one bank reported easing.
   More than one-third of the banks cited a "less favorable
economic outlook" as their main reason for tightening lending
standards. The survey was taken from mid-July until Aug. 1.
Since then, many economists have begun to fear that the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait will further hurt the economy.
   About 20% said "industry-specific problems" were a factor
in the toughened standards, and about 15% noted "regulatory
pressures." The banks didn't identify which industries
presented problems.
   The Fed does about six surveys of bank lending each year.

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Wholesale sales in West Germany
in July jumped 10% from a year earlier in real, or
price-adjusted, terms, as the economic and monetary union
with East Germany got under way, the Federal Statistics
Office said.
   The price-adjusted data are based on 1985 levels. In
nominal, or unadjusted, terms, West German wholesale sales
increased 10% to 74 billion marks ($47.45 billion).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The statistics agency said sales of finished products, as
well as of raw materials and intermediate goods, rose
strongly in what was a "very clearly marked development" last
month. The July rise was especially strong, compared with the
real 4% annual drop in wholesalers' sales in June, when sales
also were down 5% in nominal terms.

   It looks as if Irish rock singer Sinead O'Connor won't be
playing New Jersey's Garden State Arts Center again. She
announced backstage Friday that she wouldn't perform if the
U.S. national anthem were played first, as is policy at the
state-run center. Officials felt it was too late to cancel
her performance. She wasn't acting out of solidarity with
Roseanne Barr, last seen spewing spit onto the turf after
singing "The Star Spangled Banner." No, Sinead O'Connor
objects to how the U.S. government grants arts subsidies. "I
feel very strongly about censorship," she said, "and I don't
want to go onstage after the anthem of a country that's
arresting people and harassing people for expressing
themselves onstage." We haven't heard about any arrests in
the United States yet of chocolate-covered women, but
censoring the national anthem does give new meaning to Ms.
O'Connor's hit, "Nothing Compares 2 U."

   Gold Posts Biggest One-Day Loss in Seven Years
   On Absence of Mideast Hostilities, Oil Price Drop

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- A slight relaxation of Mideast tensions and a
sharp decline in oil prices caused precious metals prices to
plunge. Gold sustained its biggest one-day loss in more than
seven years.
   There had been widespread fear that war might break out in
the Middle East over the weekend, analysts said. When it
didn't materialize, and then Iraq was reported to be willing
to talk with United Nations officials, heavy selling
developed, they said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gold gave up most of the gains it had run up since Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. Silver and platinum, which had
reluctantly followed the gold advance, fell to levels below
those prevailing before the invasion.
   December delivery gold fell $27 an ounce to $396.20, the
biggest one-day drop since the price plunged $42.50 on Feb.
28, 1983, according to the Commodity Exchange. The decline
wiped out 73% of the December contract's gains from its high
of $425 reached twice this month. The day before the invasion
of Kuwait, the December contract settled at $382.40.
   December silver fell 35 cents an ounce to $4.9650, the
biggest one-day decline since July 25, 1988, when the price
fell 57 cents to $7.036, the exchange said. On Aug. 1, the
December contract settled at $4.96.
   October platinum dropped $21.30 an ounce to $486.00, the
largest one-day decline since Dec. 19, 1988, when the price
fell $29.20 to $525.30. On Aug. 1, the October contract
settled at $492.20.
   "It goes to show how fundamentally weak this market really
is," said Peter Cardillo, director of commodity research for
Jesup Josephthal &amp; Co., New York. "It took only one day to
wipe out most of the gains that it took gold three weeks to
accumulate. It shows that the main force behind this market
is Iraq and that country's effect on the oil price and its
inflationary potential. Whichever way oil moves, gold will
move with it."
   Another analyst said, "this is what happens when you have
a one-issue scenario." He also said the London market's
closing for a holiday may have contributed to the heavy
trading and the price declines.
   Analysts, however, warned that yesterday's reaction to the
Mideast situation didn't accurately reflect existing
conditions.
   "You can't tell me that conditions have changed to the
extent that they warrant a $27 change in one day," one
analyst said.
   Another analyst, Douglas Newby, of S.G. Warburg, &amp; Co.,
said: "I don't see anything that suggests a peaceful
settlement is going to take place. War could still break out
this week, next week or at any time."
   Anthony Rizzuto Jr., analyst for Nomura Research
Institute, said: "If a diplomatic solution takes place, the
gold price will fall another $30. But will the situation be
resolved that easily?"
   On the other hand, Jeffrey Nichols, president of American
Precious Metals Advisors in Toronto, said that even when gold
was rising, it didn't have a particularly strong
underpinning.
   "There has been little evidence of any widespread or
meaningful rise in physical investment demand for gold in
either North America or Europe," he said. "Sales of bullion
coins or small bars are up on both continents but not enough
to matter much to the overall world market."
   Caution is advised, Mr. Nichols said, because the market
has moved higher on the basis of "short-term views and hot
money," both of which have been reflecting the volatile
Mideast crisis.
   Mr. Nichols said that before yesterday's setback, market
professionals had expressed disappointment that the price of
gold was up only to $405 or $415. Their argument, Mr. Nichols
said, was that gold should have risen considerably higher in
view of the Mideast situation, oil at $30 a barrel, plunging
stock markets world-wide and a weaker U.S. dollar.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND LIVESTOCK: Speculation that the chances of war
in the Middle East are easing had opposite effects on the
agricultural markets. Prices of futures contracts for cattle
and hogs jumped yesterday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, however, contracts for corn,
wheat and soybeans slipped. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, some
economists predicted that the burden of rising oil costs
would help push the U.S. economy into a recession. Livestock
traders pushed down hog and cattle prices on the assumption
that consumers would respond to any recession by buying less
beef and pork. With the Middle East crisis seeming to slip
into a stalemate, livestock analysts are downgrading the
chances of a full-blown recession, so livestock prices are
rebounding. In the grain pits, however, the apparent easing
of tensions helped to depress prices. For several weeks,
traders had been speculating that higher oil prices would
help some oil-producing countries, such as the Soviet Union,
generate more currency to finance grain purchases from the
U.S. That speculation is being deflated at least temporarily.
Corn prices also are being depressed by forecasts for a
relatively large harvest this fall. In the wake of heavy
summer rains, much of the Midwest crop is well suited to
withstand a recent spate of high temperatures, analysts said.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose. The December contract ended
with a gain of 1.30 cents a pound at $1.2485. With most of
the interest focused on the Mideast and on oil, copper was
little noticed, an analyst said. The market opened higher and
held there most of the day. Another analyst said that, while
the 11-day-old miners' strike in Peru was causing some
concern over supplies, a union spokesman reportedly expressed
confidence that the walkout would end this week. Demand for
physical copper remained quiet, a dealer said.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices rose. The December contract gained
0.64 cent a pound to 72.99 cents. Demand was stimulated by
concern that the quality of cotton in the Mississippi Delta
and Southeastern states might have been affected by the
recent heat and drought, an analyst said. Also, he noted,
after the close of trading Friday the government raised its
estimate of mill consumption during the first 10 months of
the 1989-90 season, which ended July 31, to 8,725,000 bales
from 8.6 million. The rally in futures encountered aggressive
selling by people in the cotton trade, according to the
analyst. He speculated this selling was aimed at locking in
prices for the cotton these dealers and others have on hand.

   GM Will Triple
   Cars With Air Bags
   For '91 Model Year

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said that for the 1991
model year, it will triple the number of its U.S.-built cars
equipped with driver-side air bags as standard equipment.
   The No. 1 auto maker, which has lagged behind rivals
Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in offering standard air
bags, said it expects to sell about 1.3 million cars equipped
with air bags during the 1991 model year that begins Oct. 1.
The bags will be offered as standard equipment on 21 car
lines, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far this model year, GM has sold about 450,000 cars
equipped with driver-side air bags. That represents only
about one-seventh of the auto maker's current annual U.S. car
production. The bags are now offered as standard equipment on
13 car lines and as an option on two others.
   "Customers have indicated that they like the air bag, and
therefore we will put them on," a GM spokesman said.
   The No. 1 auto maker appears now to be stepping up
production of air bag-equipped cars as a reaction to
increasing competition and consumer demand.
   Within hours of GM's announcement, Chrysler Corp. released
a statement announcing its plan to roll its one-millionth air
bag-equipped car off the assembly line. Chrysler was the
first of the Big Three to offer air bags as standard
equipment on all its domestically built cars.
   Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, said driver-side bags are
standard equipment on nine of its U.S. car lines accounting
for about 45% of its product line. By the mid-1990's, Ford
said it will offer driver-side and passenger air bags on all
U.S. cars.
   The major Japanese auto makers also have been slow to
introduce air bags on their high-volume cars, preferring
instead to offer automatically fastening seat belts.
   Federal law requires that all cars be equipped with
so-called "passive restraints." Auto makers have a choice
between offering automatically fastening seat belts, or
installing driver-side air bags that inflate during a crash
to cushion the driver from the force of impact.
   GM said that for 1991, it will offer standard air bags for
the first time on three of its highest-volume car lines: the
Chevrolet Corsica, Beretta and Caprice. In addition, GM said
the Buick Park Avenue, Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon,
Oldsmobile Eighty-eight and Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser Wagon
will also come with air bags as standard equipment for 1991.
   GM said virtually all of its U.S.-built cars will have air
bags by the fall of 1995. Additionally, the auto maker said
it will add passenger-side air bags in more cars for the 1992
model year.

   Japan's Nissan Motor Co. and Hitachi Ltd. are studying the
possibility of creating a new company to develop and
manufacture high-grade, next-generation information systems
for automobiles.
   Potential projects include facsimile machines, navigation
systems and digital-telephone and other services to be built
into Nissan automobiles, the two companies said. A Nissan
spokesman said the field is sure to boom, noting that other
Japanese car makers seem to be pursuing similar joint
projects with electronics and communications companies.
   Plans haven't yet reached the stage that company
capitalization or an establishment date has been decided, or
that both parties have committed to working together,
spokesmen from Nissan and Hitachi said.
   Hitachi's spokesman said that the company's average annual
sales of automobile-related electronics equipment total
roughly 200 billion yen ($1.37 billion).
                                                                                                       

   EUROPEAN CFC AGREEMENT
                                                                                                       

   Seven chemical companies with European operations signed
an agreement with the European Community to reduce the
amounts of atmosphere-damaging chlorinated fluorocarbons used
in foam plastics. The European Isocyanate Producers
Association said the CFC content of foam plastics should be
reduced by 35% by the end of 1991 and by 65% by the end of
1993; the figures are relative to the amounts of CFCs in foam
plastics in 1986. The seven companies are BASF AG, Bayer AG,
Dow Chemical Co., Imperial Chemical Industries PLC,
Montedison Petrolchimica, Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Royal
Dutch/Shell.
                                                                                                       

   GLOOM IN TAIWAN
                                                                                                       

   Over 70% of Taiwan's business leaders are gloomy about the
local economy during the second half of the year, Taiwan's
Gallup poll reported. The poll was conducted from Aug. 14 to
Aug. 17 with 1,092 managers of selected enterprises in the
country. The survey showed 63.7% of interviewees were
pessimistic and 8.1% were very pessimistic about Taiwan's
economic performance from July through December. Plunging
share prices, rising crime, political instability and a
slowdown in the world economy contributed to the pessimism,
economists said.
                                                                                                       

   DOMINICAN REPUBLIC STRIKE CALL
                                                                                                       

   Labor unions in the Dominican Republic issued a call for a
72-hour general strike beginning Sept. 10. Union officials
said the strike would be a protest against the government's
new economic-austerity program. Workers are also demanding a
150% wage increase, a cut and freeze in food prices, a
solution to energy shortages and reinstatement of 64 labor
activists dismissed from the state-owned Dominican Electric
Corp.
                                                                                                       

   MRS. MARCOS'S REQUEST
                                                                                                       

   Imelda Marcos asked a Philippine anti-graft court to
dismiss ill-gotten-wealth cases filed against her by the
government of President Corazon Aquino. Mrs. Marcos's lawyer
in Manila, Sergio Apostol, filed a motion with the court that
said the former first lady enjoys immunity because she was
following the orders of her husband during his 20-year rule
over the country. Government lawyers opposed Mr. Apostol's
motion. No decision was immediately taken by the three-man
panel of judges.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA'S ENERGY PLAN
                                                                                                       

   South Korea will introduce an energy-conservation program,
effective next month, that seeks to cut the nation's energy
consumption by 10%, government officials said. Tourist
hotels, hospitals, railroad stations and other public
facilities would be exempt from the restrictions, they said.
Under the program, elevators would stop at every other floor
and factories and offices would be banned from using
incandescent lamps. The use of outdoor neon signs would be
restricted between midnight and sunset the following day.
Movie theaters wouldn't be allowed to operate after midnight.
                                                                                                       

   INDONESIA LIMITS CENSORSHIP
                                                                                                       

   Indonesia said it was ending press censorship unless
national security was at risk.
   "Reporters are no longer restricted. They can write any
news as long as it does not violate the code of ethics of the
Indonesian Journalists' Association and national interests,"
Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Sudomo said.
He was quoted as telling the Merdeka newspaper group the
issue was discussed at a security meeting last week.
   President Suharto's government has kept tight control of
the domestic press and recently embarked on its toughest
censorship of the foreign media in more than two years. But
under the new rules, articles in foreign newspapers would no
longer be blacked out.
   Editors received the news with some skepticism. "So far
it's just a statement. . . . The important thing is what is
the reality," said one.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The grandson of Josef Stalin will portray the dictator in
"War Is War for Everyone," a new Soviet film about World War
II, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported. The
grandson, Yevgeny Djugashvili, is a professor at a military
academy. . . . The British Broadcasting Corp. launched Radio

   IMF May Lend
   More to Countries
   That Import Oil

   WASHINGTON -- Because of higher world oil prices, the
International Monetary Fund may lend more money to Brazil and
some other developing countries that import oil, a senior
Treasury official told reporters.
   "The question of access {to IMF resources} may need to be
looked at," the official said. He stressed that no decisions
have been reached, and he made it clear that any broadening
of access to IMF resources wouldn't match the special IMF
lending that followed the severe oil price rises of 1973-1974
and 1979.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite a sharp decline yesterday, oil prices remain about
40% above their level of six months ago. According to some
estimates, Brazil's oil import bill may rise by as much as $2
billion a year because of the higher prices, the official
said.
   Brazil currently is seeking loans from the IMF to support
economic reforms. It also is talking informally with a few of
its biggest commercial bank creditors; the talks, which are
expected to end by Sept. 14, are designed to enable the
country's biggest lenders to tell Brazil what they want from
a bank debt settlement and to learn more about the country's
controversial economic reforms. Formal negotiations between
Brazil and its commercial bank creditors are expected to
begin this fall in New York.
   The current exploratory talks "will probably help in
getting a deal done later," the Treasury official said.
Brazil hasn't paid interest on about $70 billion of its
medium-term foreign bank debt for more than a year.
   Of all Latin American countries, Brazil is probably being
hit hardest by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the
subsequent international embargo on trade with those
countries. Brazil is a large importer of oil -- particularly
Iraqi oil -- and Iraq has been an important market for
Brazilian airplanes, tanks, and other goods.
   The crisis in the Persian Gulf won't affect the
administration's Enterprise Initiative for the Americas, the
Treasury official said. The Treasury is preparing legislation
to back up that initiative, which would offer Latin American
nations closer trade relations, cut the relatively small
loans they owe the U.S. government, and attempt to boost
foreign investment in the region. The legislation will be
"prepared and ready to go to the Hill when Congress gets back
in session," the Treasury official said.
   Separately, the official said World Bank Senior Vice
President Ernest Stern will join the new European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the London-based development
bank that will lend to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Mr. Stern will be the senior U.S. official in that
institution and is expected to fill the No. 2 job there under
the bank's chairman, Jacques Attali, personal adviser to
French President Francois Mitterrand.

   LOS ANGELES -- Whittaker Corp. said it may spin off to
shareholders its biotechnology unit, which will contribute
about 17% of Whittaker's expected $190 million sales for the
current fiscal year.
   A Whittaker spokesman said a decision hadn't yet been
reached but said "chances are we'll do it," probably early
next year. The company's directors and secured lenders would
have to approve the transaction, however. It would also have
to be structured on a tax-free basis, Whittaker said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The unit makes and sells diagnostic tests used by doctors
and hospitals and laboratory cell-culture media.
   Whittaker also posted results for its third quarter, ended
July 31. In the period, the concern had net income of $4
million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $5 million, or 62
cents a share. Year-earlier net included a loss from
continuing operations of $3.2 million and a gain of $5.5
million on the disposal of discontinued operations. Sales
rose 7.1% to $48 million from $44.8 million.
   Whittaker has sold several businesses in the past year as
part of a recapitalization plan. Whittaker's continuing
operations, besides the biotechnology unit, are in aerospace.
   For its first nine months, an $85.2 million gain on the
disposal of discontinued operations more than offset a
$363,000 loss from continuing operations. Net was $80.7
million, or $9.61 a share, compared with $22.4 million, or
$3.03 a share.
   Marcus Schloss &amp; Co., a New York investment firm, also
disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it boosted its stake in Whittaker to 7.6% for
investment purposes.

   Fight Tobacco,
   Liquor Ad Curbs

   Some Hispanic media executives fear that proposed
restrictions on alcohol and tobacco advertising would
threaten the existence of many minority newspapers and
magazines.
   "It would be devastating" for Hispanic magazines and
newspapers if Congress banned such advertising, said Tino
Duran, president of the National Association of Hispanic
Publications and the owner of two small newspapers in Texas.
Mr. Duran, who attended a recent forum on the subject,
estimated that the 350 Hispanic newspapers that belong to his
association receive about 20% of their ad revenue from
alcohol and tobacco companies. Without it, Mr. Duran said,
many would fold.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Latino publications depend on tobacco, alcohol and
fast-food advertising because many other companies don't see
Hispanics as important consumers, said Alfredo J. Estrada,
editor and publisher of Hispanic magazine. "Many companies
view them as being poor," said Mr. Estrada. "It's hard for
them to realize there are Hispanic professionals."
   Community activists and lawmakers, citing higher levels of
diseases associated with smoking and drinking among blacks
and Latinos, are pushing to rein in companies that
aggressively pitch tobacco and alcohol to those groups.
   A report by the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
a nonprofit advocacy group for public-health policies, titled
"Marketing Disease to Hispanics" criticized Hispanic groups
for taking advertising revenue and charitable donations from
the tobacco, alcohol and junk-food industries in the face of
rising health problems among Hispanics.
   The center's report said Mexican-American men are 40% more
likely to die from cirrhosis of the liver than white men. The
death rate from adult diabetes for Mexican-Americans in the
Southwest is double that of whites, the center said. And the
incidence of cancer among Hispanics is also on the rise.
Meanwhile, the study notes, tobacco, alcohol and junk-food
advertising to Hispanic communities is increasing. The report
parallels earlier findings on blacks.
   At the forum earlier this month, Hispanic media
professionals gave a collective thumbs-down to congressional
efforts to restrain alcohol and tobacco advertising in U.S.
publications. The Hispanics also lambasted the report from
the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Mr. Duran
called the study racially paternalistic, saying it implies
that Hispanic consumers must be protected because they aren't
smart enough to know better.
   Ernest Bromley, president of Sosa &amp; Associates, San
Antonio, Texas, one of the largest Hispanic advertising
agencies in the country, called the 100-page report "yellow
journalism" for implying that Hispanic organizations have
"sold out" to the corporate dollar.
   The media representatives argued that attempts to restrict
advertising infringe on freedom of speech, the position taken
by tobacco, alcohol and fast-food companies. "I don't want
the great white father leading the Hispanic to the proper
course," said Mr. Duran. He scoffs at the report's suggestion
that ads from such ubiquitous marketers as Coca-Cola and
McDonald's be banned, asking, "Why don't they censor Jello?"
   The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce also opposes the
advertising restrictions. That group is lobbying to defeat a
bill that would allow each state to regulate tobacco ads.
Jose Nino, president of the Hispanic chamber, said such a
bill, if passed, would have an "extremely severe" impact on
the Hispanic population by depriving Hispanics of "thousands"
of jobs in the advertising and publications field.
   Some Hispanic groups, most notably the National Coalition
of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations, support
the idea of restricted advertising and a ban on donations.
"If they are marketing a product that kills our youths, we
should look elsewhere {for money}," said Dr. Jane Delgado,
president of the nonprofit Hispanic health coalition. The
coalition never has taken money from tobacco companies, and
three years ago it stopped accepting donations from the
alcohol industry.
   Debate at the forum, called specifically to address the
advertising issue, spilled over into talk about donations
made by alcohol, tobacco and fast-food companies to nonprofit
Hispanic organizations. Mr. Estrada of Hispanic magazine said
the study's recommendations would have a "chilling effect" on
corporations that have provided scholarships and educational
programs to the Hispanic community.
   Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for
Science in the Public Interest and co-author of the report,
said many Hispanic groups have had to rely more and more on
donations from corporations since federal funds for social
programs were slashed during the Reagan administration. But
such gifts have strings attached, Mr. Jacobson charges. "They
want something in return," he said. "They want silence, if
not advocates."
   The National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest
Latino advocacy organization, accepts donations from tobacco,
alcohol and food companies, but maintains there's no problem
with doing so.
   "The total amount of money we get from alcohol and tobacco
companies amounts to 1% or 2%" of the organization's total
annual budget, says Raul Yzaguirre, president of the council,
"so they are hardly in a position to influence us."

   In the 1950s, an active and sometimes vindictive and
acrimonious debate arose over the question, "Who lost China?"
In the 1990s, an active, but more civilized, debate has begun
over the question, "Why did we so badly misestimate the
Soviet economy's size and performance?"
   In "Meltdown: Inside the Soviet Economy" (Cato Institute,
Washington, D.C., 144 pages, $19.95 cloth, $9.95 paper), Paul
Craig Roberts and Karen LaFollette suggest one answer: the
predisposition of Western intellectuals "to look favorably on
societies that seem to be the antithesis of their own" led
them to view the Soviet economy through rose-tinted glasses.
Because Western intellectuals often favored centrally
planned, collectivist systems while harboring antagonism
toward marketized, capitalistic ones, they "dropped standards
of professional objectivity in their portrayal of the Soviet
regime."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One example, among many cited by the authors, is Harvard's
John Kenneth Galbraith, who, writing in 1984, proclaimed that
"the Russian system succeeds because, in contrast to the
Western industrial economy, it makes full use of its
manpower." Evidently Mr. Galbraith had never heard the
familiar joke among Soviet workers: "We pretend to work and
they pretend to pay us."
   Of course, other answers besides those offered by Mr.
Roberts and Ms. LaFollette have been suggested. Peter
Drucker, Igor Birman, Viktor Belkin, among others, have said
simply that the Soviets typically havelied in the economic
data they've publicized. And Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan has
placed the onus on the CIA for overestimating the size and
growth of the Soviet economy during the past 20 years.
   Clearly, these explanations are not mutually exclusive.
Probably each has some validity.
   Only the latter portion of "Meltdown" addresses the
question of why and how the Soviet economy has been
misestimated. Most of the book is devoted to a topical
analysis of the Soviet economic system as it has actually
operated. Focusing successively on the Soviet producer and
the Soviet consumers, Mr. Roberts and Ms. LaFollette
highlight the inefficiencies, mistakes and wastage, as well
as the corruption and fraud characterizing an economy based
on quantitative norms and bureaucratized, nonmarket
decisions.
   In this system, they suggest, production "frequently
amounts to destroying the original value of . . . inputs."
Whereas, in market systems, "the production process adds
value to materials . . . in the Soviet Union the opposite is
often the case." In the process of conforming to quantitative
production norms, the consumer has little influence on either
the quantity or quality of what is produced.
   The Roberts-LaFollette style is an eclectic combination of
anecdotes, secondary source references, and commentary that
is strong in its insights and readability, and less so in its
rigor and precision. "Meltdown" occasionally vaults toward
hyperbole. For example, they assert that "no one in the
Soviet Union places any faith in economic statistics"
(although they themselves use and cite many economic
statistics with a presumption of their accuracy).
Nevertheless, their 75-page description of the Soviet economy
in operation is cogent, as well as readable.
   Still, two important caveats should be kept in mind. The
first is a reminder that, notwithstanding its inherent
weaknesses and inefficiencies, the Soviet economy has
produced and maintained massive and sophisticated military
and space capabilities. The second is that the sorry
predicament of the Soviet economy does not warrant the
conclusion, sometimes drawn by others, that the U.S. was
misguided in its defense preparations of the past 10 years.
Clearly, Soviet defense capabilities were not indefinitely
sustainable. Nevertheless, the prospect of losing them might
well have increased temptations for using them absent
countervailing capabilities in the West.
   Mr. Roberts and Ms. LaFollette also address the question
of whether the Soviet system is "redeemable." Their analysis
of prospects for economic reform emphasizes the central
importance of property rights, and they suggest several
practical ideas for accomplishing privatization: by vesting
ownership in plant workers and managers, while establishing
securities markets for trading these equities. They also
explain why price deregulation and a social "safety net" are
essential parts of the reform package, and accompany these
suggestions with the important admonition that "a market
economy cannot be established piecemeal."
   In assessing the prospects for reform, the authors
repeatedly urge reliance on and support for Mikhail
Gorbachev. This is, at best, arguable. The West may be
ill-advised to rely for systemic economic reform on one who
has repeatedly said that he does not intend "to switch the
country to capitalism," that he favors "a regulated market
economy," and that he wants to preserve and invigorate
socialism, not to supplant it.
   To be sure, one should not underestimate Mr. Gorbachev's
capacity to shift positions, and to do so with flair and
conviction. He has demonstrated this proclivity with
remarkable frequency in recent years. Nevertheless, it is at
least as appropriate to view Mr. Gorbachev as part of the
problem of achieving genuine economic reform in the Soviet
Union, as to view him as part of the solution.

an article published in USA Today, was hired by Wertheim
Schroder &amp; Co.'s New York office.

   Mr. Lowenthal, in the Aug. 3 newspaper article, commented
on why there are so many complaints about brokers: "Because
this is a dirty business. Our product is money. And money
attracts scum." He also said a broker is a "dummy" if he
focuses only on his own firm's research ideas. Shearson, an
American Express Co. unit, said in response that Mr.
Lowenthal's views didn't "conform with the firm's philosophy
of quality service."
   Wertheim Schroder, by contrast, yesterday called Mr.

   Gold Turns Into Lead for U.S. Investors

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Even as financial markets are roiled by
Mideast strife and volatile oil prices, U.S. investors
continue to spurn gold.
   Yesterday's steep plunge of $26.70 an ounce in gold to
$388.30 -- the biggest one-day drop in more than seven years
-- is just the latest blow for the gold market that has had
to struggle for its gains since Iraq invaded Kuwait earlier
this month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales of gold bullion coins in the U.S. -- moribund for
nearly three years -- should be skyrocketing in these times
of uncertainty, dealers and precious-metals analysts say. A
possible Arab war, a sagging dollar and inflation fears are a
combination of perils that seems exactly what used to spur
U.S. investors, at least temporarily, to the "haven" of gold.
   So far, though, there has been only a modest increase in
investor interest in gold in the U.S. -- despite the fact
that the stock market, even with yesterday's rally, has
plunged nearly 300 points, or 10%, since Iraq's invasion.
Overseas gold investors, by contrast, have been buying
actively.
   Gold prices after yesterday's plunge are just $15 an ounce
above levels before the invasion. And dealers say the sales
activity pales in comparison with levels seen in the weeks
after the 508-point crash of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
in October 1987, when gold rallied briefly to $500 an ounce.
   For example, sales of the U.S. Mint's American Eagle gold
coins to distributors, a barometer of individual investors'
interest in gold, have risen to 70,000 ounces so far this
month, nearly double that of August 1989. But that's about
the same as August 1988 -- when gold prices were higher --
and still falls far short of October 1987 (198,000 ounces).
Or even the following November (113,500), to say nothing of
October 1986, the month the Eagle was launched (692,000).
   Also, the mint's figures could be overstating the recent
investor interest because they only reflect sales to
authorized distributors. Some of the distributors apparently
have been stocking up, hoping investors will eventually beat
down their doors.
   "There's just a lethargic attitude toward investing in
gold," moans Alan Posnick, senior vice president at MTB
Banking Corp., a major precious-metals and foreign-currency
dealer. Adds Fredric Tordella, MTB president: "It's a
wait-and-see attitude."
   Gold sales spurted after Iraq stormed into Kuwait, but not
to levels that dealers expected. MTB went so far as to
announce a "Gold Investment Hotline" for the public when the
Mideast crisis flared, to try to stir up interest in precious
metals. Yet jolts such as yesterday's plunge don't exactly
enhance such marketing efforts.
   Gold dealers are scratching their heads for answers. Some
say investors are disillusioned by gold's disappointing price
movement in the past decade, when the market pushed ahead and
then consistently fell back. Some say investors increasingly
have swarmed to gold mutual funds in recent years -- not
bullion -- or bypassed gold entirely for foreign-currency
instruments. Still other dealers suggest many investors
aren't expecting a protracted conflict that would trigger a
significant spike in gold prices.
   Gold coins are generally bought by longer-term investors,
and these people simply don't yet see a long-term opportunity
here, says Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group,
precious-metals consultants. "There's always been this
caution that if we avoid war, the price will slam back down.
In that kind of environment, you really wouldn't expect
long-term investors to shoot in. And, by God, they're not."
   As much as half of investment demand for bullion usually
is satisfied through coins rather than gold bars. Among
individual investors, coins are the overwhelming choice.
   Dealers have seen increased gold-bar demand lately in the
"high end" of the market among institutions and private banks
in Europe. Yet dealers are more interested in coin sales,
because typically if there isn't small-investor reaction to a
market move in gold, the move fizzles.
   "Investors are wishing and hoping that this Iraqi thing
goes away," says Bruce Kaplan, president of Kaplan &amp; Co., a
Santa Monica, Calif., firm that advises gold dealers. "They
have lived through a decade of resolved crises and relative
peace; they're thinking this thing is going to be over
tomorrow."
   Investors have good reason to be disillusioned with gold's
price movement the past 10 years. After briefly spiking to
$850 an ounce in early 1980, prices have remained depressed
despite a few short-term jumps. In Salomon Brothers Inc.'s
survey of financial and tangible investments, gold ranked 13
out of 14 investments over the past 10 years, with an annual
compound return of minus 4.3%. (Only silver performed poorer,
falling 10.2%.) Stocks, by contrast, jumped 17.3% annually
during the same period, Salomon says.
   The muted demand in the U.S. contrasts with the activity
overseas. Donald Mackay-Coghill, chief executive officer of
Gold Corp. of Australia, which sells Australia's legal-tender
gold coins, says European and Southeast Asian investors have
been snapping up bullion coins in recent weeks.
   A major reason U.S. investors have shied away, he says, is
that real interest rates -- which are adjusted for inflation
-- aren't narrow enough to justify a stampede just yet. "When
we get negative real interest rates, more people will move
into gold," Mr. Mackay-Coghill predicts.
   Small investors haven't been the only ones sitting out
gold's recent rally. Commercial buying by institutions and
other big investors has been poor, Wall Street traders say.
   "It's been underwhelming," says Michael Mainzer, a first
vice president and gold trader at Prudential-Bache Metal Co.,
a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. Now, with
gold's recent rally, Mr. Mainzer says, "everyone is afraid
they may have missed their buying opportunity."
   Meanwhile, some gold specialists question whether gold has
lost its allure as a haven from crises.
   "This could be one of the final tests," Mr. Kaplan, the
consultant, says. "If everything plays out -- military
conflict, a declining stock market, inflation -- and gold
stays flat, something materially has changed."

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co., continuing its
aggressive marketing, introduced what it called an improved
DeskJet computer printer model at its lowest price ever.
   The company said its DeskJet 500 will carry a list price
of $729 and will offer better performance than the two
DeskJet printers it replaces. The newer of those two printers
was introduced in May 1989 and lists for $995.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The DeskJet uses a non-impact technique that results in
sharper print and quicker printing than inexpensive
dot-matrix printers, which are often criticized for the
quality of their printing. Hewlett-Packard makes its DeskJet
printers in the U.S., while Japanese and other overseas
manufacturers dominate the dot-matrix business.
   Analysts said the new printer, which is expected to retail
for less than $500, should steal business from dot-matrix
printers. "H-P is meeting an important price point," said
John Seybold, editor of Seybold's Report on Desktop
Publishing. "This is deliberately priced to take a very
significant share from dot-matrix printers."
   Hewlett-Packard will take in an estimated $1.4 billion in
revenue from computer printer sales this year. Besides
nonimpact printers, the company sells the more expensive
laser printers, which are credited with sparking a boom in
the publication of computer-produced documents and
newsletters.

   Ireland's Parliament to Act
   On Bill to Aid Beef Firms

   DUBLIN -- Prime Minister Charles Haughey called an
emergency session of parliament for today to act on
legislation designed to protect troubled beef producers from
creditors.
   Ireland sends 44% of its beef exports to the Middle East
and North Africa, with most of that going to Iraq, Iran and
Egypt. But recent restrictions on shipments to the Persian
Gulf have cut sharply into Ireland's beef exports.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One person who would benefit most from the proposed
legislation is Irish beef baron Larry Goodman, who is
responsible for about 50% of the country's annual 1 billion
Irish pound ($1.72 billion) beef trade. Iraq alone owes Mr.
Goodman about 180 million pounds.
   The question is how big a salvage operation the Irish
government is willing to undertake to save Mr. Goodman,
Europe's largest meat processor.
   Mr. Goodman's debts are said to be at least 50 million
Irish pounds more than his assets. He owes up to 500 million
pounds to 33 banks in Ireland, Europe, Japan, South America
and Australia, and is believed to need at least 200 million
pounds to back his day-to-day operations over the next few
months.
   The Irish government isn't expected to have any trouble
getting the new legislation passed. The measure, which is
modeled on Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, provides
for a court-appointed examiner to oversee financially ailing
companies for three months.
   Even Labor Party leader Dick Spring, who called the
legislation a bill to protect rich men from their bankers,
said Mr. Goodman "is too big a player to allow the banks to
walk in and destroy him."

   EMERYVILLE, Calif. -- Cetus Corp. said the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office has reaffirmed the validity of two of its
patents that are the subject of a lawsuit filed by Du Pont
Co.
   Cetus's stock rose 87.5 cents in national over-the-counter
trading yesterday, to close at $7.625.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont filed suit in federal court last year, seeking to
strip Cetus of the two patents, which cover a new
biotechnological tool described as extraordinary by some
observers. The tool is polymerase chain reaction, or PCR,
which gives scientists the power to zero in on a single gene
and multiply it.
   The potential market for PCR is huge, and Du Pont's
interest in the field is intense. But Cetus spurned Du Pont's
efforts to obtain a license to the patents, allying instead
with a competitor.
   Cetus said the reaffirmation of its patents, originally
awarded in 1987, should be "especially helpful" in fighting
Du Pont's action. Last month, Du Pont asked the judge
presiding over the case to rule the patents invalid.
   The judge hasn't yet ruled on Du Pont's motion, and
despite the patent office's reaffirmation the court could
still rule Cetus's patents invalid, said a Cetus spokeswoman.

   CONSOLIDATED FREIGHTWAYS Inc., Menlo Park, Calif., trying

trucking and air-freight company said in June that it had
negotiated an $850 million credit agreement with a subsidiary
of Chemical Banking Corp. But the spokesman said that changes
in the company's management, announced last month, and
improvements in its business resulted in a new credit deal
for a lower amount. The deal with Bank of America calls for
Consolidated to receive a fixed-rate term loan of $100
million and "standby" credit of $250 million. Consolidated
said the financing is subject to "customary conditions," but
declined to provide details. Consolidated, which bought Emery
in 1989 for $470 million in cash and debt, has struggled
financially this year, posting a net loss of $37.5 million
for the first half of the year, mainly because of Emery's
woes. But the company said Emery is on the mend, citing
"stabilized levels of revenue and reduced expenses" at the
air-freight unit.

   NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence sank to a seven-year low
as the index compiled by the Conference Board plunged almost
18 points to 83.8 in August from July's 101.7.
   The index is now 31 points below the year-ago period and
the decline steeper than that registered immediately after
the October 1987 stock market crash.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's consumer
research center, said that a recession is more likely now
than it has been in many years, given the economic
uncertainties in the Middle East.
   While consumer confidence has been edging down since the
year began, in this latest survey consumers expressed
increasing concern about current economic conditions and a
marked pessimism in their expectations for the next six
months. The monthly survey, conducted for the Conference
Board by National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, uses
1985 as a base year of 100 for the index and covers 5,000
households throughout the U.S.
   The proportion of consumers who feel conditions are "bad"
rose three points to almost 24%; those who feel conditions
are "good," fell three points to 20%. Almost 19% of those
surveyed fear conditions will worsen in the next six months,
up from 12% in July.
   Opinions about employment were especially gloomy. Still,
buying plans retreated only modestly, the board said, citing
respondents' plans for buying homes and cars.

Phone From Golf Cart, a boon for beeper-carrying doctors and
executives whose athletic skills don't include the sprint, or
bailing out of a golf cart for that matter.
   "Golfers would have a heart attack if they had an
emergency and had to run all the way back to our clubhouse,"
says Westwood golf pro David Lisle.
   Along the Arkansas River is the Sooner State's only Phone
From Bike. Without resort to a kickstand, bikers can dial up
on a phone perched 50 inches above the bike path. And soon to
be shipped are 36-inch-high phones for lakes and reservoirs
in Southwestern Bell's five-state region, where boaters will
be able to make calls without disembarking.
   Ergonomical public phones have already gotten good
reception. Southwestern Bell and other Baby Bells have been
putting in pay phones with extra-long cords for drivers in
cars and trucks for years.
   But the trend's latest extension doesn't ring true for
some beneficiaries.
   "That's a curious adaptation of America's drive-through"
tradition, says a spokesman for the Bicycle Federation, a
Washington group promoting "a bicycle-friendly society." He
isn't impressed: "People don't usually lose their balance and
fall off the trail when they make phone calls astride their
bikes."
   Other telephone companies, too, are skeptical. "We just
don't have enough horses," says an Ameritech spokesman in
Chicago, who adds it isn't customizing phone booths "for the
Guinness Book of World Records."

   EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- A version of the Air
Force's next-generation fighter jet, built by Northrop Corp.
and McDonnell Douglas Corp., took to the skies for the first
time yesterday, setting the stage for a showdown with another
version of the aircraft built by a rival team of aerospace
companies.
   The twin-engine YF-23, with a Northrop test pilot, Paul
Metz, at the controls, climbed to 25,000 feet, and functional
checks of basic subsystems were performed during the
early-morning, 50-minute flight. United Technologies Corp.'s
Pratt &amp; Whitney division made the engines on the YF-23.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The airplane flies very clean, much cleaner than we
expected," Mr. Metz said. "During the climb-out, I was using
considerably less power than I expected, and the chase
airplanes were on afterburners just to stay with me -- with
my landing gear down."
   The other team, composed of Lockheed Corp., Boeing Co. and
General Dynamics Corp., is scheduled to roll out its Advanced
Tactical Fighter, the YF-22, tomorrow at a Lockheed site in
Palmdale, Calif. The first flight of that plane is expected
to be next month.
   The Air Force, which wants 750 of the jets to replace the
aging F-15 fighter, is scheduled to choose the winning team
in April and award the full-scale development contract three
months later. A second YF-23, which was delivered to a test
facility here in June, will fly with General Electric Co.
engines.

   Former Buy-Out Partners Go Own Ways

   DALLAS -- When credit was easy and corporate managements
were eager, Thomas Hicks and Robert Haas racked up impressive
returns for their leveraged buy-out partnership. By
negotiating a dozen deals in three years and selling off most
of the assets before prices began plummeting, Hicks, Haas &amp;
Co. turned $90 million into a pile of cash and equity stakes
valued at $1.3 billion.
   Last year, though, the two Dallas investors, best known
for merging Dr Pepper Co. with Seven-Up Co., split up and
headed in different directions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Hicks is trying to raise a $300 million buy-out fund
that he hopes to invest, among other things, in
financial-services firms and companies struggling with too
much debt. And he wants to strike quickly, aiming to buy $3
billion of companies over the next two to three years.
   Mr. Haas, however, wants to stick with small industrial
companies and doesn't believe in "blind pools," which are
funds raised without a specific deal in mind. Nor is Mr. Haas
in any hurry to make new investments, believing that business
owners and managers haven't yet lowered their expectations
from the high prices paid a year or two ago.
   "Some people forget there are two parts to `buy low, sell
high,'" says Mr. Haas. "We knew when to sell."
   Now, Hicks, Muse &amp; Co. and the unrelated Haas &amp; Partners
want to prove that they also know when to buy. While other
buy-out firms, notably Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., have
been selling some businesses while trying to patch up
troublesome deals, the Hicks and Haas firms are hovering like
buzzards, waiting to pounce on the overly indebted companies
emerging from the buy-out binge.
   Mr. Haas says he's interested in picking over the remains
of "deals that were done at the extreme end of the leverage
spectrum, where the capital structure doesn't fit, like a
suit that's two sizes too big." Says Mr. Hicks: "A lot of
companies bought at 10 to 11 times cash flow will hit the
wall. They'll have to be restructured. They'll need new
money."
   There's a lot of competition to provide that money,
however. Well over $3 billion has been raised in various
funds dedicated to turnaround and bankruptcy investing
strategies, including one $1.8 billion pool raised by E.M.
Warburg Pincus &amp; Co. Deals today require more equity than
before because lenders are leery of piling on the debt, says
Max Derden, principal at William M. Mercer Inc., a Dallas
pension-fund investment consultant. The staggering returns of
the junk-bond era now will subside to more "realistic"
levels, he says.
   During the two men's six-year partnership, Mr. Hicks, an
outgoing, native Texan and former oilman, specialized in
bringing in the deals and sweet-talking the target company's
management. Mr. Haas, a lawyer from Ohio, is a cautious
numbers-cruncher; he focused on the detailed work of closing
deals and monitoring company performance. Working together,
they amassed what was one of the largest soft-drink empires
in the country. Hicks &amp; Haas reaped a 10-fold return when Dr
Pepper/Seven-Up Cos. was recapitalized, although the
soft-drink company is currently struggling under heavy debts.
   The only disagreement the two men will discuss publicly
concerned financing. Mr. Hicks wanted to raise a fund in
advance that would take 10% equity stakes in buy-outs itself
while also seeking other equity partners for specific deals.
But Mr. Haas preferred raising money solely on a deal-by-deal
basis, as the two men had done in the past. As a result, Mr.
Hicks formed a new partnership with John Muse and Jack Furst,
who had worked with Hicks &amp; Haas in earlier deals. Mr. Hicks
says he has raised about $170 million so far from
institutions, Dallas companies and wealthy individuals.
   The fund takes an annual management fee of 1.5% on all
commitments and will get an additional fee of 1.5% of each
buy-out's total cost for arranging the deals. Fund investors
will receive the first 20% return on each buy-out; further
profits will be split 50-50 by the investors and Hicks Muse.
Scott Ozanus, a mergers and acquisitions specialist at Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co. in Dallas, which does some work with Mr.
Hicks, says, "there's no doubt" that having a prearranged
fund will benefit a firm pursuing deals in the next few
years.
   But Mr. Haas wonders why anyone would argue with success.
Raising capital from scratch for each buy-out gives investors
a chance to question terms and contribute advice, he says.
"It's a healthy exercise to have to convince your sources of
capital" that a deal is a good one, he says, adding that it
was blind capital pools that led to some of the "excessive"
buy-outs of the 1980s.
   "We didn't have blind capital and we did not have a single
blowout," Mr. Haas says. Rather than raise a fund, he and his
partner Thomas Harrison, who also worked with Hicks &amp; Haas,
are building informal alliances with institutions and other
investors who can be called upon to back their deals.
   Mr. Haas says he expects he and his sometime partners will
have to put up between 20% and 30% equity into deals, much
more than in the past. But he is confident that the investors
who did so well with Hicks &amp; Haas will continue to back him.
"When you go back to these institutions with a third deal,
it's easier than it was the first time," he says. Says Mr.
Derden of William M. Mercer: Mr. Haas "knows where the funds
are, so I don't think {the lack of an equity fund} will make
much difference."
   The former partners also are aiming at some different
targets these days. While Mr. Hicks wants to continue
pursuing the same kinds of industrial companies the pair once
pursued, he is also going after life insurance companies, a
business Hicks &amp; Haas avoided. "We think it's a large,
fragmented industry that is consolidating," he says.
   Mr. Hicks says many small, old-line life insurers have
stumbled of late, mainly those whose managers were too
conservative in investment strategies. He plans to
concentrate on small, inefficient operations that can't
survive on their own. He has a cadre of managers in place
from the management buy-out he led of seven operating units
of troubled I.C.H. Corp.
   Mr. Haas doesn't like financial companies' sensitivity to
interest rates and economic cycles, and he doesn't like the
uncertainties of regulation. He says he'll stick with
industrial companies, such as the $70 million buy-out his
partnership led last fall of Jackson Products Inc., a
safety-equipment manufacturer, from Airgas Inc. He's looking
for more safety-equipment makers to combine with Jackson
Products and for other companies that are leaders in
industrial niche businesses.
   Although Hicks Muse has negotiated two buy-outs so far
this year -- the latest is a $100 million purchase of two
media-services companies -- Mr. Haas isn't in any hurry.
   "The quality of deals for sale is inferior today to what
was for sale several years ago," Mr. Haas says. He also
declines to set a total dollar-amount goal for his
acquisitions because, he says, such goals can encourage bad
investments: "If the good deals aren't there, you'll
overpay."

   Royal Stamp of Approval: Warrant Association Turns 150

   London -- Earlier this year, the Royal Warrant Holders
Association, a select society of merchants that provide goods
and services to the royal family, regretfully announced that
Cartier could no longer be numbered among the firms that
display her majesty's coat of arms. A routine investigation
of the jewelers, a must for all Warrant holders once a
decade, revealed that the queen had not purchased a
sufficient quantity of baubles, bangles and beads for Cartier
to retain her Warrant.
   The news made headlines and raised eyebrows throughout the
land. A Cartier spokeswoman got right to the point: "This is
not something you take lightly."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The royal demotion also created a gaggle of annoying
little expenses and inconveniences for Cartier. The large
relief of the queen's coat of arms, which had hung in front
of Cartier's elegant Bond Street shop for nearly three
decades, was taken down, and the crest removed from company
letter paper.
   Cartier, which provided many of the eyepopping bibelots
snapped up by the Queen's uncle the Duke of Windsor, is still
pretty royal, of course. The queen mother still shops there;
her stately coat of arms has replaced her daughter
Elizabeth's both at the front of the store and on Cartier
letterhead. And should QEII alter her shopping habits,
Cartier can again apply for a double entry in the
association, the organization Britons consider the ultimate
Better Business Bureau.
   Next year marks the 150th anniversary of the Royal Warrant
Holders Association, which, like cholesterol-enriched
breakfasts and the monarchy itself, is one of those uniquely
British institutions. Membership, which numbers between 850
and 900, is limited to manufacturers, suppliers and
individuals who provide goods and services to British
royalty's Big Four (the queen's husband, Prince Philip,
grants Warrants, as does Prince Charles).
   Members, all carefully vetted by the Lord Chamberlain's
office, range from the very simple to the downright grand.
Some are household words, particularly around plush
households (Rolls-Royce, Harrods, the tailors Gieves &amp; Hawkes
and gunsmiths James Purdy &amp; Son). Others are somewhat more
obscure (Southern Tree Surgeons, Lincolnshire Drainage Co.).
   Membership, not surprisingly, is heavy with rules. Warrant
holders can display the appropriate royal coat of arms in
subtle ways, such as on labels, shopping bags and delivery
trucks, as long as the image is small. But the minute you
hear an advertisement for the succulent raspberry preserves
the queen spreads on her toast each morning, you can safely
assume the association has just retired a member.
   The association also keeps an eye out for nonmembers who
brandish crests and adjectives like "royal" on their labels
and logos. It even keeps an attorney on retainer in the U.S.,
where many royal pretenders have surfaced over the years.
   Just what does a company gain by becoming a member of the
association? "Very little, except prestige," says Harold
Brooks Baker, editorial director of Burkes Peerage, the
163-year-old registry of the British aristocracy. Members get
to attend a special banquet each year, a tradition that goes
back 150 years, when members gathered to celebrate Queen
Victoria's birthday and the queen reciprocated by providing
venison for the main course.
   Current members also can see their names, and in some
cases their photographs, in the association's lavish new
coffee-table book, "By Appointment: 150 Years of the Royal
Warrant and Its Holders," by Tim Heald. The 336-page tome is
crammed with regal trivia. You learn that Rexel Business
Machines supplies the royal security shredders, that the
royal piper uses bagpipes made by Glasgow's R.G. Hardie &amp;
Co., and that a toothy lady named Kathy Pow is Warranted to
do the queen mum's royal nails.
   Though the association has been an official group only
since 1840, the notion of royal tradesmen stretches back
centuries. In 1155, the Weavers Company received a royal
charter from King Henry II, and by the time of Queen
Elizabeth I, records exist for royal purveyors of muttons,
"veales," "beeves" and fish. The ranks of official royal
tradesmen have always been exclusive. Though a palace
document from 1775 listed the Royal Rat Catcher and the Royal
Mole-Taker, it failed to credit the Royal Bug-Taker, an
oversight that caused one Andrew Cooke to complain that he
had successfully removed bugs from numerous royal beds.

   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. -- First Chattanooga Financial Corp.

   In February, BMR, a bank holding company based in Atlanta,

at $27.25 a share. Yesterday, however, the two companies said
that instability in financial markets had made the
transaction less promising and that both companies had agreed

   In national over-the-counter trading Monday, First

   Separately, First Chattanooga, a thrift holding company,
said its board authorized an increase in the company's stock
repurchase program to $4 million from $1.5 million. First
Chattanooga has about 2.8 million shares outstanding.

   NEW YORK -- Hopes for peace in the Persian Gulf lifted the
depressed yen yesterday.
   The dollar fell 2.45 yen from Friday, or 1.7%, to 144.25
yen late yesterday in New York, its lowest value against its
Japanese counterpart since it closed at 142.98 yen on Jan.
29.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dollar also set a record low against the mark in early
European trading, though it recovered slightly to a late
quote in New York of 1.5510 marks, compared with 1.5605 marks
late Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 143.35 yen, down from 144.80 yen at the close there
Monday. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.5455
marks, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.5450 marks.
   Dealers explained the yen's climb simply: The Japanese
currency lost the most from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, so it
had the most to recover from the slightest prospect of peace.
The yen has regained much of the ground it ceded to European
currencies since the Aug. 2 Iraqi attack.
   The mark, pound and Swiss franc declined to 93.005 yen,
280.39 yen and 113.182 yen, respectively, from 94.008 yen,
284.67 yen and 115.466 yen.
   The yen's correction was the foreign-exchange market's
version of the leveling that took place in other markets
around the world yesterday.
   Tokyo and New York stock prices climbed 4% and 3.1%,
respectively, after declining steeply the past few weeks.
Conversely, recent gainers lost ground. On the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark crude-oil futures contract
lost $4 a barrel to $26.91 a barrel. On the Commodity
Exchange in New York, the gold price fell steeply.
   Price movements, especially in currencies, were
exaggerated by the absence of London and Hong Kong traders,
who observed a bank holiday. London is the world's largest
foreign-exchange center.
   Foreign-exchange dealers had bid the dollar higher toward
the end of New York trading Friday, expecting a weekend war
over the U.S.'s and other nations' determination to keep open
their embassies in Kuwait despite threats by the Iraqi
occupiers.
   The embassies remained open, and nothing happened. Several
U.S. diplomatic dependents held in Baghdad were even allowed
to leave Iraq.
   With U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
scheduled to meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
Thursday, many currency investors began to take advantage of
the four-day window to liquidate "crisis positions"
accumulated over the past few weeks, said John Lyman, a
senior corporate dealer in New York with Bank of Tokyo.
   While in many ways the trend of trading changed yesterday,
the underlying nervousness remained. "People have a tendency
to take profits when they're uncertain," said Dan Brooks,
chief New York dealer for Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
   Those worries, along with the lower oil price, encouraged
dealers to sell previously bought petrocurrencies, such as
sterling and the Canadian dollar, and buy previously sold
"petrodependent currencies," such as the yen, Mr. Lyman said.
   However, sterling was supported by Britain's high interest
rates and closed higher in New York, at $1.9438 compared with
$1.9405 late Friday.
   The Canadian dollar dropped to 87.44 cents in New York
late yesterday from 88.11 cents Friday. At its recent peak on
Thursday, the Canadian unit traded at 88.55 cents, a 12-year
high.
   An unexpected volley of selling by the Reserve Bank of
Australia toppled the Australian dollar in early Asian
trading, but the currency recovered later, closing in New
York at 82.88 cents, still below 83.05 cents late Friday.
   Sydney dealers said the central bank sold the Australian
dollar when it was quoted around 83.20 cents. The Reserve
Bank was said to have chased the currency down to 82.60 cents
in two bouts of selling. A Reserve Bank spokesman said the
central bank doesn't comment on intervention in
foreign-exchange markets.
   Without the participation of London banks, trading was
thin in Europe. In addition to its record low set at the
start of European trading, the dollar also posted a record
low Frankfurt foreign-exchange fixing of 1.5411 marks. That
was down from 1.5555 marks at Friday's official pricing and
from the previous fixing low of 1.5432 marks Thursday.
   The dollar dropped in active Asian trading, finishing at
144.80 yen in Tokyo, well below its Friday close of 145.70
yen.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery plunged $26.70 to settle at $388.30 an ounce. This
was the lowest close since Aug. 9 and the biggest drop since
Feb. 28, 1983, when it fell $42.50. Estimated volume was a
heavy seven million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $392 an ounce.

   DALLAS -- E-Systems Inc. pleaded guilty to charges that it
falsified test results and defrauded the U.S. government on
contracts for Army field radios. It agreed to pay $4.6
million to settle civil and criminal charges.
   An E-Systems spokesman said the settlement will allow the
electronic systems and products company to continue doing
business with the U.S. government. "All of our problems have
been cleared up," he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   E-Systems said it will pay a $2 million fine and $1.8
million in restitution to settle criminal charges filed in a
Tampa, Fla., federal court as well as $850,000 to settle
civil charges brought by the Department of Justice. As part
of the plea agreement, E-Systems said it will drop its
pending $38 million lawsuit against the federal government.
   E-Systems took an $8.6 million write-off against its
second-quarter earnings in anticipation of the guilty plea,
the spokesman said.
   The tactical field radios were supplied to the Army by
E-Systems through its Memcor division, which has since been
discontinued. The indictment charged that E-Systems and
others falsified performance records of the radios and
concealed repairs and defects.
   This month, three former Memcor managers and a former
supervisor were charged by a federal grand jury with
falsifying records and test results to conceal failures and
defects in radios supplied to the U.S. Army.
   A production supervisor, Sadonna S. Hobbs, was convicted
Jan. 31 of perjury relating to denials of her activity in
connection with suits filed by E-Systems before the Armed
Services Board of Contract Appeals. She is serving a 16-month
federal prison term.

   Anti-tax ballot measures will be voted on in at least
eight states this November, the most since 1980. The large
number of initiatives is explained in part by a Commerce
Department report. It showed that state tax collections in
1989 were up 7.5% overall from the year before, well above
inflation. The largest gains were in Oregon and California,
up 22.5% and 14.2% respectively. Both have anti-tax votes
scheduled.
   In California, local officials have recently circumvented
Proposition 13's tax cap by passing special taxes and fees
earmarked for a specific purpose. One proposed amendment
requires a two-thirds vote of the people for such changes.
The state Legislature also would be barred from raising taxes
without a vote of the people unless two-thirds of the
lawmakers approved. California voters approved an earmarked
gasoline tax in June, but by only 52% of the vote despite the
fact that the entire political establishment endorsed it.

   Oregon has two initiatives on the ballot -- one to cap
property taxes and another to allow a tax credit of up to
$2,500 for parents sending their children to a private
school. Poor families who don't pay income tax would receive
a payment from the state, but since the state now spends
close to $6,000 on each public-school student it should save
money overall.
   Massachusetts is the only state in the nation to have
raised its taxes three years in a row. An initiative by
Citizens for Limited Taxation would repeal a 15% state
income-tax increase and all other taxes adopted after August
1989. State officials are already warning that voter approval
will mean cuts in police and fire protection. CLT leaders say
such scare tactics are akin to telling a man who has to lose
five pounds that he will have to cut off his arm instead of
going on a diet.
   Sales taxes often disproportionately hurt the poor, and
Utah tax groups are sponsoring an initiative to exempt all
food items from the state sales tax. Unless a court throws
two efforts off the ballot, Oklahomans will vote on two
initiatives to repeal an education-related tax hike and to
require that all new taxes be approved by a three-fourths
vote of the Legislature or a vote of the people.
   All the initiative sponsors had to run a gauntlet of
dubious legal challenges. In Illinois, proponents of a
measure to mandate a 60% vote in the Legislature to raise
taxes turned in more than 480,000 signatures, double what was
needed. After ballot certification, a circuit-court judge
rejected a constitutional challenge to it. Then last week,
the Illinois Supreme Court threw it off the ballot on the
grounds that it was not confined to changing the operations
of the Legislature.
   However, the overwhelming public support for the measure
has already forced both the Republican and Democratic
candidates for governor into an anti-tax corner. Within a day
of the court's ruling, both pledged they will not sign any
tax increase that doesn't meet the requirements of the
proposed amendment.
   All of the initiatives lead in the polls, but the barrage
of ads from the financially well-heeled special interests
hasn't started yet. Even so, the large number of initiatives
this year should serve as a message to both President Bush
and Congress that voter resentment over high taxes has by no
means dissipated.

   Buy-Backs Begun,
   Extended Amid
   Market Decline

   NEW YORK -- A steady decline in stock market prices since
the Middle East crisis began has led a number of companies to
start or extend stock repurchase programs hoping to snatch
their own shares at bargain prices.
   The companies believe the buy-backs will bolster the value
of the stocks in a stock market that has been battered by
Mideast events and investor fears of a recession.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But some companies that had announced buy-back programs
stayed away yesterday because of the market rally.
   Russell Banks, chief executive officer of Grow Group Inc.,
a New York-based chemical concern, said the board approved a
750,000-share buy-back in response to the market drop, but no
shares had been purchased because of the rally. The shares
closed yesterday at $7.50, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading; in July, they traded as high as
$10.
   Nevertheless, companies continued to take advantage of
deflated prices yesterday. Liz Claiborne Inc., a New York
apparel retailer, expanded its buy-back and National Pizza
Co., a fast-food chain based in Pittsburg, Kan., said
yesterday it would begin one.
   "We think it's a good use of our available cash," said Sam
Miller, chief financial officer for Liz Claiborne, which is
planning to buy back as much as an additional $50 million in
stock. "This should improve our earnings per share and
improve the stock price for our remaining shareholders."
   Liz Claiborne closed at $27.50 yesterday, up $1.75, in
national over-the-counter trading. Before the market
rebounded yesterday, Liz Claiborne stock closed at $25.75 a
share Friday, down from $30.75 a share Aug. 1, the day before
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Since Aug. 1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
declined 366 points before rebounding Monday.
   National Pizza also took advantage of deflated prices to
initiate its buy-back and in turn watch its stock rise
yesterday. In national over-the-counter trading, National
Pizza closed at $17.75, up from $17 a share Friday, but still
down from $21 a share on Aug. 1.
   "At recent price levels our common stock represents an
excellent investment," said Gene Bicknell, chief executive of
National Pizza, which is planning to repurchase as many as
one million shares, or 7.1% of its common outstanding.
   Liz Claiborne and National Pizza join more than 50
companies that have announced repurchase programs in the last
week.
   Among others, A.O. Smith Corp., a maker of auto, truck and
farm equipment, dusted off its 1987 authorization last week,
to repurchase $7.5 million in stocks while Hasbro Inc., a
Pawtucket, R.I., toymaker, said its board approved the
buy-back of as many as three million shares.
   Intel Corp., citing the market's "rapid retreat" and an
opportunity to buy back shares at "attractive levels,"
announced Aug. 23 that it would buy back 20 million shares.
   Since the announcement, Intel stock rose to $36.25 a share
at close of national over-the-counter trading yesterday. That
was up from $32.125 a share before the announcement, but
still down from $42.50 a share Aug. 1.
   Of course not all companies have the financial wherewithal
to take advantage of deflated stock prices. "Not everyone has
the flexibility to do it," said Liz Claiborne's Mr. Miller.
   Other companies that are extending or starting buy-back
programs include Nalco Chemical Co., Naperville, Ill. (one
million additional shares); PacificCare Health Systems Inc.,
Cypress, Calif. (500,000 shares); and Dress Barn Inc.,
Stamford, Conn. (two million shares)
   Yesterday, Jan Bell Marketing Inc., a Sunrise, Fla.,
designer and maker of jewelry, said it will buy back as much
as 10% of the 22.6 million shares outstanding, while First
Chattanooga Financial Corp., a thrift holding company in
Chattanooga, Tenn., said its board approved spending an
additional $2.5 million on top of $1.5 million to repurchase
stock. Blount Inc., a manufacturing and construction concern,
said it also plans to buy back as many as 300,000 Class A
common shares, or 4% of shares outstanding.

   GROW GROUP Inc. plans to buy back 250,000 of its shares.
The number of shares was overstated in yesterday's edition.

   SAN DIEGO -- Telios Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it sold an
equity stake in the closely held drug company and received
"several million dollars" for product research from Ono
Pharmaceutical Co. of Osaka, Japan.
   Under a partnership agreement, Telios sold a 6.5% interest
in the company plus an option that could eventually lift Ono
Pharmaceutical's stake to as much as 13%. Terms weren't
disclosed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ono Pharmaceutical also agreed to pay an undisclosed
amount to fund Telios's research, development and clinical
testing of drugs that inhibit a naturally occurring protein
known as Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-b) in exchange
for exclusive rights to make and market the drugs in Japan,
Taiwan and South Korea.
   "We hope that clinical trials can begin before 1994," a
Telios spokeswoman said.
   Telios also agreed to give Ono Pharmaceutical the right of
first refusal in those countries to license all but two other
human therapeutical products that Telios might develop.
   The agreement comes in the wake of a recent discovery
showing that kidney disease scarring, the leading cause of
chronic kidney failure, can be blocked by neutralizing the
activity of TGF-b. Telios holds the rights to the findings.

   Last Thursday Stuart Lockwood, aged five, stood straight
and brave and calm for all the world to see. Dressed in blue
soccer shorts and a white shirt, arms crossed firmly in front
of his chest, the English boy seemed to be staring past the
burly man in the business suit sitting in a chair next to
him. Maybe he was looking at his mother, who was among the 26
or so other hostages and the military officers in the room
where the cameras were working.
   The man talked to Stuart and as he was talking his big
left hand for a moment gently took hold of the boy's right
arm by the elbow, then stroked his hair. Stuart stood, his
face quiet, and let Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq, talk
to him and touch him. A man sitting off to the side repeated
the president's words in English so Stuart and all the rest
of us would understand them. Stuart couldn't have known what
sort of being Saddam Hussein is, only that he was dangerous.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the next few days the picture of Stuart standing there
so alone would enter our minds many times from television and
from newspapers. What was said is fading, but Stuart stays --
like the young man halting the column of tanks in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in June last year, like John-John Kennedy
saluting his father's coffin, like other such pictures; we
each have our own.
   Stuart didn't jerk his arm or his head away when Saddam
Hussein put his hand there; he didn't move even a little. His
small body said clearly it didn't want to be touched but
Stuart let it be touched. You could see he was tense, but not
if he was afraid, which he must have been. How did he know to
stay so calm? I think it was a woman who told him, probably
his mother, or an older sister or an aunt or a neighbor, but
almost certainly a woman. In the days and hours before those
cameras were set up and the bright lights turned on in that
room somewhere in Iraq, I think that woman talked to Stuart
quietly, with no panic in her voice, about the mad and deadly
world they had suddenly landed in and that she wanted them to
come out of alive.
   That "mad world" was just here for a while, she would have
said, and promised the world Stuart knew would come back
again. One day everybody would be happy once more. But now,
she had to talk to him about things to do with right now; and
if she repeated herself he should be patient because she
wanted him to clearly understand what she said and to
remember it.
   I may be wrong, but I think women are often better than
men at teaching the calmness, courage and common sense it
takes to live through brutal times, especially to children.
Is it that women at such times are able to think more about
the person they're trying to reach than about themselves? Are
they able to give their words such exactness, fit them so
perfectly, that the words become the other person's own?
   When I was about seven, a bit older than Stuart, I began a
three-and-half-year stay in Japanese prison camps. I lived in
what is now Indonesia, on the island of Java, in the city of
Bandung, in a small house my mother, my older brother, Jerry,
and I shared with three other Dutch families. Around one part
of the city they had built a high bamboo fence topped with
barbed wire and 5,000 of us lived inside the fence. The camp
was guarded by soldiers with rifles with bayonets on the end
and they would only let you out if you were extremely sick
(that was in the early days) or dead. The place was called
Bloemenkamp, which means Camp of Flowers, and it held women,
girls and small boys. Men and older boys were in other
prisons far away; my father was in one of those and in about
a year, when Jerry turned 12, he would be trucked to one
also.
   The three of us lived in what used to be a storage room,
with one mattress for my mother and one for Jerry and me, and
a wooden box that was our table. During the day my mother and
Jerry worked for the soldiers, in the vegetable gardens, the
kitchen, the above-ground sewers; I was still too young to
work and, as there was no school, I played all day.
   In the evening the three of us would sit around the box,
on which burned a smokey oil lamp. We would talk in low
voices for only a little while because the days were hot and
long and my mother and Jerry needed their sleep. We would
talk about what happened that day and about "the old days"
when we had lots of eggs and fruit salad. We could see each
other's eyes shine. Jerry and I did most of the talking and
my mother listened. She was very good at that and still is.
Sometimes, though, she would insist on speaking and often she
was serious then. You could tell because her lips grew thin.
   I remember one such time among many: I had told a story of
an adventure I'd had that day with a well-known guard called
Jantje Tomaat (Johnny Tomato). He had this name because, as
he patrolled the camp on his bicycle, he would keep an eye
out for edible tomatoes in the little vegetable plots
prisoners were still permitted. If he spotted a red one, he'd
jump off his bike, pluck it and eat it on the spot. It was
foolish to let your tomatoes ripen on the plant. That day he
picked a tomato in the front yard of the people across the
street. He saw me looking at him eating it, and I quickly
straightened my shoulders and bowed from the waist as was the
rule.
   Jantje Tomaat grinned at me and swung onto his bike -- it
was known that he liked little kids. I watched him slowly
ride down our street and then, just before he reached the
corner, there was a woman who either hadn't bowed quickly or
deeply enough, or maybe he didn't like her face. Anyway,
Jantje Tomaat got off his bike and holding the steering wheel
in the middle with his left hand walked yelling up to the
woman who was still bowed forward and rammed the front wheel
between her legs and hit her with the flat of his right hand
many times on the sides of her head, on her ears, until she
crumpled onto the road. Then he climbed back on his bike and
pedalled around the corner.
   I ran over to where the woman lay. Two women who'd also
seen what happened were carefully helping her sit up. Her
head was wobbling, her eyes stared, not even crying.
   My mother had listened and then, lips thin, she spoke
slowly, as she had done before and would again: "They are
your enemy. Always remember that. They have guns and they are
dangerous. They don't like you, even if they smile at you.
They don't like any of us. We are their enemy and if we
disobey them or get in their way they will kill us. Always be
polite, always be serious, always stay calm. Don't laugh,
don't smile, don't joke. You may lie if something in you
tells you that you must. I am afraid and I know that you are
afraid. But you'll be less afraid if you remember what I'm
telling you."
   We don't know what the words were that helped Stuart
Lockwood stand so brave those few moments in his life, but at
the heart of danger clearly the right words spoke to him.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Peter Kolokouris, former president of
North Atlantic Fisheries Inc. here, was sentenced to a
$10,000 fine and five years of probation in U.S. District
Court here.
   Mr. Kolokouris had pleaded guilty to filing a false tax
return and filing a false statement with regulators about the
company's initial public offering.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kolokouris, appearing before federal Judge Michael
Telesca, faced a sentence of as much as 13 years in prison
and $110,000 of fines, said Charles M. Pilato, assistant U.S.
attorney in charge of the case.
   In June, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Mr.
Kolokouris settled a lawsuit filed against him by the
Securities and Exchange Commission by giving up a total $2.1
million of stock in North Atlantic and three other companies.
That suit charged that the executive had a secret ownership
interest in the company's underwriter and that he received
kickbacks from the underwriter.
   John Parinello, attorney for Mr. Kolokouris, said his
client had helped to initiate the civil settlement and that
this cooperation was reflected in the outcome of the criminal
proceeding.
   The criminal and civil charges both were filed in June
1989. The civil settlement also bars Mr. Kolokouris for five
years from being an officer, or owning 5% or more, of any
public company.
   North Atlantic Fisheries, a fish processor, is being
overseen by a court-appointed receiver.

   CHICAGO -- Great American Management &amp; Investment Inc.
declared a cash dividend of 83.6 cents a share for its
minority holders as a way to get out of the savings and loan
business.
   In an unusual step, Great American concurrently declared
"a dividend paid in property" of all the shares in a Florida
thrift it owns, to a controlling partnership headed by Great
American's chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both dividends are payable tomorrow to holders of record
last Friday.
   The thrift, Firstate Financial A Savings Bank in Orlando,
Fla., now will be owned by Equity Holdings Ltd., which is the
majority shareholder in Great American. Equity Holdings is
owned by Great American Chairman Samuel Zell and the estate
of his late business partner, Robert Lurie.
   "Great American feels that being in the S&amp;L business today
is looked at in a negative light," said company vice
president Susan Obuchowski. "It could hurt Great American in
any kind of refinancing or equity offering. The company
thought it was in its best interests to no longer be in the
savings and loan business."
   Ms. Obuchowski said the Orlando thrift, with assets of
$210 million, isn't encountering financial difficulty. The
move, she said, was designed to relieve Great American of any
unpleasant associations with the national savings and loan
bailout.
   The dividend to minority shareholders in Great American
was calculated to be equal on a value-per-share basis, to the
Orlando thrift the partnership received.

   NEW YORK -- Investors went on a stock-and-bond buying
spree, cheered by rising optimism for a peaceful solution to
the Mideast crisis.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average leaped 78.71 points --
the biggest this year -- in moderately active trading to
close at 2611.63. The gain followed a 49.50-point increase
Friday. The advance for the past two sessions totals 128.21
points, or 5.2%, cutting the market's decline since Iraq
invaded Kuwait to 10%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices jumped sharply before the U.S. stock market
opened and stayed high, largely on positive Mideast news and
falling oil prices. The dollar continued its decline; many
traders bought yen because the drop in oil prices helps the
economy of energy-importing Japan.
   Adding to rallies in bonds and stocks were big declines in
gold and oil prices: The October futures contract for crude
oil sank $4 a barrel to close at $26.91. Gold plunged $26.70
an ounce to $388.30, the steepest one-day decline in more
than seven years.
   Investors were emboldened by the fact that war didn't
break out in the Mideast over the weekend and by news that
Iraq agreed to meet with the United Nations' secretary
general Thursday, rekindling hopes for a diplomatic
settlement. The perception of easing Mideast tensions first
sparked rallies in stock markets overseas. Those gains, in
turn, helped extend the bargain-hunting frenzy that began in
the U.S. Friday.
   Analysts discounted the influence on the stock and bond
markets of a report that the Federal Reserve is ready to cut
interest rates to prevent the U.S. from slipping into a
recession. Byron Wien, chief U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley, said the failure of war to erupt cleared the
way for investors to pick up where they left off Friday.
   Since the sharp decline in prices Thursday, stocks have
remained relatively cheap, Mr. Wien said. Combined with the
positive tenor of news out of the Mideast, those low prices
looked especially attractive yesterday, he said.
   "The embargo seems to be working," Mr. Wien said, "and it
looks like we're moving toward a negotiated settlement. The
market interprets anything other than shooting as positive."
   Marjorie Corp, fund manager at One Federal Asset
Management, Boston, said that at first the rally "appeared to
be concentrated in the names that were strong before the
invasion. We're not seeing any new direction or leadership."
Indeed, among yesterday's big gainers were PepsiCo,
Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck --
stocks of consumer companies that many investors consider
strong enough to withstand severe profit erosions should a
recession materialize.
   But the rally broadened during the day and by the close
most stock-market barometers registered proportionally
similar gains.
   "What propelled the buying," said Ted Eggert, equity
research manager at Yamaichi International, "were plunging
oil prices, rising bond prices and all these tips and clues
about a lowering temperature in the Middle East."
   Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu
Economics, noted that bond prices took off initially in
Japan, helped by the rebound in the Japanese stock market.
   Part of what boosted bond prices further throughout the
day was the positive effect of investors buying back bonds
they had sold Friday as a hedge against potentially plunging
prices if hostilities had broken out in the Mideast over the
weekend. But the major impetus was falling oil and gold
prices. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose more than 1
1/2 points, or more than $15 for each $1,000 of face amount,
in light trading.
   "I'm just amazed with gold down as much as it was that
bonds didn't go even higher," said Roberta Olson, fixed
income portfolio manager at Banc One Asset Management,
Columbus, Ohio.
   While some analysts expected the report of imminent
interest-rate easing in the U.S. to hurt the dollar, not all
traders paid that much attention to it. Ian Foakes, foreign
exchange manager at PaineWebber International, said the
report had no influence on his trading activity. Most of the
day's activity was focused on selling Swiss francs and marks
to buy yen. That move was a bet that oil prices will fall,
giving the import-dependent Japanese economy a lift.
   "Frankly," Mr. Foakes said, "the currency market is
trading like a second-stage-of-development animal -- it's all
herd instinct."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose sharply. Volume was 160.2 million shares
on the New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues far
outnumbered decliners, 1,453 to 256.

   Bond prices jumped. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell to 8.99%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5510 marks and 144.25 yen, compared with
1.5605 marks and 146.70 yen Friday.

   Superfund Whacks the Banks

   A recent federal court ruling -- U.S. v. Fleet Factors
Corp. -- delivers a new and potentially devastating blow to
banks. The ruling drastically expands "lender liability"
under the Superfund law (the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA), and is
proof positive, if any further proof was needed, that
Superfund is a terrible law with terrible economic
consequences.
   Banks, nonbank financial institutions and others with
secured interest holdings: welcome to the cuckoo world of
Superfund liability. Under Fleet Factors -- handed down May
23, 1990 by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit -- banks may now be liable, on the basis of
past loans, for the same Superfund costs as a polluter or any
other "potentially responsible party."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fleet Factors goes well beyond the 1986 Maryland Bank and
Trust decision, which held that a bank foreclosing on
contaminated property could be held liable as an "owner" for
clean-up of Superfund sites. The implications of that case
are minuscule when compared with the burdens imposed by Fleet
Factors.
   In Fleet Factors, the central issue to be decided was
whether and to what extent the secured creditor exemption in
the Superfund law applies to banks. The question before the
court was: What level of activity would expose a holder of a
security interest to liability?
   The new ruling answers this question with a vengeance.
Fleet Factors brings to bear the full force of Superfund's
retroactive aspects. Under the ruling, a lender may be liable
for the entire cost of a cleanup if its involvement with the
borrower ever put it in a position to "affect hazardous waste
disposal decisions if it so chose."
   Thus, it may be liable if it lent to an owner or operator
at any time during the period of disposal. It does not matter
that the contamination took place, or the loan was made,
decades before the Superfund law was enacted.
   To compound the absurdity, loans of mere thousands of
dollars could conceivably generate liabilities in the
millions. Worse, by virtue of Superfund's use of
joint-and-several liability, a single bank that in 1970 held
a 10% stake in a syndicated loan could -- if it is the only
bank in the group still solvent -- be made to pay 100% of the
clean-up costs in 1990 dollars.
   The court advises banks to factor their expanded liability
into product prices -- but this counsel is naive. First, it
assumes a price can be put on the new exposure when, in fact,
the open-ended nature of environmental claims makes adequate
pricing and reserving into a guessing game. Moreover, even if
this risk could be quantified, pricing bank services
adequately may be impossible in today's fiercely competitive
financial services arena.
   The court clearly views its opinion as providing
incentives to responsible behavior. It asserts that creditors
facing Superfund liability will more closely monitor their
borrowers' treatment of toxic waste, and that borrowers will
exercise more care since "inadequate hazardous waste
treatment will have a significant adverse impact on their
loan terms."
   The court's ruling will actually have the opposite result.
The magnitude of Superfund liability is such that, instead of
taking on the role of monitor, lending institutions will try
to insulate themselves from exposure in this highly
troublesome area. The wording of the decision fails to
provide clear guidelines for financial institutions' future
behavior. Lenders may be reluctant to finance clients with
any involvement in environmental clean-up, recycling or waste
disposal activities for fear that such financial
arrangements, in and of themselves, might establish a
sufficient level of control to trigger liability.
   The court's decision has even wider implications. Not only
does it pave the way for the Environmental Protection Agency
and others to sue banks; it also subjects the Resolution
Trust Company charged with disposing the real estate assets
of hundreds of failed thrifts -- in many cases, contaminated
real estate -- to the same fate.
   It is vital to understand that the past liabilities
created by Superfund are vast. Estimates of clean-up costs
range as high as $750 billion. Clean-up at an average site
runs from $27 million to $50 million.
   Decontamination should be our first priority -- not trying
to pick the supposedly "deep pockets" of innocent parties.
Financial institutions play a central role in our economy. To
saddle lenders with Superfund liability will entangle them in
more and more suits by government, by borrowers and by third
parties -- and may compromise their ability to act as
catalysts of economic growth in the future. Reform of a
system that is patently unfair and ineffective is essential.
   In other jurisdictions, cases may be decided in ways that
conflict with Fleet Factors. But for now Fleet Factors is the
law of the land, and it will continue to be the law of the
Eleventh Circuit unless it is overturned by the Supreme
Court. This state of affairs dictates the need for financial
institutions to make their case for legislative reform as
promptly and forcefully as possible.
   Such reform should include a program aimed at making
hazardous waste liability equitable and predictable. This is
necessary if financial institutions are to know and insure
their risks, and if they are to be a positive force in the
universal goal of creating a cleaner, safer environment.

   NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. shareholders settled five
lawsuits brought by the holders that involved losses in
trading transactions and certain real estate investments,
according to an attorney for Howard A. Rubin, a former senior
trader of mortgage-backed securities for Merrill Lynch.
   The attorney, George B. Yankwitt, said in a statement that
the holders agreed to have the suits dismissed and that
Merrill Lynch will receive $17,525,000 directly from its
directors' and officers' liability insurers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Yankwitt said three of the suits arose out of an
estimated $250 million loss sustained by Merrill Lynch in
April 1987. In those lawsuits certain Merrill Lynch holders
said a portion of the loss was due to purchases of
mortgage-backed securities by Mr. Rubin and further claimed
that Mr. Rubin's supervisors -- Brian Barefoot, Robert Andres
and Greg Herschell -- had failed to supervise his trading
activities.
   The shareholders sought more than $250 million in damages
on behalf of Merrill Lynch. Mr. Rubin has denied engaging in
any unauthorized trades or other wrongful conduct, Mr.
Yankwitt said.
   Two of the lawsuits said that directors of Merrill Lynch
violated their fiduciary duties in connection with losses
sustained by Merrill Lynch in other transactions, which
included a lease agreement in the World Financial Center and
a resort development in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.
   A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said that the company
believes all the allegations "except those relating to the
conduct of Howard Rubin" to be "completely without merit."
   The attorneys said that the settlement does not require
Mr. Rubin or any of the other individual defendants to pay
any money to Merrill Lynch. The settlement agreement
recognizes that the defendants have denied any liability or
wrongdoing.
   Mr. Yankwitt said Merrill Lynch will provide Rubin with a
general release from all potential claims.

   Soviet Bank's Zurich Office Is Linchpin
   Of Bid to Be a Bigger Player in Markets

   ZURICH, Switzerland -- As tensions mounted in the Persian
Gulf and gold prices gyrated, dealers at the Swiss branch of
the Soviet Union's Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs here
were taking a hard line.
   "You want a discount? No way," Vladimir N. Goriounov barks
into the phone. "We deal at the market. Trading with us is
like trading with any other bank." Lighting another Marlboro,
the chain-smoking, 42-year-old veteran of the war in
Afghanistan observes, "Everyone wants a bargain."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   They should look elsewhere. The Zurich branch of Moscow's
Vnesheconombank doesn't offer cut-rate centrally planned
deals, or Communist ineptitude, either. The branch, one of
the Soviet Union's most important financial footholds in the
West, operates much like a Western commercial bank, offering
a range of services from trade finance to interest-rate
swaps.
   The Zurich branch's most significant activity is
overseeing as much as a third of the Soviet Union's official
gold sales, which analysts estimate at nearly $4 billion
annually. The Zurich branch also raises much-needed foreign
exchange through its trading and financing operations in the
international capital markets. "The Russians are very savvy
gold traders with a reputation for smarts," Jeffrey Nichols,
president of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc. in
Toronto, said.
   As one of Mother Russia's few windows on world capital
markets, the Zurich branch is the linchpin of Moscow's effort
to become a bigger player in those markets. There may be
bickering back in Moscow about the pace of economic reform,
but the Soviets in Zurich have no doubts. Their central plan
is to make money.
   "We run things on a profit basis," says Mr. Goriounov, the
branch's managing director. "It's perfectly normal, just like
Chase Manhattan or Citicorp." Chief dealer Andrei V.
Schjogolev, known by his anglicized name Andrew, said: "We
speculate. We buy low. We sell high. And we take a profit.
This is what everyone does in the international market."
   Indeed, the Soviets say playing by free-market rules is
vital if the U.S.S.R. is to assume a more active role in
world markets. The eight Soviets who run the 90-member office
here blend in with their Swiss colleagues; they wear
expensive European suits, drive Mercedes cars and favor
weekend cross-country skiing. The office language is English,
though most of the Soviets speak German. And because the
bankers are paid Swiss-level salaries, they are some of the
Soviet Union's highest-paid workers.
   From their office just off the Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich's
Wall Street, the Soviets manage assets of four billion Swiss
francs ($3.18 billion). Mr. Goriounov says 60% of the bank's
activity is export finance; the rest is spread among gold
dealing, securities trading and sovereign lending.
   Zurich isn't Moscow's only financial outpost; it has banks
or representative offices in 15 countries, including the U.S.
and Britain. All provide a range of trading services, and all
have Soviet trainees who learn Western financial practices.
This elite returns to Moscow after a year or so to train
others.
   But the Zurich branch is Moscow's primary gold dealer in
the West. And because the Soviet Union is the world's
second-largest gold power after South Africa, wildly gyrating
gold prices this year have put the spotlight on the Zurich
branch. Soviet bankers say the government sharply increased
the volume of gold sales earlier this year. Market
specialists believe the Soviets shipped as much as 300 tons
in the first five months, roughly the total for the previous
year. Many analysts believe the Soviets were tapping gold
reserves for cash to pay Western trading partners, who were
complaining about multimillion-dollar payment delays.
   In recent months, the sales have slowed, the Soviets said.
And the traders here seem cautiously bullish about gold
prices. They believe events in the Persian Gulf will drive
prices higher.
   Western bankers say the Soviets' gold strategy illustrates
how the Zurich branch and Vnesheconombank's Moscow
headquarters are showing increasing sophistication.
Innovative techniques are saving money and supporting the
price of gold.
   Bankers say the bulk of the Soviet gold transfers this
year were so-called gold swaps, in which the Soviets sell
gold to a Western counterpart, on condition that Moscow can
buy it back at a fixed price, sometimes as much as a year and
a half later. This gives the Soviets immediate access to
Western currencies, as well as the option to buy back the
gold.
   The Soviets haven't always been so sophisticated. They
opened a banking operation here in 1966, mostly to sell gold
and trade foreign currencies. Assignments were handed out as
patronage plums for the party faithful, and the Soviets had
trouble being taken seriously. Some of their habits didn't
help, such as inviting Swiss traders for afternoon
vodka-drinking marathons, where the straight-arrow Swiss were
pressed for inside information.
   When gold prices rose sharply in the 1970s, the Soviets
became bolder. This led to their biggest setback in the
Western financial markets: the 1985 collapse of their Zurich
bank, Wozchod Handelsbank, following large
speculative-trading losses.
   Moscow shut the bank. It was re-opened as a branch more
tightly under Vnesheconombank control and began to upgrade
the caliber of its employees. "When they started, they had a
lot to learn, and they have learned it," a Swiss trader said.
"Nowadays, they are as sophisticated and professional as
anyone."
   The Zurich branch differs from Western commercial banks in
that it is part of a state-owned bank and is used as an
instrument of government policy. The Zurich branch must buy
gold when the government wants to sell. But the Soviet
bankers don't have to turn around and resell the gold
immediately. They can wait if they believe prices will
improve. (The gold sales may be clouded somewhat by the
Russian republic's recent declaration of sovereignty;
republic officials say that because much of the gold comes
from Russia, the republic should at least be consulted on its
sale. The central authorities have declared the republic's
claim invalid, but the issue remains murky.)
   But such debates are moot amid the hustle and bustle of
Vnesheconombank's Zurich gold trading room. "Woooooo. Things
are getting hectic," Mr. Schjogolev, the chief dealer, cries
on one recent day as his trading screen flashes green and red
with news from the Persian Gulf. He believes the whipsawing
markets will give him an opportunity to sell a gold position
he bought in the morning from a Hong Kong broker. As prices
hit $414 an ounce, he trades the position to a Swiss bank.
"You and I can do some business," he says to the buyer.
   Suddenly, gold starts plummeting, to $413, then $412. Mr.
Schjogolev gets back in the market and buys back the same
position at lower cost.
   "That's a $3,500 profit," he says. "Not bad for a couple
of minutes."

   The Many Armies of the Soviet Union

   "Only the disintegration of the Soviet empire's army into
independent republican defense forces can avert civil war,"
says Hryhoriy Prychodko, a 53-year-old Ukranian Nationalist,
Mr. Prychodko's comments, made while on a visit to the U.S.,
may strike some as alarmist. But this former political
prisoner is suggesting that in the face of deepening
divisions in Moscow, only governments in the Soviet Union's
national republics are now capable of exerting reliable
control over the military and preventing strife.
   There are signs Mr. Prychodko may be on to something. As
Mikhail Gorbachev grapples with economic decline and rising
social unrest, growing splits within a once cohesive Soviet
military complicate his task. More and more of the Soviet
Union's national republics are indicating their opposition to
the maintenance of empire by force and are seeking to restore
the military and militia to their control. Within the
military itself, ideological conflicts are growing between
reformist-oriented younger officers and reactionaries eager
to protect the military budget and defend at all costs the
unity of the "union of fraternal peoples."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   July 30, the Ukraine's Supreme Soviet took another step
along the road to disunity when it demanded that the Soviet
Defense Ministry recall Ukrainian soldiers policing Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Kirgizia and Lithuania. The action by Ukrainian
lawmakers was prompted by a July 25 presidential decree that
implied Mr. Gorbachev may soon use force to stop armed
nationalist groups challenging Moscow's rule.
   The growing numbers of small private militias, such as the
Armenian National Army, reflect the increasingly fragile
state of military unity. Last year, 6,500 young men failed to
appear for military duty, most of them from the Baltic
states, where pro-independence forces encouraged resistance
to the "army of occupation." In this summer's military
call-up, astonishing levels of draft-dodging are a barometer
of growing national discontent: In Armenia, only 7.5% of the
recruits have turned up; in Georgia, 27.5%; in Lithuania,
33%; in Estonia, 40%; and in Latvia, 54%. In the Central
Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Kirgizia more than 10% of
the draftees failed to appear.
   Soviet draftees, particularly non-Russians, are being
affected by the national reawakening of their republics. Many
have been active in patriotic demonstrations, general strikes
and informal youth organizations. This radicalization creates
conflicts with ethnic Russian recruits and has led to the
mistreatment and even murder of thousands of soldiers from
Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Central
Asia in the past year.
   Boris Yeltsin, too, has emerged as a popular figure
capable of fragmenting the army. The president of the Russian
Federation is a strong advocate of radical military reform,
the depoliticization of the army and the general staff, the
removal of Communist Party cells from the military, and the
improvement of living conditions and wages for military
personnel. Mr. Yeltsin's bread-and-butter populism is certain
to win approval from poorly paid noncommissioned officers and
recruits; while his appeal to professionalism finds resonance
within the officer corps. In late June, Mr. Yeltsin took his
case directly to the young officers when he addressed the
graduation ceremonies of the military academies.
   As Oleg Rumyantsev, a young associate of Mr. Yeltsin's who
recently traveled in the U.S., put it: "With time, it will be
Yeltsin who has control of the finger on the trigger." Mr.
Yeltsin's popularity suggests that it is not only the forces
of nationalism that are winning the hearts and minds of
draftees and enlisted men. Political groups are tugging at
the loyalty of officers and recruits. A radical officers
group, the Shield, openly backs reformist critics of Mr.
Gorbachev and echoes the programs of such independent groups
as the Democratic Russia bloc, the Democratic Platform, and
the Inter-Regional Group of U.S.S.R. People's Deputies, by
calling for an end to Communist control of the military.
   Although soldiers swear an oath of allegiance to the
Soviet Union, Soviet doctrine also teaches that the Soviet
Union is a voluntary union of sovereign republics. Now, as
republics shed rigid party control and proclaim the primacy
of their laws over those of the Soviet Union, and as newly
elected republic parliaments issue calls for the return of
conscripts to their native lands, Soviet soldiers will face
further pressures on their loyalty.
   Some see in these trends the signs of a dangerous anarchy.
Yet, the drastic decline in the once-iron discipline of the
Soviet military can also work to build stability in the
Soviet Union. Indeed, one sign of this is Mr. Gorbachev's
decision to back off from his July 25 decree. If
democratically accountable republics eventually control the
deployment of troops and move to eradicate nuclear weapons
from their territories, the Soviet Union and the world can
become a safer place.
   The dissolution of a unitary imperial state need not lead
to Balkanization. In most of the national republics,
patriotic pro-independence movements are led by moderate
democratic leaders, committed to inter-group dialogue and
peaceful negotiations. Characteristic of such views are the
recent declarations of the Ukrainian and Byelorussian
parliaments that they seek to become neutral states and
intend to ban the production and deployment of nuclear
weapons on their territories.
   In fact, it is not the appearance of a multiplicity of
political groups that has politicized the Soviet military. It
is rather the continued presence of the Communist Party's
retrograde political apparat within the military.
   In this context, the greatest danger is of a backlash from
the most reactionary, proimperial segments of the military
establishment. Such reactionary forces can win support from
personnel alarmed at announced cuts in the defense budget and
disgruntled over housing difficulties affecting some 200,000
officers and their families. The new head of the military's
Main Political Administration, Gen. Nikolai Shlyaga, has
sounded reactionary warnings against subversion of the
military and has asserted that "the only real political
force, the most massive and organized, which enjoys absolute
authority in the army is the Communist Party."
   Another army leader, Gen. Boris Gromov -- who commanded
the Soviet forces in Afghanistan and is regarded by some as a
potential Bonaparte -- complained last December about
"slanderous attacks" in the Soviet media on the armed forces.
And in February, at a mass rally attended by large numbers of
military personnel, the reactionary political activist Nina
Andreyeva was lustily applauded when, after inveighing
against the threat of counterrevolution in Russia, she
shouted: "Hail to the unconquerable unity of the Soviet army
and the people] Motherland or death]"
   A move by the army to repress dissent could of course
bring unpredictable results. Any inclination on the part of
Soviet authorities to apply martial law over large parts of
the Soviet Union could backfire, as well as set back any
prospects for the fundamental reform of the Soviet economy
and society. Mr. Prychodko, who heads a coalition of small,
radical Ukrainian nationalist parties, agrees. "In the
context of the growing Gorbachev-Yeltsin split," he argues,
"it is practically impossible to bring about martial law."

   Education:
   Verbal Skills
   Slip as SAT
   Scores Fall

   Students' weakening verbal skills pulled down scores on
the Scholastic Aptitude Test for the third straight year,
heightening worries about course content and trends in
reading habits.
   Students headed for college this fall achieved an average
combined mathematics and verbal score of 900, down from 903
last year. All of the decline was in the verbal score, which
fell to 424, down three points from last year and tied for
the worst performance ever, recorded in 1980 and 1981. Each
component in the test has a point scale of 200 to 800, for a
combined maximum of 1,600.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some observers were particularly dismayed because the
decline occurred despite a stable participation rate of about
40% of high school seniors, negating past explanations for
the downward trend.
   "We can no longer get away with saying scores are going
down because the number of kids taking the SAT is going up,
reducing the talent pool," said Lynne Cheney, chairman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities. "I suspect the reason
scores are going down is for all the other reasons: textbooks
that are still dumbed-down, teachers who are not as prepared
as they should be and curricula that are not as demanding as
they should be."
   The College Board, which sponsors the SAT, attributed the
continuing verbal score decline to an erosion of reading
time. Donald Stewart, president of the New York organization,
said "reading is in danger of becoming a lost art among too
many American students."
   The College Board noted that the National Assessment of
Educational Progress, a nationally representative test for
students at three grade levels, concluded earlier this year
that students spend little time reading and writing both in
and out of school. Mr. Stewart said one reason was a
preoccupation with television and video games.
   Even some past defenders of schools' performance reacted
soberly to the latest figures.
   "Nationally, there's weakness in reading, and it's going
to hurt us down the road," said Bill Honig, California's
school superintendent. "We have to revamp the curriculum
toward more writing, more problem-solving and more
literature."
   Mr. Honig has said that school critics aren't seeing the
whole picture in the SAT scores. In California, he says, the
major ethnic groups whose scores are broken out by the
College Board -- whites, blacks, Asians and Hispanics -- all
have shown score improvement of 3% to 4% annually since 1983.
Pulling down the overall average is the higher participation
of blacks and Hispanics, whose scores are much lower than
whites.
   The results also yielded a mixed message on new state
education laws in the 1980s. Many of these dictated a higher
graduation standard that included more so-called "academic"
subjects, including mathematics, science, social studies and
English, and fewer vocational electives, physical education
and other courses.
   The College Board said that students who took more than 20
high school courses had average scores 50 points higher than
students who took fewer than 20 such courses. But the
proportion of students with 20 or more academic courses
increased to 40% from 39% last year -- and scores still
declined.
   Gordon Ensign, supervisor of assessment for schools in
Washington state, said one possible explanation was a decline
in the reading and writing content of courses that some
systems count as academic. He said that high school
journalism and film classes are increasingly counted as
"academic" curriculum, although they make far fewer demands
on students to understand literature.

   Excel Industries Inc., Elkhart, Ind., said it agreed to
purchase the door-systems division of Johnson Controls Inc.
of Milwaukee for an undisclosed amount of cash.
   The maker of windows for cars, trucks and other vehicles
said the division is expected to have annual sales this year
of $80 million. Excel said the division will boost its 1990
revenue to about $300 million. In 1989, Excel had sales of
$259.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Johnson Controls said the sale reflects its desire to
focus on its automotive seating and related interior-systems
operations. "We don't believe we need to be in the
door-systems technology business," a spokeswoman said.
   Excel said the acquisition of door systems, which supplies
window-regulator systems for the automotive market, will
"strongly position the company in the rollup glass area." The
company said it has worked closely with the Johnson Controls
division in the past two years in developing a modular door
cartridge, which combines all internal functions of
side-window, rollup glass in a module that can be assembled
into the sheet metal door.
   The transaction is scheduled to close on Oct. 1.

   Coca-Cola Foods, which produces Minute Maid orange juice,
said it plans to cut the price of its frozen concentrated
juice to reflect cost decreases.
   The Coca-Cola Co. division, the nation's largest orange
juice maker, said it would reduce the price of a 12-ounce can
of frozen juice by 20 cents to 25 cents. A typical can
currently costs about $1.60 to $1.90, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In recent weeks, Brazilian processors have announced price
decreases on orange concentrate, reflecting strong supplies.
In taking advantage of the lower costs, Coca-Cola Foods hopes
to stimulate growth in frozen juice volume, which it
previously predicted would decline at a double-digit rate
this year.
   The price cuts may stem some of that decline, but they
aren't deep enough to completely erase price hikes taken
earlier this year to offset a freeze in Florida. In December,
for example, a typical can of Minute Maid frozen orange juice
sold for $1.20 to $1.50.
   Still, orange juice is a price-sensitive beverage, and a
price decrease is certain to stimulate demand for frozen
juice, a lethargic category that has suffered from consumers'
preference for the convenience of ready-to-drink, chilled
beverages.

   Harvests Help Iraq Stretch Food Supply,
   But Soldiers in Kuwait Suffer Shortages

   The food situation in Iraq doesn't appear nearly as
desperate as first thought, U.S. officials say, but Iraq is
running into severe problems feeding its army in Kuwait.
   Three weeks after Iraqi troops rolled through Kuwait,
there are frequent reports of bedraggled Iraqi soldiers
demanding water, juice, bread and even gasoline at gunpoint
from Kuwaiti refugees fleeing across the desert.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We understand they're facing persistent shortages" of
essential supplies in some of the southernmost battalions,
said Brig. Gen. Rich Timons, assistant commander of the
Army's 82nd Airborne division, one of the first U.S. units to
arrive in the Mideast. Iraq's military "isn't accustomed to
sustaining {supply lines} over long distances," Gen. Timons
said in an interview. "That already may be showing up."
   Senior U.S. and Saudi military strategists are convinced
that such problems, if they become more widespread and
pronounced over the next few days or weeks, are bound to
demoralize Saddam Hussein's forces and become an increasingly
important factor in shaping the U.S.'s military response.
Gen. Timons said there already are signs of "some internal
conflict" in the Iraqi military, though he didn't elaborate.
   In Iraq, however, while the U.N.-backed embargo is
pinching, the summer harvests of wheat and barley were
decent. Iraqi farmers are in the midst of their corn harvest
and are about to begin harvesting rice. While both crops are
tiny by U.S. standards, they should help stave off famine in
a nation that imports more than 70% of its food.
   The result is that U.S. officials now believe that Iraq
will have enough wheat and rice for four months of normal
human consumption, and that rationing and belt-tightening
could stretch those supplies another month or so. In a pinch,
Iraqi bakeries could switch to barley, which is usually fed
to livestock, when they run out of wheat flour. Iraq has
enough barley stockpiled to last seven months, according to a
report by the U.S. agricultural attache in Baghdad.
   As for corn, there will be enough for one more cycle of
broiler production, the report projects. With the embargo
already cutting off imports of mutton and beef, Iraq faces
severe meat shortages as soon as the last batch of chickens
are eaten, probably within two months.
   Early in the Mideast crisis, U.S. officials were saying
that Iraq only has a two-month supply of wheat and
three-month supply of rice. In addition, Iraq was said to
have only enough barley to last one month and enough corn to
last less than two weeks. But that assessment, it turns out,
focused on grain stockpiles as of July 1, and didn't factor
in the summer harvests.
   The latest assessment comes amid mounting evidence that
the trade embargo is beginning to bite. Several ships
carrying grain and other foodstuffs to Iraq and to the
Jordanian port of Aqaba have been rerouted to other
destinations -- and other customers -- since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, according to grain-trade experts. "It's
remarkable how much everybody has come into line," said a
U.S. trade official. At the same time, U.S. officials are
receiving reports of bread lines and skyrocketing prices for
cooking oil, sugar and other commodities in tight supply in
Iraq.
   But it appears that the pinch of the economic sanctions
won't give way to widespread pain for many months. "I think
it might be a little too soon to have that effect all across
the country," said Christopher Goldthwait, a senior
Agriculture Department official. "There may be localized
shortages. It is in fact their harvest season."
   With Iraq on war-time footing, wheat and barley production
in Ninevah and other northern provinces may have fallen
somewhat short of projections by agricultural attache Larry
Panasuk.
   He forecasts a total wheat harvest of 800,000 metric tons
for 1990, up from last year's drought-shriveled 491,000 tons.
Coupled with 700,000 tons still in storage, that would meet
Iraq's wheat needs for four months.
   The flight of Egyptian and other foreign laborers who
customarily help out in Iraqi fields may hamper the corn and
rice harvests. But Mr. Panasuk projects a rice harvest of
166,000 tons, or about 25% of annual consumption. Combined
with Thai and U.S. rice stockpiled before the embargo, this
should be enough for four months, according to his report.
   The corn crop now coming in is projected at 110,000 tons,
far below of Iraq's annual needs of 820,000 tons. With
stockpiles virtually exhausted, the harvest will be only
enough to sustain one last burst of broiler production. Some
Iraqi broiler operations, anticipating the crunch, have begun
selling hatching eggs for human consumption.
   The Barley crop is estimated at one million tons. "In this
emergency, the Iraqis could reduce feeding of livestock and
use it for barley flour," one government official said.
   The Iraqi army's logistics system, however, faces new
stresses along the country's northern border, where Turkey
and Syria are said to have moved as many as 90,000 troops
closer to Iraqi positions. This will force Saddam Hussein to
move troops and "stretch out his supply lines to the
maximum," according to one U.S. official.
   But others worry that Iraq's staying power, honed during
its bloody war with Iran, will help keep its military intact
during this crisis. "They managed to last eight years against
the Iranians," said Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, who runs the U.S.
Army's supply operation in Saudi Arabia.
   Efforts to disrupt Iraqi communications and supply lines
coincide with an important turning point in the largest U.S.
commitment of military might since the Vietnam War. With more
than 50,000 troops already in Saudi Arabia or on the way,
about that many more scheduled to leave during the next few
weeks, and hundreds of additional tanks slated to be deployed
shortly, the commanders of Operation Desert Shield now have
the firepower to begin thinking about possible offensive
moves.
   But many officers and soldiers here believe it's likely to
take weeks for the next phase of the operation to become
clear. "We're fundamentally in a training mode" to get
adjusted to the desert environment, said Gen. Timons, whose
airborne troops are trained for swift assault operations. "We
have no plans at this point to go into an offensive mode," he
said.
   That message was echoed by a contingent of U.S. senators
who visited troops and air crews during a three-hour stop at
a major air base in northeastern Saudi Arabia.
   The eight lawmakers, including Senate Republican Leader
Robert Dole of Kansas and Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, emphasized the
importance of maintaining international support for the U.S.
operation in Saudi Arabia. "The mission here is to deter and
defend," Sen. Nunn told reporters. "It is very important that
we keep it in that context."

   CRI Insured Mortgage Association Inc., a real estate
investment trust based in Rockville, Md., amended its plan to
acquire four mortgage investment partnerships managed by New
York-based Integrated Resources Inc.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, CRI said
it is proposing to swap cash plus shares of either CRI or a
new company it formed for all the units outstanding of the
four partnerships.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the previous offer, the partnerships' unit holders
would have received only shares. Now CRI proposes to pay 10%
of the units' exchange value in cash and 90% in stock. CRI
said the plan must be cleared by the SEC and by holders of a
majority of CRI shares.
   Integrated, which is operating with protection from
creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code, manages investment partnerships. It has been fighting
the CRI offer because it would lose certain management fees
if the bid succeeds. This month, a plan under which
Integrated would sell its interests in the partnerships for
as much as $45 million to Krupp Cos. collapsed. Krupp is a
Boston-based real estate investment manager.

   Cyprus Minerals Co. said it will spend $92.5 million to
modernize and expand its Miami, Ariz., copper smelter.
   Cyprus said the expansion would command a sizable portion
of the Denver mining company's 1991 capital expenditure
budget, which has been about $200 million a year for the past
couple of years. The expansion, which is designed to make
Cyprus self-sufficient in copper smelting capacity, will be
completed in mid-1992, the company estimated. The move will
increase Cyprus's concentrate smelting capacity to 650,000
tons from 450,000 tons annually.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The completed facility will reduce the consumption of
electric power, the biggest cost in producing copper, a
spokesman said. The upgrading of the facility has been part
of the company's long-term plans since it bought the smelter
from Inspiration Resources Corp. in 1988.
   Cyprus said that regardless of the plans for the expanded
smelter, the company will "meet its obligations" in a
copper-concentrate smelting contract it has with Magma Copper
Co., which runs through mid-1996. Magma processes about
150,000 tons of copper concentrates annually for Cyprus at a
San Manuel, Ariz., smelter.

   Investors' Fees
   For Arbitration
   To Go Higher

   NEW YORK -- Investors will soon have to fork over stiffer
fees to bring their stockbrokers to arbitration.
   In the first substantial fee change for customers since
1978, the nation's stock exchanges, squeezed for cash, are in
the process of quietly boosting the cost of filing
arbitration claims.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The brunt of the fee increase will be borne by those
investors who bring relatively large claims. "A customer who
brings an arbitration claim for $1 million can carry his own
freight," says James E. Buck, senior vice president at the
New York Stock Exchange. "For small customers, we do
everything we can to help them."
   Until now, investors put up a "hearing deposit" when they
filed a case, ranging from $15 for the smallest claims to
$1,000 for disputes of more than $500,000. Now, the exchanges
are essentially tacking on a separate filing fee, creating a
two-tier structure. This amounts to an extra $15 for the
tiniest claims to an extra $800 for investors seeking more
than $5 million.
   The Big Board is expected to put the new fees into effect
within weeks. The arbitration arms of the nation's other
stock exchanges will soon follow suit. The National
Association of Securities Dealers, which handles nearly
two-thirds of all cases, launched the new fee schedule
several weeks ago.
   Last year, the NASD shelled out $10 million to subsidize
its arbitration program -- about 10% of its total budget --
while it took in just $3 million in fees.
   The increases are targeted at areas that cost the
exchanges the most to administer, arbitration specialists
say.
   "Now, somebody who has a big claim that requires several
sessions who is intent on going to a hearing is going to pay
the biggest part of the fees," says Richard P. Ryder, editor
of the Securities Arbitration Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J.,
newsletter.
   The specter of fatter out-of-pocket expenses in a long
case could lead customers to consider settling their cases
more quickly, Mr. Ryder says. Last year, investors settled
nearly 1,500 cases at the NASD, representing about 36% of the
cases filed there, compared with about 41% of 1989 cases
filed at the Big Board.
   Arbitration still costs less than litigation, and it is a
good thing for investors: Many stock customers sign a
standard agreement when they open a brokerage account,
binding them to go to arbitration rather than file a lawsuit
if a dispute arises.
   And even with the new price boost, it still generally
costs less to bring a case at the stock exchanges than at the
major independent forum, the American Arbitration
Association. The association, which is privately funded,
charges a fee of 3% of any claim to a maximum $25,000, with a
minimum of $300. Claims of more than $5 million cost $14,250,
plus one-tenth of 1% of the excess above $5 million at the
association.
   "The difference is the {securities} industry supports
fairly lavishly the operations of the NASD and the NYSE,"
says Robert Coulson, president of the American Arbitration
Association.

   LOS ANGELES -- A shareholder sued Medco Research Inc.,
alleging the company misled investors into thinking it might
soon be sold.
   In a complaint seeking class-action status in federal
court here, Thomas Duffy also alleged that William C. Govier,
Medco executive vice president, sold 41,000 shares of the
company's stock at between $18 and $20 a share just before
share prices dropped sharply.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last November, Medco retained Oppenheimer &amp; Co. to advise
it on maximizing shareholder value through a possible sale.
No one expressed an interest in buying the Los Angeles-based
drug formula licensor, but Medco announced that several
companies were reviewing the possibility, the complaint said.
   Mr. Govier allegedly sold his shares between March 12 and
March 27 this year knowing that no one had expressed an
interest in acquiring Medco. The Medco share price dropped
$3.75 to $15.75 on March 30, the complaint said. Yesterday,
Medco was quoted at $9.75 bid over the counter, up 62.5 cents
from Friday.
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Also named as
defendants are Mr. Govier; Manfred Mosk, Medco's chief
executive officer; and Sanford J. Hillsberg, the company's
general counsel.
   Neither Medco nor its officials named in the suit could be
reached for comment.

   ARLINGTON, Va. -- With a slew of monopoly routes and a
fortress hub in Pittsburgh, USAir appeared to have a license
to make money in the 1980s. It didn't do much marketing. It
didn't buy jumbo jets. It didn't offer first class service.
It wouldn't even give customers an extra bag of peanuts.
   While other carriers were mired in red ink, USAir earned a
profit in every year except one following deregulation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So confident were the company's executives that they
undertook one of the biggest airline combinations in history
in 1987, acquiring both Pacific Southwest Airlines and
Piedmont Aviation Inc. The two mergers made USAir the
nation's sixth largest airline, and left it with dominant
market shares in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Baltimore, San
Diego, Charlotte, N.C., and Dayton, Ohio.
   The mergers, however, also meant that USAir no longer had
things quite so soft. Forced out into the rough-and-tumble
arena of national competition, it suddenly had to worry a
whole lot about the the industry's really tough players.
   Moreover, in absorbing two successful carriers into its
system, USAir adopted what it called a "Mirror Image"
strategy of making them do everything exactly its way. In
this, USAir gave up some of the very elements that made the
target airlines successful.
   On the West Coast, USAir has been getting clobbered in a
five-way battle with AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, UAL
Corp.'s United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and low-cost
Southwest Airlines. It has had to retreat in a number of West
Coast markets, and many of its Western routes are now
unprofitable. In Philadelphia, USAir is having trouble with
little Midway Airlines and Eastern Airlines. To compete, it
has had to cut fares to below profitable levels. (Overall,
though, the airline says that it is still maintaining its
market share.)
   Late last week, USAir announced plans to furlough 3,600 of
its employees, including 500 managers. The layoffs, which
represent about 7% of its work force, are among the largest
ever in the industry. USAir also said it was scaling back its
capacity growth projections to a maximum of 2% next year from
a previously projected 6%. Its stock -- already hurt by the
disclosure of a $113 million deficit in the first six months
-- has plunged from a high of $54.75 last summer to
yesterday's $16.25 close on the New York Stock Exchange.
   USAir "ran into problems when it began to venture out
beyond its area of natural advantage; now it is really quite
exposed," says Alfred Kahn, former chairman of the old Civil
Aeronautics Board and a pioneer of deregulation. Faced with
intense competition from sophisticated rivals, the airline
"strikes me as being a rather clumsy giant," he adds.
   Matters could grow even worse in coming months. That's
because USAir is more vulnerable than other carriers to
rising fuel prices. Its short-hop route system burns up more
fuel because its jets spend less time at cruise altitude.
Half of its 400 jets are more than 10 years old, and these
planes are much less fuel-efficient.
   The carrier recently mothballed six of its oldest Boeing
727s and says it may ground as many as 49 older 727s and 737s
in the next 16 months. It also has postponed taking delivery
of 12 new aircraft. A maintenance official says the airline
may try to sell some of its older airplanes. If so, it will
do so in a weak resale market.
   USAir also has almost completely missed out on the
high-growth international market where traffic has risen a
healthy 16.9% so far this year, compared to 3% domestically.
While other carriers have been adding overseas flights as
quickly as they can get government approval, USAir has
service only to London and Frankfurt. So it is especially
vulnerable to a U.S. recession.
   Against this backdrop, pressure is mounting on Edwin I.
Colodny, USAir's reserved, bespectacled chairman, to improve
matters. Mr. Colodny -- who said yesterday that he expects to
retire next year after reaching 65 in June -- is quick to
acknowledge that USAir has had its problems. "There's no way
for me to say that our management didn't make a single
mistake," he says, citing failure to pursue one foreign route
more aggressively. But he also blames the pressures the
entire industry has been under, the heavy discounting in some
markets, and the weakening U.S. economy.
   "All of these things have come together," he says. "Growth
has just disappeared." Hence, the cutbacks: "It's prudent for
us to trim back when we don't see the market growing. I can't
promise that 1991 would be profitable. Unless something in
our economy changes dramatically, I can't see that
happening."
   USAir has plenty of problems besides the economy.
Government regulators, for example. Justice Department
trust-busters are pressing it for information about its
Pittsburgh operations as part of an investigation into
whether USAir is blocking other airlines from starting
service there. USAir denies any wrongdoing.
   The Federal Aviation Administration also is pressing Mr.
Colodny to revise pilot training and crew staffing practices
after USAir Flight 5050 skidded off the runway at New York's
LaGuardia Airport a year ago, killing two passengers. The
flight had paired a new captain with a newly hired co-pilot.
USAir says it has addressed all of the FAA's concerns.
   Whether Mr. Colodny's cautious management style is suited
to quick turnarounds may be another question. Given to
micro-managing, the publicity-shy ex-lawyer even chooses the
pictures for the covers of flight schedules. He insists that
senior managers sign off on department expenditures of over
$1,000.
   When USAir decided to go to two classes of service on all
routes last year, it moved very cautiously, offering only a
single row of first class seats on many flights. And while
USAir jumped into the merger game in a big way, Mr. Colodny
was one of the last airline chief executives to pursue a
major acquisition. "Basically, he was forced into it," says
an industry official, because other carriers had already
gobbled up their competition.
   Some in the industry believe that the company's years of
insulation from major competition gave USAir executives an
inflated opinion of their operating style. This was
particularly damaging when USAir bought PSA and Piedmont.
Rather than learning from the two carriers, it appears, USAir
simply imposed its own way of doing business.
   Both PSA and Piedmont had already shown their
profitability and customer appeal. Piedmont, headquartered in
sleepy Winston-Salem, N.C., had attracted a loyal following
with its Southern hospitality and outstanding service. PSA
had wooed West Coast fliers with a playful style that allowed
flight attendants to begin safety briefings with lines like,
"In case you haven't been in an automobile since 1962, this
is a seat belt."
   Piedmont had what many in the industry believed was a more
sophisticated ticket pricing system, which balanced full-fare
and discount tickets more profitably. USAir scrapped the
Piedmont system and still uses only its own. "The revenue
differential was astounding" -- and lower -- on many flights,
says one former Piedmont executive.
   Mr. Colodny says making practices uniform was necessary to
running the big airline.
   His most immediate problem is USAir's unusually high labor
costs, and they too are related to the merger. Labor costs
have climbed to 4.13 cents per available seat mile from 3.57
cents before the merger. Meanwhile, the carrier's yield, or
revenue from ticket sales, dropped to 16.55 cents per
available seat mile in the first half of this year from 17.29
cents in the like period last year.
   USAir's labor costs are high because the airline, anxious
to insure labor peace, gave PSA and Piedmont workers hefty
wage hikes after the merger. The move cost USAir an
additional $100 million annually, at least, according to
former Piedmont executives. Some customer service agents who
earned about $14,000 at Piedmont now earn at least $20,000 at
USAir.
   With mechanics and flight attendants in contract
negotiations, Mr. Colodny has a chance of tackling the
problem soon. USAir may have to revert to using Piedmont's
more flexible work rules. At Piedmont, customer service
agents earning about $6.75 an hour also worked on the tarmac,
directing aircraft in and out of their gates. At USAir, a
mechanic earning a minimum of $18 an hour performs this job.
USAir had to hire an additional 400 mechanics to service the
same number of Piedmont flights because of this rule.
   Mr. Colodny may also have to ask USAir employees for
greater flexibility. At Piedmont, many employees were
crosstrained so that gate agents could load bags when
necessary. Moreover, USAir flight attendants, on average,
work two to three fewer days a month than Piedmont's did, for
much higher wages.
   USAir's labor costs are high even when compared with the
rest of the industry. At United, entry-level aircraft
cleaners earn $6.83 an hour; the job pays $10.94 an hour at
USAir. Getting the unions on board promises to be a big
challenge, but Mr. Colodny is optimistic. "We expect to
achieve some changes," he said. "We certainly hope to improve
our labor costs."
   Industry analysts say USAir will also have to become more
sensitive to marketing trends and customer preferences. When
USAir cut the old Piedmont practice of serving passengers
whole cans of soda, instead of just a cupful, Piedmont
frequent fliers put their foot down. Cost-cutting was one
thing, but this was downright stingy, they wrote to the
Charlotte Observer. Chastened, USAir started handing out the
cans again.
   Passengers on Piedmont had also come to love the baskets
of granola bars, cookies and crackers handed around in first
class and the snacks served on flights of less than two
hours. When USAir cut that admittedly minor service,
complaints again flowed in. Back came the baskets, but minus
the expensive cookies.
   USAir's experience with PSA also taught it that hewing to
a not-invented-here philosophy can cost you in the end. PSA
used to hand out cold snacks -- a quick and easy service --
on its short-haul California routes. USAir changed those to
hot meals. But, encumbered by trays and the need to heat
meals, flight attendants couldn't keep up with the short-haul
schedule. Several flights wound up circling airports while
the crew frantically tried to collect trays and stow away
carts.
   So USAir is back to cold snacks on those flights. It
still, however, hasn't reinstituted PSA's practice of letting
passengers buy tickets on board or in coupon books. And gone
now are the smiling faces PSA had painted on the nose of its
planes. George Shortley, PSA's former chief financial
officer, says that was a big marketing mistake. "That was one
of the most recognized trademarks in California," he says.
   Mr. Colodny says USAir had to take the smile off because
it wanted all the planes to look alike. "It's very difficult
to have a smile on everywhere," he says.
   USAir has also been wrestling with its on-time performance
and its baggage service. It chalked up one of the worst
records in the industry most of last year and part of this
year. Part of the problem stemmed from having to integrate
employees of all three carriers -- a daunting task, as other
merged airlines have also discovered. USAir now operates 17
bases from which crews are drawn -- over twice as many as
industry leader United.
   The complexity of that structure was quickly apparent. In
the early months of the merger, it wasn't unusual for pilots
to show up for a flight, only to find they were scheduled on
a plane they weren't certified to fly.
   USAir says it has worked out its crew scheduling problems.
Its on-time performance has also improved. It was fifth best
in the industry in June, the last month for which statistics
are available. However, in some cases, USAir simply added
minutes to the scheduled arrival time. The flight that used
to be scheduled to leave New York's LaGuardia at 6:10 p.m.
and reach Charlotte at 7:58 p.m., for example, is now
scheduled to leave at 6:15 but arrive at 8:15. USAir says it
revised schedules to make them "more realistic."
   In the end, USAir, now that it has joined the big leagues,
is wrestling with many of the same problems plaguing other
major airlines: how to keep service good and meet customer
demands while holding costs down. But in Mr. Colodny's mind,
critics who say the company just isn't used to competing are
wrong: USAir has had to fight for market share in the past.
And while he says he's disappointed by the company's recent
performance, he suggests that some of the criticism of late
hasn't been all that fair. "It's easy to criticize when
you're not making money," he says.
   After 33 years with the company, Mr. Colodny now faces
some of his biggest tests -- in his last year. His
announcement that he plans to retire in 1991 (a firm date
hasn't been set) lays to rest widespread speculation that he
might stay on. But whether he will be able to see the
beginning of a turnaround at USAir by then is uncertain. In
an interview, even Mr. Colodny seems doubtful. "It would be
better to have a happy ending" to his career, he says.

   Trefoil said it also signed an agreement for its plan to
purchase the 18% of Child World now in public hands for $14 a
share, or $28 million.
   Trefoil said both transactions have been approved by Child
World's board. The transaction with CNC is expected to be
completed on or about Nov. 19, and the Child World
acquisition is expected to be completed about 90 days later,
Trefoil said.

   Trashing History: Did Hanoi Make This Movie?

   Once upon a time there were two types of war movies: those
in which the American cause was just and all Americans were
heroes and those in which our cause was just, notwithstanding
the flaws of a few individual Americans.
   These days there also are two kinds of war movies: those
in which the American cause is evil and all Americans are
villains and those in which a few Americans patronizingly are
presented as idiot-innocents in a villainous U.S. cause. The
propaganda point is the same, of course, give or take a noble
savage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Today's war movies are no more subtle or sophisticated
than back in the days of our youth. Over the years, Hollywood
has simply transferred the black hats onto Americans and the
white hats onto almost anyone who shoots them up.
   The latest example of this genre is "Air America," an
airheaded aerial comedy directed by Roger Spottiswoode that
sets out to both twist and trivialize the exploits of Air
America pilots flying missions in Laos during the Indochina
war. The film succeeds in delivering pretty faces (Mel Gibson
and Robert Downey Jr. in lead roles), talented stuntmen, some
spectacular Southeast Asian scenery, ample aerial acrobatics,
and a plot so moronic and mendacious that it might more
logically have been distributed by Red Star Studios in Hanoi
rather than Tri-Star Pictures in Hollywood.
   For the record, the U.S. government did indeed support a
semi-clandestine war in Laos during the 1960s and early '70s
aimed at stemming the flow of Hanoi's men and war materiel
down the Ho Chi Minh Trail and at keeping the North
Vietnamese and their Laotian puppets, the Pathet Lao, from
conquering all of Laos. The main heroes in this bloody
struggle were the Laotians, particularly the Hmong mountain
tribesmen who suffered uncounted thousands of casualties
battling the communists with a modicum of U.S. support. In
the "peaceful" postwar period, while Hollywood set about
inverting war history on Thai movie sets, these same Hmong
were victims of a campaign of annihilation carried on by
Hanoi with means including chemical warfare.
   There also were American heroes in Laos, primary among
them the pilots of the CIA-funded Air America, who suffered
243 deaths in action flying military supplies to the Hmong
soldiers or relief supplies to the myriad refugees from
communist aggression.
   None of this, naturally, emerges in "Air America." Rather,
the Hmong soldiers are depicted as corrupt drug dealers led
by a rapacious Laotian general employed by the CIA, which is
masterminding the Laotian drug traffic to finance its wicked
war of aggression in Indochina, in the process actively
promoting the addiction of GIs in neighboring South Vietnam.
The pilots of Air American are cast as knaves and fools,
ferrying heroin and stealing guns, between their frathouse
pranks and drunken stupors.
   This drivel is scripted with all the subtlety of an
"Animal House" cast reciting passages from Jane Fonda's Hanoi
diaries. By the way, it cost Tri-Star $35 million to trash
history and heroism in Laos; Air America pilots, by contrast,
were paid about $35,000 a year to risk their lives.
   Now, no one who spent time in Laos (which the film makers
didn't) could contest that this war, like any other, included
some element of humor amid pathos, human foibles along with
heroism, smiles amid suffering. Whimsy exists in war, but it
is something vastly different from the crude stereotyping and
slapstick of "Air America."
   Similarily, those who knew Laos would not contest that
opium was a traditional crop of some Laotian tribesmen, that
some drugs flowed through and from Laos, or that some
corruption existed in Souphanna Phouma's Vientiane, as indeed
it does in Marion Barry's Washington.
   But the fact is that the main products of the Laotian war
were casualties, refugees and postwar communist persecution
and enslavement, not opium poppies. Air America was
specifically barred from carrying any drugs for any purposes
and during the two years the pilot co-author of this article
flew helicopters in Laos, he never heard of those regulations
being flouted.
   The facts also are that Air America pilots were decent,
dedicated, disciplined aviators -- among the most
professional and courageous in U.S. aviation history. Flying
little Porters, lumbering C-123s or vulnerable helicopters
into hand-hewn jungle airstrips to deliver ammunition,
medicines or food supplies was no one's idea of fraternity
pranks. It is not surprising that Air America veterans, in
their outrage over the film, resent above all being depicted
as slovenly drunkards and clowns.
   The facts, too, are that the CIA operatives, AID relief
workers and other American civilian officials in Laos who
were Air America's clients also were proud and patriotic
people serving their country in this sad side-theater of the
Vietnam War. They too merit honor, not mockery.
   How is it then, after all the Indochina evidence of these
past 15 years -- the communist conquest, concentration camps,
exterminations, starvation, refugee exodus -- that Tri-Star
Pictures in the year 1990 still chooses to make a war movie
planting the black hats squarely on the wrong heads? And what
is it that leads the film makers to ridicule the honesty and
professionalism of these pilots in the process?
   A few clues perhaps can be found in a Hollywood-groupie
article written from the film's Thai-resort set and published
in the current issue of Premiere magazine. Here we learn how
tough the poor cast and crew had it up there in the hills:
Mr. Gibson actually getting diarrhea, plumpish Mr. Downey
having to lose 15 pounds, a camera crew getting scared on a
helicopter ride, and the constant risk of AIDS from Thai
prostitutes hired as film extras. Small wonder, given such
suffering, that the film makers were of misanthropic mind.
   Then there's John Eskow, billed as screenwriter and
co-producer of the film. Mr. Eskow, Premiere bemusedly tells
us, speaks with pride of having "faked a shrink letter" to
avoid service in Vietnam. This self-identified protege of
Abbie Hoffman explains to Premiere that he wanted to make a
"yippie" movie for producer, Daniel Melnick -- "a fun, zany
thing for the whole family, with laughs aplenty and big
things blowing up."
   Like the truth.
   Is it worth being outraged over any of this, over what,
after all, could be dismissed as just another silly bit of
summer entertainment? This isn't by any means the first film
to get the Indochina war backward or to belittle American
sacrifice. Yet this one, more than the others, lapses from
cinematic absurdity into political obscenity. And this one,
because it focuses on a part of that war that is largely
relegated to historical footnotes, threatens to become, for
all too many Americans, the pop-historical memory of this
conflict.
   The association of Air America veterans attempted, during
the three years this movie was in planning and production, to
reach the producers and plead the case for some minimal tilt
toward historical accuracy and decency to its dead. All to no
avail. So the veterans are left to protest to the few who
will listen that this film "is generally and specifically not
true to the pilots and crews, the customers, the events, the
mission, the results, the policies, and the raison d'etre of
Air America. Not since the era of Ms. Fonda have individuals
such as the makers of this film expressed so publicly their
disgust and dislike for a group of American servicemen. It is
a shame."
   The rest of us are left with the prospect of Messrs.
Melnick and Eskow embarking on a sequel a few years hence.
This one presumably will be about corrupt warmongers at the
Pentagon in cahoots with Zionist racketeers, sending 50,000
drug dealing GIs to the Middle East to launch a vicious war
of aggression against Saddam Hussein and his groovy little
guys.

   More than six moons have passed since the current occupant
took over this space. Shall we pause as summer's sun wanes?
Moving from subject to subject weekly has left some untied
ends.
   Take Motorola Inc.'s ambitious drug-testing policy,
discussed here a couple of months ago. The company hasn't
backed off from its intended Jan. 1 start-up, but a few
employees called to say that support is far from the 80%
reported here. In Austin, Texas, some Motorolans have teamed
up with counterparts from Texas Instruments, the other major
U.S. employer to urine-test all workers, to lobby the City
Council to prohibit the policy there. About 7,000 work for
the two companies in that liberal city. So far, however, the
councilman sponsoring the ban has yet to line up a majority
to pass it. Now it isn't expected to make the council agenda
until at least October. Meanwhile, fickle public opinion
seems to have downgraded drugs a few notches on the crisis
meter, as old favorites war and unemployment stage a
comeback.

   Franklin Savings Association of Kansas still is in federal
conservatorship, awaiting a court ruling after a hearing in
July. The once-burgeoning thrift was taken over by regulators
on Feb. 16 when they alleged that its sophisticated hedge
strategy was masking insolvency. John Scowcroft, the
36-year-old University of Chicago "quant" who was
second-in-command of the brash institution, says he hopes to
be back in the saddle along with Chairman Ernest Fleischer
when a federal district judge rules shortly. Meanwhile, the
holding company's been paying him enough to get by, not the
$524,000 (half in stock) he made in 1989. And the type of
mortgage-backed securities that Franklin relied on, called
REMICS, have shinnied in the volatile investment climate of
recent weeks.
   Other financial institutions whose leaders have graced
this space have had a similar rocky flight. About the time
two executives of Chicago's Continental Bank were quoted here
saying their high-leverage transaction financing was right
for the times, Forbes magazine reported it was the wrong
strategy. Continental had a fit, but so far, Forbes is more
right. And Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles, which
continues to creep up on J.P. Morgan for the No. 4 slot among
U.S. banks (it hasn't made it yet, despite our premature
crowning), is exasperatingly looking for a way to put some
pounds on its withering stock price. The Southern California
real-estate market may have to show some muscle in support of
the aggressive home lender.
   The Golden State got in training for the Iraqi oil scare
by raising its gasoline tax, in spite of all good advice to
the contrary here. It also voted narrowly to build every rail
line in conception, again without our concurrence. In mute
accord with the libertarian admonition to be glad you don't
get the government you pay for, however, officials recently
cautioned that the transit projects can't possibly proceed as
quickly as backers planned. Surprise]
   Gov. George Deukmejian's administration also seems to have
given up an effort to bridge deep political chasms and impose
a worker health-insurance requirement on California
employers. A bruising budget battle may have convinced
everybody that no money is in the till for ambitious
undertakings. With luck, the new governor (and old
Legislature, probably) will face a similar triage situation
come 1991.
   Over in southern Nevada, the gaming and construction boom
continues, with only a few busted hands. Efforts to lure
industry to Las Vegas continue uneventfully apace, but a
November ballot initiative to impose a state business tax
would "instantly destroy" the state's economy, Democrat Gov.
Bob Miller says. A less-onerous payroll tax is being designed
by the corporatists to fund schools for all the new
residents.
   America West Airlines will not have to make good on an
implied threat to move its home base to Las Vegas or
somewhere else, because the city of Phoenix obligated itself
for bonds to build a new maintenance facility for the carrier
at its birthplace, Sky Harbor Airport.
   North as the spotted owl flies, opposing sides remained at
loggerheads over timber exports. Sure enough, the
nature-at-any-price lobby went after wood sales to Japan from
private lands as soon as they succeeded in cordoning off
state acreage. The saving grace for employment in the
Northwest may be the enterprising spirit that the region's
many newcomers bring with them.
   In Portland, Ore., a setback was suffered by opponents of
throwaway diapers. Gary Hansen, the trash-board member whose
diaper (of choice)-abatement scheme we spotlighted in the
spring, was the bridesmaid in his bid for a Multnomah County
commissioner's seat. No word on whether the ballots were
recycled. California, meanwhile, didn't join in the official
cloth-diaper movement, a rare show of, uh, restraint by the
Legislature.
   Four employees of Gibraltar Savings, the wrecked Southern
California thrift whose perquisite package for top managers
included fully paid boob jobs, sued alleging they weren't
given 60 days' notice of termination when the government put
the mess in someone else's lap. The lucky new owner: Security
Pacific (see above).
   No buyers have been solicited for the nation's public
airports since the prospect was explored here in March.
However, one blot on the privatization record must be noted:
Last winter we touted SuperShuttle, a van service at Los
Angeles airports and a few others in the Sun Belt, as a model
for reducing commuter congestion. Since then, the author of
this column has twice called on the company to get him on his
way. Both times, SuperShuttle's on-time performance made the
airlines look like Swiss watches (thank goodness for the
private auto as a backup). Posing as an unimportant
passenger, the aggrieved party dropped a letter to the
outfit's president. Two months later, he waits for a reply.
   Good news came faster for Dr. James Todd, the acting head
of the American Medical Association when we met up with him
in early April. He is now the fullfledged chief executive of
the AMA. Try as he might wish, though, he's probably too late
with his bid for mandatory health insurance to assist Gov.
Deukmejian in selling the idea to skeptical small-business
people and taxpayers (see above).
   Another progressive notion, that young people should not
be toil-bound, brought Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole's
forces out in the field again in June to find some peach fuzz
manning the pizza oven at 11 p.m. To mix food groups, you may
recall our mentioning the candy man, who solicited kids in
housing projects to go door-to-door selling. He got fined
$9,900 and his appeal is pending.
   A column on the exploding cost of worker-compensation
insurance brought a few enterprising souls out of the
woodwork to pitch their schemes for keeping employees healthy
on the job. But Steven Kelen, the president of a small Los
Angeles manufacturer, California Webbing Industries, was
probably closer to the mark with a cri de coeur about bogus
claims -- back pain, headache, "stress" -- being filed by
workers as they leave his employment in order to secure a
nice severance. And from a workers' comp official in Michigan
came a brag that "by changing the law to deal with specific
problems such as the overuse of the system by retirees, we
have dropped litigated cases from over 44,000 in 1981 to
about 22,000." Go Blue]

   First-Half Net Income Skids
   As Operating Costs Climb

   Scandinavian Airlines System said its group net income
before extraordinary items in the first half of 1990 skidded
to 369 million Swedish kronor ($64.2 million), from 593
million kronor in the year-earlier period. Revenue climbed 9%
to 15.2 billion kronor.
   The company, 50%-owned by the governments of Sweden,
Norway and Denmark, blamed the weaker results on increased
capital and operating costs. SAS said the current
international situation and uncertainty in the oil markets
make it difficult to assess the rest of the year. But the
company said the group's full-year operating results before
depreciation are expected to be in line with comparable 1989
figures. Pretax profit in 1989 plunged 38%, to 1.46 billion
kronor, on revenue of 21.2 billion kronor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the latest six months, the airline's operating profit
fell to 128 million kronor, from 416 million kronor the year
earlier, due to investments in airplanes and computer
reservation systems, an expansion of the route network,
higher fuel prices and industrial disputes.
   The company's hotel subsidiary widened its operating loss

   Decide to Endorse Plan
   To Increase Oil Output

   VIENNA -- World petroleum prices crashed even as OPEC oil
ministers were reaching a tentative agreement on a plan
intended to hold prices down for the duration of the Middle
East crisis.
   Early Tuesday in Austria, 10 of the 13 oil ministers of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided
they would endorse plans by three leading OPEC members to
produce a total of as much as three million barrels a day
beyond their current OPEC quotas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time the ministers were working out that
settlement, oil prices were plummeting as much as $4 a
barrel, largely on the possibility of negotiations in the
standoff in the Persian Gulf. The OPEC talks aimed at
authorizing more oil production added to the selling binge.
   In the sharpest one-day decline in the four years of
records kept by the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
benchmark U.S. crude for October delivery plunged $4 a barrel
to $26.91. Brent crude in the spot market for September
delivery tumbled $3.65 a barrel to $27.55.
   Gasoline for September delivery also fell sharply, by
17.10 cents a gallon to 87.56 cents. Heating oil for the same
month declined 12.86 cents to 78.10 cents a gallon.
   John Lichtblau, chairman of Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation, attributed the price decline to "the realization
that Iraq and the U.S. may try to negotiate their way out of
the crisis rather than go to war with each other."
   Despite yesterday's drop, petroleum prices are still 35%
above the level of Aug. 1, the day before the Mideast crisis
began. OPEC has sought in recent years to stabilize oil
prices and markets after a long series of wild price
gyrations. Many OPEC ministers fear a new round of runaway
prices would trigger recessions in the industrialized
economies and ultimately lead to another big loss in their
share of world energy markets.
   "I would prefer prices of $21 to $25 a barrel for one
year," said Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister
in an interview last night.
   Under the tentative agreement among a majority of OPEC
ministers, Saudi Arabia will be allowed to produce two
million barrels a day more, pushing its total output to 7.4
million barrels a day. Venezuela, which has an OPEC quota of
1.9 million barrels a day, will be cleared to produce as much
as 500,000 a day more -- with most of that attainable within
the next couple of weeks. The United Arab Emirates, which has
a current quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, will be cleared
to go back to its recent rate of two million barrels a day.
   The combined extra output from these three will make up
most of the four million barrel shortage created by the
global embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes.
   It has been clear since early this month that Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates were prepared
to boost output even if OPEC wouldn't "bless" such a move. In
fact, it is understood the three have already begun pumping
more oil, though Venezuela has claimed it has been storing
its extra output.
   But they wanted the full endorsement of OPEC, preferably
via a formal emergency conference. Though chances of that
faded quickly here over the weekend, the tentative agreement
arising from informal talks will satisfy the three nations.
   An Indonesian proposal formed the basis of the tentative
agreement. Under it, the three countries -- which have the
bulk of the current extra capacity within OPEC -- would
increase output for the duration of the crisis, with the
understanding the three countries would return to their
quotas when the crisis ends. In exchange, OPEC would call on
oil-consuming nations to dip into their commercial and
government inventories to help make up the rest of the
shortfall and help take care of anticipated rising demand
later this year. Developing countries, hard hit by escalating
oil prices, would receive priority in the distribution of the
added supplies.
   Ministers are expected to meet later Tuesday to complete
the agreement. Last night, several said they hoped to get an
11th member, Iran, to go along.
   Iran has opposed a production increase at this time, and
yesterday's price drop seemed to help its case. Iran has
argued that world oil supplies still are plentiful despite
the embargo, and that recent price runups reflected
psychological rather than fundamental factors.
   "We oppose an increase in production at this time," said a
senior Iran delegate. "We shouldn't decide on this while
there is so much tension" in world oil markets, he said.
   The two remaining OPEC members, Iraq and Libya, also
oppose any output boosts. The Iraqi oil minister hasn't
appeared for the talks here; there were some reports that the
Libyan minister might show up Tuesday.
   Yesterday's steep price decline "was more abrupt than I
would have imagined," said Tom Burns, manager of economics
for Chevron Corp. But he called the drop an almost inevitable
"clear reaction to the semi-panic buying of the last eight to
10 days which carried prices to above $30 a barrel." The
latest sell-off brings crude down by about $6 a barrel since
Thursday.
   Mr. Burns noted that oil inventories are still high. The
threat of war dictates whether those inventories are
considered a valued cushion or simple surplus, he explained.
"Whether the extra barrels are an overhang or not is in the
eye of the beholder," Mr. Burns said. "It's largely
perception."
   Despite the sharp price decline and the tentative
agreement to boost OPEC output, oil strategists say prices
won't continue to fall sharply. Many consider $25 to $30 a
barrel realistic -- which still would be far above the prices
in the high teens earlier this year.
   "We're not home free yet," said Mr. Lichtblau of the
Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "The extra pricing
reflecting anticipated warfare may have disappeared. But even
if we make up for much of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti shortfall, the
supply situation going into the winter will be precarious."

   THE U.S. EXPELLED Iraqi envoys as Bush voiced pessimism on
"fruitful" talks.
   In response to Iraq's attempt to close the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait, the White House ordered Baghdad to slash its
diplomatic contingent in Washington by two-thirds. While Bush
expressed doubts, he endorsed plans by the U.N.'s chief to
meet Iraq's foreign minister, but the president indicated the
U.S. wants the talks limited to an unconditional Iraqi
pullout from Kuwait. Baghdad, meanwhile, reportedly ordered
at least one captain of an oil tanker not to defy the
international naval blockade of trade with Iraq.

   Komatsu Ltd., Japan's top maker of contruction machines,
said it revised its sales and earnings projections upward for
the fiscal year ending March 31 because of
stronger-than-expected domestic demand.
   Komatsu officials said unconsolidated sales will total
about 690 billion yen ($4.7 billion), up from 660 billion yen
estimated last May, while pretax earnings will reach 50
billion yen, up from an initial 45 billion yen estimate.

<TEXT>
   Profit is now seen at around 21.5 billion yen, only
slightly higher than 21 billion yen in the original
projection.
   Officials said their company is more bullish because of
unexpectedly strong domestic demand for construction and
industrial machinery that they said apparently reflects
sustained economic growth.
   Komatsu expects sales to amount to some 980 billion yen,
up from 950 billion yen estimated in May, while it sees
consolidated pretax and earnings at about 77 billion yen and
35 billion yen, respectively. Its previous projections called
for pretax earnings of 73 billion yen and profit of 34
billion yen.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Stocks Soar 78.71 on Speculation
   Of a Resolution to Mideast Crisis

   NEW YORK -- Speculation about a possible diplomatic
resolution to the Mideast crisis sent stock prices soaring in
the biggest rally this year.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 78.71, or 3.11%, to
2611.63. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange
swamped decliners 1,453 to 256.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Contributing to the gain were a $4 drop in the price of
crude oil to $26.91 for October delivery, sharp rallies in
foreign stock markets and a powerful surge in bond prices,
all of which helped coax investors to continue the
bargain-hunting rally that began Friday. With Friday's
49.50-point gain, the Dow Jones industrials are up 5.2% from
the lowest close of the year of 2483.42 hit last Thursday.
   Yesterday's gain was the fifth-largest for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, in point terms, and the largest since the
88.12 point rebound on October 16, 1989, the session
following last year's "mini-crash."
   Broader indexes also rose sharply: Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index climbed 9.93 to 321.44, the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index rose 5.13 to 176.18 and the Dow
Jones Equity Market Index rose 9.12 to 297.66.
   But despite 2- and 3-point jumps in several big stocks,
the rally lacked stamina. Stocks held to narrow ranges after
a powerful jump on the opening.
   In the first nine minutes of trading, the industrial
average rose 50 points -- prompting the Big Board to put its
rule on stock-index arbitrage transactions into effect.
Friday was the first time the rule took effect during a
rally. In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy or sell stocks
and offset the trade in stock-index futures to lock in slight
price differences between the New York and Chicago markets.
   For the rest of the session, stock buying related to index
arbitrage could be completed only after the shares to be
purchased had gone down in price.
   But by the end of the first half-hour of trading, the Dow
Jones industrials were up nearly 81 points as bargain-hunters
and traders looking to cover short positions poured into the
market.
   Several big stocks, such as International Business
Machines and Procter &amp; Gamble, opened late due to delays
caused by too many buy orders. By noon volume on the New York
Stock Exchange was a hefty 98,760,000.
   But trading slowed in the afternoon, with a total of
160,150,000 shares changing hands during the day. That
compares with 199,040,000 shares Friday.
   "It was a typical bear-market, low-volume rally," said Leo
Grohowski, director of equity investment at Marinvest. Blue
chip consumer and growth stocks dominated most of the
activity. Among the most active shares were Philip Morris,
Wal Mart Stores, General Electric and Boeing. More than 2
million shares changed hands in each of those stocks.
   "There is a sense of gradualism on the buy side," said
John B. Burke, an independent trader at the Big Board. "Many
people already own these stocks" at higher prices.
   Signs of easing tensions in the Persian Gulf caused
investors to consider how the stock market will respond to
sluggish U.S. economic growth. Said Chung Lew, head trader at
Kleinwort Benson North America Inc.: "It would be foolish to
think that all of the market's {fall} was due to the Middle
East" tension.
   IBM soared 4 to 104 3/8 in Big Board composite trading of
1.6 million shares, while Procter &amp; Gamble tacked on 4 to 75
7/8 and Union Carbide advanced 1 1/4 to 16 7/8. Other issues
subject to opening delays included such institutional
favorites as Toys "R" Us, which went up 1 1/4 to 26 1/4 on
1.4 million shares; PepsiCo, which rallied 3 1/4 to 73; and
Compaq Computer, which rose 1 5/8 to 49 3/8.
   Among the 30 Dow Jones industrials, only Primerica failed
to close higher, ending unchanged at 28 1/2. Meanwhile,
General Motors rose 1 3/4 to 39 1/8, Philip Morris rose 1 1/2
to 44 3/4, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph climbed 1 1/4 to 33
1/8 and Merck soared 3 3/8 to 81.
   Despite all the buying, several analysts said they weren't
expecting to see the market make a quick recovery from its
steep drop since late July, in which the industrial average
tumbled more than 500 points after flirting with 3000.
   "This snapback rally is very much akin to {what happened}
the last time we went down 500 points" -- namely in October
1987, said Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis
group at Salomon Brothers.
   Before the market can stage a sustained advance, Mr.
Spence said, "a bottoming process" will be needed that may
take a month or two to be completed. "We've done a tremendous
amount of technical damage," he said.
   Energy stocks generally held firm despite the steep drop
in oil prices, in which October crude-oil futures fell $4 a
barrel in New York trading and contracts for later months
dropped their daily price limits.
   Exxon gained 3/4 to 49 5/8, Chevron added 1/8 to 74 3/8,
Texaco went up 1/2 to 61, Mobil  rose 1/4 to 62 1/4 and Amoco
rose 3/8 to 54 3/8. In the oil-services sector, Halliburton
went up 1/8 to 52 1/8 and Schlumberger finished unchanged at
62.
   But precious-metals issues plunged along with the price of
gold, in a reversal of the "haven" buying tied to the Middle
East crisis which had boosted the issues earlier in the
month. October gold futures skidded $26.80 an ounce, to
$391.30, in New York trading
   American Barrick Resources skidded 1 7/8 to 20 1/4 as 1.4
million shares were traded. Among other gold stocks, Home
stake Mining dipped 2 1/8 to 19 3/4, Placer Dome slid 1 to 17
3/8, Hecla Mining fell 3/4 to 11 1/8, Battle Mountain Gold
lost 5/8 to 10 1/2 and ASA slid 4 3/8 to 48 1/8.
   The Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped 38.32 to
908.03, scoring its fifth-largest point gain on record.
Airfreight and railroad issues paced the move; Airborne
Freight jumped 3 3/8 to 21 1/2 and Federal Express rose 2 5/8
to 39 1/2, while Norfolk Southern advanced 2 5/8 to 39 1/2
and Consolidated Rail added 2 3/8 to 36 7/8.
   USAir Group climbed 1 7/8 to 16 1/4 as the drop in oil
prices, which could eventually mean lower jet-fuel costs,
lifted the airline sector. UAL, the parent of United
Airlines, rallied 3 1/4 to 96 3/4; AMR, which owns American
Airlines, advanced 2 1/2 to 47; and Delta Air Lines rose 2
1/8 to 58 1/8.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 4.44
to 320.73. Volume totaled 17,730,000 shares.

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Exxon Co. USA will spend $2.8
million to improve environmental safeguards at a refinery to
settle a lawsuit over the fouling of a New Jersey waterway,
officials said.
   Exxon Co. USA, based in Houston, is a division of New
York-based Exxon Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The settlement resolves allegations that Exxon violated
terms of its state waste-water discharge permit at its
refinery in Bayonne, which discharges into the Kill Van Kull
waterway.
   The New Jersey Public Interest Research Group and Friends
of the Earth filed the lawsuit in May 1989 in federal court
in Newark under the Clean Water Act, which provides for such
citizen action.
   Exxon, without any finding or admission of liability,
agreed to invest $2.8 million for "environmentally beneficial
mitigation projects" at the Bayonne facility, the public
interest group said.
   An Exxon spokesman said the agreement "demonstrates
Exxon's commitment not only to comply fully with all permit
requirements but also to take further responsible steps
designed to reduce or eliminate waste materials at their
source."

   Cineplex Odeon Lures Investors Amid Signs
   Of Rebound, but Firm Has Long Way to Go

   TORONTO -- A glimmer of a turnaround is sparking
investors' interest in Cineplex Odeon, the beleaguered
movie-theater chain.
   Even its diehard fans expect no near-term miracles from
this battered stock. New management is shouldering heavy
debts left behind by Cineplex's founder and former chairman
Garth Drabinsky, who was forced out in December. But as the
new team goes about its task of slashing debt, paring
expenses and selling assets, a few investors are warming to
the recession-defying potential of the company's line of
business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "People are always going to go to movies and buy popcorn
and sodas," says Henry Bonis, a New York businessman and
Cineplex investor.
   Mr. Bonis says he owns about 50,000 shares, many of them
acquired in recent weeks. "I've seen their theaters, I have
confidence in the new management," he says. "It's going to
take a year or so, but they'll get back in the black."
   Cineplex closed yesterday at $2.50 a share, unchanged, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Although many securities analysts still don't recommend
buying Cineplex shares, some, such as Lisbeth Barron, vice
president of S.G. Warburg, say they are contemplating
changing their recommendations to "hold" from sell. "This is
a turnaround that's beginning to work," Ms. Barron says. "It
just remains to be seen whether they can keep it going."
   Investors give good reviews to the company's first-half
operating performance. More people are walking through the
doors of Cineplex movie theaters, they say, pointing to a
15.7% increase from a year earlier in first-half admissions
revenue. And Cineplex far outstripped the industry average
increase of only 0.4% for such revenue in the period.
   "If somebody has the patience to wait it out, he could
make a bundle on this stock," said Ernest Camponegro, a New
York investment executive who has bought Cineplex stock in
recent weeks and recommends it to his clients. "How many
stocks are there with this kind of visibility, with a
business that's a real cash cow, backed by major
shareholders, that trades at $3?"
   Reflecting its former expansion spree, Cineplex had $479.4
million in long-term debt at midyear, down from $578.1
million a year earlier. Besides using $75 million from asset
sales to cut debt, Cineplex's president and chief executive,
Allen Karp, is hoping to refinance, whittling away at
interest expense. "We're looking at every way of doing this,"
he said. "We're in a process that could take several months."
   There's little to cheer investors in the company's
first-half net loss, which widened to the equivalent of $1.06
a share from 59 cents a share a year earlier. But in terms of
cash flow, Cineplex had a net outflow of $13.2 million in the
six months, narrower than the $30.6 million outflow a year
earlier. After cutting general and administrative expenses
28% in the second quarter to $5.9 million, Mr. Karp expects
to trim perhaps 10% to 20% more in the second half.
   Investors are heartened by the presence of Cineplex's two
controlling shareholders, MCA of Universal City, Calif., and
interests associated with Montreal financier Charles
Bronfman. If Cineplex fails to meet an agreement with its
banks to raise $200 million through asset sales by year-end,
MCA and Mr. Bronfman's Claridge Investments have agreed to
chip in $50 million each to help cut debt; Cineplex
presumably could turn to them for additional support if
necessary.
   Cineplex's theaters are in prime locations, such as New
York, and as a result the company may have bargaining clout
with studios over rising costs. A growing supply of new
films, including about seven releases from Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Co., will help boost admissions and concession
revenue in the second half, Cineplex says.
   But this month saw the collapse of a $31.8 million plan to
sell some of Cineplex's U.S. theaters to Plitt Amusement Co.,
Los Angeles. Bankers are believed to have been reluctant to
finance an acquisition valued at eight times cash flow. Mr.
Karp insists: "We will not dispose of assets except at fair
value. We're taking a firm stand and I have the strength of
our shareholders {MCA and Claridge} behind me on this." He
says a sale might still be completed, possibly at a lower
price and with Cineplex retaining some of the theaters.
   The Plitt affair suggests how hard it is to sell assets
when the movie industry is already what industry people call
"overscreened." As Mr. Karp puts it, "We couldn't have picked
a worse time to restructure the company, from an industry
standpoint." Cineplex may be "out of the woods," but the
executive says he doesn't think "people should be throwing
parties quite yet."

   Tokyo's Nikkei index posted a strong gain on low volume
Monday, deferring at least for one day worries about the
Middle East crisis, traders said.
   Prices were higher on most other world stock exchanges.
London and Hong Kong markets were closed for holidays.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Amid an absence of hard news of fighting in the Gulf over
the weekend and Monday, a firmer yen and better bond market
provided the justification for buying at Tokyo, which was
driven by the "Big Four" brokerage firms and by major foreign
house program trading, traders said.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 976 points
at 25141.76. The index rose 428.13 points Friday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index surged 518.52 points to
close the morning session at 25660.28.
   Observers cautioned that the rise may be short term,
however, adding that any outbreak of fighting in the Middle
East would spur "Round Two" of the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
unwinding.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 330 million
shares, off from 546.1 million Friday.
   Winners outpaced losers, 827 to 163, while 86 issues
remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which rose 16.47 points Friday, jumped
58.87 points, or 3.19%, to 1904.59.
   The second section index, which lost 79.41 points Friday,
gained 49.05 points, or 1.40%, to close at 3603.79. Volume in
the second section totaled seven million shares, down from
10.3 million Friday.
   "The market's taking some reassurance from the impression
that there's no war to be fought (in the Middle East), at
least not for today," one Big Four trader said.
   "It's just a technical bounce," another participant said.
"The market has realized that it oversold on the news" over
the past three weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The dollar was sold off from early morning as a result of
there being no actual fighting in the Gulf, leaving the yen
to appreciate and Japanese government bond prices to improve
markedly, traders said.
   Foreign brokerage houses moved in, buying from 1,000
shares to 15,000 shares apiece on the Nikkei index issues
from early morning.
   Although many traders had predicted a much more modest
gain for the Nikkei Monday, buying by the Big Four firms
fueled strong gains in the index, particularly during the
last 30 minutes of trading.
   Nomura, Yamaichi, Daiwa and Nikko Securities combined made
up about half of the day's volume, according to one Big Four
trader.
   Opinions varied on factors behind the buying by the top
four Japanese firms, but one trader noted the easing of "the
30% rule" in particular.
   Thursday, the firms were made aware that the 30% rule --
known as administrative guidance from the Ministry of Finance
saying that no firm can trade more than 30% of any particular
issue, in order to prevent stock-price manipulation -- had
been temporarily abandoned, the trader said.
   In other words, traders said, the Finance Ministry, which
only arbitrarily supervises the 30% rule to begin with,
indicated that it would view the firms' actions with a broad
mind. On the other hand, if the freedom is abused, the
ministry probably will reverse course, traders added.
   The ministry's move came at the same time that the Tokyo
Stock Exchange Thursday decided to make trading changes,
particularly on futures and options trading, in order to try
to curb arbitrage activity. Arbitrage selling has been
singled out as a major contributor to the market's repeated
plunges, although arbitrage buying hasn't yet been cited for
contributing to recoveries.
   The buying by the Big Four Monday ignited broad-based
buying throughout the day, including arbitrage buying all day
and straight index buying on futures in the afternoon,
traders said.
   Talk in the market was that Nomura Securities, which just
switched its head office into a new building, was receiving
congratulatory orders for its new trading floor and has
started up a promotion campaign, initiating renewed buying.
Other talk was that new investment trust funds were being set
up to enter the market.
   As Nomura has been a heavy seller over the past few weeks
since the Iraqi invasion, its cash position is now much
higher, traders suggested.
   Blue-chip stocks led the rally Monday, with Sony rising
260 yen ($1.78) to 7,360 yen, TDK up 200 to 6,060 and Kyocera
up 400 to 7,600.
   Hitachi rose 70 to 1,380, while Pioneer gained 250 to
5,200.
   Construction stocks were also higher, with Taisei Corp. up
51 to 1,030 and Kajima gaining 60 to 1,450.
   Real estate shares such as Mitsui Real, up 70 to 1,410,
and Mitsubishi Estate, up 70 to 1,330, also benefited from
the rebound.
   Shipbuilders, steel makers and financial shares also rose.
IHI was up 30 to 740, Mitsubishi Heavy rose 25 to 814,
Kawasaki Steel gained 10 to 490, NKK rose 13 to 506 and
Nomura Securities gained 160 to 1,770.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Milan, Zurich, Amsterdam, Brussels, Madrid and Stockholm.
South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Wellington, Manila,
Taipei, Seoul and Singapore.

   AUBURN, Ky. -- Retired high school teacher Helen Raby is a
Democrat. But she says she's backing Republican Sen. Mitch
McConnell for re-election because he wrote her a letter that
"sounded real personal."
   The typewritten missive expressed sympathy for the plight
of her husband, George, who is confined without insurance to
a nursing home near here. "It really appealed to me," she
says.
   Chalk up another vote to the power of incumbency. Though
Mrs. Raby is convinced the letter came from Mr. McConnell's
own hand, it was in fact drafted by his staff, and taxpayers
paid the postage. In hopes of winning converts like Mrs.
Raby, Sen. McConnell has spent nearly $2 million of
taxpayers' money over the past six years mailing letters all
over Kentucky.
   In terms of lawmaking, Mitch McConnell doesn't have much
to show for his six years in the Senate. By his own
admission, his chief legislative concerns are eclectic, and
have so far been unsuccessful. One is to limit plaintiffs'
rights in injury suits. Another is the GOP effort to alter
campaign-finance laws -- an enterprise Democrats disparage as
something less than reform.
   But in terms of using his office to cement the loyalties
of home-state voters and shake the political money tree, the
48-year-old senator is an acknowledged master. He has used
visits by high government officials, from the agriculture
secretary to the president, to attract campaign
contributions. He has dipped deeply into the pockets of
political-action committees, which strongly favor incumbents
over challengers. And he has kept his exposure in the state
high by meeting with constituents almost every weekend.
   Though he plays down many of these benefits, he
acknowledges: "I'd rather be an incumbent than a challenger."
   The result is likely to be good news for the senator come
November. Though Kentucky is normally an inhospitable state
for Republicans, Sen. McConnell is currently favored to win a
second term this year over his Democratic opponent, former
Louisville Mayor Harvey Sloane, who hopes to make an issue of
the senator's use of his incumbency.
   "Politicians like McConnell are just looking after their
own self-interests as opposed to the public interest,"
contends Dr. Sloane, who is a physician. "I'm glad he's
exploited his office to such an extent. It makes him
vulnerable."
   But making that charge stick will be difficult --
ironically, because Mr. McConnell has been so skillful in
using his office to raise campaign funds. He is assured that
his own message of how he has looked out for Kentucky's
interest will be all over the airwaves.
   His first commercial this year was almost an unintentional
parody of the old Washington adage that there are two kinds
of lawmakers, workhorses and show horses. The TV ad, run
during this year's Kentucky Derby, brags that he prevented
the shutdown of his state's show-horse industry after a judge
raised questions about how the horses were being treated.
   His war chest also helps him make up for any legislative
shortcomings through sometimes questionable claims. One
commercial casts Sen. McConnell's as the deciding vote to
override the veto of a 1987 highway-construction bill that
President Reagan considered pork barrel, but which he asserts
was important to Kentucky. In fact, the deciding vote was
cast in a dramatic and widely reported fashion by Sen. Terry
Sanford (D., N.C.), who changed sides after an initial roll
call upheld the veto.
   Sen. McConnell learned many of the tricks of incumbency at
the expense of his predecessor. In 1984, he was the upset
winner over Democratic Sen. Walter Huddleston, an entrenched
but complacent incumbent who failed to persuade voters he was
anything but the "shadow senator" Mr. McConnell accused him
of being. The McConnell campaign ran commercials depicting
bloodhounds in search of the frequently absent senator.
   Once in office, Mr. McConnell took advantage of his new
position to spend almost every weekend for the next two years
holding town-hall meetings throughout the state -- more than
120 in all. He also chose wisely in coming out early for
then-Vice President George Bush for the 1988 GOP presidential
nomination, a gutsy move considering that Mr. Bush's chief
opponent was the Senate's Republican leader, Robert Dole of
Kansas. The risk paid off big when Mr. Bush chose to hold his
first fundraiser as president in Kentucky, collecting a state
record $1.3 million for Sen. McConnell's re-election bid.
   Sen. McConnell continues to play an insider's game by
bringing a parade of cabinet secretaries to Kentucky to make
speeches on his behalf, hold out the hope of special favors
and then wring campaign dollars from the starry-eyed locals.
So far, the secretaries of energy, agriculture, labor and
transportation have made the circuit.
   The senator makes much of these ties to top-ranking
Republicans and the president, and the voters know it. "He
and the president are like this," says Auburn farmer Robert
Earl Chyle, crossing his fingers.
   "The relationship does make a difference for Kentucky,"
Mr. McConnell asserts.
   Though Sen. McConnell is fighting to eliminate PACs as
part of campaign-finance revision, he is unembarrassed about
taking their money in the meantime. Over the years, he has
collected at least $1.1 million of PAC contributions, making
him one of 78 Senate million-dollar PAC recipients.
   Even the standoff with Iraq gives him a chance to cloak
himself in the establishment. During a tour of Dollar General
Corp. headquarters near here, he hugs the mother of a
serviceman dispatched to active duty in the Middle East, and
then promotes his reassurances during a radio interview soon
thereafter. "Our thoughts and prayers should be with the
Moore family," he says.
   At the Southern Kentucky Fair in Bowling Green, he and his
entourage attach "Stick with Mitch" stickers onto almost
every passer-by. One who stops to shake the senator's hand is
Larry Cole, a meter reader and owner of five show horses that
now compete thanks to the senator. "He sure has my vote," he
says.

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices soared yesterday in reaction to a
hefty decline in the price of oil and a sense that tensions
in the Mideast are abating.
   In active trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
crude oil futures for October delivery fell $4 a barrel to
close at $26.91.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even before oil prices started to fall, government bond
prices were rising around the world on relief that officials
in both the U.S. and Iraq have signaled a willingness to
negotiate an end to the Mideast crisis.
   Prices of long-term Treasury bonds climbed more than 1 1/2
points for a gain of more than $15 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, eased to 8.99% from 9.15% on Friday.
   Tax-exempt municipal bonds, high-grade corporates and
mortgage-backed bonds followed the Treasury market, posting
moderate to big gains. Most junk bonds, which were boosted by
rising stock prices, ended between 3/4 and one point higher
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 78.71 points to
end at 2,611.63. Junk bonds are speculative-grade bonds that
carry low ratings or no ratings at all.
   But bond market activity was very light yesterday. Traders
said that yesterday's rally may have been exaggerated by a
large number of speculators who were buying notes and bonds
to cover short sale positions. In a short sale, investors
sell borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by
replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities.
Essentially, these traders were betting that prices would
fall.
   "A lot of people had gone short into the weekend expecting
a major confrontation in the Middle East," said Elizabeth
Reiners, money-market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
But after nothing happened in the Middle East, "people who
were short had to come into the market and cover their
positions," she said.
   Fear that political turmoil in the Persian Gulf would
disrupt oil supplies and lead to spiraling prices and
inflation has haunted the bond market for weeks. Late last
week, war seemed imminent when Iraqi troops surrounded
foreign embassies in Kuwait and demanded that foreign
diplomats abandon the embassies.
   While yesterday's rally was welcomed by investors,
analysts warned that the market remains vulnerable to both
political and economic news.
   It was a busy day for new issues in the mortgage-backed
securities market. More than $3 billion of new real estate
mortgage investment conduit securities were offered.
   Yesterday's offerings included the first Remic ever
collateralized with Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. new Gold
PCs, or participation certificates.
   The $1 billion offering, through Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., is collateralized with Freddie Mac Gold 9.5%
participation certificates.
   Gold PCs reduce the delay between the time homeowners make
their monthly payments and the time investors get their
payments from Freddie Mac to 45 days from 75 days on the
regular PCs. By October, all new PCs issued by Freddie Mac
will be Gold PCs.
   The remaining three offerings, all Federal National
Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Remics, were priced late
last week and unveiled publicly yesterday.
   The issues were a $1 billion offering in Series 1990-119
in 15 classes through Goldman, Sachs & Co.; a $563 million
issue in Series 1990-117 in 10 classes through Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. and a $500 million offering in Series 1990-120
in 12 classes through PaineWebber Inc., backed by Fannie Mae
9% securities.
   Heavy new Remic issuance had been expected. Last week, the
mortgage-securities market outperformed the Treasury market,
as dealers sought collateral for the new Remic offerings. The
incentive to issue Remics increases when the yield curve
steepens, as it did last week.
   The bulk of Remic offerings are short-dated instruments,
so it becomes more attractive to underwrite these issues at
times when short-term rates are falling faster than long-term
yields.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were sharply higher in
light trading activity.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 97 13/32 to
yield 8.99% compared with 95 26/32 to yield 9.15% on Friday.
The latest ten-year notes ended at a price of 99 4/32 to
yield 8.86% compared with 98 2/32 to yield 9.03%. Two-year
notes ended at 99 21/32 to yield 8.17% compared with 99 15/32
to yield 8.28%.
   The Treasury sold a total of $18.49 billion of short-term
bills yesterday at its regular weekly auction.
   The average discount rate on the three-month bills was
7.49%, down from last week's auction when the average rate
was 7.55%. But the rate for six-month bills at yesterday's
auction was 7.48%, which was slightly higher than the 7.45%
rate at last week's auction.
   Today, the Treasury is scheduled to sell $11.5 billion of
two-year notes and tomorrow the Treasury will sell $8.5
billion of five-year notes. In when-issued trading activity,
the yield on the two-year notes was quoted late at 8.16%
while the yield on five-year notes was quoted at 8.54%. Here
are details of yesterday's short-term bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated Aug. 30. The 13-week bills mature
Nov. 29, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Feb. 28, 1991.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds took their cue from the stock market and
advanced as some shortcovering by dealers pushed the market
higher.
   "I think the dealers took the market down and the dealers
are taking the market back up," said David Briggs, senior
trader at Federated Investors Corp., which manages mutual
funds. "We are just basically getting whipsawed by dealers."
   Junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc., which lost ground most of
last week, staged a partial rebound.
   RJR Nabisco's 17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, rose 1 1/2 points to 108 3/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange. Pay-in-kind issues pay interest in the form
of additional securities. The company's 17% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended 1 3/4 points
higher at 83 3/8.
   Deferred-interest bonds, which are highly volatile, were
the biggest gainers yesterday.
   American Standard Inc.'s zero-coupon subordinated
debentures gained two points to close at 52 while RJR's
zero-coupon subordinated debentures added 1 3/4 points to end
at 46 1/4.
   Other gainers: Duracell Holdings Corp.'s 13.125% senior
subordinated notes chalked up one point to end at 101 while
Kroger Co.'s 12.875% senior subordinated debentures advanced
one point to close at 101.
   These bonds, which rank in the top tier among junk bonds,
were relatively unscathed during last week's bout of selling.
However, market participants said that when the broader
market appeared to firm, investors started scrambling to buy
these better-quality names at Friday's prices.
   Meanwhile, junk bonds of Stone Container Corp. shrugged
off news of a credit-rating downgrade from Moody's Investors
Service Inc. Stone Container's 11.50% senior subordinated
notes finished up 3/4 point at 84 3/4 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Moody's said it downgraded the rating of Stone Container's
$350 million issue of 13.625% subordinated notes, due 1995,
to single-B-3 from Ba-3; and the rating of the company's $200
million issue of 11.5% senior subordinated notes to
single-B-2 from Ba-3.
   In addition, the credit agency said it assigned a
single-B-1 rating to the company's forthcoming junk-bond
issue.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds also posted gains, but lagged the U.S.
Treasury market. Intermediate-term corporate bonds gained 1/2
point while long-term corporate bonds advanced 3/4 point, on
average.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   The decline in oil prices helped municipal securities,
which closed as much as 1 3/8 points higher.
   Among actively traded issues, the price of the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 climbed 1 3/8
points to 97 1/8.
   Despite the price increases, activity during the session
was dominated by dealers and short sellers covering their
positions.
   Traders remain skeptical about whether the market will
climb much higher this week, focusing on the Mideast
situation.
   "I think people would just rather wait and just do nothing
because one change in circumstance in the Middle East could
turn things around," said one trader.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   In the secondary market for mortgage securities, prices
rose on the drop in oil prices.
   Among actively traded issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues for September delivery were up 23/32
at 98 6/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues for
September delivery were up 22/32 at 97 25/32, and Federal
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were up 22/32 at 98
10/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds

   Prices of most foreign government bonds ended higher
yesterday, although dealers in many markets said that
yesterday's rebound was not the start of a new bullish trend.
   In Japan, bonds were helped by a stronger yen, talk that a
large securities firm was supporting the market and
aggressive intervention in the money market by the Bank of
Japan.
   Through several operations, the central bank added 1.4
trillion yen ($9.57 billion) to the market. Before the
central bank intervention, the overnight unsecured call money
rate was bid as high as 7 24/32%, but after the operations
the rate dropped to 7 18/32%.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year bonds was quoted at
82.64, up 0.37 point, to yield 8.2%. (Foreign bond yields are
quoted here in local terms and therefore differ somewhat from
yields calculated for these markets by U.S. investment firms,
which tend to use the semiannual compound measure to compare
yields across markets. Using that method, the yield on
Japan's No. 119 bond ended at 7.53%, according to Salomon
Brothers Inc.)
   In Paris, French government bonds gained about one point,
with the market taking some encouragement from easing tension
in the Middle East. Dealers said short-covering by
professionals also lifted prices, especially at the longer
end.
   "We get to the point that the French market starts to look
cheap vis-a-vis the German market, and that always brings in
some buyers," said a Paris-based dealer.
   Among French Treasurys, the 8.5% bond due 2000 ended 0.81
point higher at 89.53 to yield 10.26%.
   The French rally helped fuel a 0.55 point rise in West
German bond prices.
   But aside from a flurry of buying out of the Far East,
turnover was light, dealers say. Activity also was curtailed
by a bank holiday in London, which closed the London
International Financial Futures Exchange and the Bund future
contract.

   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Oracle Systems Corp. said its
review of certain revenue transactions has not resulted in
any restatement of either revenue or net income for its year
ended May 31.
   However, the company said the review has resulted in
restatements of the quarterly results for the fiscal year. It
said the changes result from "the company's determination
that a portion of revenue and related sales expenses reported
in some fiscal quarters should have been recognized as
revenue and expenses in different periods."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The announcement by Oracle, which makes computer software,
came after the close of trading yesterday. A spokeswoman
declined to elaborate on the terse prepared statement.
   Oracle posted record revenue of $970.8 million and net of
$117.4 million, or 86 cents a share, for fiscal 1990. But in
recent months, the company's marketplace success -- it sells
popular database software for minicomputers and mainframes --
has been partly obscured by concern over its accounting
methods.
   In March, the company cited an accounting glitch as the
reason for lower-than-expected revenue in its third quarter.
The day after the announcement, the company's stock fell 31%
on record-breaking volume for a single over-the-counter
issue.
   As restated, Oracle's revenue was unchanged for its first
quarter. Revenue totaled $209 million for the second quarter,
compared with $224.6 million originally reported. For the
third quarter, revenue totaled $245.6 million, compared with
$236.4 million reported. For the fourth quarter, revenue
totaled $340.8 million, compared with $334.4 million.
   As restated, Oracle's net was unchanged for the first
quarter. For the second quarter, net was $19 million,
compared with $28.5 million reported. For the third quarter,
net was $29.8 million, compared with $24.3 million. For the
fourth quarter, net was $56.8 million, compared with $52.9
million.

   Lefty Collegian Prevails in Amateur Final

   Cherry Hills, Colo. -- Two former San Diego high school
teammates had at it in the finals of the men's U.S. Amateur
Golf Championship here Sunday, and it was a tossup which had
come farthest to keep the date.
   The one who lost was Manny Zerman, a dark-haired,
broad-shouldered young man of 20 who's a sophomore at the U.
of Arizona. He's a South African who came to San Diego to
live three years ago, so his trip covered several thousand
miles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Phil Mickelson, the winner, made a physically shorter but
more unusual journey: to the "wrong" side of the ball. The
20-year-old Arizona State junior is a natural righthander but
took to whacking golf balls lefty as a toddler and stayed
that way. He's the first of that persuasion to win a
tournament that's been contested 90 times since 1895.
   "My dad tried to change me to righthanded when I was about
two years old but I wouldn't let him. I guess two-year-olds
are tough to convince," says the psychology major. "I'm told
that only about 7% of the people who play golf play lefty,
but I never thought it was a handicap."
   It was no handicap to Mickelson over a week in which he
played 150 holes through a 36-hole medal qualifier and six
rounds of match play. He was 13 under par for that stretch,
all but one qualifying round of which was played at the
7,110-yard, par 71 Cherry Hills Country Club. He was four
under for the 32 holes of the final, which he won, 5 and 4.
That's match play for five holes up with four to go.
   "He hits the ball great, and nothing rattles him," said
Zerman of the guy he's played "a couple hundred" times in
practice since they met as seniors at U. of San Diego High.
Sunday's was the first formal match between the two, but
Mickelson said the others also were important. "They were for
our own cash," he explained.
   It was appropriate that two collegians met in the final,
because the "kids" had all the best of it in the rest of this
fest. Of the eight quarterfinalists, only two could be called
workingmen. And that classification might be disputed by
some, because both earn their living at golf.
   As luck would have it, they met in one quarterfinal
Saturday morning, and 38-year-old David Eger, an
administrator with the PGA tour, edged Mike Brannan, 34, a
golf club manufacturer's rep, 2 and 1. Then Eger fell to
Mickelson, 5 and 3, in Saturday's afternoon round.
   Among the earlier victims here were three tourney
ex-champs. Buddy Alexander, the 1986 winner, failed to
qualify; insurance man Jay Sigel (1982 and '83) lost in the
second round; and Chris Patton, the defending titlist, was a
first-round victim, to Southern Cal soph Chris Zambri, by the
lopsided margin of 8 and 6.
   Patton, the rotund ex-Clemson U. player whose victory last
year at the old Merion course near Philadelphia gave the
amateur game a needed shot of pizzazz, remarked that he'd be
turning pro now, in part because his car was falling apart
and he needed a new one.
   In Patton's absence, the favorite's role fell to
Mickelson, who has accomplished a lot, linkswise, in his
brief life. He's won the past two NCAA championships, played
in the Walker Cup against the British, and was the low
amateur in June's U.S. Open. His 72-hole score of even-par
288 there was the best effort by a non-pro, relative to par,
since Jack Nicklaus finished two under, and two strokes
behind winner Arnold Palmer, in 1960, here at Cherry Hills.
   Mickelson is a tall lad with a lusty, upright swing and an
exaggeratedly stiff-wristed putting stroke. He's a long
hitter by any standard, and attacks a course with
single-minded aggression. "I never lay up on a hole. The
closer you get to the pin, the better chance you have for a
birdie," says he.
   Nothing better illustrated this philosophy than his play
of the 17th hole here. It's a 555-yard par five whose
moat-protected green precludes runups. Nonetheless, Mickelson
invariably went for it in two through the light Colorado air,
and his birdies there were instrumental in his closest wins,
a 1-up, third-round squeaker over Mike Swingle of the U. of
Washington, and a quarterfinal triumph, by the same score,
over Bob May of Oklahoma State.
   Zerman is a more compact type whose radar iron shots
settled each of his matches save the final before the 18th
hole. A much-traveled player whose titles include the 1986
Chilean Amateur, he was born in Durban, South Africa. He came
to San Diego in 1985 to play in an international junior
tourney, living with a family named Hogue. Two trips later he
decided to stay, and has been legally adopted by the Hogues.
He plans to apply for U.S. citizenship.
   His odyssey reminds of those of runner Zola Budd and
tennis player Kevin Curran, who'd previously sought to avoid
strictures against South African athletes by changing
citizenship. "My {birth} parents have been supportive. They
agree what I'm doing is best for my future," Zerman says
quietly.
   Sunday's final between the buddies was about as good as
they come, despite the score. Mickelson started as though he
would make a rout of the thing, going two under par through
10 holes to Zerman's two over, and taking a four-hole lead.
But Zerman played the next nine holes in three under par and
cut the lead to one.
   Zerman could have pulled even on the day's 21st hole, the
328-yard par-four third, but Mickelson holed a chip shot for
a birdie to go 2 up again. Zerman cut the lead to one by
smacking a seven-iron to two inches of the pin on the
168-yard 24th hole, and rolled in a chip shot of his own for
a birdie two holes later. But Mickelson frustrated him with a
tying, 30-foot putt there, then rolled in.
   Both players later said they would stay amateur through
college. Zerman said he liked college life, Mickelson was
more businesslike. "I want to feel I can win every week
before I turn pro," he said.
   A couple more years ought to do that.

   Involved Discrimination
   In Pricing of Cigarettes

   A federal judge threw out a $148.8 million jury verdict
Liggett Group Inc. won against Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Corp.
   In awarding the treble damages last March, a jury in
Greensboro, N.C., had upheld Liggett's claim that B&amp;W engaged
in predatory price discrimination in the market for
low-priced, generic cigarettes in 1984 and 1985. Liggett
changed its name to Brooke Group Ltd. last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But U.S. District Judge Frank W. Bullock Jr. ruled
yesterday in Greensboro that Liggett hadn't proved that B&amp;W's
aggressive pricing policies had damaged competition in
violation of federal antitrust laws. Moreover, he suggested
that companies must meet a stiff burden of proof whenever
they rely on antitrust laws to attack price cutting by
competitors.
   "The antitrust laws' goal is to promote consumer welfare,
not to discourage aggressive price competition," Judge
Bullock said.
   Liggett said it was "disappointed" with the decision and
believes there are grounds for appeal.
   The case stems from Liggett's highly successful strategy
of using volume rebates to sell generic cigarettes in the
early 1980s. By 1984, it was siphoning thousands of smokers
away from other manufacturers and wreaking particular havoc
on B&amp;W. B&amp;W fought back with its own volume rebate plan,
giving rise to Liggett's allegations that B&amp;W engaged in a
predatory pricing campaign designed to "kill" the generic
cigarette category.
   The jury agreed that B&amp;W hadn't fought fair, ordering it
to pay Liggett $49.6 million for violations of the
Robinson-Patman Act. The total is automatically tripled under
the law to $148.8 million.
   But Judge Bullock said the Robinson-Patman Act bars only
the kind of price discrimination which may "substantially"
lessen competition. In this case, involving a national
market, B&amp;W could only do that if it were in a position to
control prices on a nationwide basis, the judge asserted. And
he concluded that B&amp;W was incapable of exercising such
control.
   "With at most 12% of the domestic cigarette market, B&amp;W as
a matter of law could not exercise market power unilaterally
in either the whole cigarette market or the generic segment,"
Judge Bullock ruled.
   Nor would the judge accept Liggett's contention that B&amp;W
exercised market control by acting in "tacit collusion" with
other cigarette manufacturers. He said Liggett's own
executives had testified at trial that there wasn't any such
collusion.
   In its statement on the decision, Liggett said it was only
one of the victims of B&amp;W's unfair competition, asserting
that the others are "consumers who we still feel have been
and will continue paying higher prices because of B&amp;W's
actions."
   But B&amp;W countered by saying the ruling underscores what is
supposed to happen in a free enterprise system. It said in a
statement that its introduction of generic cigarettes created
"more product choice for consumers" and generated "aggressive
price competition" in the industry.
   Martin London, an attorney for B&amp;W, called the decision a
"ringing endorsement" of price competition. "It establishes
that companies aren't going to be able to threaten
competitors with antitrust suits merely because those
competitors want to sell at low prices," said Mr. London of
the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp;
Garrison. "It says low prices are good, not bad."
   On a separate issue in the case, Judge Bullock refused
Liggett's request for a new trial on the question of whether
B&amp;W had infringed Liggett's trademark on design features of
its cigarette packages. The jury had rejected Liggett's
claim.

   CHICAGO -- Stotler Group Inc., the troubled futures
concern, admitted it couldn't solve its financial problems
and filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition at the federal
Bankruptcy Court here.
   The move, which was expected, came three weeks after
commodity funds managed by Stotler forced the company into
involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, claiming
Stotler owed them more than $5 million. It was the latest
wrinkle in the collapse of the futures brokerage firm linked
to former Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the bankrupt firm is liquidated
after the courts have determined that reorganization isn't
worthwhile; creditors often receive a fraction of their
claims, and stockholders typically get nothing. In a Chapter
11 proceeding, the company is reorganized and continues to
operate; security holders often get a reduced ownership
position.
   Stotler's troubles came to light last month with the
disclosure that it failed to meet Chicago Board of Trade
capital requirements. Mr. Mahlmann, who was Stotler's
chairman, has said he wasn't involved in the firm's daily
operations. But he became the first CBOT chairman in 130
years to resign from the nation's largest futures exchange.
   Stotler President Thomas M. Egan said in a statement
Friday that "it is now in the best interests of all creditors
that the further administration of these companies' affairs
be handled in an orderly manner by the bankruptcy court, in
accordance with bankruptcy laws." He added that "a return to
the shareholders of Stotler Group appears unlikely."
   Stotler also said it offered to settle Securities and
Exchange Commission charges related to its failure to
maintain sufficient capital, without admitting or denying the
agency's findings.

   NEW YORK -- New American Magazine Co. is negotiating for
the possible merger of its men's magazine, Smart, with the
as-yet-unpublished Men magazine.
   Owen Lipstein, chairman of New American, confirmed that he
was discussing a possible acquisition of Men, which will
begin circulation next year. It is owned by Norris
Publishing, the Fairfield, Conn.-based company newly formed
by Christopher Kimball, former publisher of Cook's magazine,
and Peter Kaplan, the former editorial director of the
now-defunct Manhattan inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Lipstein said he hopes to complete an agreement some
time next week.
   At Norris Publishing, Mr. Kimball wouldn't comment on
whether a merger would result in an entirely different
publication. Smart, a general-interest magazine for men, has
a literary bent. Men magazine has been described by Mr.
Kimball as a "field guide for men in their 20s and 30s."
   The talks come as publishers are rushing to create new
general-interest and life style magazines, with a handful of
editors jumping to new jobs at rival titles. Should the
negotiations break down, Mr. Kimball said he would follow
through with the launch of Men in early 1991. "After 25 years
of the woman's movement, men are back. The question is how
you design a magazine for that need," he said.
   Smart's Mr. Lipstein is looking to shore up the fortunes
of his two-year-old magazine. Last week, in a surprise move,
Smart's founding editor Terry McDonell was named the new
editor of Hearst Corp.'s Esquire magazine. Earlier this
month, Mr. Lipstein sold 50% of his New American Magazine Co.
to Tokyo-based Japanese Independent Communication Co.,
bringing in cash to pay debt accumulated in the 1980s.

   Reid Nagle's recommendation to seize and sell healthy
mutual savings institutions to raise funds for the
savings-and-loan bailout is outrageous, irresponsible,
inaccurate, unconstitutional, unjust and un-American
(editorial page, July 30).
   The depositors of mutual institutions are by definition
"members" of the institution. They have voting rights based
on the value of their accounts (much as stockholders have
voting rights based on the value of their shares) and a
portion of the institution's assets, proportional to the
value of their accounts, belongs to each account holder.
Federal law and regulations provide that all holders of
accounts of a mutual association are entitled to equal
distribution of assets in the event of voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
association. Provisions of state laws provide similar
protection for members of state-chartered associations.
Mutual thrifts, technically and in fact, belong to their
depositors. Mr. Nagle's view that the managers are the only
people who would lose in a government takeover of healthy
mutual thrifts is inaccurate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He is advocating the seizure of healthy institutions that
serve their communities well. From 1985 through 1989 the
healthy portion of the thrift industry paid more than $5
billion in increased insurance premiums through a "special
assessment" to support the government's resolution of the
troubled thrifts. Since 1989, they have been paying insurance
rates set by the law that are significantly higher than those
paid by commercial banks. All of this money is being used to
fund the costs associated with resolving the problems of
troubled thrifts.
   Disregarding due process and other constitutional
protections, Mr. Nagle proposes that the government seize
private property. Since when has this country advocated the
seizure of private business to finance a government debt?

   Mr. Nagle's article bears a strong resemblance to the
Willie Sutton aphorism that he robbed banks because that's
where the money was. Mr. Nagle proposes the theft of property
simply because it is mutually rather than individually held.
He ignores economic realities in suggesting that there is
some gain to the American taxpayer from the confiscation of
mutual savings institutions. And he disregards the needs of
communities that have been well served by mutual savings
institutions.
   Next, Mr. Nagle hits us with the fiction of a $10 billion
"windfall" to be realized through the seizure. He ignores the
problem of what exactly is being sold. When a mutual is
"sold" through its conversion to stock, the "buyers" are
actually investors; every dollar of the amount they pay for
the stock stays in the institutions and becomes new capital.
In fact, the conversions of some institutions that took place
in the 1980s were a way of expanding by raising this capital.
But he suggests that there will be buyers for institutions
under a plan in which every dollar paid goes into government
coffers.
   State-chartered mutual savings banks, far from being a
"relic of the past," continue to serve local communities
today as they have for more than 175 years. The overwhelming
majority are solvent, successful and crucial to the economic
needs of individuals and businesses in cities and towns
across the country. Rather than destroy these sound
institutions, the industry should learn from them.

   Mr. Nagle's illogical scheme to confiscate the reserves of
mutual savings institutions is flawed. No justification
exists for requiring mutual associations to pay for the
problems created by others simply because they operate under
a different corporate structure than stock corporations.
Simply because the U.S. Supreme Court said the depositors in
mutuals were not "technically owners" of the institutions,
for purposes of conversion to stock organizations, doesn't
permit the quantum leap in logic that these companies are
therefore in some sort of ownership limbo. Technical
ownership of a mutual is not the issue.
   It is interesting to note that Mr. Nagle's business
happens to be converting mutuals to stock organizations. Who
would profit if the government proposed escheatment on
conversion? Oddly enough, Mr. Nagle.

   Mr. Nagle suggests that by auctioning off healthy mutuals
and "eliminating" 2,000 savings institutions, $10 billion
could be raised. If 2,000 institutions with an average size
of $225 million are eliminated, his economics break down
rapidly.
   With a commensurate average payroll of approximately $2
million per institution, the federal government would lose
(at the 15% tax bracket) $600 million in income-tax revenue
annually. State government would see an approximate $100
million annual shortage. Furthermore, the institutions for
auction, by his own admission, are healthy and therefore
paying corporate income taxes. Based upon industry averages,
we are probably talking at least an additional $200 million
annually. Add to this the lost local real-estate tax revenues
and additional state unemployment-insurance expenses.
   More important, the healthy savings institutions pose the
least risk and pay the highest insurance premiums to the
reconstituted FDIC. Mr. Nagle's proposal kills the cash cows
that are paying the most to defray obligations incurred by
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp./Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   The abolition of the local-oriented mutual thrift
institution would be a sad day for communities throughout
this nation, but his disregard for neighborhoods and
communities is evident.

   Mr. Nagle's conclusions are based on a number of premises
that just ain't so. He believes that depositor members of
federally chartered savings-and-loan associations don't have
property rights in the institution under the Home Owners'
Loan Act. But they do. The case law never has held that
depositors have no property rights.
   He further believes that the tangible book value of
solvent mutuals can be obtained for the U.S. government
through some form of "sale," although the potential
purchasers are not described, nor is there a description of
what they would purchase and what, if anything, would remain
behind. This structure ignores the tax consequences of either
the liquidation or the transfer of assets and liabilities of
the S&amp;L. Such a transaction could result in generating
federal tax liabilities at the association level, as well as
to holders of any remaining, distributed net worth of the
institution. Such a transaction generally would prevent or
inhibit the use by the acquirer of any net operating loss
carry forwards, even assuming they otherwise could be used.
The windfall billions wouldn't be billions at all because the
transactions couldn't work the way Mr. Nagle describes them.
   He also assumes that 2,000 savings-and-loan institutions
would disappear and there would be fewer federally insured
deposits. How? Does this mean that commercial banks would
pick up all the deposits? That's what's currently occurring
with Resolution Trust Corp. transactions, but would the
acquirers also pick up the mortgages and other assets? If
they didn't, where does this instant money come from? If
commercial banks acquired the deposits, they remain federally
insured, but by a different FDIC fund. The total federal
exposure does not decrease by any relevant amount. If the
article contemplated acquirers purchasing the entire
institutions and operating them as S&amp;Ls, then there aren't
2,000 fewer institutions to be supervised.
   At first glance, Mr. Nagle's scheme may appear ingenious,
but the premises used in it don't permit the conclusions he
reaches. Unless quite substantial changes were made in
applicable charter, escheat and tax laws, as well as amending
some relevant provisions of the U.S. Constitution, it can't
work.

   Mr. Nagle wants those institutions that did almost
everything right to pay for those that did everything wrong
and then to be handed off to "acquirers" in exchange for a
few golden parachutes. He refers to the mutual as a "relic of
the past." If his opportunistic "acquirers" are the symbols
of our industry's future, then I see little hope for the
American consumer in the financial marketplace. I find it
very difficult to consider seriously his solution even
forgetting for the moment that his proposal would pay only 2%
toward the resolutions of the problem while causing a major
disruption of our industry.
   I have to believe his outrageous proposal was a bid for
attention and notoriety. Unfortunately, it succeeded.

   Mr. Nagle's proposal is something that could happen in a
communist country, but it certainly does not make sense in
America. His concept to just go in and take over 2,000
mutuals with assets of about $450 billion is like robbing a
bank without a gun.
   Speaking for one profitable mutual, I had nothing to do
with the S&amp;L bailout. In fact it is not an S&amp;L bailout but a
bailout of the government-sponsored deposit insurance. We
haven't gotten bailed out; we are doing the bailing.
