   Interco Won't Pay Interest Due June 15
   On Bonds; Firm Sets Debt Restructuring

   Interco Inc. said it won't pay interest due June 15 on its
bonds, proposing instead that bondholders accept a debt
restructuring of nearly $900 million.
   St. Louis-based Interco's finances have deteriorated
steadily since the furniture and shoe company carried out a
leveraged recapitalization in late 1988. At that time,
Interco borrowed about $2 billion to fight off a corporate
raider. Since then, Interco has posted a series of operating
losses and has failed to meet its price targets for selling
assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Interco's restructuring plan isn't likely to appeal to
bondholders. It offers little in the way of new
interest-paying bonds, and relies heavily on issuing more
Interco common stock, which closed yesterday in composite New
York Stock Exchange trading at 62.5 cents a share, unchanged.
   In fact, analysts regard the Interco plan as just the
first step in what may be a long-running series of
negotiations with bondholders. "The first restructuring plan
never goes through, and the companies know that," said Andrew
J. Herenstein, an analyst at Delaware Bay Co., a securities
concern specializing in distressed bonds. In recent months,
militant bondholders have frequently won concessions from
companies in financial straits.
   In announcing yesterday that it couldn't pay interest on
its bonds, Interco effectively conceded that its 1988
leveraged recapitalization hadn't worked. When the
recapitalization was devised by Interco's Wall Street
advisers, Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co., it was valued at $76 for
each Interco share. But most of the new securities issued in
the Interco recapitalization have sunk drastically in value.
Traders estimated yesterday that the Wasserstein Perella
recapitalization package ultimately proved to be worth only
about $42 a share.
   For the past year, Interco management has avoided
criticizing Wasserstein Perella by name. But in yesterday's
announcement of the restructuring plan, Interco hinted at
reservations about the high-debt strategy that it chose in
1988. The restructuring plan, Interco said, is designed to
relieve "the problems resulting from our over-leveraged
capital structure."
   The restructuring plan begins with about $400 million of
13 3/4% senior subordinated debentures due 2000. These bonds
have recently been trading at about 27 cents on the dollar.
Holders of those bonds would receive, in exchange for each
$1,000 principal amount of such debt, 70 shares of Interco
common stock and $900 principal amount of a new issue of 6%
accrual convertible debentures, which pay accrued interest at
maturity. The new 6% debentures are convertible into 504
shares of Interco common; additional terms weren't disclosed.
   The Interco restructuring plan doesn't offer any new debt
for holders of more than $450 million of subordinated bonds.
These bonds have recently been trading at just five cents on
the dollar, reflecting the bond market's pessimism about
Interco's condition. In the restructuring plan, holders of
these subordinated discount debentures due 2003, and 14 1/2%
junior pay-in-kind subordinated debentures, also due 2003,
would exchange each $1,000 principal amount of such
debentures for 150 and 130 shares of Interco common,
respectively.
   Interco also said it will ask shareholders to approve the
reclassification of each share of the company's existing
Series D $7.75 cumulative convertible preferred stock into
100 shares of Interco common, and its Series E preferred
stock into 8 shares of Interco common.
   Interco makes Converse sneakers and operates Florsheim
shoe stores; it also owns the Lane and Broyhill furniture
companies.
   The restructuring plan is conditioned, among other things
on acceptance of the offers by at least 90% of each of the
debenture groups. Interco said it will file a registration
statement covering its exchange offers with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in the next "one to two weeks."

   Firm Criticized for Shifting
   Gears on Drexel Clients

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- A major accounting firm, criticized for
alleged soft treatment of some former clients of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., is suddenly playing hardball with
Drexel clients.
   Touche Ross &amp; Co., which merged with Deloitte, Haskins &amp;
Sells in December to form Deloitte &amp; Touche, the
third-largest U.S. accounting firm, had long been the auditor
for a raft of Drexel clients. Drexel, which filed for
bankruptcy-court protection in February, was the originator
of junk bonds and sold millions of dollars of them to Touche
clients. Touche had been criticized by some attorneys as
permitting these clients to stretch accounting rules to
produce better financial results for portfolios of the
high-risk, high-yield bonds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But suddenly Deloitte &amp; Touche, which audits about 65 of
the 300 biggest U.S. thrifts, is forcing former Drexel
clients to take write-downs over deteriorating junk bonds or
real-estate holdings or by questioning the clients' internal
controls. One result has been a tighter squeeze on some
thrifts already struggling to survive.
   "Touche has gotten some religion because it doesn't want
to be burned in court again," said Daniel Mogin, a San Diego
attorney representing shareholders who have sued Columbia
Savings &amp; Loan Association and Touche over an allegedly
overblown valuation of the thrift's junk bonds bought from
Drexel. The suit, alleging that investors bought Columbia
common stock based on the inflated value of the junk bonds,
was filed in federal district court in Los Angeles in
December.
   Edward Kangas, managing partner of Deloitte &amp; Touche and
former managing partner of Touche, says that Touche hasn't
become any tougher with former Drexel clients than current
economics or new laws dictate. "The junk-bond market didn't
begin to fall apart until last October," Mr. Kangas said.
"Prior to that, there were daily quotes in The Wall Street
Journal citing the value of these bonds, and these are what
our auditors adhere to."
   Deloitte &amp; Touche ordered Columbia Savings after last
year's fourth quarter to incur about $50 million in
write-downs on the value of equity securities that Columbia
had received from Drexel for buying junk bonds. As a result,
Columbia, which tried to delay the write-down until the first
quarter of this year, couldn't meet federal standards for
assets and declared itself insolvent last month.
   J. Michael Cook, chairman and chief executive of Deloitte
&amp; Touche, says that a law passed in July -- the Financial
Institutions Reform &amp; Recovery Act -- that became effective
in December mandated that thrifts must dispose of their junk
bonds over the next five years. "This meant that all of a
sudden, these portfolios had to be marked to market rather
than being held at amortized cost," he said.
   By starting to require thrifts to market such junk-bond
holdings to market last December, "we were simply responding
to the new law," Mr. Cook says. He says that other downward
revisions of profits for thrifts audited by Deloitte &amp; Touche
have resulted from real estate collapses in Arizona, Florida
and the Northeast.
   Deloitte &amp; Touche forced Great American Bank, a San Diego
thrift, to boost its reserve for nonperforming loans in the
fourth quarter by $87 million, resulting in a net loss of
$59.3 million in the quarter, mostly from write-downs of
Arizona real estate. Great American, the eighth-biggest U.S.
thrift, has said it disputed the auditor's request for such
big reserves and is now seeking to be acquired as a rescue
operation to continue in business under higher capital
standards mandated by federal regulators in December.
   And Deloitte &amp; Touche was fired last month by Financial
Corp. of Santa Barbara, parent of Santa Barbara Savings &amp;
Loan Association, which was taken over by federal regulators
soon afterward. Financial Corp. said it discharged the
auditor after the accounting firms refused to issue an
opinion concerning the thrift's 1989 financial satatement due
to "material weakness in internal controls."
   The flap involved problems with the thrift's conversion
last year to a new computer system, which was plagued with
start-up problems, according to Financial Corp.'s 10-K
filings with the the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"We're still scratching our heads, wondering why Touche
judged the usual problems encountered in most computer
conversions as being serious enough to deny us an opinion on
our financial statement," says David Heaberlin, executive
vice president and chief financial officer of Financial Corp.
   Prior to playing hardball with its clients, Touche was
criticized for being too lax with some Drexel clients. In the
class-action suit filed against Columbia Savings and Touche
by Columbia shareholders, the plaintiffs allege that Touche
violated professional standards by permitting Columbia to
overvalue its junk bonds and to set too low a reserve for
possible future trading losses.
   Columbia Savings, Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara and
Great American Bank of San Diego were all clients of both
Drexel and Touche.
   In the Columbia case, the lawsuit against the thrift and
Touche notes that Touche had been a longstanding "accountant
of choice" for numerous Drexel clients such as Integrated
Resources Inc., Reliance Financial Services Corp. and First
Executive Corp. A class action suit was filed against
Intregrated, Drexel and Touche last June in federal district
court in New York. The suit alleges that Touche permitted
Integrated, which filed for bankruptcy court protection last
February, to overstate its income and assets -- a charge that
Touche denies.
   Mr. Kangas says that Drexel never referred any of its
clients to Touche as clients. "Many Drexel clients were
clients of ours long before junk bonds were invented by
Drexel," he adds. For example, he says both Integrated and
Reliance became Touche clients in the early 1970s and First
Executive in the mid-1960s.
   Mr. Mogin, an attorney with Milberg, Weiss, Bershad,
Specthrie &amp; Lerach, which is representing Columbia Savings
investors who claim they lost money by investing in the
thrift's common shares, says that Touche played a key role in
Columbia's alleged scheme to defraud shareholders.
   "At the height of the junk-bond frenzy, Columbia in 1988
had a junk-bond portfolio worth about $6 billion," Mr. Mogin
says. Last Dec. 31, that portfolio was worth only $3.8
billion. In last year's third quarter, the thrift set up a
reserve against junk-bond losses of $227.3 million and wrote
down its junk-bond holdings by $130.2 million.
   "Why did Touche permit Columbia to set up only a $45
million reserve against junk-bond losses for 1987 and 1988?"
Mr. Mogin asks. "It was obvious that Columbia was trading in
and out of its junk bonds and under accounting rules, the
value of the bonds should have been marked to market prior to
last year," Mr. Mogin says. Federal regulators say that from
the beginning of 1986 to the end of 1988, there was an 80%
turnover in Columbia's junk-bond portfolio.
   "We didn't perceive that Columbia was holding its
junk-bond portfolio for trading, which would have meant they
would have had to be marked to market rather than held at
amortized cost as in an investment account," says Mr. Kangas
of Touche. "A lot of these junk bonds have short maturities,
ranging from two to 10 years, and it's natural to have this
sort of turnover, even in an investment account."
   But Mr. Kangas maintains that only by last October did it
become obvious that both Drexel and the junk-bond market
"were falling apart." He adds: "That's why we required
Columbia to take the write-down in the fourth quarter of last
year. The market for junk bonds changed and anyone who says
we should have been able to predict it doesn't know what he's
talking about."

   Senate Ethics
   Panel Expands
   Durenberger Case
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Ethics Committee has expanded its
case against Sen. David Durenberger (R., Minn.) and will
examine a new charge that he violated government ethics laws
regarding blind trusts.
   The committee also announced yesterday that it had found
"substantial credible evidence" that Sen. Durenberger may
have "abused" his Senate office by improperly receiving
reimbursement for staying in a condominium he partly owned;
submitting improper reimbursement vouchers for travel;
misrepresenting the ownership of the condominium, and
back-dating real estate transactions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the allegation that Sen. Durenberger may have
violated the Ethics in Government Act's provisions relating
to communication about his blind trust is new, the
committee's expansion of the investigation to include the
condominium arrangement was expected.
   "This is the logical next step," said Sen. Durenberger's
administrative assistant, Bert McKasy. According to Sen.
Durenberger's press secretary, Lois West, the blind-trust
issue involves the senator's communication with his attorney,
who was also administrator of the trust, concerning the
condominium.
   Last January, Sen. Durenberger repaid the Senate $11,005
after the Rules Committee decided he shouldn't have been
reimbursed for use of the condominium during congressional
recesses.
   The ethics panel had announced earlier this month that it
would hold trial-like hearings beginning June 12 to determine
whether Sen. Durenberger had broken Senate rules and federal
law in a $100,000 book deal he had with Piranha Press. The
expanded charges announced yesterday will be combined with
the charges relating to the book deal.
   Ethics committee members will act as a jury to hear
evidence and determine whether Sen. Durenberger, who has
served in the Senate for 12 years, should be punished. If any
of the allegations are proven, possible punishment ranges
from reprimand to expulsion.

   Travel Prices Expected to Resist Usual Summer Rise

   Something strange is going on with travel prices this
summer: They're not going up.
   Travel companies normally boost their rates about this
time, priming for the annual rush of summer business. But so
far, most airlines, hotels and car rental companies are
barely touching prices. Some are even talking about lowering
them. "It's becoming a real smorgasbord for special pricing,"
says Albert Gomes, director of hospitality, travel and
tourism for Arthur D. Little Inc., a consulting firm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The soft prices are coming even though travel is up quite
a bit since last year's slump. Airline traffic has risen 8%
this year and hotel occupancy rates are their highest in
several years. But despite the improved business, many travel
companies are still hurting; four of 10 hotel rooms go
vacant, and car rental companies are loaded with debt. In
this environment, most travel companies don't want to risk
price increases.
   "People in the industry are afraid of running business
off," says Chris Browne, senior vice president of marketing
for Prime Franchise Systems Inc., franchiser for Ramada
Hotels and Inns, Howard Johnson and Roadway Inns. "I'd be
very surprised to see any aggressive pricing any time soon."
   What's more, some travel companies say the recovery has
slowed in recent weeks, creating fears that consumer
confidence may be slipping. "You've got a suffering economy
and one of the first things people give up is travel," says
Paul Turk, an analyst with Avmark Inc., Arlington, Va.
   To be sure, traveling won't be cheap, primarily because
airlines imposed a slew of beefy increases over the past two
years. Most travel experts figure that domestic air fares
will be about the same as last year's, with the cheapest
round-trip ticket from New York to Los Angeles costing about
$358 to $378.
   But things could have been a lot worse, had the normal
seasonal rate increases gone through. United Airlines, which
already lowered some transcontinental fares 15% from May 1 to
June 11, says it's not planning any fare hikes after the
latest special ends. "It's going to be a stable situation,"
says a spokeswoman for the UAL Corp. unit.
   Similarly, Delta Air Lines, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines,
and NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines say they have no fare
increases in the works, and America West Airlines officials
say its transcontinental fares may even drop. "The fare and
traffic levels are reasonable and we don't want to affect
that," says Marilyn Hoppe, the carrier's senior director of
pricing.
   Lodging rates, which rose 3% to 4% this winter, shouldn't
go up any more in the next few months, predicts Smith Travel
Research in Hendersonville, Tenn. Ramada Inns and Howard
Johnson plan to raise prices only $2 to $5 a day. Radisson
Hotels International Inc. says it will offer 25% to 50%
discounts off weekend rates in the summer at all 150 domestic
properties.
   Most car rental companies, meanwhile, plan to offer weekly
rates as low as $99 to $109 this summer, even in their
biggest three markets -- Florida, Hawaii and California. "You
may see some promotions go away, but you won't see any
big-time increases," says Robert Wilson, vice president of
marketing for Budget Rent a Car Corp.
   Given the unsteady nature of the travel industry, where
sudden shifts in pricing are common, the fare outlook could
obviously change. But most travel experts are betting that
the good deals will last through the fall. That's because
many airlines, which set the tone for the rest of the travel
industry, are adding an unusually large number of new planes
to their fleets. Before the year is out, the industry will
take in 750 new planes, compared with 415 in 1989, according
to Avmark. All those extra planes will increase competition
and keep fares down, travel experts say.

   MONTREAL -- Severe production cuts in March didn't make a
dent in Canadian pulp producers' big inventories. Meanwhile,
Canadian newsprint makers were able to trim their inventories
slightly as shipments picked up.
   Canadian output of market pulp fell 10% in March to
553,000 metric tons from 615,000 metric tons a year ago, the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said. However, pulp
shipments fell 13% to 564,000 metric tons from 652,000 metric
tons a year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The big drop in shipments left producers' pulp inventories
at the end of March virtually unchanged from February at
532,000 metric tons, a 30-day supply. Inventories at the end
of March 1989 were 290,000 metric tons, a 14-day supply. Pulp
producers operated at 85% of capacity in March, compared with
97% a year ago.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp
and of newsprint.
   Shipments from Canadian newsprint mills rose 2.7% in March
to 825,000 metric tons from 803,000 metric tons a year ago.
Newsprint demand has picked up as some publishers build up
stocks of newsprint in anticipation of a possible strike this
year at paper mills in eastern Canada.
   Canadian newsprint production in March was steady at
794,000 metric tons, compared with 796,000 metric tons a year
earlier. Canadian newsprint mills operated at 95% of capacity
in March, unchanged from the previous year.
   Canadian newsprint mills' inventories at the end of March
were 401,000 metric tons, down from 413,000 metric tons a
year ago and 432,000 metric tons in February.
   U.S. consumption of newsprint in March was flat at
1,044,000 metric tons, compared with 1,047,000 metric tons a
year earlier.

   San Francisco Imposes Plan
   To Cut Water Consumption

   SAN FRANCISCO -- After another season of drought, a water
rationing plan was imposed on this thirsty city, requiring an
immediate 25% cut in consumption.
   San Francisco's move, affecting some 2.2 million water
customers in several surrounding counties, follows a similar
rationing plan adopted in March by the Santa Clara Valley
Water District.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is a real emergency. We're in bad shape," said Rodel
Rodis, president of the city's public utilities commission,
after the vote to impose rationing late Tuesday. "We're in
the fourth year of a drought, and this is the worst year
yet."
   In a year of normal rainfall, he explained, the Hetch
Hetchy reservoir, which supplies much of the Bay Area's
drinking water, receives 700,000 acre feet of water. However,
during the past four rain-starved years, the reservoir has
received a cumulative total of just 525,000 acre feet of
water.
   Elements of the rationing plan will be familiar to city
residents from past seasons of scarcity. They include
shutting off decorative fountains, a ban on hosing sidewalks,
and restrictions against serving water in restaurants unless
a customer asks for it.
   Each household will receive a water allotment based upon
the number of people in it, with a sliding scale of penalties
for big and little offenders.

   Volkswagen Says
   Group Net Rose
   5.5% in 1st Period

   WOLFSBURG, West Germany -- Volkswagen AG said
first-quarter group net income rose 5.5%, but weakness in
South American operations is leading Europe's largest
automobile manufacturer to be cautious about forecasts that
it will be able to repeat last year's record earnings.
   Group net for the quarter was 191 million marks ($115.2
million), compared with from 181 million marks a year
earlier. Group sales rose 6.9% to 17.23 billion marks ($10.4
billion).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Group net for 1989 soared 33% to 1.04 billion marks from
780 million marks in 1988, the company's third-consecutive
record result. Group per-share earnings, adjusted for
extraordinary items, rose to 61 marks from 46 marks a year
earlier.
   Volkswagen Chairman Carl H. Hahn said it was too early to
forecast a fourth-consecutive year of record profit. Although
unit sales rose 2% to slightly more than one million in the
first four months of 1990, unit sales in the South American
Autolatina group fell 26% to 65,300 because of austerity
measures instituted by Brazil's government.
   Mr. Hahn said sales have recovered "surprisingly" strongly
in Brazil in recent weeks, but in Argentina, where Autolatina
is jointly based, the company "expects further negative
developments."
   Mr. Hahn said Volkswagen is looking at East Germany and
all of East Europe "all the way up to and into the Soviet
Union" as a market as well as a possible production site. He
said talks about joint ventures and other cooperation
agreements are being conducted with auto makers in
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and in Hungary. No details were
provided.
   Volkswagen plans to invest five billion marks in East
Germany during the next four years and has signed exclusive
marketing contracts with 555 East German car dealers to sell
cars produced by its joint venture with VEB IFA Kombinat
Personenkraftwagen. The joint venture will eventually produce
Volkswagen's Golf and Polo models, phasing out existing
production of IFA's antiquated Trabant.
   While unit sales in West Germany edged up 1.1% to 295,000
during the first four months of 1990, Mr. Hahn pointed to a
solid 5.5% increase to 485,000 units sold in other European
countries and a 4.2% boost in unit sales in North America.
   Unit sales of its Audi luxury car jumped 14% in the U.S.
during the first four months. Sales of its transporter van
gained 26%. Total unit sales in the U.S. were at last year's
levels, Mr. Hahn said.
   Analysts said the results were in line with expectations,
but said the uncertainty surrounding the weakness in South
America makes full-year forecasts difficult.

   The Alaska House of Representatives rejected a
Senate-sponsored code of ethics bill that would have made the
state's ethics law perhaps the toughest in the nation.
   The measure died 26-14 in the final minutes of the
legislature's regular annual session.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Proponents vowed to introduce a similar bill when the
legislature reconvenes next fall. As written, the measure
would have severely curbed legislators' dealings with
lobbyists, banned the acceptance of travel expenses of more
than $100 from private sources, outlawed post-election
fund-raising to retire campaign debt and kept legislators
from serving on most corporate boards.
   The measure earlier sailed through the Alaska Senate,
which has been rocked in recent years by prolonged ethics
investigations involving two of its members. The bill was
modeled upon recommendations of an outside ethics expert
brought in by Senate leaders seeking to rehabilitate that
body's battered public image.
   The bill received the strong endorsement of state
government watchdog groups and most of the state's
newspapers. Opponents, including most of the state's
registered lobbyists, argued that the bill was overly broad.

   TORONTO -- Asea Brown Boveri Inc. unveiled a 2.9 billion
Canadian dollar (US$2.5 billion) plan to build a high-speed
train link between Quebec City and Windsor, Ontario, that
rivals a more expensive plan previously proposed by
Bombardier Inc.
   Peter Janson, president and chief executive officer of
ABB, said an initial 540-kilometer (338-mile) section of the
line could be built between Montreal and Toronto for C$1.8
billion in about three years. The total line, comprising
1,160 kilometers, would take about seven years to construct,
he said. Montreal-based ABB is a wholly owned unit of Swiss
engineering concern Asea Brown Boveri Group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Janson spoke at a news conference here to announce the
results of a preliminary study of the high-speed train plan.
He expects a full feasibility study to be completed by the
end of the year. The company today will present its findings
to an Ontario-Quebec task force that has been examining
options for passenger transportation in the Quebec
City-Windsor corridor.
   In February, Bombardier, an aerospace and transporation
concern based in Montreal, offered its plan for a high-speed
rail link in the Quebec City-Windsor corridor at an estimated
cost of C$5.3 billion. The plan, which would use the French
TGV (very fast train) technology, would require about C$1.6
billion in government backing.
   But Mr. Janson said the ABB plan could be funded mostly
with private money. "We believe . . . the project can be done
with minimal or no government financing," he said.
   The ABB train, dubbed the Sprintor, would employ the
company's X2 rail technology currently in use in Sweden. This
enables electrically powered high-speed trains, traveling at
up to 250 kilometers (156 miles) per hour, to use existing
tracks without any alterations the banking of track curves.
By contrast, the Bombardier plan would require the laying of
new tracks along existing rights-of-way.
   Both ABB and Bombardier estimate their high-speed trains
would cut travel time between Montreal and Toronto to about
two hours and 45 minutes from about five hours currently.
   A Bombardier spokesman declined to comment on the ABB
plan.

   WASHINGTON -- Capital flows from Japan to the U.S. have
slowed recently, Makoto Utsumi, Japan's vice minister for
international affairs at Japan's finance ministry, said.
   But Mr. Utsumi, in an interview, refused to speculate on
whether this week's record Treasury refunding of more than
$30 billion would be affected. Japan has been an important
investor in Treasury securities in recent years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Speaking at the end of three days of international
meetings here, Mr. Utsumi expressed satisfaction with
Sunday's communique from the Group of Seven industrialized
nations. He stressed that the statement, released Sunday, is
more explicit about the need for a stronger yen than a
previous G-7 communique released in Paris a month ago.
   "The current level of the yen is to a certain extent out
of line with fundamentals," said Mr. Utsumi, who would like
to see his country's currency strengthen.
   The G-7 statement said "the present level {of the yen} may
have undesirable consequences for the global adjustment
process." There wasn't any mention of the present level in
the earlier communique released in Paris, Mr. Utsumi pointed
out. (The G-7 includes the finance ministers and central bank
presidents of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada.)

times vary, so check local listings): "Seven Days in
Bensonhurst." You may not want to relive the racial paroxysm
that followed last August's murder of a young New Yorker
named Yusuf Hawkins. But you may want to wrestle with its
meaning, as writer Shelby Steele tries to do in this edition

the 1964 "Dr. Strangelove."
                                                                                                       

   Sunday-Monday, May 20-21, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "Voices
Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase." This Sweeper miniseries
stars Shelley Long (formerly of "Cheers") as a woman with
multiple personalities caused by a traumatic childhood. The
obvious comparison is with "Sybil," an outstanding 1976 TV
movie starring Sally Field and Joanne Woodward (now available
on video). Unfortunately, not even Ms. Long's intelligent
acting can rescue the present film, which takes the attitude
that multiple personalities can be fun.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, May 20, starting at 6 p.m. EDT, on Bravo (repeated
on May 29): "The South Bank Show" and "The Modern World: Ten
Great Writers." Both regular programs will focus on the
fiction of Franz Kafka. Included is an interview with Steven
Berkoff, who adapted Kafka's "Metamorphosis" to the stage;
interviews with three actors who have played Gregor Samsa,
the character who turns into a giant cockroach; a TV version
of "Metamorphosis"; and a presentation of another Kafka work,
"The Trial."
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, May 22, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on CBS: "Killing in a
Small Town." Meanwhile, back among the Sweepers . . . This
film about a nice Texas lady who also happens to be an ax
murderer has a fine cast -- Barbara Hershey, Brian Dennehy
and Hal Holbrook.
                                                                                                       

   Tuesday, May 22, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "Last Flight Out."
Don't blame me -- Sweepers are always broadcast opposite one
another] This entry, fully sponsored by AT&amp;T, stars Richard
Crenna and James Earl Jones as an American airline pilot and
airport official who presided over the departure of the last
overloaded Pan Am plane from Saigon on April 24, 1975. It's
refreshing, after a few seasons of Oliver Stone, to see a
Vietnam movie in which the Communists are actually perceived
as a threat. But unfortunately, historical accuracy doesn't
automatically lead to good drama -- the film is earnest but
plodding.

   ORLANDO, Fla. -- Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said it
terminated discussions about possible sales of some of its
assets and public debt.
   The publishing and insurance concern, struggling under
debt from a highly leveraged takeover escape in 1987,
confirmed April 25 that it was holding the talks with another
company, but declined to elaborate. A Harcourt director,
however, former Sen. Eugene McCarthy, said the talks involved
Toronto-based Thomson Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thomson officials couldn't be reached for comment on the
termination of talks. Harcourt made the announcement after
the markets closed.
   "I didn't give a high probability to anything happening
with Thomson anyway," said Andrew Herenstein, an analyst with
Delaware Bay Co., a New York-based investment research firm.
Mr. Herenstein, who anticipates a slight drop in the value of
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich stock today in wake of the
announcement, said the company must still complete some kind
of restructuring.
   Roger Gordon, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. in New York, said Harcourt isn't under any
pressure to complete a restructuring in the immediate future.
   "They can move with deliberate speed," he said, "because
they're not facing an immediate cash crunch and won't be
confronting large cash demands for another three years" when
cash payments on subordinated debt issues are set to begin.

   WASHINGTON -- The Record Industry Association of America
unveiled a uniform voluntary label -- which will appear on
certain records, cassettes and compact disks -- warning
customers of explicit lyrics.
   Beginning in July, the black-and-white sticker will
appear, at the discretion of record companies, on the lower
right-hand corner of the product, inside the cellophane. It
will read: "Parental Advisory -- Explicit Lyrics."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plan is endorsed by the six record distributors that
dominate the business: Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Records, MCA
Inc.'s MCA Records, Sony Corp.'s CBS Records, Bertelsmann
AG's BMG unit, N.V. Philips's PolyGram Records and Thorn EMI
PLC's Capitol-EMI Records. It is also endorsed by the
National Association of Recording Merchandisers, which
represents retailers.
   This uniform label replaces a 1985 plan under which
individual record companies devised their own labels. The new
system is designed to blunt criticism of the record industry
by citizen's groups and state legislators.

   Aetna Acts to Stop
   Insuring Drivers
   In Pennsylvania

   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. is trying to withdraw from the
personal auto-insurance market in Pennsylvania.
   Although the insurer filed a lawsuit last week challenging
the constitutionality of two laws that bar its withdrawal
from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania is the first state where it
has started the process to leave the auto-insurance business.
It has begun sending out nonrenewal notices to its 200,000
policyholders in the state. Aetna has also begun cutting back
on its auto-insurance business in other states.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Aetna, the fifth largest auto insurer working in
Pennsylvania, expects to have pulled out completely in one
year.
   Yesterday, the Hartford, Conn., company also amended a
complaint filed in February in U.S. district court in
Philadelphia, asking the court to enjoin the Pennsylvania
insurance commissioner from taking any action to block
Aetna's withdrawal from the auto-insurance market in this
state.
   Insurance regulators view Aetna's action as a violation of
a 1968 law that governs the circumstances allowing an insurer
to stop renewing policies in Pennsylvania. The insurance
department will issue a temporary order to block Aetna's
action today.
   Earlier this week, the insurance department asked a state
court to prevent Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. and a
Safeco Corp. unit from not renewing their auto-insurance
policies in Pennsylvania.
   New auto-insurance legislation passed last February
required insurers to offer drivers rate reductions of 10% to
22% in premiums. Yet, more than 100 companies have failed to
comply with the new law last week, when rate filings
incorporating the rollbacks were due. Some asked for rate
boosts, and two other companies tried to pull out entirely
from the market.
   Aetna filed for a rate increase, averaging 24.7% for all
classes of drivers. The company said the filing was returned
without comment by the insurance department.
   "The inability to receive adequate rate relief, coupled
with the burdensome rollback provisions of the new state auto
insurance law, makes this decision necessary," said John J.
Martin, president of Aetna's personal financial security
division.

   For Sixth Week
   In a Row, Assets
   Of Funds Decline

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
</IN>
<LP>
   Money-market mutual fund assets dropped for the sixth week
in a row, as investors found other places to put their cash.
   Assets of 427 taxable funds fell by $1.2 billion in the
week ended Tuesday, to $377 billion, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based
newsletter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I take my cue from the auction" of three-year Treasury
notes, said Walter Frank, chief economist for Donoghue's.
"Money funds are getting some competition."
   Individual investors bought record amounts of three-year
notes at the auction Tuesday, getting a yield of 8.74%.
Demand from individuals also was high at yesterday's auction
of 10-year notes, when the yield was 8.88%. Six-month T-bills
yielded 8.28% at Monday's auction.
   Average money fund yields, meanwhile, remained just below
8%, where they've been for the last three months. Donoghue's
reported that the average seven-day compound yield, which
assumes reinvestment of dividends, was 7.96% for the second
consecutive week.
   It's still possible to get yields approaching 9% in a
money fund, although it requires some looking. The top
performing fund in the latest week, Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar,
had a seven-day compound yield of 8.91% and a few other funds
offered more than 8.5%.
   Yields aren't likely to change much in the next few weeks.
Average maturity of the funds' investments remained at a
fairly long 44 days, about what it has been for most of the
year. Money funds invest in such things as commercial paper
(short-term corporate IOUs), bank certificates of deposit and
short-term Treasury securities.
   Longer maturities usually are thought to indicate that
portfolio managers expect rates to decline because they make
it possible to retain comparatively high yields. Mr. Frank of
Donoghue's said he expects rates, and hence money fund
yields, to remain stable for the next couple of months
because of uncertainty about the strength of the economy.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.66% from 7.67%. The average 30-day simple yield
remained at 7.68% and the average 30-day compound yield
stayed at 7.98%.
   Yields on tax-free funds declined. The average seven-day
compound yield, for instance, eased to 5.74% from 5.79%. That
is equal to 7.97% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and
8.57% for someone paying 33%.
   Assets of the 220 tax-exempt funds tracked by Donoghue's
rose by $180.6 million to $75.6 billion. Average maturity
lengthened by a day to 42 days.

   High-Speed Train Propelled by Magnets Attracts
   `Peace Dividend' Funds and Defense Contractors

   WASHINGTON -- The "peace dividend" is alive, well and
floating a few inches above a railroad track at 300 miles an
hour.
   Since late last year, lawmakers have fretted over whether
the shrinking of the nation's military would benefit
long-starved domestic needs, or whether the much-vaunted
peace dividend would go instead only to pare the federal
budget deficit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Well, federal money is gradually dribbling into new
domestic programs, including a futuristic, high-speed railway
system called Maglev. Officials have been falling all over
themselves trying to find it funds, and defense contractors
are wild about it, too. Believing it might provide them new
business as the market for weapons slows, they are lobbying
for more federal dollars.
   Increased funding for Maglev "is a way to get us back on
track," asserts Richard Gran, director of advanced concepts
at Grumman Corp., a Bethpage, N.Y., military contractor.
   "It's a natural," agrees Democratic Rep. Robert Mrazek, in
whose Long Island, N.Y., district many Grumman employees
live. He is among a growing number of Maglev backers in
Congress and in the Bush administration.
   Maglev is short for magnetically levitated transportation.
Under this technology, powerful electromagnets raise a train
inches above a metal guideway and propel it forward at great
speed. In Congress and in the Bush administration, Maglev is
being hailed as a clean, quiet and safe way to help reduce
congestion on highways and at airports.
   In his budget for fiscal 1991, President Bush singled out
Maglev as an "emerging technology," and recommended more than
quadrupling, to $9.7 million, federal funds to study the
system. Bills are being readied in the House and Senate to go
much further. Rep. Mrazek, for example, would authorize $950
million for the study and construction of a demonstration
guideway.
   To be sure, the Maglev field is filled with some
high-powered hyperbole. To hear zealots tell it, Maglev
trains will be speeding passengers to work almost any day
now. In fact, there isn't a commercial Maglev anywhere, and
there is some doubt whether there will be one anytime soon.
"The Maglev business brings out a lot of oddballs; you find
people like that running around all over the place," says
Robert Kiernan, coordinator of Maglev 2000, a trade group
representing potential U.S. component makers.
   There also is serious opposition to Maglev. Advocates of
expanding urban mass transit, for instance, worry that
pie-in-the-sky hopes for Maglev might take funds away from
their less-flashy though more-fundamental systems. In
addition, they assert that Maglev is wholly incompatible with
existing transit modes and ill-suited for most mass-transit
uses, which entails frequent stopping. "There's nothing
inherently wonderful about it . . . and a lot of hype,"
grouses Frank Cihak, chief engineer of the American Public
Transit Association.
   Maglev was developed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory
on Long Island and at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in the 1960s and early 1970s, and was backed and
tested by the U.S. government. But, when the federal budget
deficit began to swell, Maglev was one of the first victims.
U.S. development of the technology died along with its
federal funding in 1975. In the meantime, Japan and West
Germany each poured about $1 billion into developing the
technology. They now boast demonstration models of the train
and are moving toward commercial versions they hope to sell
abroad, particularly in the U.S.
   Leading the fight to restore federal funding, and to bring
Maglev home to the U.S. again, is Sen. Daniel Moynihan. The
New York Democrat sees the technology as the inevitable next
generation of transportation, and has almost single-handedly
forced the federal bureaucracy and his colleagues in Congress
to pay attention to it.
   The senator's first task was to provide some federal
support. "No major transportation revolution has ever
progressed in the U.S. without substantial federal
involvement," he wrote in an essay for Scientific American
magazine. "Maglev will be no exception."
   His mission was made difficult by officials at the
Transportation Department. Gilbert Carmichael, the federal
railroad administrator, for example, insisted that industry,
not government, should lead the way. "We want to use a very
little amount of money to stimulate the private sector and
the states," he says.
   In response, Sen. Moynihan publicly referred to Mr.
Carmichael as a "boob," and maneuvered privately to funnel
federal dollars to his pet project. Using his chairmanship of
the Public Works Committee's subcommittee on transportation,
he authorized the Corps of Engineers to study Maglev, and
then used his influence to win $1 million in appropriations
for that purpose last year.
   The action instigated a turf battle in Congress and in the
executive branch, which ultimately has meant even more money
for Maglev. Seeing the Corps of Engineers getting ahead on
the issue, the Transportation Department sought and won a
half-million dollars for its own Maglev study last year. And
this year, thanks mostly to the new-found interest of
President Bush, almost everyone wants into the act.
   On April 3, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to create
a new high-speed rail office in the Transportation Department
and to authorize $100 million over two years for matching
grants with U.S. companies to research Maglev. On April 24,
the Senate Public Works Committee voted to allow Maglev
projects to be built on federal highway rights of way. Inside
the Bush administration, a special interagency group has been
formed to coordinate Maglev efforts. And just last week, the
government hosted a two-day Government-Industry Maglev Forum
to discuss what it dubs the "Federal Maglev Initiative."
   Outside government, lobbying groups advocating Maglev are
springing up and thriving. These include Maglev 2000, a task
force of the Council on Superconductivity, and Maglev USA, a
new but quickly growing group of U.S. corporations that want
to have a hand in the technology's U.S. revival. Members of
Maglev USA include defense contractors Grumman; General
Electric Co.; Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s
electronics-systems group; construction-engineering
companies, such as Rust International Corp., a subsidiary of
Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., and Sverdrup Corp.; and the
CSX Transportation Inc. unit of CSX Corp., a transportation
giant.
   The biggest spurt of interest has come from defense
contractors, according to Wayne Thevenot, a Maglev USA
officer, and for good reason. "We have as an objective to
apply defense technologies to non-defense applications,"
explains Aris Melissaratos, a vice president for the
Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group. "Maglev could offer
some business opportunities."
   Defense contractors are frequent attendees of Maglev
conferences, and meet regularly with lawmakers and policy
makers to urge their support. General Dynamics Inc. has met
with Mr. Carmichael, the railroad administrator. And
representatives of Grumman, General Dynamics, Maglev 2000 and
Maglev USA accompanied Rep. Mrazek on April 25 when he made
the rounds of senior lawmakers whose committees hold sway
over the future of Maglev funding.
   Few expect hundreds of millions of dollars to be allocated
to Maglev this year. But increasing sums are sure to be
whizzing its way soon. "There's no question Maglev is going
to be built here in the U.S.," says Maglev 2000's Mr.
Kiernan. "It's a question of whether American companies will
compete in their own market."
   Sen. Moynihan, for one, is pessimistic that the Bush
administration will permit more than a token sum to be spent
on Maglev, far less than is needed to get the system rolling.
But Rep. Mrazek is more sanguine. Maglev, he says, "is an
easy one to sell politically."

   PRO BONO MATURES prompting changes in law practices.
   Once an informal system of providing free legal aid for
the poor, pro bono work is being built into the structure of
legal practice. At large law firms "there has been a trend to
do more and to be more visible," says Kimball Anderson of
Winston &amp; Strawn, Chicago. Holland &amp; Knight, Tampa, set up a
formal program in January. One reason: "It helps the
recruitment effort," says Steve Hanlon. Other benefits:
contacts in the business community, greater visibility and
inexpensive training for lawyers.

   Corporate law departments are using pro bono to tackle
issues that fit company strategy, says Craig Smith of the
Corporate Philanthropy Report, citing insurance company pro
bono programs that help the elderly. With 648 bar sponsored
pro bono programs now in operation, the number of lawyers
involved increased 8% last year, says Dennis Kaufman of
American Bar Association.
   Meanwhile, studies on unmet legal needs fuel the push for
mandatory pro bono in some states, says the ABA's Esther
Lardent.
                                                                                                       

   MORE MOMS get pampered as service gifts for Mother's Day
increase.
   Flowers and perfume, move over. The latest in Mother's Day
presents are gift certificates for services ranging from a
massage to a day of housecleaning. Mother's Day demand for a
$198 five-hour beauty package is growing "by a grandiose
amount," says Vicki Lanzarotta, manager of the Gates, a San
Marino, Calif., salon. Why? "More women feel stressed these
days," says a spokeswoman from Elizabeth Arden Salon, New
York, where big sellers include a $45 body massage and a $225
five-hour beauty package.
   Huff n' Puff Maid Service, Atlanta, says Mother's Day gift
sales have picked up this year, thanks to the growing number
of working mothers who don't have the time or energy to
clean. Meet My Maids in West Los Angeles says children in
their 30s and 40s with aging moms are the biggest
gift-certificate buyers on Mother's Day. Despite a $500
minimum, some people even order a catered Mother's Day meal
to be served at home, says Grayce Baldwin of Just Leave
Everything to Us Ltd., Hollywood Hills, Calif.
                                                                                                       

   COMPOST PROJECTS proliferate in backyards and
municipalities.
   Seattle is providing 9,000 residents with free composters
and an hour consultation as part of an expanded backyard
composting program. More municipalities compost leaves, and
some are turning to composting to solve bigger waste disposal
problems. Portland, Ore., is building a $20 million facility
that will compost 185,000 tons of garbage a year, with the
end product sold to nurseries and vineyards.
   At Gardener's Supply Co., Burlington, Vt., the composting
trend is translating into sales: Compost supplies are now the
company's biggest product group. "We are selling composters
faster than we can get them in," says spokesman Paul Conrad.
Others are jumping into the business. Howard Stenn of Tilth,
a Seattle organic gardening group, says dozens of people "are
just starting to manufacture compost bins."
   The risk for large projects: diminishing demand for the
end-product as compost projects multiply, says law firm
Nixon, Hargrave, Devans &amp; Doyle.
                                                                                                       

   BAG AGAIN: Massachusetts Volunteer Network revives "bottle
bags," that can be filled with returnables and left on the
street for the homeless. In its first week, DeLuca's Market
in Back Bay had two bagfulls redeemed -- not by homeless but
by regular customers. "We're still working out the tweaks,"
MVN says hopefully.
                                                                                                       

   BABY THE MOM, is the message going out on Mother's Day
bouquets sent by 70 Hartford, Conn., florists this year. The
program is part of an effort to reduce the Hartford infant
mortality rate, which is nearly twice the national average.
                                                                                                       

   THE NAME GAME: Most companies taking new names for
themselves or their products don't test before adopting them,
says a survey by Rivkin &amp; Associates, Midland Park, N.J. The
most common source of new names: an internal task force.
                                                                                                       

   KIDS MEALS become a hot market for food companies.
   Children ages six through 12 ate fewer frozen dinners in
1986 than any other segment, says the Lempert Report,
Montclair, N.J. "Not many youngsters were jumping at the
chance to chow down on breaded filet of sole with a side of
broccoli." Now major food companies are filling the gap with
frozen and shelf-stable products. First to market: My Own
Meals, which began with mail-order in 1987 and now sells
through supermarkets and Toys "R" Us stores.
   This spring's entrants: ConAgra's Kid Cuisine and Tyson's
Looney Tunes Meals for Kids, both frozen lines with items
such as chicken nuggets. Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co. tests a
shelf-stable Kid's Kitchen line. Taking a cue from fast-food
chains, Kid Cuisine includes a fun pack so "the kid can play
with the fun pack while the adult prepares the food," says
ConAgra's Susan Hanley.
   Parents' growing comfort in letting children use the
microwave is feeding demand for such products, says Bill
Bernardo of Hormel.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Celsus Designs Inc., Hacienda Heights, Calif.,
markets stuffed-animal arms, heads and feet that attach to
computer screens to create Computer Critters. . . . A new
doll designed to bolster children's confidence is dubbed
F.R.O.Y.D., standing for For Reality of Your Dreams.

   Your Money Matters:
   Disappointing Art-Auction Sales
   Paint Riskier Picture for Investors

   Art collectors had better be buying for love, not money.
   Disappointing sales at auctions this week in New York,
coming on the heels of lackluster results last month in
London, offer evidence that art, one of the hottest
investments of the 1980s, isn't sure-fire.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In roughly the past five years, art prices have soared
sky-high, a rapid rate of appreciation that prompted
experienced collectors to become more active, attracted new
collectors to the market, and boosted the number of dealers
and others, particularly in Japan, buying art purely for
speculation.
   But at contemporary-art auctions held at the premiere
art-auction houses in New York this week, about one-third of
the artworks offered for sale failed to find buyers. At
Christie's International PLC, the total sale at Monday
night's auction came to $40.2 million, sharply lower than the
firm's lowest estimate of $50 million. At Sotheby's Holdings
Inc., the total sale at Tuesday night's auction was $55.9
million, well below the $86 million minimum predicted by the
auction house.
   Some sales in April in London of less expensive, less
historically important merchandise also had mixed results.
But the results of all the recent sales are still considered
only early warning signals.
   But what is especially worrisome to the art industry is
that the failures so far have included some high-quality,
multimillion-dollar works by Willem de Kooning, Andy Warhol
and other established artists. Conventional wisdom had held
that, even when the art boom wound down, or outright busted,
the important works would be recession-proof. Recent sales
indicate, art dealers say, that collectors and market players
who believed that might have been both overconfident and
greedy.
   One sculpture by Claes Oldenberg, who was a leading
proponent of 1960s' "Pop Art," sold at Sotheby's a year ago
for $495,000. On Tuesday the work was put on the block again,
and bidding went as high as $525,000 for the plaster, fabric
and wire wall-hanging of an egg and slice of bacon. However,
that price didn't meet the seller's minimum acceptable bid,
and the piece went unsold.
   Many stock-market investors, who had been playing the art
boom by buying shares rather than sculptures, didn't even
wait for this week's sales to render their verdict by selling
Sotheby's stock. The price of the stock, previously one of
Wall Street's star performers, has been sliding since the
April auctions. Yesterday in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, the stock opened almost an hour late
because of an imbalance of orders, and down by $2.125 a
share. By the end of the day, the stock had fallen $3.125 to
a 52-week low of $16.50, in more than seven times its normal
trading volume.
   In contrast, the stock of Christie's International PLC,
which is traded in London, closed near its 52-week high
yesterday, at #3.27 ($5.46), down three pence. Christie's
stock is more thinly traded than Sotheby's, and the company
rarely takes a position in the art it is selling.
   Sotheby's, however, effectively underwrote six of the
artworks that went up for bid Tuesday evening by guaranteeing
that the sellers would receive a certain price even if the
art didn't sell. All six did sell -- two for more than the
highest pre-sale estimates and three for less than the lowest
estimates.
   Art dealers, collectors and artists say the art market's
apparent softening is partly due to the twin recessions in
New York's real estate and finance industries. They also
blame a new mood of caution on the part of international
investors sparked by weakness in the Tokyo stock market.
Perhaps most of all, however, they talk about a vague feeling
that the rapid price appreciation of the past few years was
simply too good to last.
   Some argue that a return to earth might not be so bad for
the art market. "Oh, good," said one Impressionist painting
collector, "maybe I can afford something next week."
   For collectors and investors, the lesson is that not even
works of art are immune from the ups and downs of free-market
economics. Until the dust settles, the sidelines may be the
safest place, especially for those who have been thinking
about selling, some collectors and dealers say.
   Still, they caution against making sweeping
generalizations about the health of the market based on the
auctions so far. Several of the arts and collectibles
markets, African art and toys, for example, have set record
prices and shown continued vigor at recent auctions. American
folk art has also been very strong.
   Moreover, the contemporary market "is a trendy and flaky
market," of works by artists "who have not been sorted out by
time," says Samuel Pennington, publisher of Maine Antique
Digest, which has been following the art market since 1973.
"When you have a guy making a parallelogram of string and
calling it sculpture," the fact that it sells or doesn't sell
isn't necessarily indicative of the health of the broader
market.
   Nonetheless, art dealers are, to say the least, on
tenterhooks ahead of the major auctions of the season, the
evening sales of Impressionist and modern paintings, which
will be held at Christie's and Sotheby's next Tuesday and
Thursday, respectively. Those sales are keenly watched
because, in the past, they've set the tone for the art market
world-wide.
   Scheduled to go on the block are two acknowledged
masterpieces, both carrying estimates of $40 million to $50
million, and even higher expectations. Christie's will sell
Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," an evocative,
brooding canvas painted in shades of deep blue by the artist
shortly before he committed suicide in 1890. Sotheby's will
sell "Au Moulin de La Gallete," Pierre-Auguste Renoir's
vibrant depiction of a festive Parisian dance hall.
   David Nash, head of the Impressionist and modern paintings
department at Sotheby's, says he's still "confident" that the
price estimates that the company set several months ago, when
the artworks were first consigned to auction, "are still
pretty good." He notes that collectors of Impressionist
paintings tend to be wealthier than most other collectors,
and that many of the works for sale haven't been at auction
in quite some time.
   He adds, however, that some of the sellers have been
calling the company to say "I'm not feeling that bullish
anymore," and are lowering the reserves, or minimum prices
they will accept. Such last-minute cautiousness isn't
uncommon, he adds.
   Traditionally, that minimum acceptable bid is equal to or
slightly less than the lowest presale estimate. But at
Sotheby's contemporary sale Tuesday night, almost one-fourth
of the works that did find buyers sold below the low end of
Sotheby's price estimate, indicating sellers may have lowered
their reserves.
   One Donald Sultan flower painting, for example, sold for
$70,000 instead of the $125,000 to $175,000 it had been
expected to bring.

   Maryland's Bike-Helmet Rule Causes
   Safety, Industry Advocates to Butt Heads

   A new Howard County, Md., law requiring all bicycle riders
to wear helmets could spark other communities to jump aboard
with their own rules.
   "I suspect, unfortunately, that {the Howard law} will have
a national impact. The proponents are seeking to get a lot of
momentum . . . to get various communities across the country
to take similar action," says Michael Kershow, a spokesman
for the Bicycle Manufacturers Association of America. The
trade group fears that requiring helmets could discourage
bicycling.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of the helmets say the action gives a
significant boost to improving biking safety nationwide.
"With one county doing it, you might have another, then
another until it snowballs," says New York State Assemblyman
Henry Barnett, who wants safety headgear required for all
cyclists.
   New York and California already require helmets for young
children riding in bike carriers, and some other states are
considering adopting that rule. But the Howard County law,
passed Monday by the county council, is a groundbreaker
because it requires helmet use by all bicyclists of any age.
   More than 1,000 bikers die in accidents each year, most
because of head injuries. "Head injuries are very, very
nasty," says Andrew Dannenberg, a doctor with the Johns
Hopkins Injury Prevention Center in Baltimore. "If they don't
kill you, they can leave you permanently incapacitated,
unable to read well, think well or take care of yourself. A
broken arm will heal, but head injuries often don't."
   A study by the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research
Center in Seattle showed that wearing a bicycle helmet
reduced the risk of head injury by 85%. Nevertheless, fewer
than 5% of the estimated 90 million bicyclists in the U.S.
currently use helmets.
   And only 1% of children under 15 wear cycling helmets,
according to Bell Helmets Inc., the nation's largest
manufacturer of bike helmets.
   In the face of such data, everyone involved in the issue
agrees wearing helmets is a good idea; the fight is over
whether the government should require it.
   Howard County Councilman Charles Feaga, who pushed the new
law, says that the legislation is good public policy because
it will save lives and money. "The public currently picks up
an awful lot of the expense of people who experience brain
traumas in accidents," he says. Dr. Dannenberg favors federal
action; he wants the Consumer Product Safety Commission to
require that the price of a bike include a helmet.
   But opponents say such measures would drive some people
away from biking because of the added cost; helmets generally
cost between $25 and $90. "Some people won't buy helmets and
will just say, the heck with it, I won't go biking," says
James Fremont, education director for the Bicycle Federation
of America.
   Mr. Kershow, the bike manufacturers' association
spokesman, says sales to lower-income families, in
particular, would be hurt. "These families might not have the
disposable income to spend an additional 20% to 40%," he
says. Besides, he contends, enforcing mandatory helmet use
would be difficult and simply create resentment toward the
police.
   But supporters of the Howard County measure say that
mandating bike helmets isn't any different from requiring the
use of car seatbelts and child safety seats.
   Some parents are apparently responding to warnings about
the dangers of cycling without headgear. In Seattle, helmet
use by children under 12 has risen to 24% from 1% in the past
three years because of an aggressive public-education
campaign by Harborview.
   Nationwide, helmet sales are expected to rise this year to
as many as four million from the three million sold last
year, according to Bell.
   In Howard County, the issue hit home after three young
people were killed in recent years in bicycling accidents.
One, Christopher Kelley, had attended Glenwood Middle School,
where students, in response to his death, asked Mr. Feaga to
take steps to make bicycling safer.
   The ultimate result was the legislation approved earlier
this week. The new law says that all bicycle riders using
county roads must wear helmets or face possible fines of up
to $50 for a first offense and up to $100 for a second
offense. Mr. Feaga says much of the credit goes to the
students, who provided valuable research on how many students
had bicycles and whether they used helmets. "They were
instrumental," he says.

   New Newspaper
   Seeks to Defy Odds

   When the Evening News hits the streets Monday in Kansas
City, Mo., owner Stephen F. Rose will be trying to do the
seemingly impossible: successfully launch a metropolitan
daily newspaper and publish it in the afternoon.
   Mr. Rose, president of Sun Publications Inc., Overland
Park, Kan., will publish the Evening News Monday through
Friday, hitting newsstands about 2 p.m. The 50-cent tabloid
newspaper will be heavy on international and national news,
and sports.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Evening News will operate as a unit of Sun
Publications, a family-owned publisher of 18 suburban weekly
newspapers in the affluent suburbs of Kansas City's Johnson
County, as well as publisher of the Kansas City Jewish
Chronicle.
   Mr. Rose is attempting to buck a nationwide trend: the
steady decline of metropolitan evening newspapers. The number
of evening dailies has shrunk from 1,450 in 1950 to 1,125 in
1989. Some evening papers have simply died, though many -- at
least 140 since 1976 -- have converted from p.m. to a.m.
newspapers, according to the American Newspaper Publishers
Association.
   News of startup city newspapers is so rare that recent
attempts have drawn wide publicity, but no success. On April
25, Ingersoll Publications Co. closed down the St. Louis Sun,
a colorful tabloid newspaper started with great fanfare only
seven months before, citing slow growth of circulation and
costly home delivery.
   Mr. Rose's plan for the Evening News has different twists.
In St. Louis, Mr. Ingersoll spent millions on home delivery;
The Evening News will have no home delivery. It will be sold
instead from street vending machines, at convenience stores,
and by newsboys on street corners. Initial circulation goals
are 25,000 daily.
   The St. Louis Sun also went head-to-head with Pulitzer
Publishing Co.'s Post-Dispatch, also a morning paper. The
Evening News, however, will fill the afternoon gap left by
the demise March 1 of the Kansas City Star's afternoon
edition.
   The odds on the Evening News's survival are long, despite
Mr. Rose's strategy. "You like to see any one try it, but the
cost of daily newspaper production is pretty heavy to handle
with only circulation revenue," said Paul Kessinger,
consulting director of the Jordan Group, a New York
consulting and media brokerage firm. Daily newspapers
typically get 80% of their revenue from ad linage and 20%
from single-copy and home subscription sales.

   Try to Scrap

   The major television networks, faced with a mysteriously
shrinking audience, may try to do away with their practice of
promising advertisers that shows will reach a specific number
of viewers.
   Insiders at all three networks said they hope to scrap the
current guarantee system when they begin negotiating with
advertisers next month for the fall prime-time season.
Instead -- in a move already raising the ire of the
advertising community -- they want to offer different,
less-stringent guarantees. They're considering guaranteeing a
certain range of ratings rather than a specific rating, for
example, or only making guarantees for a small portion of the
ad time sold.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If successful, the networks would transform the business
of buying television ad time, and save themselves millions of
dollars: When programs fall below guaranteed audience levels,
the networks must give advertisers additional TV time to
"make good" on the promised audience levels. In the first
half of this year alone, the estimated value of `makegoods'
at the three networks reached a painful $150 million to $200
million.
   "You can't go into {guarantees} the way you did in prior
years; the ratings aren't the same," says Larry Hoffner,
executive vice president, network sales, at NBC, a unit of
General Electric Co. Adds H. Weller Keever, executive vice
president of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC unit: "We have to
find a way to limit our liabilities."
   The networks' moves are already drawing hoots from the
advertising community, which isn't about to give up
guaranteed-audience numbers. And to some extent, the networks
are posturing, as they always do just before beginning
negotiations for the fall season. The so-called up-front
negotiations are expected to begin just after the networks
announce their fall lineups a few weeks from now. Even NBC's
Mr. Hoffner concedes that doing away with guarantees as they
stand now is far from a done deal: "I don't know that we're
going to come up with any alternatives at all."
   But the talk of slashing guarantees appears to be more
than just a negotiating ploy. The networks are in a serious
bind as the 1989-90 season draws to an end. According to A.C.
Nielsen, viewers have been deserting television in droves;
the number of adults watching prime time plummeted each month
this year, dropping 5.5% in March and 3.6% in April.
Television executives say the total audience of all three
networks fell 7% to 8% below guaranteed levels this year --
an exceptionally costly drop, considering advertisers had
paid about $4 billion for the season's prime-time ad time.
   The networks have complained long and loud to Nielsen,
saying there must be some problem with its measurement
system, but to no avail: Nielsen said last week it couldn't
explain the drop-off. So the networks are taking it upon
themselves to come up with alternatives to the traditional
guarantees.
   One possibility under discussion would offer audience
guarantees only for certain shows, perhaps only for returning
hits rather than for new shows. Or, the networks might offer
to make good for as much as, say, a 5% drop in guaranteed
ratings, but refuse to do anything if ratings were to slide
further than that. They might also consider doing away with
the very specific guarantees common now -- such as a
guaranteed-audience size of women aged 18 to 49 -- and move
to far broader guarantees, such as the number of households
watching.
   "I don't think there's just one way to do it," says NBC's
Mr. Hoffner. "Procter &amp; Gamble has different needs from
McDonald's, so it will give us opportunities to have a
dialogue. There's an opportunity for all of us to be
creative."
   "There has to be some acknowledgment that the Nielsen
number isn't a hard, bankable number anymore, and that it has
to be interpreted with some cushioning," adds Jerry Dominus,
a CBS senior vice president. Reinforcing the networks'
contention that the ratings system is flawed, a
network-sponsored study released yesterday claims the current
system misses more than a million viewers each weekend. The
study, sponsored by ABC, NBC, ESPN and Nielsen, said those
viewers were watching at work, in hotels and at bars.
   The networks have attempted to peel back the guarantee
system before, but without lasting success. Two years ago,
when the people-meter measurement system was first introduced
and resulted in a drop in children's-TV ratings, ABC withdrew
age-specific guarantees for its kids' programming. Instead,
it offered to guarantee the number of households tuned in, a
far broader measure. But ABC's bold stand lasted only one
season, and a year later it was back to guaranteeing specific
audiences -- just the way advertisers wanted it.
   It isn't clear whether the networks will have any more
success this time around, especially considering how
important prime time is to major advertisers -- and
especially when sponsors can turn to the networks' pesky
rivals, such as cable-TV and the Fox network. And those
advertisers are prepared to fight.
   "There's going to be major concerns about any attempt on
the networks' part to move away from guarantees," says Rich
Hamilton, a media executive with D'Arcy, Masius, Benton &amp;
Bowles, whose clients include Procter &amp; Gamble. "Guarantees
are a component of advertising value. If you're an
advertiser, why would you want to walk away from them"?
   In any case, the way advertisers buy network TV is clearly
changing. Even as the networks attempt to do away with
standard guarantees, they're working with advertisers to come
up with individually tailored ad plans. Last week, General
Motors agreed to a three-year ad package with NBC valued at
more than $500 million, allowing it to lock into some of the
network's most popular shows for the long run. Other big
advertisers have been mulling the package with thoughts of
following, if not this season, then perhaps next.
   ABC, meanwhile, is considering package deals of its own,
despite a reluctance in the past. ABC had rebuffed General
Motors, which wanted to discuss the same kind of multiyear,
multiday-part package that it agreed to with NBC. "With our
brightening ratings future in prime time, we thought it was
best not to mortgage our future," says Mr. Keever. But he
said he would be open to discussing one-year packages that
would go across day-parts, perhaps including daytime, prime
time and news.

   `Interactive TV' Test Is Watched to See
   Who's More Than Remotely Interested

   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Lately, Donald Ainsworth hasn't been
getting enough sleep. Not because of insomnia, but because he
stays up for "Midnight Blackjack" -- a television game show
in which viewers, using a special remote control, play
against the on-screen dealer.
   Crouched in front of his TV late one evening, the
30-year-old dairy company employee can't call it quits --
even though the cards aren't going his way. "You're getting
pretty bad," the TV dealer taunts after winning another hand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Ainsworth is one of 300 cable-TV customers here taking
part in an eight-week experiment in "interactive TV," a
technology that is unproven, but progressing. With
interactive TV, couch potatoes don't just watch the tube,
they tell it what to do by pushing certain buttons, which
trigger a choice of broadcast "responses."
   Through ACTV Inc., a fledgling New York company that's
conducting the experiment with Mr. Ainsworth, viewers not
only participate in game shows, but can choose different
camera angles while watching live sports events, select an
exercise program personalized for their age and weight, get
advice from panelists on "Teen Talk Forum," or decide to hear
"clean" or "dirty" jokes on comedy shows.
   "It's a revolution," says James Demers, 53, a Springfield
cook who is also taking part in the ACTV test, which ends
this week. "You get the sensation that they geared {the
programs} just to you."
   A handful of small entertainment companies has been
exploring the field of interactive television for about a
decade. Interactive Network Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.,
for example, has tested for more than two years a system that
allows home viewers to compete with game shows on regular
television. But ACTV's system is one of the most advanced to
date, and it's already on the market in Montreal.
   Advertisers are watching ACTV's Springfield study with
great interest because, with its technology, ACTV can keep
track of each household's selections. This could enable
advertisers to use interactive TV to target their commercials
only to homes that fit the right demographics. "From a
marketing perspective, everybody is trying to move to a more
efficient media. I think {interactive TV} will be an
important step in that direction," says Martin Nisenholtz,
president of Interactive Marketing, a division of Ogilvy &amp;
Mather Advertising.
   Some big spenders in the ad world are interested in the
concept, ACTV says in a prospectus for a public stock
offering. Among the companies evaluating ACTV's technology
are McCann-Erickson Worldwide advertising agency, General
Motors Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., the prospectus says.
   But interactive TV has a long way to go to prove itself.
Participants in the experiment received the service for free
-- and some say they'd be reluctant to pay extra for the
novelty. Others got bored after a few weeks, saying that the
programming was limited and repetitious. "I'd rather watch
ESPN," says Paul Huckins, a 35-year-old mail handler.
   And there are clearly bugs to work out, as equipment
breakdowns at some homes attest. "They came twice to fix it
and it broke again," says Denise Bolduc, a 30-year-old retail
worker.
   Indeed, media specialists say there is reason for caution,
at least in the near future. Interactive TV has
"extraordinary" potential for hooking the audience, says
Everette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies at Columbia University. But, he notes, "there's
an assumption here that somehow the public wants to choose
its own fare . . . like a book or magazine selection. Whether
it applies to an electronic market isn't yet clear."
   Nor is it profitable at this point. ACTV, struggling to
develop the business, has shown losses for the past five
years. Indeed, its prospectus said: "There can be no
assurance that the company will generate significant
operating revenues in the future. The likelihood of the
success of the company must be considered in light of the
problems, costs, difficulties and delays encountered in
connection with . . . the development of new and unproven
technologies." ACTV declined to discuss any aspect of the
business, including the Springfield test, because of the
offering.
   ACTV first installed its technology last year in about
3,000 Montreal homes. The service, which adds the equivalent
of about $16 to regular monthly cable-TV bills, is offered
through Le Groupe Videotron, a cable company that is also a
minority partner in ACTV.
   To permit the viewer to "personalize" the programming,
ACTV's technology simultaneously transmits several previously
videotaped versions of the same show. Each viewer, using a
special remote control, chooses the variation he wants or
responds to multiple-choice quiz-show questions -- which
prompt different footage depending on the viewer's answer.
While the on-screen reactions to viewers' answers are canned,
they're meant to give the impression that characters on the
television actually know how a question has been answered: In
shows where viewers are pitted against on-screen contestants,
for instance, players on TV sometimes laugh at viewers' wrong
answers.
   Watching a game show called "College All-Stars," Marie
Pratt, a 32-year-old teacher, sits with remote in hand. "We
in the United States call them hurricanes. In Japan they call
them..." "Kamikazes," Ms. Pratt shouts, punching in one of
the multiple-choice answers. A TV player stifles a laugh as
the game-show host replies, "You at home are wrong." (The
answer is typhoons.)
   Playing against TV contestants is fun, Ms. Pratt says. "If
I watch Jeopardy {on regular TV}, I'm usually answering
anyway," she says. "I just don't get credit for it."
   Mr. Ainsworth says interactive TV is the best way to watch
the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League. He can
choose from four different live camera angles -- from a
close-up of the goalie to an overhead shot of the entire rink
-- whenever he wants.
   His wife, Lynn, a 30-year-old secretary, likes the
personalized workout she can get on "Exercise Chalet," one of
the interactive programs. At the start of the show, she
programs in her age and weight and chooses among the three
exercise levels (she chooses beginner); this tells the
television which signal to send to her TV, and the on-screen
instructor starts doing exercises best suited for that level.
   Similarly, a music-video program gives viewers a choice of
what they want to hear, instead of making them settle for
whatever happens to be on.
   One shortcoming of the current programming, some say, is
that there still isn't enough variety. The schedule of shows
is the same almost every day, and there isn't any interactive
programming between 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. most days or
between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m.
   But ACTV believes programming would broaden as the market
does. "If the subscriber reaction to ACTV in Springfield is
as positive as we expect," Michael Freeman, chairman of ACTV,
said in a statement, "we'll expand the market for ACTV as
quickly as we can."

   Inflation May Be Worse Than Data Show

   NEW YORK -- While inflation gnaws at consumers and policy
makers, some economists say the actual bite on many budgets
may be even worse than the statistics' bark.
   The consumer price index jumped 0.5% in March, pushing the
annual inflation rate to a hefty 8.5% for the first quarter.
But economists and financial planners say spendable incomes
are often pinched even tighter by difficult-to-measure,
extra-inflationary forces that include: runaway property
taxes in many areas; a spate of state and local tax
increases; soaring health costs; and rising tuition fees.
Furthermore, changing demographics may present a somewhat
different market basket than the CPI's, as index weightings
haven't been adjusted for several years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Jackman, chief of the CPI branch of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, concedes that the index's recent jump may
reflect catch-up on recent property tax increases. "Some of
the increase in `owners' equivalent rent' in March is at
least being linked to property tax increases in the
Northeast," says Mr. Jackman. Unlike sales taxes, which
immediately pass through the CPI, property tax increases can
lag because of the complicated way housing costs are
calculated. Rather than directly measure the diverse,
mercurial costs of homeownership, the index uses a "flow of
services" approach that calculates costs through the
so-called rental equivalent.
   No one knows for sure just how large a factor property
taxes are in the housing component that makes up a hefty 42%
of the CPI. "There is really no way to decompose {the rental
equivalent}," Mr. Jackman notes. Of course, housing is also
one of the biggest deflationary factors in family budgets
that enjoy low-cost, fixed-rate mortgages on homes that have
soared in value in recent years.
   Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economist and
an authority on inflation, maintains that excess capacity in
the rental market may be stalling the passthrough of higher
property taxes in the CPI. While individual homeowners may be
hit with big, immediate property tax increases, rental
properties may not pass through all of a tax increase at
once, creating a sort of margin squeeze.
   "When you have a lot of excess capacity in the rental
market, the cost pressures can't come forward," says Mr.
Ratajczak. He notes that the sharp jump in March's CPI
indicates that property tax increases are starting to pass
through to the index. "If April is like March, {the tax boost
lag} will probably catch up," he says.
   Quirks in the CPI could be significant because the index
is a pervasive indicator. Among other things, it indicates
the effectiveness of government economic policy; affects the
wages of three million union workers covered by collective
bargaining pacts; and influences income of 60 million
Americans who receive benefits as diverse as Social Security
payments and school lunches.
   But temporary flukes in the CPI are only one of the
talking points as economists try to match statistics with
real-life budgets. Sales taxes, for instance, are escalating
around the country as deficit-ridden states try to compensate
for federal cutbacks and a cooler economy. Unlike property
taxes, sales taxes immediately pass through the CPI's market
basket -- directly adding to inflation and muddying some
outlooks.
   "While a slowdown in the economy is presumably helpful in
defusing inflation, it may also add some costs and raise
inflation through higher taxes," says Robert Chandross, an
economist at Lloyd's Bank, New York.
   A recent fiscal survey by the National Association of
State Budget Officers pegs federally mandated increases in
health care costs, for the third year in a row, as a chief
reason for revenue shortages in at least 20 states. And
health costs were again recently blamed for pushing up the
first-quarter employment cost index. The overall index rose
by 5.5%; health costs jumped more than 12%.
   The CPI's Mr. Jackman sticks by the integrity of his
index. But he concedes medical costs are a headache to
calculate. "The problem revolves around trying to maintain
the same health coverage from one year to the next. One ends
up measuring implicitly, by measuring the cost of services,"
he says.
   Francis H. Schott, chief economist at Equitable Financial
Cos., New York, adds: "It's desperately difficult to measure
medical costs," particularly because technology has improved
medical care tremendously. Organ transplants, for instance,
"cost ungodly sums." But those costs "should be discounted by
the quality, which nobody knows how to measure," Mr. Schott
adds. For instance, it's much simpler to adjust for the
quality upgrade an air bag gives an auto than to fine-tune
for improved transplant technology.
   While it's true the CPI was never intended to reflect
specific inflation felt by special demographic groups such as
the elderly, some analysts believe that today's demographics
herd more people into these special economic categories than
statistics such as the CPI indicate. The formula used to
compile the CPI was last updated in 1987, using 1980 census
data and consumer spending patterns from the period 19821984.
The next update is planned around 1995.
   "Does it hit a lot more people on certain items? Sure,"
says Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., New York. But can the extra-inflationary
"hits" be apportioned scientifically? No, says Mr. Yardeni,
who has written much on the demographics of the baby boomers.
He says there are too many offsetting factors to consider.
"My own individual household perspective on it is: If I'm
paying less in federal taxes but more in local and state
taxes, it's more good-news, bad-news offset," he says.
   Karen Schaeffer, a financial planner in Bethesda, Md.,
says, "There's clearly a group of people getting a double or
triple whammy right now." The over-40 babyboomers, for
instance, can be hit with college expenses for offspring at
the same time they are asked to give financial aid to ailing
parents.
   Ms. Schaeffer adds that college costs are rising so fast
they are difficult to track. "We've had to change our thought
process in doing our financial plans. We inched {college cost
estimates} up 6%, then 7%, now 8%." College cost surveys say
tuition is expected to jump as much as 11% in 1990 -- beating
inflation for the 10th year in a row.
   To find out how these extra-inflationary budget-busters
can add up, one need look no further than the front door of
Robert L. Freeman of Gaithersburg, Md. Mr. Freeman, 41 years
old, and his wife Carol, also 41, have two children in
college; they live in highly taxed Montgomery County, and
they help out with medical expenses of an incapacitated
elderly uncle. How does the family cope with annual college
expenses of about $26,500 and the management of inhome health
care that has "at least doubled" in cost over the past 10
years?
   "By saving and working two jobs," says Mr. Freeman, who
has been a firefighter for 18 years. Around the 24-hours on,
48-hours off firehouse schedule, he has built a couple of
businesses and currently works at a local lawn equipment
distributorship. Mrs. Freeman also works.
   "I'm not crying poor-mouth," says Mr. Freeman, noting that
his property has appreciated quite nicely over the years.
"But we don't go out to dinner two or three times a week and
the kids aren't sent off to Europe in the summer. The kids
come home for summer and they work," he says. The couple have
taken out a home equity credit line but haven't drawn on it
and don't plan to unless they have an emergency.

   Unisys' Caswell
   Regigns as Head
   Of Mainframes

   Hollis Caswell, the widely respected head of Unisys
Corp.'s mainframe business, resigned to run a start-up
business that makes electronics using superconductors.
   Mr. Caswell, 58 years old, said in an interview that his
decision didn't relate to the heavy losses that the computer
and defense-electronics company has posted over the past year
and a half. Still, executives who have worked with him said
his departure is a loss for Unisys.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "He was one of my bosses at IBM, and one of the best
bosses I've worked for," said Paul Stern, chief executive
officer of Northern Telecom Ltd. "He's a terrific guy, and I
don't say that lightly."
   Mr. Caswell wins points inside Unisys for his work in
bringing to market the much-delayed replacements to the 1100
series of mainframes made by Sperry Corp., which merged with
Burroughs Corp. in 1986 to form Unisys. Although there was a
last-minute hiccup that delayed the midsized models by three
months, Unisys executives said the process went much more
smoothly after Mr. Caswell took over. Customers generally
compliment the machines -- even as some consider moving to
hardware for which there is more software available.
   "There are some real nice things about the hardware,
things that IBM doesn't have," said James H. Johnson,
director of financial reporting and budgeting at Giant Eagle
Inc., a supermarket chain based in Pittsburgh. He added,
though, that "There aren't many {software} systems that run
on the Unisys hardware. That's one of the problems."
   Mr. Caswell will become chief executive of Hypres Inc.,
Elmsford, N.Y., a closely held concern with about 40
employees and $5 million a year in revenue. He said the move
gives him a fresh challenge and returns him to an early
interest of his: He worked on superconductor research when he
joined International Business Machines Corp. in the late
1950s and later did extensive research on
superconductor-based devices known as Josephson junctions.
Mr. Caswell said he thinks Hypres has a good chance to get
its devices used in such equipment as telephone switches,
which may require the huge increases in speed that
superconductors can provide.
   Unisys, which is based in Blue Bell, Pa., said that
responsibility for its mainframe operations will be shifted
to Cyril Yansouni, 47, who will also retain control of its
personal-computer and workstation businesses. A spokesman
said the company had been considering merging the two
operations, in any case. Unisys, like many computer
companies, is focusing primarily these days on making it
easier for all types of machines to communicate with one
another, and the company hopes the combination will
facilitate that.
   Mr. Yansouni, who had been a senior vice president,
becomes one of two executive vice presidents.
   Unisys also said that it consolidated some of its
marketing operations to improve the coordination among them.
Reto Braun, president of the Pacific Asia Americas division,
was also given responsibility for the general U.S. marketing
operation and one targeted at corporate customers. Mr. Braun,
48, also becomes an executive vice president; he, too, had
been a senior vice president.

   WASHINGTON -- Back in January, the Securities and Exchange
Commission met to consider the fate of one James O'Hagan, a
respected Minneapolis lawyer who allegedly had run afoul of
securities laws. The commission's investigators insisted he
was an insider trader who bought Pillsbury Co. stock on the
secret knowledge that his firm's client, Grand Metropolitan
PLC, planned to bid for the company.
   Now, SEC attorneys were trying to persuade the
commissioners to let them file charges against Mr. O'Hagan.
An easy decision, concluded the commission's new chairman,
Richard Breeden. "This man," he said sternly to his staff,
"should be left naked, homeless and without wheels."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Insider-trading charges were soon filed. A lawyer for Mr.
O'Hagan says his client is innocent, and the case is still
pending. But one thing is certain: Guilty or not, Mr. O'Hagan
is dealing with a new -- and tougher -- SEC.
   Spurred by a growing national call for a crackdown on
white-collar crime, and led by an ambitious, publicity-hungry
chairman, the SEC has suddenly gotten more hard-line with
people suspected of violating securities laws. It is charging
not just brokers and traders but their supervisors,
accountants and lawyers. And it is taking more securities
cases to trial.
   The harder line is in keeping with the Bush
administration's style of deregulation: Ease the rules, but
come down hard on those who violate them. "I tend to be
somewhat skeptical that some of our traditional remedies are
adequate to prevent improper conduct," says Mr. Breeden, a
slim, intense 40-year-old.
   Mr. Breeden has been at the SEC less than eight months,
but his attitude already has trickled down. Carmen Lawrence,
the enforcement chief for the SEC's largest regional office
in New York, says that, looking back over recent years and
the many wrist-slappings the SEC handed out, it is clear that
"the deterrent effect of what we were doing wasn't great."
So, she says, "the view now is to make it cost."
   According to defense lawyers and SEC staff members, the
commission under Mr. Breeden is rejecting settlements
negotiated by its staff that it previously would have
rubber-stamped. The pacts it does approve tend to be stiffer
than in the past. Five years ago, for example, a broker who
peddled unregistered securities -- a typical problem in
penny-stock cases -- could have expected to settle for a
30-day suspension from the securities industry. Now, the norm
is six months. Repeat offenders are likely to be barred from
the securities business for life.
   "We see it every day in our negotiating," says Arthur
Mathews, a prominent defense lawyer at Wilmer, Cutler &amp;
Pickering in Washington. "The staff demands more in sanctions
because the commission is demanding more. I've seen the
commission turn down settlements negotiated with the staff
that the staff certainly would have taken."
   Some say the SEC is making up for the weaker enforcement
program of the early 1980s, when Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken,
Dennis Levine and others made Wall Street a playground for
lawbreakers. Others contend that the SEC simply is responding
to a surge in financial crime. "The 1980s were such a boom in
the financial markets that the stock market became
everybody's opportunity," says Commissioner Mary Schapiro.
"That kind of opportunity breeds fraudsters."
   The SEC has cracked down in the past, but never appeared
so eager to litigate, even in the days of legendary
enforcement chief Stanley Sporkin. Back then, in the 1970s,
the SEC was inclined to initiate many cases, but husband its
resources by settling virtually all of them.
   SEC staffers now say that, over the years, the agency may
have become too eager to settle. "We probably let ourselves
go down a road of lesser settlements," says current
enforcement director William McLucas. "Now we are moving back
up the ladder." To prove it isn't bluffing, and ensure its
own effectiveness, the agency "has to be willing to litigate
a case to conclusion," adds Mr. Breeden.
   This latest swing toward severity began in the mid-1980s,
when the SEC finally began cracking down on big insider
traders such as Messrs. Levine and Boesky. Mr. Breeden has
given that drive a big push. These days, his SEC rarely
settles a case without full repayment of ill-gotten gains.
Not having the money isn't a defense any longer; the SEC
encourages defendants to take out loans to pay back the
gains.
   If a defendant says he can't afford full reimbursement, he
must produce financial statements proving his case. Several
times in the past few months, insiders say, Mr. Breeden has
argued against leniency and insisted defendants seek the
protection of bankruptcy laws if they need to. It isn't clear
whether any defendants actually have been pushed that far.
   The uncompromising posture isn't without costs. A growing
number of defendants are balking at the tougher terms, and
litigation has ballooned, pushing the SEC's pending caseload
to 70 cases from 18 just four years ago. The caseload now is
near capacity, and is eating up limited resources.
   And the more SEC cases that go to litigation, the greater
risk the agency runs of significant reversals. Just last
week, the agency lost an insider-trading conviction on an
appeal by former stockbroker Robert Chestman. The appellate
decision undercut a major SEC rule on insider trading.
   Moreover, not everybody is convinced that Mr. Breeden
really is a tougher cop. Some wonder whether the commission
is just jawboning to cast itself as a more formidable
negotiator in settlement talks. "To me it's business as
usual," scoffs Washington securities lawyer Wallace Timmeny.
"I don't see anything except tough talk."
   But others in the front lines unhappily report that Mr.
Breeden is acting as well as talking. Recalls one individual
close to deposed junk-bond king Michael Milken: "Breeden
wanted to boil Michael in oil."
   Even relatively small-potatoes cases are coming under the
hot spotlight. On Tuesday, for example, the SEC charged in
federal court in Chicago that the son of B.F. Saul II, the
chairman of a big Maryland thrift institution, passed along
inside information about his father's acquisition in 1988 of
a real-estate investment trust. The 28-year-old son, Frank,
didn't make any money on the alleged violation, the SEC says,
but violated a supposed duty to his father by tipping off his
roommate, who made a $38,000 profit by buying shares in the
trust before the takeover.
   The elder Mr. Saul says that, under oath, the roommate
swore he "didn't get anything from my son." Frank Saul
independently took a lie detector test, passed that, and
offered to take another from the SEC, the senior Mr. Saul
says. The SEC rejected that offer, he adds.
   "I think it's just the bureaucracy run wild," he says.
"The charges are untrue, and we're not about to cop a plea.
Who would want that blemish on their record?"
   But the SEC is adamant. "A lot of people come in and say
their dog ate their homework," says Thomas Newkirk, the
agency's chief litigator. The Sauls' explanation, he
contends, "just doesn't hold up."
   Some attorneys worry that this new inclination to take no
prisoners may lead the agency to act overzealously. Take, for
example, the commission's decision in January to charge
several foreign firms with insider trading in Rorer Group
Inc. securities. The charge stirred plenty of negative
publicity for the defendants but, so far, hasn't gotten very
far in court. Late last month, a federal judge in Manhattan
denied the SEC a preliminary injunction it sought against two
of the defendants to prevent their selling of their Rorer
securities. After that decision, the SEC, citing a lack of
evidence, voluntarily dismissed its case against one of them,
Fondation Hai, a Lichtenstein-based foundation.
   "The filing of this complaint without any investigation
was unduly hasty, if not irresponsible," contends Andrew
Levander, a New York attorney representing Fondation Hai.
   Clearly, Chairman Breeden, who joined the commission last
October, has brought a fresh eye to enforcement decisions. He
isn't an alumnus of the SEC, and isn't a member of the
unofficial club of securities lawyers who take a proprietary
view of the agency. The son of a greeting-card salesman, he
graduated from Harvard Law School and then practiced law in
New York and Washington, D.C. In 1980, he worked in the
Reagan campaign. After holding several White House posts, he
helped Mr. Bush prepare for the 1988 primaries by playing
Jack Kemp in practice debates.
   President Bush rewarded Mr. Breeden with the chairmanship
of the SEC. Called savvy by some and arrogant by others, Mr.
Breeden moved quickly to reshape the commission in his image.
He is pushing hard in Congress for broader SEC enforcement
powers and is fighting to steal oversight authority from a
cousin of the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
He has positioned himself as an ambassador of capitalism,
advising Soviet and Eastern European officials on
establishing or expanding their stock exchanges. Staffers
complain he is more inclined to spend four hours with the
Hungarian finance minister than 20 minutes on important
agency issues.
   Mr. Breeden's domineering approach -- some at the SEC
privately call him King Richard -- sharply contrasts with
that of his immediate predecessor, the professorial David
Ruder, who allowed his staff to run the show, deferring to
its expertise. Unlike most of his predecessors, for whom the
SEC job was generally the culmination of a career in
securities law, Mr. Breeden is said to long for higher
office. He is mentioned as a future candidate for Treasury
secretary, and is said by some to have designs on the Supreme
Court. Indeed, some Washington insiders say his tough stance
reflects his ambition as much as his conviction. "Everybody
who comes in wants to put on his or her brand," shrugs Mr.
Timmeny, a former SEC enforcement attorney. "The guy's just
trying to make his mark."
   Mr. Breeden says his experience as Mr. Bush's point man on
the savings and loan crisis shaped his views on financial
crime. He believes inadequate federal oversight, shady
dealings and incompetent management almost destroyed that
industry.
   So, when Mr. Breeden took over at the SEC last October,
one of his first moves was to create two task forces: One to
scrutinize public filings of banks and thrift institutions,
the other to bring cases against wrongdoers at those
institutions. He also enlarged his office, had additional
phone lines installed, and brought together market-watching
computers to create a "command center" for times of crisis.
He ordered key aides to wear beepers or carry cordless
phones.
   At the commission table, he immediately started making
changes, too. His first demand: Violators must pay interest
on all illegal gains. "On virtually Day One, Case One, he
said: `Where is the interest?'" recalls Commissioner Edward
Fleischman. "Now it's not even something you think about
twice. It must be in there." If the government doesn't charge
interest, the chairman argues, it's essentially making
interest-free loans to crooks.
   Mr. Breeden can be hard on his own people, too. One agency
official recounts a meeting at which the SEC staff didn't
have clear proof that a defendant truly needed the drawn-out
repayment schedule his lawyers had proposed. Mr. Breeden
glared at the staffers. "Woe to the next person who comes
before this commission with this kind of settlement," he
warned.
   The staff is getting the message. Ms. Lawrence says
defendants have made settlement offers on about half the
litigation pending in the New York office. But the offers
have been rejected. "They aren't acceptable under the new
guidelines," she says.
   One SEC lawyer describes a pending case in which a former
broker embezzled as much as $500,000 from customers. The
broker offered to settle by disgorging the amount. The agency
refused, insisting on collecting full interest and barring
the broker from the industry. "We didn't even bring the case
to the commission," the lawyer says. "It's clear to us that
there are certain components to settlements now."
   The Chestman case notwithstanding, the SEC isn't having
much trouble winning when it goes to court. Mr. Newkirk, the
agency's chief litigator, estimates the SEC wins roughly
two-thirds of its trial cases.
   That is partly because federal courts are turning the
screws on defendants by broadening securities laws. In 1987,
for example, the agency decided to make a test case out of
First City Financial Corp. and its vice president, Marc
Belzberg. First City had acquired more than 5% of the stock
of Ashland Oil Co., but waited 13 days longer than permitted
to file the required disclosure documents with the SEC.
During those 13 days, First City loaded up on additional
Ashland shares. It eventually sold the entire stake back to
Ashland for a hefty profit. The SEC sued the firm and Mr.
Belzberg, contending that they wouldn't have profited as much
if they had properly disclosed the stake.
   For the first time in a disclosure case, the SEC sought
disgorgement of profit, a penalty previously imposed only for
egregious violations such as insider trading. "It was the
type of case we would have settled five years ago for no
money," Mr. Newkirk says.
   The SEC won the case last year, forcing First City to give
up $2.7 million. "It has become a landmark case," Mr. Newkirk
says. Now, the SEC routinely forces firms and individuals who
settle to pay back funds gained from disclosure violations.
   Then came the Milken case, the first big-league
enforcement test for the new chairman. He bruised more than a
few egos, nearly scuttled the settlement -- and wound up
winning a tougher set of terms than Mr. Milken had expected,
according to lawyers familiar with the case.
   By the time the SEC got into the act, attorneys for Mr.
Milken already had agreed with Justice Department prosecutors
that, if Mr. Milken chose to plead guilty, it would be to six
felony counts. Still left undecided, among other things, was
the size of his fine.
   Mr. Milken's attorneys were stunned by Mr. Breeden's
initial demands. He is understood to have asked that Mr.
Milken pay back nearly $1 billion. Mr. Milken's attorneys
threatened to break off negotiations. "There was no reason to
settle if he {Milken} could get the same deal by going to
trial," says one individual close to the Milken defense team.
The SEC, he says, "demanded total capitulation." Mr. Milken
ultimately settled for $600 million in fines and restitution.
   Mr. Milken's lawyers had also sought assurances from
Justice Department prosecutors that they would recommend
concurrent five-year sentences for all the counts Mr. Milken
pleaded to. But SEC officials, led by Mr. Breeden, demanded
-- and received -- a promise that prosecutors wouldn't
recommend any specific sentence, leaving open the possibility
that Mr. Milken could receive consecutive, and hence longer,
sentences for his crimes.
   In an interview, Mr. Breeden insists he wasn't intimately
involved in the Milken deliberations and that his enforcement
staff led the way. Nonetheless, sounding a refrain that's now
very familiar around the SEC, he added that the commission
had to be tough with Mr. Milken, that the punishment fit the
crime.
   Consider, he says, the part of the guilty plea in which
Mr. Milken acknowledged cheating investors of Finsbury Fund
Ltd., a mutual fund, by falsely reporting the prices of
trades and pocketing the difference. "If someone walked into
a hotel where Finsbury shareholders were staying, pulled out
a machine gun and robbed them, everyone would regard that as
a serious event," he says. "I regard this as equally
serious."

   Moscow Matchmakers Tell
   Women to Place Boors
   On Pedestal to Win Them

   MOSCOW -- Like a hen clucking at a chick, Bella Lukyanova
shoos a hopeful client into position before a video camera.
The customer, modestly clad in a plain knit skirt and blouse,
braces herself.
   "Shhhh]" Mrs. Lukyanova commands, pressing a finger to her
lips. A video is about to be made: a taped proposal of
marriage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. Lukyanova is a modern Soviet matchmaker. Her private
International Marriage Agency promises its female clientele
the moon -- or rather, the Man in the Moon. It seeks husbands
for them in the faraway West, where all the men are said to
be rich. Its videotapes, featuring 60 clients, will go to
dating agencies in the U.S., Canada and Australia if Mrs.
Lukyanova's grand plans go through. Although she has yet to
send a single tape abroad, and is extremely vague about her
Western contacts, she already has a catchy corporate name:
the "Moscow Matchmaker."
   "What do you think?" she asks. "I looked it up in my
English dictionary and saw the word `matchmaker.' Will men in
the West understand what it means?"
   Mrs. Lukyanova's international brand of matchmaking is a
novelty here. But matchmaking itself is an old tradition that
is being revived. Though the boomlet is biggest in the
budding private sector, Communist officials support it too.
Soviet planners fret over falling birth rates and rising
divorce rates in the western Soviet Union. Communism, they
reason, needs a cupid.
   The Moscow City Council already runs a marriage bureau, to
which lonely-hearts come to find mates in a 5,000-name card
file. But now private, Western-style dating agencies are
flourishing under such trendy names as "Dialogue" and "Union"
too. One, in the Ukraine, offers its clients videotapes,
counseling by "psychologists and sexologists," and
matchmaking on a computer identified as built by "future
radio-electronics engineers."
   Moscow newspapers are catching on, accepting personal ads
once rejected as Western decadence:
                                                                                                       

   I am expecting a baby in September. A blue-eyed brunette
32 years old, height 170 cm {5 feet 7}, higher education. I
hope to meet a kind and courageous man with no bad habits,
who would be capable of becoming a good husband and a father
to my baby. (Ad No.) 125565, Moscow.
                                                                                                       

   The best-known ancestor of today's matchmakers appeared a
century ago in the stories of Sholom Aleichim, a Ukrainian
author, and were popularized in the Broadway musical "Fiddler
on the Roof." The Aleichim tales of Tevye the Dairyman
depicted Ephraim the Matchmaker at work, promoting a match
with "a young man who is something special from special-land]
Top quality] This man is rich, chockfull of money." As it
turns out, the aged suitor flees town and his creditors.
   "Matchmakers, you know, can persuade a wall," Mr. Aleichim
writes.
   Arranged marriages still occur in parts of Soviet Central
Asia and the Transcaucasia region, says Tatiana Ryabycheva,
director of the Moscow City Council's Matchmaking Service. "I
can't say arranged marriages are bad," Mrs. Ryabycheva
allows. In time, love can develop.
                                                                                                       

   I would like to meet a kind, cheerful, responsive girl of
no more than 25 years old. About myself: Have graduated from
a vocational school, was married before, no children. Hobby:
Music, literature. One of the conditions of a future mate: A
move to the Polar North region in the near future. Moscow,
Central Post Office, c/o Sergei A. Shumskiy.
                                                                                                       

   Mrs. Ryabycheva is from the modern Soviet school of
matchmaking. A psychologist, she opened Moscow's first and
only official matchmaking service in 1985. In her small,
rundown office, the thoughtful, plump brunette in black
leather boots settles behind her desk for a chat. "Coffee?"
she offers, reaching for a jar of instant and her electric
kettle.
   From her client list of 5,000, she says, she arranges
about 100 marriages a year. And that isn't easy. In her
files, women outnumber men by a ratio of 3 to 2 -- a
demographic vestige of the millions of men slaughtered in the
Great Patriotic War 45 years ago. Many female clients bring
unromantic baggage, such as children from a previous
marriage. Many others are in their 30s and 40s, with
established careers and single-woman habits. However hungry
for a husband, they can't stomach the spoiled, domineering
boors they meet normally. Her advice to these lovelorn ladies
is simple: Yield.
   "We teach them to place the man on a pedestal," she says.
However non-feminist it sounds, she says, in the Soviet Union
"it's easier for a woman to adapt. Men are extremely
conservative."
                                                                                                       

   I am looking forward to meeting a man of deep culture,
broad education, energetic, regarding himself as a highly
moral person, who would like to make a true family based on
the traditions of the Russian intelligentsia. About myself:
Height 169 {about 5 feet 7}, 39 years old, energetic, work in
a university. Absolutely provided for. 141009, passport No.
XX111-IK 509121.
                                                                                                       

   As the videotape rolls, the international matchmaker, Mrs.
Lukyanova, cues a client to speak into the microphone about
her dream husband. Off-camera, she holds a Western "beat box"
aloft: It provides background music to tug the heartstrings
of wealthy, Western viewers -- a schmaltzy Russian folk tune
with balalaikas and accordions.
   "I have big experience in television," Mrs. Lukyanova
boasts. She is a medical-news reporter on Soviet TV who, like
many Muscovites these days, is dabbling in free enterprise.
   She certainly appears to have grasped the profit part of
capitalism. She charges her clients 280 rubles -- a month's
wage. If their videotape snares a Western mate, the
prospective bride will pay 1,000 rubles more. The husband
will pay, too, in hard currency. While Mrs. Lukyanova has
already accepted her clients' payments up front, for reasons
that are unclear, she refuses to disclose any details about
how, or even whether, the Western end of the operation will
work.
   But some in the West believe her video Valentines will
find a warm reception in the post-Cold War world, where
things Soviet are becoming chic. Like the mail-order Asian
brides sometimes advertised in New York newspapers, the
Soviet women may appeal to some men as old-fashioned
homebodies, happy to be barefoot, pregnant and in the
kitchen. "There's a certain percentage {of U.S. males} who
say they don't like American women because they're so
business-oriented," explains Kurt Morrow, a franchisee of Los
Angeles-based dating service "Great Expectations," which
boasts 80,000 members.
   But the view of such international romance is a bit dimmer
back home. In Stalin's day, Mrs. Lukyanova's clients would
have had to honeymoon in Siberia, because marrying a
foreigner was illegal. And even now, emigrating with a
foreign spouse is difficult -- and controversial. Mrs.
Lukyanova for instance, arouses suspicion and even outrage
among the others who work in the Moscow art gallery where she
has rented space for videotaping.
   "I don't like this woman at all," says a young gallery
attendant, Alla Logova. The matchmaker, she says, is preying
on her clients' yen for foreign climes and rich husbands. And
no matter how difficult life is becoming in Moscow, the women
shouldn't leave. "They should stay here and work to makes
things better."
   The prospective brides disagree, of course. One, awaiting
her taping session, sits filling out a matchmaking
application. She wears her best dress, a flowing violet gown
with black velvet bodice. A matching choker necklace supports
a small black onyx stone. She appears flustered on being
introduced to a male Western visitor. "Oh, I must get
serious," she says, removing her glasses and rising from her
chair.
   She identifies herself as Marie, a 29-year-old secretary
at a television station. And to prospective husbands, she
says, she would describe herself as "slim, romantic, and
talkative. I like sewing my own clothes." She doesn't dislike
Moscow, she says, but simply hasn't had any luck finding a
husband here. So she thought she'd take a chance on Mrs.
Lukyanova. "Nobody can guarantee success, but it's
interesting to try."
   And what kind of husband does she want? "A man I can
trust. Honest, kind and clever -- and handsome." She pauses,
then adds: "Money isn't so important."
   She giggles at her questioner: "Are you married?"

   Aggressive Expansion Area
   Includes Soviet Union;
   Improved Results Seen

   ORLANDO, Fla. -- After a bleak 1989, Eastman Kodak Co.
expects improved sales and earnings this year, and plans to
expand aggressively into Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The photographic, chemicals and pharmaceuticals concern
didn't offer a specific earnings forecast at its annual
meeting here. But company executives said they expect "higher
sales, better earnings and improved cash flow" in the latter
part of 1990, as benefits kick in from a recent cost-cutting
program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last year, Kodak's net income plunged 62% to $529 million,
or $1.63 a share, including an $875 million restructuring
charge. Kodak also was hurt by sharp earnings declines in its
information-systems business and other divisions. Sales
increased 8% to $18.3 billion.
   In the first quarter, net fell 6% to $199 million, or 61
cents a share, which was a better result than analysts
expected. Sales fell to $4.11 billion from $4.21 billion.
   While it hopes to improve earnings this year by boosting
film prices and cutting operating costs, Kodak is looking to
Eastern European markets for profit and revenue. The
Rochester, N.Y., company -- citing a "large, pent-up demand
for high-quality photographic products and services" in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union -- said it expects to
increase imaging sales there by 20% annually in coming years.
   Currently, the company has a very small presence in those
markets. However, a joint venture established last year in
Hungary has been "extremely successful" in providing film and
processing services to consumers and professional
photographers, Kodak executives said.
   A similar venture was launched six weeks ago in Poland,
and Kodak also is negotiating several joint ventures in the
Soviet Union for the sale of film, cameras and finishing
supplies.
   Kodak hopes to avoid a mistake it made in Japan, where it
was relatively late with aggressive marketing. "We're getting
established well ahead of the competition," said William F.
Fowble, group vice president-photographic products.
   Kodak also is counting on growth from several new
technologies, including hybrid products that combine film and
electronics.
   Film-based products "will remain Kodak's major earnings
generator for years to come, but we're also ready for the
electronic age," said Kay R. Whitmore, president, who will
take over as chairman and chief executive officer on June 1.
The 57-year-old Mr. Whitmore was named in December to succeed
Colby H. Chandler, who is retiring at age 65.
   Mr. Whitmore is expected to name a new president within 12
to 18 months.

   WASHINGTON -- Bank failures have slowed considerably this
year, said William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   As of Tuesday, 52 banks with assets of $4.7 billion had
failed in 1990. By contrast, at this time last year, 73 banks
with $19.7 billion in assets had failed or received FDIC
assistance in order to continue operating, Mr. Seidman said.
No banks have received such FDIC aid this year.

   Last year's figures included 20 bank subsidiaries of
Dallas-based MCorp, with assets of $15.6 billion. For all of
last year, 207 banks with $29 billion in assets failed or
were assisted by the FDIC.
   Mr. Seidman said in an interview that initial figures show
the FDIC's bank deposit-insurance fund had a loss of about
$800 million last year, larger than the $250 million-to-$500
million loss he predicted late last year. He said the larger
loss stemmed from greater-than-expected costs from the MCorp
failures and from the failure this year of Seamen's Bank for
Savings, based in New York. (Under its accounting rules, the
FDIC must account for some of those costs in its 1989
results.)
   That loss will leave the deposit-insurance fund with about
$13.2 billion, or about 0.7% of insured deposits. Government
policy is to try to maintain the fund at about 1.25% of
insured deposits. Final figures on the fund's performance
last year are to be released May 18.
   Mr. Seidman said the fund could increase somewhat during
this year, but the failure of a large bank would probably
cause a loss. He wouldn't say whether he was expecting a
large bank failure.
   Mr. Seidman, who is also chairman of the Resolution Trust
Corp., said the RTC may abandon its policy that permits
buyers of insolvent thrifts to repudiate rates paid on
certificates of deposit after two weeks. The RTC is the
agency charged with selling or liquidating hundreds of
insolvent thrifts taken over by the government.
   In a meeting scheduled for May 18, the agency will
consider requiring buyers to honor CD rates for three months,
he said. The policy has recently been recommended to the RTC
board by its staff, he said.
   The move would mean that buyers of insolvent thrifts would
know exactly the cost of funds from the market, Mr. Seidman
said, and that depositors -- often big-deposit brokers --
would have the assurance that their rates would be locked in
for at least 90 days after the thrift is sold. Depositors,
for example, would be able to compare rates at insolvent
thrifts with those of 90-day Treasury instruments, he said.
   Eliminating the uncertainty ultimately means lower costs
for obtaining funds and greater liquidity, Mr. Seidman said.
"If someone has uncertainty, they are going to require a
higher rate," he said.
   Mr. Seidman said the RTC's ambitious project to sell about
140 thrifts by the end of June to get the troubled
thrift-industry bailout off the ground is "on schedule."
   He said sales of assets separately from thrift
institutions were also moving forward, with about $600
million in sales last month. But he said rising interest
rates may make such asset sales more difficult in coming
weeks.

   Lindner-Run Firm
   Is Seeking Buyers
   For Radio Stations

   Great American Communications Co. is quietly shopping
around some of its radio properties.
   The move, by the Cincinnati company run by financier Carl
H. Lindner, underscores the pressure for cash facing the
highly leveraged company. Great American, which purchased
Taft Broadcasting Co. in October 1987 for about $1.5 billion,
had a $115.6 million loss in 1989 on revenue of $300.6
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Great American's long-term debt as of Dec. 31 totaled
$1.19 billion. In October, the company will have to pay $165
million as its first principal payments on that debt.
According to several individuals in the radio industry, Great
American would like to raise about $150 million in the sale
of the radio stations.
   The company owns 11 FM stations, six AM stations and five
network-affiliated TV stations. None of the television
stations are for sale. It also has a controlling interest in
Spelling Entertainment Inc., which produced such TV shows as
"The Love Boat" and "Dynasty," and Hanna-Barbera Productions
Inc., the producers of such animated shows as "The
Flintstones" and "The Jetsons."
   Carl J. Wagner, president of Great American Broadcasting
Co., a unit of Great American, couldn't be reached to
comment. However, several people close to the process said
Great American is interested in selling stations in Atlanta,
Kansas City, Mo., Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis. One
person with knowledge of the situation said that New York
radio broker Gary Stevens is handling the bidding for the
radio stations.
   Mr. Stevens declined to comment.
   "Great American will sell some media properties," said one
person. "Ultimately, it may not be the radio stations, but
something will go."
   Great American is asking from $50 million to $60 million
for its Atlanta FM station, $50 million for the Indianapolis
AM-FM properties, from $25 million to $30 million for
Columbus AM-FM stations, and about $30 million for the Kansas
City AM-FM properties.
   One person close to the process said Great American "is
pretty firm on these prices at this point. They're
independent thinkers and if they don't get the price they
want, they won't sell."
   There are other options to raise cash.
   In October, Spelling Entertainment put itself on the block
six months after control of the company went from founder
Aaron Spelling to Mr. Lindner. Spelling Entertainment
retained Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s Capital Markets unit and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to handle the possible sale.
   To date, Spelling Entertainment hasn't been sold. And it
isn't clear what price Spelling Entertainment could fetch.
   Spelling Entertainment has a library of one-hour
prime-time series, such as "Charlie's Angels" and "Hotel."
Such shows have recently not sold well in syndication, the
traditionally lucrative marketplace where shows are sold to
individual stations. Half-hour situation comedies now are the
hot properties in syndication sales to local stations.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Great American rose
37.5 cents to close at $6.625.

   Management:
   Should a CEO Bet His Job on an Upturn?

   Most chief executives start pointing fingers when their
companies stumble.
   Telxon Corp.'s chief executive did the opposite: He made
himself the fall guy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the company's annual meeting last fall, Raymond D. Meyo
pledged that he'd quit if Telxon's performance didn't improve
within a year. At that point, the maker of hand-held
computers had negative cash flow and no order backlog.
Inventories and accounts receivable had balooned, and efforts
to market bigger computer systems had stalled.
   Now, seven months later, the 46-year-old executive
contends his novel approach is helping to put the Akron,
Ohio, company back on track. Although Telxon will show a loss
for the year ended March 31, Mr. Meyo says a rebound is
occurring in the current quarter and he expects to be
vindicated through a return to profitability in the current
fiscal year.
   Even assuming he is vindicated, should chief executives
make such a vow, especially in public? Most management
experts say no, believing that the pitfalls far outweigh any
morale benefits that might result. While none can recall a
case where an executive made a similar promise, they believe
such a move is likely to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
   It's just not done, says Warren Bennis, a professor at the
University of Southern California and a leadership and
motivation consultant, who believes Mr. Meyo's promise is
"ridiculous." An executive who puts his job on the line
usually is foolhardy because it invites outsiders to judge
his performance. Other consultants agree, saying that
onlookers are hungry for blood and may be eager to see a
person fall.
   Mr. Meyo, the son of a coal miner, defends himself,
contending the company needed something drastic, and that he
wanted to set a tone of boldness. "We want to remain an
entrepreneurial company, with people who take risks and are
willing to fail," Mr. Meyo says. "If employees see that
you're not going to buckle, they get confidence."
   Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, director of the Center for Leadership
and Career Change at Emory University, concedes there's some
truth in that. "When things are bad and a CEO makes himself
the target, he achieves heroic stature which encourages
others to take risks," Mr. Sonnenfeld says. But, he adds,
what's intended to be a bold move aimed at inspiring
employees can easily be misinterpreted as the final act of a
desperate leader, or a signal that he's about to be fired.
The ultimatum can jolt an already unstable company into a
death spiral.
   "It's like a parent saying, `If you don't behave, I'll
commit suicide,'" says Harry Levinson, a Cambridge, Mass.,
psychologist and management consultant. Such a maneuver is an
attempt to manipulate employees' guilt, he says, and may
cause some to become resentful or angry.
   Mr. Meyo readily agrees that the move made him the focus
of heavy scrutiny and subjected him to a lot of pressure.
He's been exposed to increased grilling by analysts, the
media and others who suddenly saw him as the cause of all of
Telxon's problems. "Sometimes it's easier to solve things
internally," he says. Moreover, Mr. Meyo -- who acknowledges
he tended to direct the business with a heavy hand -- had to
deal with employees rooting for him to fall flat on his face.
   Mr. Meyo, an outgoing, driven man who often works 70-hour
weeks, isn't sure why he decided to publicly take the flak
for the company's problems. In fact, he says his announcement
at the annual meeting was largely impulsive; he'd intended to
tell only a few analysts of his decision. Even after he went
public with the pledge, he didn't think he had said anything
profound until several shareholders and board members asked
whether it was wise to "paint himself into a corner."
   But Mr. Meyo says he knew he had to light a fire -- under
himself and others. There were tell-tale signs that his top
lieutenants weren't managing well or were subtly working
against him. "Some of them were in over their heads, some
weren't psychologically committed to Telxon, and some didn't
believe they could give their heart and soul to Telxon as
long as Ray Meyo was there," the executive says.
   Shouldering responsibility for the company's direction
didn't keep him from harshly judging others. All four of the
company's vice presidents and its chief financial officer
were replaced. While a few of those five officials were
shuffled to new positions, others were among the 110
employees, or roughly 9% of the company's work force, that
Mr. Meyo has fired since last fall. "I've grieved over the
layoffs," he says.
   Based on the proxy statement for fiscal 1989, the latest
available, Mr. Meyo's financial stake in the company isn't
anything out of the ordinary. He or members of his family
owned just 1.5% of Telxon. He earned $225,000 in salary and
$150,000 in bonuses for the year.
   Of course, a chief executive is ultimately in charge of a
company and therefore isn't without blame, as Mr. Meyo
learned. He brought in a management-consulting firm, which
confronted him with a troubling revelation: that Mr. Meyo
was, in fact, central to some of Telxon's problems. The
consummate salesman ever since he and chairman Robert Myerson
saved the company from bankruptcy in 1978, Mr. Meyo had
focused solely on what he knew best. And the company's sales
successes blinded him to any festering problems. Through the
nine years ended in fiscal 1988, Telxon's revenues grew at a
hearty compounded annual rate of nearly 30%. But in the past
year or so, as the company began moving away from selling
hand-held computers that read bar codes to expanded systems
and sophisticated software, "we lost our focus," Mr. Meyo
says. "We got sloppy."
   Orders were being rushed through, often at steep
discounts, before profit margins and forecasts were hashed
out. Inventories piled up as Mr. Meyo emphasized customer
satisfaction over focusing on particular markets. "We tried
to be everything to everybody," he says.
   Now, Telxon's four separate sales forces have been melded
into one. Sales commissions are tied to profits rather than
overall dollars. And the company has built up a backlog of
orders in hand-held computers as well as its newer products.
Mr. Meyo won't disclose specific numbers, but says Telxon
will be profitable in each quarter of fiscal 1991.
   Mr. Meyo hasn't changed his strenuous work schedule, but
he's delegating more. "I had molded the company, and managers
were relying on me too much," he says, concluding that his
hands-on style was no longer working. "I've loosened
controls."
   "He is learning that he has to put quality people in every
job and let them do their jobs," says Julie Ganim, the new
vice president of corporate development.
   Mr. Meyo has set high goals for himself before. As a young
boy, he suffered from a speech defect so severe that only his
mother could understand him. To overcome the problem, he
practiced speaking in front of a mirror for hours on end and
vowed that one day he would earn his living as a salesman.
"My father said I've always enjoyed life the best under
pressure and I guess he's right."

   War Against Federal Waste Not Won

   President Bush wants budget negotiations "unfettered with
conclusions about positions taken in the past." In plain
English, Mr. Bush is distancing himself from his
"read-my-lips" no-new-taxes campaign pledge. By this action,
the president may be taking the country a step closer to
economic disaster.
   Mr. Bush may believe that soaring deficits will do more
harm to his political fortunes than will his capitulation on
the issue of new taxes. But if this is his view, it is
short-sighted, because new taxes will further depress an
already sluggish economy, ushering in a new recession for
which the president -- not Congress -- will be held
responsible.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Further, the notion that deficits are caused by low taxes
is a complete falsehood. In fiscal 1990, federal revenues
will increase by $70 billion as a result of economic growth.
We have chronic deficits because, while income tax revenues
have grown by 8% a year during the past decade, Congress has
increased spending by 11% a year.
   In January 1990, on national television, Charles A.
Bowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, Congress's
investigative agency, estimated that the federal government
squanders $180 billion of the taxpayers' money each year
through waste, fraud and mismanagement.
   This is an amount equal to more than one-third of
estimated personal income tax receipts in the current fiscal
year, and $50 billion more than the estimated $129.7 billion
in corporate income taxes. And it's nearly three times
current fiscal year's Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $64
billion.
   Just where is the waste? Perhaps a more appropriate
question is: Where isn't it? In November 1989, the General
Accounting Office reported that 17 major federal agencies had
"material weaknesses" in financial management and internal
control systems that "cost taxpayers billions of dollars"
every year. Specific losses cited by the GAO include: $6
billion at the Export Import Bank; $12 billion at the
Commodity Credit Corporation; $10-$20 billion in foreign
military sales; and $4 billion at the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
   The worst single example of government waste in our
nation's history is, without question, the savings and loan
fiasco. This was a pure product of the perverse incentives
built into the deposit insurance system, combined with lax
oversight by Congress and the federal regulators.
   Official estimates of the cost of the S&amp;L bailout now run
between $325 billion and $500 billion. This will more than
wipe out any savings that our nation may gain through the
so-called "peace dividend."
   In an April poll by the Wirthlin Group, taxpayers were
given a choice as to how they would reduce the budget
deficit. Among four options, the results were: eliminate
government waste, 64%; cut defense spending, 27%; cut
domestic programs, 4%; and raise taxes, 2%. Where should the
president and Congress begin? Citizens Against Government
Waste has compiled a list of waste-cutting initiatives that
could save taxpayers $280 billion over the next 5 years.
Nearly all of these initiatives come from reputable sources
readily accessible to the president and Congress, such as the
General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office,
the Grace Commission, the Heritage Foundation, and the
Inspectors General of the various federal departments. A few
examples:
   -- Requiring employers to make prompt payment of
accumulated payroll tax deposits of $3,000 or more would
generate approximately $14.5 billion in savings to the
Treasury, Social Security and Medicare Trust funds.
   -- Establishing user fees for federal services enjoyed
chiefly or exclusively by specific individuals or businesses
would save taxpayers $12 billion.
   -- Closing down strategically insignificant military bases
and properties would save taxpayers $5 billion.
   Alexander Hamilton wrote in the "Federalist Papers" that
the real test of a democratic form of government, the
necessary but not sufficient condition of its survival, would
be whether or not it could sustain a good administration, the
frugal and proper and wise use of the resources of the
government and the people. Wasteful spending by the federal
government has put the financial integrity of the U.S. at
risk, and is undermining the accountability of our political
system.

   Radio Tags Trigger
   Train Identification

<TEXT>
   RAILROAD executives think they've found a reliable way to
track freight cars.
   Currently, clerks at freight yards manually type car
identification numbers into computer consoles, producing an
error rate of between 1% and 3%. One result: Freight cars too
often wind up on the wrong train to the wrong destination,
delaying deliveries and angering shippers.
   So railroads are testing automated ID systems that use
radio-triggered devices, known as transponders, mounted on
the sides of freight cars. When a transponder is excited by a
low-frequency radio signal broadcast from a trackside
transmitter, it responds by sending out identifying
information. "It's like Morse code with a flashlight and a
mirror," says R. Rand Brown, a vice president of Amtech Inc.,
a Dallas company that sells the equipment.
   Steven Ditmeyer, who heads the research group of
Burlington Northern Inc.'s rail unit, says the technology
proved 99.99% accurate during tests in Minnesota. Both
Burlington and Norfolk Southern Corp. are putting radio tags
on their locomotives, but neither have decided whether to put
them on all their freight cars.
   Rail executives say it's just a matter of time before the
technology is adopted for all of the nation's 1.2 million
freight cars. In April, the Association of American Railroads
smoothed the way by deciding that each car should be equipped
with transponders on two sides, rather than just one, to help
identify cars on parallel tracks. Companies had been waiting
for a standard to be set.
   Some rail executives are still smarting from the
industry's previous attempt to monitor freight cars
automatically using bar-code technology, like that found in
supermarkets. Dirt and snow on the bar code panels caused
misreading rates to climb to 30%, and the rail industry
scrapped the system in 1978. "Everyone is still skittish,"
Mr. Ditmeyer says.
                                                                                                       

   Train Toilets May Take
   A Cue From Airlines
                                                                                                       

   AMTRAK HAS TURNED to makers of airplane toilet systems to
meet impending restrictions on dumping waste from its trains.
   The passenger railroad has been fighting lawsuits brought
by Florida and other states tired of having sewage released
on the tracks. Charles Engelhardt, Amtrak's director of
equipment design, says the company is testing six systems
made by four companies. Amtrak is searching for a system that
would retain wastes for up to 72 hours. That way,
long-distance trains wouldn't need servicing en route.
   Monogram Sanitation of Compton, Calif., a maker of
airplane waste systems, proposes to retrofit long-distance
Amtrak cars with 250-gallon retention tanks while reducing
the amount of water used in each toilet flush to seven
ounces, about one-seventh the normal amount. Monogram would
redesign the toilet bowls, using steeper sides and a Teflon
coating, so that they would perform with less water.
   Once a model is found, Amtrak says it may be cheaper to
replace some aging sleeping cars than to equip them with new
toilet systems.
                                                                                                       

   Looking to Get Around
   Double-Hull Oil Tankers
                                                                                                       

   AS CONGRESS considers legislation to mandate double hulls
on oil tankers to prevent spills, the ship industry is
proposing easier and less-costly alternatives.
   The Swedish Maritime Administration is promoting a
"vacuum" method to reduce pollution in the event of a damaged
hull. The scheme involves setting cargo tank pressure valves
so that air can't enter the tanks. The initial escape of a
small amount of oil after a tanker grounding would then
create a vacuum in the space between the oil cargo and the
top of the tank that would keep the vast majority of the
cargo from flowing out.
   Overseas Shipholding Group Inc., a New York ship company,
advocates loading oil, which is lighter than water, slightly
higher than the water line. The company suggests filling the
cargo tanks 15% less than normal and keeping the ballast
tanks filled with water on all voyages so the vessel rides
lower in the ocean. That way, very little oil would come out
after a grounding as long as the fluid in the tanks remains
in hydrostatic balance with the water outside, says George
Blake, a director of Overseas Shipholding.
   Critics say Mr. Blake's proposal provides limited
protection in cases where tankers are punctured on the side
or are exposed to strong waves. They also are concerned that
the Swedish vacuum method would subject cargo tanks to
potential collapse and interfere with the vessel's inert gas
system, intended to counter explosive cargo fumes.
   The alternative plans "have some value," says Arthur
McKenzie, director of the Tanker Advisory Center, an
information clearinghouse. "But by no stretch of the
imagination are they a substitute for double hulls or double
bottoms."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   LONG VEHICLES can take tight corners more easily with a
truck trailer rear axle steering system, says Steerable
Carriages, a company in Little York, N.J. Henry J. Kmiecik,
vice president, likens the system to the tiller man at the
rear of a hook and ladder truck. . . . Michael Baker Corp., a
Beaver, Pa., engineering consulting firm, says it is testing
a system to continuously monitor the structural integrity of
highway bridges by measuring their response to traffic loads.
The system uses gauges permanently mounted on the bridges to
measure strain.

the $1.6 million, or 27 cents a share, reported for the
fiscal-fourth quarter ended Jan. 31.
   Sales of approximately $10 million fell below the $12
million posted in the fourth quarter, the computer-graphics
company said. In last year's first quarter, Sigma posted
profit of $3.1 million, or 49 cents a share, on sales of
about $26 million.

   The company blamed the unfavorable forecast on a reduction
in revenue from Zenith Data Systems and weak demand from
other customers.

   NEW YORK -- A federal judge found a New Jersey investment
adviser in civil contempt, saying he "has not made a good
faith effort" to comply with a consent agreement he made with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In March, the SEC charged Frank R. Breitweiser, doing
business in Newton, N.J., under the name of Orange County
Financial Planning Services, with making "material
misrepresentations."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The charges stemmed from the adviser's offering for sale
approximately $1.1 million of securities for two investment
firms under whose names Mr. Breitweiser also does business,
Orange County Financial Income Fund and Orange County
Financial Stock Management. Mr. Breitweiser was accused of
misrepresenting "the nature, value, liquidity, rate of
return, use of proceeds and risk" of the securities.
   In New York, U.S. District Judge Peter Leisure ordered Mr.
Breitweiser to pay a fine of $250 a day, beginning May 14,
until he complies with the agreement. Under that accord, Mr.
Breitweiser didn't admit or deny any wrongdoing, but he
agreed to repay investors more than $151,000. He agreed not
to commit any such violations in the future.
   Mr. Breitweiser declined to comment. According to the
judge's order, Mr. Breitweiser "does not contest the fact
that he has not satisfied the conditions" of the agreement.
"Rather, he claims that he is unable to satisfy" the terms of
the accord "due to his current financial position."

   The Soviet Union has talked with Salomon Inc. and possibly
other big U.S. securities firms about setting up a $1 billion
to $2 billion fund for investing in that country.
   Andrew Jonas, head of East European investment banking at
Salomon Brothers International Ltd. in London, confirmed that
Salomon has had discussions with Soviet banking officials
that began at the Soviets' initiative. However, he said the
discussions are "at somewhat of a dead end because of
political problems there."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Jonas's remarks were made in response to a question at
a conference on Eastern European investment opportunities
sponsored by the Corporate Finance Institute in New York.
   He said a possible fund might center on financing for
three or four large projects. "I mean big projects, because
the Soviets only think in terms of big projects," Mr. Jonas
said, but he gave no specifics.
   The fund, if realized, the Salomon executive said, would
start out much more modestly than the Soviets might have had
in mind, probably at $20 million.
   Even if the Soviets overcome their political problems,
there is no guarantee that Wall Street will work with them.
Other investment banks aside from Salomon are said to have
been approached by the Soviets. But, said Mr. Jonas, Salomon
is worried about how marketable a fund would be.

   Though He's Back in the Soup,
   He Still Sticks to His Game Plan

   To the outside world, John T. "Ipy" Dorrance III is the
eccentric and usually reclusive heir to the Campbell Soup
fortune. But in Wyoming, where he lives on a 17,000-acre
ranch at the foot of Devils Tower National Monument, the
45-year-old Mr. Dorrance is making himself a highly visible
figure.
   Says Phyllis Atchison, a prominent Cheyenne cattle
rancher, "He's becoming a pariah."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The reason for the notoriety: Mr. Dorrance has proposed to
import and breed hundreds of exotic game animals, including
ibexes, European boars, red deer and arctic wolves (15 exotic
species in all). He believes the plan would be great for his
ranch, part of which could become an exotic zoo to attract
tourists, thus helping the state's economy.
   Besides allowing some animals to be hunted as big-game
trophies, Mr. Dorrance contends, others could be raised in
pens for meat (red deer tenderloin from New Zealand, for
example, sells for $9 a pound), and some of the rare goats on
his list could be used for "weed-control research."
   Hogwash, say the members of the Wyoming Game and Fish
Commission, who recently rejected Mr. Dorrance's plan after
wading through expert testimony and listening at length to
his arguments. The commissioners fear the exotics will escape
and interbreed with native deer, antelope, elk and other
species. They also cite the risk of spreading exotic
parasites.
   Some ranchers refer to the Dorrance proposal disparagingly
as "Ipy's Dippy Zoo." A cartoonist at the Casper Star-Tribune
depicted a fenced-in Mr. Dorrance with arm outstretched above
a Wyoming Game and Fish sign that reads: "Do Not Feed the
Billionaire."
   Mr. Dorrance's lawyer denounces the commissioners for all
wearing the same color blazer and for behaving in what he
calls "a group-think mode." Mr. Dorrance complains that state
officials are inflexible bureaucrats who refuse to talk to
him. But he isn't giving up.
   The wealthy rancher continues to grant radio and newspaper
interviews around the state to spread the word about his
plan. A few days ago, he dropped the arctic wolf from his
plan and filed an appeal in a state court, hoping to overturn
the commission's decision.
   Meanwhile, preparing for the day when his dream comes
true, Mr. Dorrance is erecting an electrified, woven-wire
fence along the perimeter of his vast holdings.

   HONOLULU -- A federal jury convicted Center Art Galleries
and two of its officers on mail and wire fraud charges in
connection with the sale of fake lithographs by surrealist
artist Salvador Dali.
   The U.S. District Court in Hawaii ruled that the gallery
and its officers sold prints that they had reproduced at a
cost of $50 to customers for prices ranging from $1,000 to
more than $20,000. The major selling tool of the gallery,
according to the U.S. attorney's office in Honolulu, was to
tell customers that the prints were a great investment
opportunity.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In some cases, according to the attorney's office, even
the original works from which the reproductions were made
hadn't been executed by Dali.

Mett, its president, and Marvin L. Wiseman, its vice
president.

   Rowny's Warning:
   Slow Down
   On START

   When Ed Rowny resigns, pay attention.
   Back in 1979, Mr. Rowny put a damper on SALT II when he
quit his job as lead delegate to the talks with Leonid
Brezhnev. Then, Congress heeded an old general's message and
refused to ratify a strategic treaty that ceded important
arms advantages to the Soviet Union. Now, Mr. Rowny is
resigning again -- this time from his job as senior arms
control adviser to the president. Again, he's worried about a
strategic treaty that can put the U.S. in a scary position.
This round, Mr. Rowny's challenge is more daunting. In
Washington today, it's hard to find anyone besides Balts
worried about Soviet aggression.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Bush-Gorbachev summit planned for the end of this
month is what troubles Mr. Rowny. U.S. and Soviet negotiators
are racing to prepare the framework for a treaty on limiting
strategic missiles, START. Secretary of State Baker is off to
Moscow on Monday to work on the effort. It's an agreement,
Mr. Rowny says, that is loaded against the United States.
We're agreeing to missile cuts with the Soviet Union, but
while we're doing so, the Soviet Union is modernizing its
missiles so they're more powerful than a START agreement
would reflect.
   Mr. Rowny thinks a lot, for example, about SS-18s,
intercontinental missiles three times as heavy as anything
the U.S. has. The Soviet Union has land-based mobile
missiles, while America's, after years, are still on the
drawing board. He's afraid, in particular, that the U.S. will
put off the thornier problem of verification, and focus on
the glory of getting START moving now. On verification, he
points to some disturbing news. After the U.S. completed the
INF treaty with the Soviet Union in 1987, it assumed all
intermediate-range nuclear missiles were gone from East
Europe. But since then, intermediate-range SS-23s have been
discovered in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.
   Why, in the year of the peace dividend, should we care
about Cold War terms like "threat" and "verification" anyway?
Because START, at least the START that early models show,
gives a weakening country a strong military advantage.
Because a rocky Soviet Union -- one with tanks in Riga and
Vilnius, and an eye on rebellion bubbling in Tallinn -- could
be a less predictable opponent than the ossified Soviet Union
of the slow-moving Brezhnev. Mr. Rowny summed this up in a
talk he gave the other day: "It would be a tragic mistake to
impose a false clarity on the future by assuming that a
political status quo exists at present."
   The right way to proceed with disarmament, in the Rowny
view, is to "push like the devil on conventional forces
negotiations," first. On conventionals, Moscow has already
agreed to asymmetrical cuts -- cuts that mean, for example,
that the Soviets will no longer be able to station their 17
divisions in East Germany. A more even playing field on
conventionals means the U.S. would be even less likely to
resort to nuclear weapons -- for example, the short-range
tactical missiles Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney is talking
about this week at a NATO meeting in Calgary.
   Mr. Rowny's logic on getting a strong conventional
agreement is old but sound. He says the fact the Soviet Union
is making treaties with East Bloc countries to move off their
territory is no guarantee Europe will be safe from invasion.
"Because even if the Soviets withdraw from those countries,
they don't have a long distance to travel when they come
back."
   Mr. Rowny himself doesn't like to compare this season's
resignation to his SALT departure. But some of the parallels
are worth noting. Verification, then as now, was for him a
key concern. Then, testifying before the Senate on SALT II,
he called the treaty "detrimental to our national security,"
and said that "In our zeal to reach an agreement the United
States made too many concessions. We permitted large
inequalities favoring the Soviet Union to be written into the
agreement." The same words represent his stand today.
   The main difference is the audience he is addressing.
Then, Mr. Rowny went to work -- at $143 a day -- as a
consultant testifying against a treaty he succeeded in
helping to block. Now, he'll move to the role of visiting
professor at George Washington University -- around the
corner from his old office at the State Department.
   Ed Rowny is 73, and he calls his resignation simple
retirement. Washington insiders say the arms negotiator has
become superfluous anyway. They say Secretary of State James
Baker, and the White House, don't include him in their
planmaking. While staffers work furiously to frame some kind
of START model for the June summit, Mr. Rowny heads off to a
hospital in Arlington for a hip replacement operation.
   But this old adviser still feels his voice will be heard
in the White House. "I'm with the president and Cheney 100%
on policy," he says during a meeting in his State Department
office, and pushes his black glasses up his nose. He'd like
his musings to be heard now -- after a summit that fixes a
START plan, he argues, it will be "too late" to warn against.
   "Arcane" is the term most folk in this town would use to
describe the Rowny view -- and, in fact, the entire
disarmament process. The principal thing, they argue, is to
make deals that will help Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr. Rowny has a
different perspective, one perhaps born of commanding a World
War II regiment in Africa, helping to plan the invasion at
Inchon and 3,000 hours at the international negotiating
table. "The Soviets were there before Gorbachev," says this
uneasy Cassandra. "And they'll be there after him."

   NEW YORK -- A federal bankruptcy judge in Cincinnati
refused a request by B. Brothers Realty Limited Partnership,
landlord of the Manhattan Bloomingdale's store, to permit it
to pursue an action to terminate that store's lease.
   Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. threw out that request, ruling
that, for procedural reasons, B. Brothers' actions violated
the Bankruptcy Code. The judge called B. Brothers' actions
"vexatious," according to two lawyers at the hearing, and
assessed sanctions against the landlord, which was
represented by the New York law firm of Pryor, Cashman,
Sherman &amp; Flynn.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the hearing, Judge Aug also extended the period during
which Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp. have the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan
for the two Campeau Corp. retail units. Judge Aug gave
Federated and Allied until Sept. 12 to file their plan. The
company's creditors hadn't objected to the extension.
   In bankruptcy cases, the debtor has a right to file its
own reorganization plan before creditors have a chance to
suggest an alternative. But the debtor must file within a
designated period or lose that right.
   In court documents, B. Brothers charged that Federated had
breached its lease by improperly transferring its interest in
the store lease to a unit, Bloomingdale's Inc. B. Brothers
also argued that Federated had violated its rights by
pledging the lease as security for new financing after
Federated filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Jan. 15.
   David Heiman, counsel to Federated, said B. Brothers'
arguments are "based on a distinction without a difference."
No rent payments have been missed.
   In assessing sanctions, the judge said he would require B.
Brothers to pay the legal fees incurred by Federated in this
matter.
   After the hearing, Frederick Danziger, a lawyer
representing B. Brothers, said, "We find what happened
extraordinary. We obviously just want to review the
transcript before commenting further. {We} view the judge's
action as very surprising."

   Elite Group of Chief Executives Attended
   Trade Retreat Held by House Tax Panel

   WASHINGTON -- For the first time, a select group of
corporate chief executive officers participated in the House
Ways and Means Committee's annual invitation-only weekend
retreat.
   This year's retreat, held at a North Carolina conference
center the weekend of April 20, was devoted to trade. All of
the chief executives who attended the privately funded
retreat, including James Robinson of American Express Co. and
Edmund Pratt of Pfizer Inc., have a vital stake in this
year's topic, the current Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations. The chief executives also have billions of
dollars riding on almost every tax and trade decision made by
the committee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Not surprisingly, many of the corporate chieftains who
were hand-picked to participate are also contributors to
members of the panel, which has primary jurisdiction over
trade and taxes in the House. Political action committees
controlled by the companies whose chief executives attended
the retreat have given members of the panel $237,475 in
campaign contributions since 1983. A few of the individual
executives have also made personal contributions to the
tax-writers.
   The exclusive, off-the-record conclave strikes some
critics as a glaring example of buying access. "It's
interesting in the climate of reform that the committee
continues with business as usual, with special access for
special interests," said Ellen Miller of the Center for
Responsive Government. "It's an affront to the American
public."
   Each year since 1984, the committee has left Washington en
masse for the retreat. The annual excursion isn't viewed as a
junket for the tax-writing panel, but an occasion for the
committee to focus its attention on a policy issue away from
the din and distraction of the capital.
   Invitations are precious -- not even spouses are invited.
The whereabouts and timing of the retreat are kept quiet. "We
tend to be lobbied by people who want to go," said an aide to
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). Usually the retreats
are top-heavy with academic and policy experts.
   This year the chief executives dominated. Besides Messrs.
Robinson and Pratt, those invited included Prudential
Insurance Co. of America's Robert Winters; Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing Co.'s Allen Jacobson; Unisys Corp. Chairman and
former Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal; Zenith
Electronics Corp.'s Jerry Pearlman; SmithKline Beecham
Corp.'s Henry Wendt; Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc.'s Dexter
Baker; and Gap Inc.'s Donald Fisher. Thomas Donahue,
secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, also attended.
   Committee members said political contributions had nothing
to do with who was invited. "It isn't as if we picked people
who gave a lot of money and no one else," said Rep. Sander
Levin (D., Mich.). "Their role in trade is so pronounced. I
don't think anyone could misunderstand it."
   Mr. Pratt, for example, has been heavily involved in
intellectual property issues at stake in the Uruguay Round
and is chairman of the Business Roundtable, whose members
have a big stake in the negotiations. Mr. Robinson has been
highly visible on trade issues. Mr. Wendt is chairman of the
U.S.-Japan Business Council. "If you're dealing with trade,
you want to deal with people in the trade business," added
the Rostenkowski aide.
   Besides the 20 or so committee members who made the trip,
there was a virtual who's who of the trade establishment,
including U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, her top
deputies, several ambassadors and former trade officials.
   "Anyone in the business world would have given their
eyeteeth to be in that room," said one of the participants.
   The Ford Foundation paid the Congressional Research
Service $200,000 to finance the retreat. The service, an arm
of the Library of Congress, wasn't involved in picking the
corporate participants, although it approved the committee's
choices, according to deputy director Bill Robinson, who
helped plan the retreat.
   "The intent of the retreat isn't to provide a vehicle for
anyone to engage in lobbying or influence legislation," said
David Arnold of the Ford Foundation. "The CEOs were there
because of their particular expertise and not to peddle their
position or stake in the current round."
   Participants say the off-the-record programs are important
policy-making tools. "It is very useful to meet in depth on
subjects across party lines," said Rep. Levin. According to
several participants, previous retreats on taxes led to
important legislative initiatives.
   The committee didn't publicize the April retreat. But in
response to inquiries, the Congressional Research Service
provided a list of the guests, and committee aides disclosed
the agenda.
   None of the corporate participants who could be reached
would discuss the retreat. "If we say anything," said a
spokesman for SmithKline Beecham, "we might not be invited
again next year."

   SAO PAULO, Brazil -- When Fernando Collor de Mello took
office in March, he said he had "only one shot" to halt
Brazil's hyperinflation. But instead of firing a bullet, the
new president dropped a bomb.
   "The monetary contraction we imposed on society is
fantastic," acknowledges Ibrahim Eris, one of the architects
of the harsh anti-inflation plan and now the president of the
central bank. "It's probably the first time in the world that
a country in time of peace has practically destroyed its
monetary standard and replaced it."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the plan, Mr. Collor didn't just restrict credit or
cut spending, as other governments here have done. He froze
about 70% of the money circulating in the economy for 18
months, until the fall of next year, and also replaced the
old currency, the cruzado novo, with a new, strictly
controlled one, the cruzeiro. If money causes inflation, the
thinking goes, then removing money removes inflation.
   The results have come faster than it takes to say
hyperinflation. Inflation, which reached 84.32% in March
alone and totaled 4,854% in the 12 months through March,
halted completely -- in fact, prices fell -- in the month
following the unveiling of the plan, the government says.
(However, some trade unions and economists disagree, charging
that the index is based on an incomplete basket of goods.)
   But in stopping inflation, the government has also stopped
the economy. "To kill the cockroach, they set the apartment
on fire," complains former Economic Planning Minister Antonio
Delfim Netto.
   Deprived of cash, consumers stopped buying, companies
stopped producing and exporters stopped exporting. Then,
afraid that it had paralyzed the country, the government
started re-injecting money into the system to the point that
some feared a revival of inflation, and the government closed
the tap again. Although the government terms all this as only
a short, predictable phase and says economic activity is
picking up again, many economists and businessmen think that
Brazil has simply traded inflation for recession -- and could
end up with both if the government errs in its efforts to
revive the economy.
   Almost overnight, with the drop in inflation -- and in
bank accounts -- the habits of Brazil's nearly 150 million
people have changed. Companies that had cash in the bank
suddenly have to beg for loans at exorbitant interest rates
just to meet their payrolls. People who wouldn't have been
caught dead with cash in their pockets because inflation was
shrinking its value by the minute rushed to the bank to
withdraw all the money they could to stash it under
mattresses. And all of a sudden, the rich were poorer, and
the poor felt richer.
   Antonio Ermirio de Moraes, the extremely wealthy chief of
Grupo Votorantim, Brazil's largest private industrial group,
declared on television that he was stuck with little money
for himself and had to get a bank loan to pay his group's
60,000 employees after $500 million of its reserves were
frozen. So depressed was the workaholic Mr. Ermirio that he
took a swim in his pool for the first time in 36 years of
marriage, his wife says.
   Meanwhile, Claudio Teller de Silva, a 23-year-old who lost
his truck-driving job, says he can buy a used Volkswagen
Beetle with the unemployment benefits he will get. "If I'd
been fired in a time of high inflation, I couldn't have done
that," he says as he waits in line at an unemployment office
in Sao Paulo.
   The drastic liquidity squeeze, the government says, was
designed just that way. "Our directive was to liquidate
inflation fast without the working class footing most of the
bill," says Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello. To
make the well-heeled do the sacrificing, the government froze
funds in savings accounts in excess of 50,000 cruzados novos
(about $1,000 at the official rate). It also froze all funds
above 25,000 cruzados novos or 20% of total funds --
whichever was higher -- in short-term, interest-bearing
instruments.
   These limits and the rest of the plan were set in a series
of secret meetings of a small team of economists after Mr.
Collor's mid-December election. Examining Brazil's three
failed anti-inflation plans since 1986, as well as similar
plans in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia and Israel, "we
came to the conclusion that the core problem was the
explosion of demand" that accompanied more traditional policy
instruments such as wage-and-price freezes coupled with
credit restrictions, Mr. Eris says. So, by late January, the
team decided it had to reduce the amount of money in the
economy.
   "We took the plan to the president practically as it
stands today but without details," Mr. Eris says. "We held a
meeting with a blackboard and all that, and the president
accepted all our arguments in favor of a freeze of assets. He
was quickly convinced we had no alternative." But he adds:
"After we decided, we were extremely nervous . . . worried
about the consequences of our decisions."
   Rightly so, many now say, even if they think that the plan
makes sense theoretically and gives Brazil a salutary shock.
"At a macroeconomic level, the plan is fine," says Roberto
Civita, the president of Editora Abril, Latin America's
largest publishing group. "But guess what the sum of
everybody cutting here and canceling there is? The way it
looks from here is a big recession."
   Mr. Civita knows first-hand about cutting here and
canceling there. "We have cut all the costs we could imagine
except toilet paper and people," he says. The publisher of
about 150 magazines, including the respected newsweekly Veja,
Mr. Civita says newsstand sales have dropped about one-third,
although subscriptions have picked up slightly, and
advertising has fallen 50% since the plan was enacted. The
decline in revenue has forced Abril to put off its planned
August launch of MTV. "The tower was going up, the building
was being put up, people were being hired -- and we told the
construction company: `Stop]'" Mr. Civita says.
   In addition, Abril has cut its auto fleet by 60%,
suspended the publication of special issues and stopped
lunches with clients, all purchases of nonessential goods and
corporate travel. "Nobody's going anywhere," Mr. Civita says.
Because Abril had adopted a strategy of having no cash on
hand by March 15, none of its money was frozen. But cash flow
stopped. "We've thrown out the profit-and-loss statement,"
Mr. Civita says. Now, "we're thinking only of cash flow" to
pay bills and salaries. To meet the April payroll, Abril had
to take out a bank loan at almost 30% interest, and "May will
be even worse," Mr. Civita predicts. At one printing plant,
the workweek has been cut by a day with a matching pay cut,
and the group may adopt such tactics across the board.
   The problems are even worse for small companies, such as
Jacques Memran's wire maker near Sao Paulo. The company,
which employs 30 people and mostly makes wire spirals for
notebooks, is "completely stopped" and its employees are on
paid leave, Mr. Memran says. "I haven't fired anyone yet, but
how long can this last?" he asks. Paper companies "aren't
making any orders. They're trying to make cruzeiros by
selling inventory to be able to make new orders. It's a
vicious circle," he says.
   Mr. Memran voted for Mr. Collor but describes the plan as
"a bad surprise." He is particularly incensed at the freezing
of 800,000 cruzados novos that the company had put in the
overnight market -- a sort of one-day government bond in
which many Brazilians invested to hedge against inflation.
"The money we had wasn't to speculate," he says. "It was to
be able to meet our next payroll. In times of high inflation,
we were obliged to invest our money on the market to preserve
its value. Taking our money is a real aggression. Not only
did Collor take our savings, but he also took our working
capital." Mr. Memran adds that if the Collor plan "continues
like this, only the big will survive. And the big aren't
going to absorb all the people we're going to put out on the
street."
   Indeed, many Brazilians believe that although Mr. Collor
said he wanted to spare the poor, the poor in fact will pay
the biggest price in the medium term if the incipient
recession sparks mass unemployment. The middle classes are
already feeling the pinch. "Collor said the plan would affect
the elite and help the `descamisados'" -- the shirtless
people. "We're discovering we were the elite, and now we're
the shirtless," says Luiz Carlos Mansur, a 27-year-old copy
editor in the sports department of Jornal do Brasil in Rio de
Janeiro.
   With advertising low, the newspaper is paying salaries in
installments as money flows in, and staffers are never sure
of getting their full pay. Mr. Mansur's wife, Teresa, who
gives private classes in Portuguese and French, recently lost
two of her five students. And since the plan was enacted, the
Mansurs have had to tighten their belts. They rarely go out
to eat. They've stopped buying books and clothes. They've
fired their maid. Now, they're considering moving back to
live with Mrs. Mansur's mother.
   "Every day you wake up, and you don't know what will
happen," Mr. Mansur says. "You can lose your money, your job,
part of your salary." Adds his wife: "I'd think the plan was
good if I had the same amount as money as before and no
inflation. But to know that prices aren't rising when you
can't buy anything isn't very satisfying."
   Others say the plan, though harsh, may yield something
satisfying: the notion that Brazil will finally get its act
together.
   "Unemployment and recession are a price we have to pay to
stop the casino economy we lived in, where the poor got
poorer and the rich got richer," says Sergio Haberfeld, the
chairman of Toga, a packaging company whose production has
fallen about 25% since the plan was announced. "People made
profits on inflation and on their cash surplus. Now, it will
be profit on efficiency and productivity."
   For that to happen, however, the government will have to
match the sacrifices of the private sector, economists say.
The paradox of the plan is that although Mr. Collor was
elected on a free-market platform and vowed to reduce the
state's role, the plan's initial phase concentrates so much
power in his hands that Lawrence Pih, a businessman, speaks
of the "Popular Republic of Brazil."
   Economists are waiting to see how the government will
handle the ban on most government subsidies, the closure of
several state agencies, and the planned sale to the private
sector of most of Brazil's state-owned companies and of many
government houses and cars. Many say that if the government
wants permanently low inflation, it has to attack the
public-sector deficit through tougher spending cuts than it
has enacted so far. "About 10,000 people losing their jobs in
the public sector is very little compared to what we're
already seeing in the informal economy and what we'll see in
the financial, auto and construction sectors," says Carlos
Langoni, a former central-bank president.
   Meeting with cabinet members and government congressional
leaders yesterday, Mr. Collor exhorted them to move faster on
privatization and cut 20% to 25% of Brazil's 1.6 million
government workers.
   Meanwhile, the government's efforts to re-inject money
into the most affected sectors, such as the automobile,
construction and capital-goods industries, have to be
carefully calibrated to reignite business activity without
reigniting inflation. That will be all the harder because the
plan has disorganized the country's financial system and
destroyed confidence in savings -- a problem that government
officials admit they underestimated. Since the plan was
announced, the government has kept on printing money to
satisfy people's demand for cash, and that, in turn, could
trigger a paradoxical consumer boom in the midst of an
economic downturn.
   "We're walking on a very narrow road," the central bank's
Mr. Eris concedes. "On one side is the precipice of
recession; on the other is inflation. Today, society thinks
we're walking close to recession, but the road is so narrow
we could fall the other way. Our problem today is trying to
administer this so we don't fall on either side."
   Mr. Eris also admits that the plan "has implications that
aren't clear. Talk of recession or depression and talk of an
explosion of demand prove the economy hasn't found its
equilibrium." Inflation, he says, "has been knocked down, and
the judge has counted to three. When he says 10, we'll be in
another world." But both he and Economics Minister Cardoso
are confident of steering the economy through the twin perils
of inflation and recession.
   If they succeed, economists say, they will have laid the
foundations to allow Brazil, at long last, to live up to its
huge potential. If they fail, Brazil will have "exhausted the
economic encyclopedia" of ways to cure inflation, Mr. Langoni
says. The results, all agree, won't be clear for at least
another couple of months.
   "We're going to have a terrific decade," Abril's Mr.
Civita says. "All we have to do is get over the next two
months. I'm sure there's a promised land at the end of the
desert. The question is: Is there enough water in the canteen
to make it across?"

   In the past year, voters in Phoenix have thumpingly turned
down tax measures for a baseball stadium and mass transit. So
what is the state legislature now mulling? Raising the sales
tax for a baseball stadium and mass transit.
   The civic establishment is eager to have a ballpark in
progress to tempt Major League Baseball to award the desert
metropolis one of the new franchises due for announcement
later this year. Republican State Rep. Chris Herstam's bill
would permit the Maricopa County supervisors to impose up to
a half-penny surcharge on each dollar of purchases to raise
enough to keep the athletes and fans in style.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Supervisor Jim Bruner, who's leading the push, emphasizes
that this plan differs from one rejected last fall at the
polls. This would have raised property taxes only in Phoenix
proper, while the whole area reaped the benefits. Mr. Bruner
says he senses a more positive attitude toward the countywide
sales tax. But under the Herstam bill, no public vote would
be required. So there would be no reality check of Mr.
Bruner's gauge, at least not until he and his four colleagues
came up for re-election in 1992, by which time the
supervisors may have collected the entire tax.
   Arizona has long experience with the Cactus League in
spring training, so maybe it is ripe for the big time. But it
wasn't ready to pay the National Football League ticket
prices that the Phoenix Cardinals brought to town in 1988,
and many seats went unsold. (Owner Bill Bidwill has now cut
prices a second time.) And Phoenix last year already went on
the hook for $46 million to build an arena for the basketball
Suns, without a nod from voters.
   Moreover, a general backlash is developing against public
giveaways to sports barons. Al Davis has alienated the whole
state of California dangling his football Raiders before
various communities. Residents of Seattle are bucking a new
arena that the Supersonics basketball team actually would
build for itself but only if tax funds are used to take the
existing playing facility out of commission as a competing
venue for other events.
   The Arizona legislature's current special session to
balance the budget also could pave the way for a sales tax
boost for transit. Proponents are at pains to distinguish
this drive, too, from one the voters rejected in the spring.
This time, they say, the money would go mostly for buses and
not rail. Given the nature of public-transit failures in the
U.S. (the Buffalo fiasco being the most recent example),
that's probably a slight plus. And the expectation is that
voter approval would be required because it would be a longer
commitment than the stadium assessment and doesn't need to be
rushed to assure a group of team owners.
   At a time when many state and local governments --
including those in Arizona and Phoenix -- are struggling to
balance their budgets, the discipline of public referendums
on major projects can be especially helpful. Although we have
detected a special-problem in recent years with the
business-labor-government "Arizocracy" centered in Phoenix,
the tendency of elites nationwide to revel in grand public
works requires monitoring as authorities run short of funds
to meet basic service commitments. Anybody is entitled to
pitch a pet project, but we're more comfortable when the
voters have a chance at bat.

   Experimental AIDS Drug Found
   To Lower Virus Levels in Trials

   Bristol-Myers Squibb's DDI
   May Have Less Serious
   Side Effects Than AZT

   Medical researchers in two independent studies found that
the experimental drug DDI lowers virus levels and enhances
immune cells in patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex
(ARC).
   The two safety studies of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
compound found that DDI's side effects include a painful
neuropathy, or nerve damage, to the feet, and pancreatitis,
an inflammation of the pancreas. But such side effects mostly
occurred at doses now considered too high. Moreover, they
didn't provoke the kind of blood problems caused by Wellcome
PLC's AZT, the only approved antiviral for AIDS.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is a drug of considerable promise, but one that has
associated toxicity, as all drugs do," said Raphael Dolin,
professor of medicine at the University of Rochester (N.Y.)
School of Medicine, and a lead author of one study. "The
exact place of DDI in the armamentarium of drugs for treating
AIDS will depend upon the outcome of current Phase Two, or
efficacy studies." Such studies now are under way.
   "You have to be cautiously optimistic," said a lead author
of the other study, Timothy P. Cooley, assistant professor of
medicine at Boston University. Although the point of the
studies was to assess toxicity and find the safe-dosage
ceiling, he said, "We have some soft evidence of clinical
benefit." Hard proof awaits conclusion of the efficacy
trials, which could take up to a year to complete.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bristol-Myers Squibb stock rose 50 cents a share, closing at
$58.50.
   Despite the good news, an editorial accompanying the two
reports, published in today's edition of the New England
Journal of Medicine, urges eager patients and doctors to
"suspend judgment" about DDI until all the evidence is in
hand.
   "There is a promise here of efficacy," said the
editorial's author, Anthony Fauci, director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "But we must
reserve any conclusions" until the end of efficacy studies.
   What encourages researchers most about today's published
reports is the finding that even at the lowest dosage levels,
DDI suppressed the level of an AIDS viral protein, called
p24, a common marker for disease progression. It also
prompted significant and in some cases sustained rises in the
levels of T4 lymphocytes, which are disease-fighting white
blood cells of the immune system. Taken together, the two are
used as the most common lab measure of the disease's
progression or improvement.
   In addition, many patients exhibited increased appetites
and weight gains of about two to four pounds, along with more
subjective measurements, such as an improved sense of
well-being. However, both reports warn that such findings
don't ensure long-term clinical benefits and improved
survival.
   DDI's development has been marked by high hope as well as
anxiety in the AIDS community, which urgently needs more
drugs to augment the limited AIDS armory. So far, the only
approved antiviral drug, AZT, induces bone marrow supression
and anemia in about half the patients who take it. Also,
long-term AZT use gives rise to mutant viruses that no longer
respond to AZT. Recent test-tube studies indicate that these
mutant viruses respond to DDI.
   An intense patient lobbying effort last year sought and
won expanded access to DDI in a giveaway program now running
concurrently with ongoing efficacy studies. So far, about 900
patients are in the Phase Two studies. About 6,100 patients,
most too ill to qualify for the studies, receive DDI under
the expanded-access program.
   Safety concerns erupted earlier this year after a
newspaper reported a higher number of deaths within the
expanded-access group than in the study. Researchers
attributed the deaths to the inexorable progression of AIDS
among sicker patients in the expanded-access group. Still,
certain academics criticized the giveaway as too hasty.
   About 13 deaths have been linked with DDI-induced
pancreatitis, though researchers don't fully understand how
it is caused. Pancreatitis is often traced to alcohol and
certain other drugs, including pentamidine, a popular
preventative for AIDS-linked pneumonia. Doctors were warned
in the journal reports to remove patients from DDI at the
first sign of toxic effects.
   Researchers are urging doctors to monitor patients' blood
for elevated pancreatic enzymes, which can precede an attack
of pancreatitis, and then "cut back or stop the drug," said
Dr. Dolin. His report noted that AIDS itself causes subtle
pancreatic damage that may be exacerbated by DDI.
   Other toxicities included raised blood levels of uric acid
and liver enzymes, which have yet to provoke clinical
problems but "could become important in a larger population,"
Dr. Cooley cautioned.
   The drug's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, is pressing
ahead with development and expressing general optimism to
members of the financial community. The drug has been given
the brand name Videx, executives told analysts recently. In
addition to potential usefulness against AZT-resistant
viruses, the drug also has the advantage of longer activity
in the body, which means that patients can take it less
frequently.
   Saying DDI's efficacy looks comparable to that of AZT at a
similar stage of development, the company confidently
forecasts filing a new drug application with the Food and
Drug Administration by the end of the year.

   JAL, Lufthansa, Nissho Seek DHL Stake,
   Raising Ante in Express-Delivery Market

   The battle for dominance in the $8 billion-a-year
international express-delivery market is heating up again.
   Three companies -- Japan Air Lines, Lufthansa German
Airlines and Nissho Iwai Corp., a leading Japanese trading
company -- confirmed yesterday that they are negotiating to
acquire a stake in DHL Worldwide Express, the world's largest
international express-delivery concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While officials at DHL International, the Brussels-based
holding company, declined to comment, industry analysts say
such a marriage would increase the pressure on Federal
Express Corp. and closely held United Parcel Service, both of
which have been pushing hard to expand their operations
overseas.
   "With this move, Japan Air Lines and Lufthansa are saying
to Federal Express and United Parcel Service, `We're not
going to let you waltz in {our} markets uncontested,' " said
Edwin Laird, director of Air Cargo Management Group, a
Seattle consulting firm. "In other words, the ante has just
been upped."
   News of the DHL negotiations helped push down Federal
Express's stock $1.50 a share, to $52.125, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   But some observers play down the threat to Federal
Express. "I suspect that DHL has worked with {Japan Air Lines
and Lufthansa} before, so there would be some benefits on the
cost side but little change in terms of marketing clout,"
said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "This
amounts to just more jockeying for position, so we expect
that it will be business as usual at Federal."
   Federal Express, based in Memphis, Tenn., declined to
comment, as did UPS, based in Greenwich, Conn.
   Officials at Japan Air Lines, Lufthansa and Nissho Iwai
all said they were seeking minority holdings, but declined to
elaborate. People familiar with the negotiations, however,
said that a deal was imminent and could result in the
outsiders gaining majority control with a 60% stake. The
three companies' initial investment would total about $500
million and would be limited to DHL's international
operations, the people said.
   "The global freight market is booming, and this looks like
a logical partnership" said Martin White of Coopers &amp; Lybrand
Associates Ltd., a management consulting firm. "DHL needs
air-freight capacity, and JAL and Lufthansa need its
world-wide distribution services."
   Founded in 1969 by three American entrepreneurs -- Larry
Hillblom, Adrian Dalsey and Robert Lynn -- DHL created the
express door-to-door delivery business. It remains a closely
held company controlled by two of its three founders -- Mr.
Lynn is no longer involved in the company. DHL currently
serves 184 countries, while Federal Express operates in 127.
In 1989, DHL carried more than 50 million international
shipments.
   The international market is growing by an estimated 28% a
year-and changing. Most of the expansion is coming in Asia,
where express delivery remains underdeveloped, and in Europe,
spurred by the move toward the 1992 unified market and the
opening of Eastern Europe.
   Japan Air Lines and Lufthansa already are huge cargo
carriers, each ranking in the top five world-wide. The two
airlines joined forces in April, announcing an agreement with
Air France and Cathay Pacific Airways to cooperate on an
aircargo information service. Nissho Iwai also has vast
experience in shipping large volumes of goods, but is
inexperienced in small air-cargo shipments.
   DHL would complement these airport-to-airport or
port-to-port services with door-to-door delivery. The
agreement also would give the Japanese an entry into the
European market and the Germans into the Asian market.
   Indeed, it is the saturated U.S. market that has prompted
Federal Express and UPS to look overseas. Both companies have
invested heavily in building international operations to
offset slower growth in domestic markets. In 1988, Federal
Express agreed to pay $880 million for Tiger International
Inc., then the world's largest air-cargo carrier.
   Investors, however, are still waiting for that move to pay
off. Federal Express's international operations have been
losing an estimated $15 million a quarter, according to Paul
R. Schlesinger, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities. He added: "A DHL deal is significant in that
Federal's investment in Tiger is now more at risk."
   But Morgan Stanley's Mr. Murphy says an agreement
involving DHL is more likely to affect other European and
Pacific Rim air carriers that currently transport DHL cargo,
such as Air France and Singapore Air Lines.
   "My guess is that at the end of the day, it's these guys
who will be losing business, not Federal Express," he said.

   A federal appeals court narrowed the choices many
investors have when their disputes with brokers go to
arbitration.
   The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
investors nationwide can be required to arbitrate in New
York, rather than in the city in which they live or do
business. The decision -- which involves cases with American
Stock Exchange members before the American Arbitration
Association -- is at odds with the exchange's and the
arbitrators' own policy.

   In a related case, the court also ruled that a customer's
individual brokerage contract takes precedence over Amex's
more general rules about arbitration. The court said that by
signing an individual contract, the customer gives up the
right to arbitrate before the American Arbitration
Association. Instead, investors must use securities-industry
arbitration proceedings specified in the contract. Many
shareholder attorneys consider AAA proceedings to be more
fair to investors.
   Previously, Amex and AAA have allowed investors' cases to
be handled in cities that are convenient for them. But the
federal appeals court in Manhattan, N.Y., said the wording in
the Amex constitution requires that cases before the
arbitration group be handled in New York.
   The Amex provision says that cases can be taken "before
the American Arbitration Association in the city of New
York." The Amex and the arbitrators say the wording merely
describes where the association is based, but the court said
the language of the rule compels that arbitration be held in
New York.
   "The argument that `in the city of New York' is
descriptive is undermined by the fact that, at all relevant
times, there was only one American Arbitration Association,"
the court said in its opinion earlier this week. "The
geographic reference is superfluous if not a forum selection
clause." The panel of appellate judges said the Amex would
have to change the language of the provision if it disagreed
with the court's interpretation.
   The case before the court involves investors who claim
PaineWebber Inc. employees misled them into buying securities
before the price collapsed. The investors wanted to arbitrate
the case in Orlando, Fla., where they live. They were doing
business through PaineWebber's Orlando office.
   Robert Coulson, president of the arbitration association,
said the decision poses an inconvenience for many investors.
"We're sorry that the court seems to have foreclosed access
of the investor to AAA procedures," Mr. Coulson said. "We try
to keep our procedures open to anyone who wants to use them."
The association is a nonprofit public-service group that
arbitrates a wide range of cases, from brokerage disputes to
labor issues.
   Neal Blaher, a lawyer for the investors, said, "It's a
real blow to any fairness for customers." He said many
investors in such proceeding can't afford to take their cases
to New York. Under the decision, arbitration before a
securities-industry proceeding could be held in various
cities -- only investors going before AAA would be required
to arbitrate in New York.
   Scott Noah, an assistant vice president and associate
general counsel for Amex, said the exchange last November
proposed a change in its constitution to make it clear that
it didn't intend to require that AAA cases be arbitrated in
New York. He said the Securities and Exchange Commission has
taken no action on the proposal.
   In the other case, an investor in a dispute with Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. claimed that when it comes
to arbitration, the Amex constitution should preempt
individual brokerage contracts. In affirming a lower court
judge, the appeals court said the investor had agreed to
narrow his arbitration choices by signing the brokerage
contract.

   GEORGIA ELECTION LAW is challenged as discriminatory.
   A class-action suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court
in Atlanta alleges that a 1964 state law requiring candidates
in a primary election to receive more than 50% of the votes
cast to secure their party's nomination dilutes black voting
strength. The plaintiffs, a group of 27 black legislators and
civil-rights leaders, want a candidate to be able to win
primary and general elections with a plurality.
   The suit could affect the 1990 governor's race in Georgia.
The plaintiffs said they intend to seek a preliminary
injunction to prevent a runoff in the July 17 Democratic
gubernatorial primary. No runoff is expected in the
Republican primary.
   The suit is the second major challenge to Georgia's
election laws in federal court. A related case involves
allegations that the state's method of electing superior
court judges from multi-county circuits dilutes black voting
strength. In these wide geographic areas, voters select more
than one judge for the region. Such elections can dilute a
voting group's power if that group is a minority within the
circuit.
   In contrast, single-judge districts give neighborhoods
sole power to select the judge for that district.

   HOSPITAL'S FIRING of therapist turned photographer is
upheld.
   The case involved photographs of toddler Jessica McClure,
the Midland, Texas, girl who captured national attention in
October 1987 when she was trapped in an abandoned well for 58
hours.
   A respiratory therapist working at Midland Memorial
Hospital shot photographs of Jessica as she was brought into
the hospital's emergency room after her rescue and sold the
photos to the New York Times.
   The hospital fired the therapist, John Brennan, for
violating hospital policy governing the release of
information about patients. The therapist, who argued that he
had the permission of Jessica's mother to shoot the
photographs, filed suit in state district court in Midland,
alleging that he was deprived of property and liberty
guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. The original suit also
alleged wrongful discharge and breach of contract, but those
claims were later withdrawn.
   State District Judge Vann Culp of Midland granted the
hospital's motion for summary judgment on the constitutional
question and dismissed the therapist's suit last week.
   The hospital was represented by labor law specialists
Christopher Knepp and Grace Renbarger of the Austin office of
Dallas-based Hughes &amp; Luce.
   Barry L. Hart, the Odessa, Texas, lawyer representing the
therapist, said his client hasn't decided whether to appeal
Judge Culp's decision.

   FOOTBALL PLAYERS gain support of state officials in high
court.
   The attorneys general of eight states, including New York,
Texas, Michigan and Utah, asked the U.S. Supreme Court to
hear an appeal by National Football League players in an
antitrust suit against the league. The players are objecting
to NFL rules restricting player movement among teams.
   Last November, the Eighth U.S. Court of Appeals in St.
Louis ruled that federal labor law made the NFL immune from
the players' antitrust suit as long as the players' union
remained as a collective-bargaining agent. In response to the
decision, the union ended its status as a bargaining agent.
   In a brief filed this week, the states argued that the
appeals court decision narrows the reach of the antitrust
laws and could extend to other industries.
   "The Court of Appeals has imposed on employees a choice
between the right to bargain collectively and the protection
of the antitrust laws," the attorneys general wrote.
   "We're not saying the players should win {the underlying
dispute} or management should win. But we believe the players
have a right to go forward and try to prove . . . that there
has been a restraint of trade," said Lloyd Constantine, chief
of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general's
office.
   A spokesman for the NFL Management Council said he
couldn't comment on the filing because he hadn't seen it. The
council has argued that the Supreme Court shouldn't hear the
case because the ruling doesn't have a widespread effect, as
the players have claimed.
   Friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of the players have
also been filed by the players' associations of the National
Hockey League and the National Basketball Association.

   The Mitchell Recession?-IV:
   Lost Opportunity

<LP>
   That loud noise you hear is the gears, pulleys and steam
whistles of the Beltway political machine, squealing over the
possibility that Mr. Bush will break his pledge and sign on
to a tax increase. This lever is supposed to somehow reduce
interest rates and that lever will prevent Congress and
George Bush from falling into the abyss of a $165 billion
deficit. It makes for grand political theater, but we doubt
there'd be any need to stage this show if early last November
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell hadn't personally
killed a cut in the capital-gains tax.
   We'll describe in a moment the contributions we think a
capital-gains cut would have made to the economy, which some
fear has turned soft. But let's look back at how the
Washington establishment dealt with the capital-gains cut it
had in hand, and rejected, last fall.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For starters, the same part of the Beltway establishment
that is most eager now to cure a recession with a tax
increase is the same group that ridiculed a capital-gains cut
as only a tax-giveaway to "the rich." No one was more ardent
in criticizing the capital-gains proposal from this
class-based position than Senator Mitchell.
   Against this view, others of us argued at the time that
the main purpose of such a cut was to continue the economic
expansion of the previous eight years by giving capital an
incentive to move toward its most efficient uses, consisting
of the ideas and work of other Americans. A majority of the
House Ways and Means Committee supported the cut, and about
60 Senators, including Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, were
behind the idea. On some days Dan Rostenkowski has been
willing to support it. The President was ready to sign the
bill.
   In the end, Senator Mitchell stood against all these
forces. "This is for me]" he told his Senate colleagues. So
out of deference to their new majority leader, the Democrats
let capital gains die.
   It is now seven months later. Federal tax receipts are
coming in below projections, partly because a slowing economy
has held down corporate profits. Smaller borrowers, such as
start-up firms, are hard-pressed to find capital, as
frightened lenders overreact to pressure from the S&amp;L bailout
inspectors. The stock market drifts in a "trading range" as
many shareowners simply sit on their holdings; anti-takeover
laws and sentiment also lock up shares.
   In retrospect, a capital-gains cut last November looks
like it would have been a pretty good deal. No one disputes
its significant first-year boost to revenues. Even if you
believe that the later revenue impact may be more modest, it
seems clear that a lower capital-gains rate would expand the
tax base as investors continued to take taxable profits.
   In turn, most of those profits would have been reinvested
in the hope of further gains, and some of those investments
surely would have flowed to the smaller, cutting-edge firms
that are now being told to get lost by bankers clamping down
on credit. Perhaps not coincidentally, the job-growth figures
have gone flat.
   By freeing up capital, a gains cut also would have
alleviated the increasing political pressure the Federal
Reserve is now under to single-handedly guarantee the
economy's health. The Fed's primary role is to control
inflation. By freezing the fiscal side, Mitchellnomics
shifted the burden back to the Fed. And in fact the Fed eased
in December, with Wayne Angell dissenting. Add to this that
Congress is still trying to mandate the uses of capital by
enacting a $27 billion Clean Air Bill, parental-leave and
child-care bills.
   We are not trying here to overstate the effects of a
capital-gains differential; it obviously doesn't solve all
the world's economic ills or relieve policy makers of their
responsibilities, such as controlling spending. Its purpose
is to free capital to seek its most productive uses, which of
course is why so few countries other than our own tax capital
gains as we do, if at all. The fact remains that Senator
Mitchell's defeat of the capital-gains cut was a mistake,
which is the reason for the fourth installment in this
series, "The Mitchell Recession?" A full recession isn't
here, but the Mitchell slowdown is, with falling government
receipts.
   By all reports, the congressional coalition for a
capital-gains cut is intact, and no one is disputing that it
would add significant revenue in its first year. This
certainly should be part of any deal the White House now
strikes with Congress. Indeed, the goal is sufficiently
worthwhile that it shouldn't be held hostage to any bigger
deal. Senator Mitchell and his supporters in the Democratic
party are free to fight the cut solely in class-warfare terms
if they so choose. But the rest of us are also free to argue
that the real issue is unlocking capital for productive
investments, and to the extent Mr. Mitchell continues to
thwart that process, he should be prepared to get blamed for
the consequences of an opportunity that was lost last
November.

   Some Germans Fear U.S. Military Pullout

   Primary Concern for Most
   Is One of Finances

   ZWEIBRUECKEN, West Germany -- A half-dozen U.S. airmen are
gathered around a tree stump anchored to the floor of
Heiney's bar, absorbed in the task of pounding nails into it.
Whoever drives home his nail first wins.
   Between turns with the hammer, the young servicemen draw
absently on their beers and nod to the thundering rock music.
It is only a Tuesday night, but Philip Bochicchio knows he is
turning a profit. The saloonkeeper jabs a thumb at the busy
dartboard, the packed bar and the group around the stump.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Americans like to have a good time," says Mr. Bochicchio,
an American who has lived here for most of his 38 years. But
he doesn't expect his booming business to last forever. "When
they leave, I leave," he says.
   Across town, the office of Gerd Fallboehmer's furnace and
drainage firm is cluttered with contracts and service awards
from U.S. military bases and housing compounds outside town,
which account for 60% of his business. Mr. Fallboehmer notes
a change in how the locals view the American presence.
   "A lot of people used to grumble into their beers that we
don't need them here," he says. "But they're talking a little
different now that {withdrawal plans are} cutting to the core
of their existence. We have to rethink everything, and there
are no alternatives in sight."
   The Cold War was money in the bank for the scores of West
German communities where U.S. troops have been based since
World War II. But as German reunification nears and the
likelihood grows that foreign troops will leave for good,
many of these garrison towns are realizing too late that
their communities relied too heavily on military spending.
   In late January, U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
dropped a bombshell on Zweibruecken's business community by
confirming a dreaded rumor: The U.S. air base here, home to
the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, is to be closed in
1993, and the 7,000 military personnel and dependents are to
be withdrawn.
   Their departure threatens 2,500 jobs in this city of
33,400, and about $83 million in annual business. Officials
fear this is only the first step in a regionwide U.S. troop
cut that casts doubt on every fifth job in the area.
   Older Zweibruecken residents aren't sure the U.S. should
rush out of West Germany with the fate of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform programs in question. But the
primary concern for most is one of finances. In Mainz, for
example, Mainz Industries Panzerwerk G.m.b.H. employs 5,000
workers solely to repair and maintain American tracked
military vehicles. A U.S. Army decision to cut its repair
programs threatens half of the company's jobs, Mainz
officials say.
   Three years ago, the U.S. European Command calculated that
the U.S. military pumps about 15 billion marks ($9.05
billion) into the West German economy annually, the bulk of
it from 29 major U.S. installations in seven of West
Germany's 11 states. That total, which includes local
spending by 252,000 U.S. servicemen and their 100,000
dependents, as well as base contracts extended to German
firms, is supplemented by the expenditures of the more than
100,000 British, French, Canadian, Belgian and Dutch troops
in West Germany.
   Of course, many West Germans see benefits in an allied
troops reduction. Big urban areas are eager to get their
hands on valuable property denied their developers for years.
The government of the wealthy central German state of Hesse
is eyeing the huge American air base that abuts Frankfurt's
international airport, as well as the U.S. air base in nearby
Wiesbaden. Developers are lining up for the U.S. army's
priceless real-estate holdings in Frankfurt itself.
   But the picture is a little different in
Rhineland-Palatinate, the state between France and the Rhine
River where Zweibruecken is located. It has eight North
Atlantic Treaty Organization air bases and the greatest
concentration of troops in West Germany, a situation born of
the logic that the river is a natural defense against a
Soviet-bloc attack.
   The U.S. fighters that regularly roar overhead on training
missions generally cause little comment, except when they
crash and kill civilians on the ground.
   "It will be a big loss when they go," says Cornelia
Winkelmann, day manager at a local hotel that gets half its
business from military transients. "On the other hand, there
is always that fear" of military airplane crashes.
   "For Hesse, an American withdrawal is like hitting the
lottery," says Rainer Bruederle, deputy premier and economics
minister of the Rhineland-Palatinate state government. "It
has a financial-services center with unbelievable growth that
needs the housing and the real estate." But in his state, he
adds, the possibility of a troop withdrawal has generated
only muted enthusiasm.
   The U.S. military is the biggest employer in this part of
the country. Mr. Bruederle estimates that as much as
two-thirds of his state's 70,000 U.S. troops, plus their
dependents, will be gone by the end of the decade. About
60,000 regional jobs are in jeopardy. "There is a lot of
handwringing going on here," he says.
   But while regional promoters are touting a program called
"Computer Chips Instead of Jet Planes," they acknowledge that
prospects of attracting growth industries are grim. "Nobody
ever thought about what we could do without the military,"
says chamber of commerce Director Karl Herzberger.
   "We made the mistake of assuming they would always be
here," says Heinz Moosmann, a local journalist. "It's going
to set off a chain reaction through this state's entire
economic structure. It's a mistake by the Americans to make
this decision thousands of kilometers away without first
talking to us. It's alienating -- even arrogant."
   A full-scale pullout also bodes ill for the housing
markets in rural garrison towns that have depended on U.S.
troops for demand. In Zweibruecken, base personnel occupy
about 600 houses and apartments.
   Much of the housing currently used by Americans could
stand empty unless the town can attract new industries. Even
the huge air base might be of little use. Town officials talk
vaguely of converting the facility into an industrial park,
but they wonder if decades of oil and aviation-fuel spillage
has contaminated the soil. Worse, locals fear that NATO will
retain the vacated air base for future emergency use, denying
it to the community.
   Mr. Bruederle, the state's deputy premier, is torn between
his state's economic problems and Germany's new role in
history. Reflecting the prevailing opinion in Bonn, he
describes the U.S. as an indispensable ally, but he adds that
the time has come for it to begin leaving German soil for the
two countries to define a more equal partnership.
   And, he says, "we also have to recognize that the American
taxpayer can't be persuaded to continue paying for the
security of those rich and sassy Europeans now that the
threat is nearly zero."

   Black South Africa's Civil War

   JOHANNESBERG -- Shortly after his release from prison,
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela appealed to
the warring black factions in this country to throw their
guns and knives into the sea. Up to 5,000 blacks have died at
the hands of other blacks since late 1984. The eastern
province of Natal has been the scene of the worst and most
bloodthirsty clashes, claiming the lives of more than 2,500
people over the past five years and rendering between 50,000
and 70,000 people homeless.
   But Mr. Mandela's plea has gone unheeded, and the violence
is getting worse. Since the beginning of this year, more than
600 people have been killed in Natal and more than 2,000 have
been injured. In the first two weeks of March alone, there
were 730 recorded instances of serious violence. The killings
have been brutal. Eighteen people have been "necklaced" --
burned to death by a gasoline-soaked tire round the neck --
this year. One of them was a nine-year-old-girl, another a
14-year-old boy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An 80-year-old woman was abducted and brutally stabbed to
death south of Durban. A 75-year-old black town councillor in
Newcastle, Natal, shot himself in the head to avoid capture
and a necklace death at the hands of a mob of youths. Tiny
babies have been burnt to death in fire-bombed houses, or
abandoned by parents fleeing for their lives.
   The strife is often described as inter-tribal violence
between the Zulus -- the largest of South Africa's 12 black
ethnic groups and formerly the rulers of large stretches of
present-day South Africa -- and the Xhosas, the second
largest group. This impression is sometimes sustained by the
chauvinist remarks of some traditional Zulu spokesmen.
Zwelethini Goodwill, hereditary king of the Zulus called on
his people in a March speech to honor their culture "with
your Zulu might."
   In that same speech, he railed against Zulu youth who join
trade unions and disobey their elders, and called upon Zulu
traditionalists to "act swiftly and decisively." This speech
was given in the middle of bloody fighting in Natal and was
taken as a "call to blood."
   When black troops from outside a region are deployed,
local people will often express fears that the troops are
Zulus. When black conservatives mobilize as "vigilantes" to
oppose radical activists in their townships they are widely
thought of as associated with the Zulus. Radical activists in
turn single out Zulus for punishment. Black youths on the
Witwatersrand have attacked motor vehicles with Natal
registration plates in a search of Zulus.
   In fact, though, the conflict among black South Africans
is not a tribal struggle, but an ideological one. Large
numbers of Zulus belong to the ANC and its affiliates, the
United Democratic Front and the Confederation of South
African Trade Unions. While the membership of Inkatha, the
religiously and politically conservative group that is the
ANC's chief rival for power in black South Africa, is
overwhelmingly Zulu, Inkatha's leader, Mangosutho Buthelezi,
has very seldom appealed to sectional tribal loyalties.
   Years ago Mr. Buthelezi incurred the wrath of the South
African government by issuing citizenship in the "independent
homeland" state KwaZulu, of which he is chief minister, to
Xhosas and other non-Zulus in order to help them to evade
"influx control" laws and move to the rapidly developing
industrial areas of Natal. Inkatha has always been open to
blacks of all tribes and has for years published its
materials not only in Zulu but in Sotho, English and
Afrikaans as well.
   Although Mr. Buthelezi is connected to the Zulu royal
family, his differences with the ANC are not ethnically
motivated. A devout traditional Anglican who considers
liberation theology a threat to the integrity of the Gospel,
Mr. Buthelezi understands the benefits of federalism and
devolution and mistrusts central state hegemony. His concern
with growth and employment has led him to oppose emphatically
the ANC's campaign for sanctions against South Africa. So,
while he has always acknowledged the importance of the ANC,
he cannot find a home in a movement that leans toward
socialism and is allied to the South African Communist Party.
   Mr. Buthelezi's views are shared by Zulu traditionalists,
many of them businessmen and conservative Christians. They
are fiercely rejected by unionized black workers, younger
urban activists and left-leaning ministers and priests. Zulus
are found on both sides of this intellectual divide -- a
divide that is the origin of the Inkatha-ANC struggle in
South Africa, and especially in Natal.
   Since 1985, the exiled ANC has sought to assert control
over all the anti-apartheid forces in South Africa. At the
end of 1989, the Mass Democratic Movement (an ANC front)
approved a motion at its "Conference for a Democratic Future"
to bring pressure to bear on "homeland" leaders to resign or
declare their loyalty to the ANC, and to bring similar
pressures to bear on local black town councilors.
   Political resistance to this bid for ANC dominance has
been greatest in Natal, where Inkatha is strongest. Inkatha,
in its turn, is accused by the ANC of having provoked the
violence by an aggressive membership campaign also aimed at
establishing political control in Natal.
   But while ideology explains the conflict between blacks in
South Africa, it does not explain why it is so bitter. After
all, the ANC has been able to establish political
understandings with five other "homeland" leaders, most
notably with Enos Mabusa, the chief minister of KaNgwane. One
must add a few additional ingredients to the analysis.
   As in many Third World societies in which democratic
pluralism has not yet taken root, politics in black South
Africa is about establishing local hegemony or control of
political territory. Add the fact that upward of 70% of black
township youth are unemployed, bored and tempted by the
excitement of political struggle, and it's no surprise that a
culture of violence is taking hold.
   A black doctor in Durban, Natal, was recently attacked by
UDF-linked youths who accused him of treating Inkatha
patients when he should treat only ANC sympathisers. In some
schools in metropolitan areas in Natal, Inkatha pupils are
made to feel at least unwelcome, if they are not actually
barred; in other schools in other areas UDF youth are put
under similar pressures. Violence erupted in Durban in March,
when a Confederation of South African Trade Unions-linked bus
strike prevented Inkatha supporters from attending a rally in
Durban at which the Zulu king spoke.
   Both the ANC and Inkatha are consequently ambivalent about
the violence in Natal. They want to establish or defend their
political control of black society in Natal. On the other
hand, the sheer brutality of conflict -- and the intense
personal vendettas that have emerged in the townships --
embarrasses them. UDF-ANC leaders complain of "criminal
elements" infiltrating their struggle and Inkatha feels
uneasy about local conservative "big men," called warlords,
who mount offensives on personal initiatives for which Mr.
Buthelezi is blamed.
   Peace talks between Mr. Mandela and Mr. Buthelezi were
planned for late March or early April, but Mr. Mandela broke
them off because, as he said on April 23, his movement ad
vised him against contact with Mr. Buthelezi so long as the
violence was raging. Mr. Buthelezi, in turn, is equally hesi
tant about talking in situations that will create the impres
sion he is conceding political primacy to the ANC.
   In the meantime, angry youths continue to fuel the flames.
"Mobilize, organize for the final offensive] All youth to
battle] All youth to the frontline]" This was the way in
which a recent conference of the UDF-linked South African
Youth Congress was reported by the ANC sympathizing newspaper
New Nation. At the moment, Inkatha appears to be more
powerful, or lethal, on the ground. The bulk of the refugees
in Natal come from communities sympathetic to the ANC.
   No doubt the ANC-linked youth will remobilize to reverse
the situation. An ANC leader in Natal, Harry Gwala, on May 1
issued a call: "Let us wipe them out if they attack us,"
reinforcing threats of massive retaliation against Inkatha
made on the same day by the Confederation of South African
Trade Unions.
   A prominent black journalist, Connie Molusi, said in a
recent discussion organized by the South African Institute of
Race Relations, that his knowledge of black South African
opposition politics convinced him that there was "no group
with a concept of political pluralism" -- with an effective
and not merely rhetorical commitment to the unpleasant
democratic duty of accepting the political opponents have a
right to mobilize and be heard.
   In the past, before President F.W. de Klerk's leadership,
the South African government hugely contributed to this
lethal tradition in South African politics by its repression
of resistance movements. Unless a mood of at least reluctant
tolerance of political opponents can take root in South
African society, current negotiations may yield power sharing
between whites and some black power-groupings, but they will
not bring democracy in the sense that the West understands
it. Until all political groupings come to understand the view
that democratic politics is about representation and not
about control, the killing will continue.

   PARIS -- British Aerospace PLC and Aerospatiale of France
confirmed they will conduct a five-year study to decide
whether to develop a new supersonic airliner to replace their
jointly produced Concorde.
   The final decision on whether to proceed with a $10
billion dollar production program will be made in 1995,
Aerospatiale President Henri Martre said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He said the feasibility study, which would cost about $34
million dollars, would focus on such issues as market
potential, technical factors and environmental protection.
   Mr. Martre said the British and French companies would
welcome cooperation with other industrial powers, including
the U.S., Soviet Union, West Germany and Japan.
   British Airways and Air France together operate 13
Concordes on trans-Atlantic routes. These planes are due for
retirement within 15 to 20 years; the new planes, if
developed, would be ready by about 2005.
   The projected aircraft would be capable of nonstop flights
across the Pacific.

   BANK OF JAPAN'S WARNING

   The steady rise in Japanese land prices in the late 1980s
could reverse and trigger widespread financial problems, the
Bank of Japan warned.
   History doesn't bear out a view common in Japan "that land
prices will keep climbing and never decline," the central
bank cautioned in a report. That sense of inevitability is
driving economic decisions and threatens the economy, the
bank said.
   The bank urged legal and tax reforms to end incentives for
property speculation. In the meantime, it said, financial
institutions must be monitored to ensure that a tumble in
land prices doesn't lead to upheaval in the financial system
and undermine the value of the yen.
   Cases in the U.S. and Britain show that when land prices
rise steeply over a short time, they may turn lower again,
the bank noted. "Experiences abroad suggest that it is
important to forestall any turbulence which might arise from
a sudden change in land prices, in order to maintain a safe
and sound financial system," the bank concluded.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIAN COUNTERATTACK
                                                                                                       

   Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans criticized the
U.S. for having a "high moral tone" on trade practices. Mr.
Evans told the Australian Senate that U.S. criticism of
Australian trade practices was hardly fair in view of some of
the U.S.'s own practices. Australia has complained about U.S.
grain subsidies to the Soviet Union, which it said undercut
its own market. The foreign minister's comments followed
questioning about a report last month in which the U.S.
criticized Australia's tariff regime and customs evaluation,
among other practices.
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMAN UNEMPLOYMENT
                                                                                                       

   Official unemployment in East Germany nearly doubled in
April to 64,948 job seekers from 38,313 people the previous
month, the East German state news agency ADN reported. The
news agency also said 48,858 people had registered with the
state seeking unemployment compensation. Of the nearly 65,000
jobless East German people seeking employment, 12,000 were
school leavers, while 36,000 were skilled workers and 16,000
were unskilled.
                                                                                                       

   SEOUL BUYS SOVIET URANIUM
                                                                                                       

   Korea Electric Power Corp. signed a contract to buy 390
tons of enriched uranium, valued at about $230 million, from
the Soviet Union, Energy and Resources Minister Lee Hee Il
announced. Mr. Lee said the 10-year contract was signed in
Seoul between the state-run power company and Technadexport,
the Soviet state-run nuclear-related export agency. Korea
Electric operates nine nuclear-power plants and is building
several more. It will be capitalist South Korea's first deal
to import uranium from any East European or communist
country.
                                                                                                       

   BRITISH BANKING SLIPPAGE
                                                                                                       

   The United Kingdom's share of international-banking
business slipped 2% in the first nine months of 1989 to less
than 19.5% of the total, the Bank of England said. The
British central bank, in a report entitled "Developments in
International Banking and Capital Markets in 1989,"
attributed the decline to a number of factors, including "an
absolute fall in local foreign-currency interbank lending."
It also suggested that currency deregulation within the
European Community and enhanced trade within the EC were
leading to a shift in banking activity away from the U.K. and
toward continental Europe.
                                                                                                       

   NO FUNDS TO SOVIETS
                                                                                                       

   Agreement on a $12 billion development bank for East
Europe is expected at the end of May, but no U.S. funds wil
go to Moscow for three years, Treasury Undersecretary David
Mulford told Congress. World Bank and International Monetary
Fund officials said the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, to be located in London, will be headed by
Jacques Attali, an adviser to French President Francois
Mitterand.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN'S NOMURA SECURITIES
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Nomura Securities Co. said it will set up European
headquarters in London in June to oversee its European
subsidiaries. The new company's responsibilities will include
personnel and finance administration for Nomura's European
units, which are spread among the United Kingdom, France,
Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy and
West Germany.
                                                                                                       

   THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT
                                                                                                       

   Senior officials from the world's industrialized and
developing nations decided to put off for further study a
plan to create a pilot fund that would finance programs
designed to reduce global environmental problems.
   The fund, originally proposed by France, would require
financing of between $300 million and $400 million annually
for three years. France has said it is prepared to put up
$150 million a year for the first three years of the project,
but the U.S. has said it won't participate in the project.
   In a statement released at the end of a meeting of the
joint Development Committee of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, the officials said that further
work is necessary to develop methods for the World Bank to
assist developing countries to take actions that contribute
to the reduction of global environmental problems.
   In their statement, the officials called on the World Bank
to take steps to expand its existing environmental programs
that contribute to the same objective.

   Italy agreed to give Malta more than $200 million in aid
and to provide helicopters and patrol boats to help combat
drug trafficking through the island nation. . . . In Hungary,

   Mattel to Pay
   First Dividend
   In Seven Years

   Senior Notes to Be Repaid;
   Licensing Pact Reached
   On `Simpsons' Products

   LOS ANGELES -- Mattel Inc. announced its first quarterly
dividend in seven years and said it plans to repay $75
million in senior subordinated extendible notes. The move
reflects improved earnings during the past several quarters.
   The toy maker also announced at its annual meeting a
licensing agreement with Twentieth Century Fox Licensing &amp;
Merchandising to produce toys and related products based on
the hit television cartoon series "The Simpsons." Twentieth
Century Fox is a News Corp. unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dividend of three cents for each share of common stock
is payable July 2 to stock of record June 15. Mattel's last
common stock dividend was paid in June 1983, the year the
company's plunge into electronic toys and other strategies
resulted in a $394 million loss. That prompted a major
restructuring and eventually a change in senior management.
   John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the board will review its dividend policy each
quarter, but he said it hadn't determined a set amount to be
paid.
   Mattel won't extend $75 million of 10 7/8% senior
subordinated extendible notes, and it plans to repay the
notes on the July 15 due date. The board also authorized the
purchase of as much as 500,000 of the company's 50.5 million
common shares during the next year on the open market to fund
Mattel's stock-option plan.
   Mattel's stock climbed 50 cents on the news, closing at
$24 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   In an interview, Mr. Amerman said he is comfortable with
analysts' per-share earnings estimates of $2 to $2.10 for
1990.
   In 1989, Mattel earned $68.7 million, or $1.38 a share, on
sales of $1.2 billion.
   The world-wide licensing pact with Twentieth Century Fox
will feature the offbeat members of the Simpson family,
especially the spiky-haired son, Bart. The line will include
action figures, vehicles and play sets, as well as dolls,
preschool products and child-sized accessories.
   The products will be rolled out this fall with the new
episodes of "The Simpsons," and new products will be
introduced for the spring 1991 season. Al Ovadia, Twentieth
Century Fox's vice president, licensing, said the company has
signed more than 100 licensing agreements on "The Simpsons,"
ranging from apparel, school supplies and games, to
skateboards and computer games.
   Mr. Amerman estimated that the licensing agreement could
produce more than $20 million in sales by year end, but he
said he couldn't predict the value of the agreement over the
long run.
   Entertainment-related character tie-ins can be fraught
with problems, as it is extremely difficult to gauge the
public appetite for movies, TV shows and cartoons.
   Mattel passed up the licensing for "Star Wars" characters
in the mid-1970s, and that line proved to be one of the most
lucrative ever. Mattel also passed on licensing pacts for a
current hit movie "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Conversely,
others in the toy industry have bombed when characters
suddenly fell out of favor.
   More recently, though, Mattel has launched some successful
licensed product lines. Its Disney preschool and infant toys
racked up $135 million in sales last year. For 1990, Mattel
has introduced an infant toy using Muppet's characters.
   Despite the unpredictability of such a venture, most
toy-industry analysts say the Simpsons tie-in could be a
profitable sideline for Mattel.
   "If you do it as an adjunct part of your business and not
the mainstream, and if you manage your products carefully,
you'll be in good shape," said Thomas Kully, an analyst with
William Blair &amp; Co. in Chicago. But Mr. Kully and other
observers did voice some uncertainty over how much appeal
"The Simpsons" has among younger viewers. "Is it really a
kids' property?" Mr. Kully asked.
   Twentieth Century Fox said Simpson-licensed clothing and
other merchandise has been selling briskly through special
departments in 1,200 J.C. Penney Co. department stores, and
consumer demand should remain steady as licensees such as
Mattel introduce fresh products during the fall television
season.

   Slumping bond prices and a plunging dollar kept stock
prices from posting an eighth consecutive gain.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a scant 0.68 point
to 2732.88 in moderately active trading. Long-term bond
prices fell despite a good response to the Treasury's sale of
$10 billion in 10-year notes. The dollar plunged to its
lowest level in two years against the West German mark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices and the dollar set the tone for the day. The
dollar's steep drop against the mark reflected the opinion of
many currency traders that U.S. interest rates may be headed
lower. That opinion is rooted in evidence the U.S. economy is
more sluggish than had been thought and in the success of the
first leg of the Treasury's three-part, $30.5 billion
quarterly refunding auction Tuesday.
   The dollar tumbled to a 28-month low against the West
German mark as news spread that the Bush administration might
be willing to raise some taxes to reduce the U.S. budget
deficit.
   "It was a bad day for the dollar," said Robert Hatcher, a
vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York. "The market
feels that if Bush is inclined to hike taxes and reduce the
budget deficit, then interest rates in the U.S. can go lower.
Some of the hot money started to leave." Lower interest rates
generally tend to reduce a currency's allure to international
investors and speculators. Over the past two weeks, the
dollar has fallen 3.5% against the mark.
   Bond prices fell because of uncertainty about the outcome
of the remainder of the Treasury's refunding auction.
Although the first sale went well, traders were more
concerned about the sale of 10-year notes yesterday and $10
billion in 30-year bonds today. News that the 10-year notes
sold at an average yield of 8.88% wasn't enough to convince
traders today's 30-year auction would go as well.
   The weakness in the dollar and bond prices spread to
stocks early in the day. The Dow industrials were off about
13 points with less than 30 minutes of trading left when the
results of the note sale were announced. Some
computer-assisted buy programs were triggered, recouping
nearly all the lost ground by the close. Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index eked out a small gain.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices were mixed. Volume totaled 152.2 million
shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where gaining issues
outnumbered decliners 760 to 733.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar plunged against the mark. In late New York
trading the dollar was quoted at 1.6360 marks, down from
1.6573 Tuesday, and at 156.60 yen down from 157.62 yen
Tuesday.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. The
yield on the issue climbed to 8.86%.

   Commencement Speaking: Bloviating
   To the Bored and Boorish

   Now is the moment of somewhat breathless anticipation on
innumerable campuses across the nation. Fingers are crossed,
small prayers are being uttered to a pantheon of gods, and
reputations stand teetering upon the edge.
   No, not among the graduating seniors. Their fate is
already settled. Most of those being asked to return for
another try have already heard the bad news. Where the future
is still in doubt is in the offices of university presidents
and chancellors. What will their honored guests, the
commencement speakers, produce this time in exchange for
their honorary degrees and/or fees. And how will the students
behave?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the past is any guide, they should relax, try to enjoy
it and promise that next year they'll drop the whole thing.
When it comes to the speakers themselves, the colleges will
once more get just about what they deserve, which is to say
that high mediocrity will be the order of the day. Given the
reasons behind the selection of most commencement speakers,
nothing else should be expected. The vast majority are chosen
because they are 1) famous or notorious, 2) rich, 3) wise, at
least by the lights of the selection committee, 4) rich, 5)
of interest for the moment to people who are temporarily in
their early 20s or 6) rich.
   Having been the recipient of a few of those desperate
requests for that oratorical diversion that falls after the
processional and before the recessional, in the time not
otherwise taken by the awarding of diplomas and other bits of
academic bookkeeping, I can testify from experience and
performance. If the speakers are even moderately self-aware,
they know they are irrelevant and are therefore blessedly
brief. If they are so fatuous as to believe that the students
assembled hang in fascinated rapture on their every word,
they will be unbearably long. In either case, to command
Lincoln for a lesser purpose, the world will little note nor
long remember what is said there. Particularly not that
little world of students, parents and friends who make up the
vast majority of every commencement audience.
   Unless things go really badly or extraordinarily well.
Last year, for instance, a noted scientist gave a first-rate
talk at a university that prides itself on its high ranking
on all the usual charts. Everything was first-rate about it,
that is, except the graduates' response, which can best be
described as lowlife vulgar. They talked, they cheered, they
uncorked cheap champagne bottles after unending bottles to
the accompaniment of loud pops and spewing geysers of
well-shaken froth, they waved back and forth and weaved in
and out of the stadium as nature required. They did
everything, in fact, but listen. It was really too bad, since
the speaker had more to offer than much of what they had
heard for the preceding four years, but theirs was also a
crude statement of the obvious. That speaker up there on the
platform might have something to do with the university's
sense of itself, but he had virtually nothing to do with
them. Since they are the children of a boorish era, they
acted accordingly, which only goes to show that not even a
$100,000 education can produce behavior that society does not
routinely demand.
   Not that such behavior is to be understood solely as the
province of uncivilized post-adolescents, lumpen proletariat
with sheepskins, young men and women without a collective
thought or care. It is occasionally the reflection of a
singularly different impulse. That is, there is the
graduation speaker who seems to have only too much to do with
whatever is roiling at least a portion of the student sea at
the time. There has been less of this kind of reaction among
students of late, certainly as compared with the 1960s and
early 1970s, perhaps because college administrations are more
cautious in their selections than they once were.
Self-censorship has proved itself alive and well at more than
one institution when it comes to speakers at graduation and,
unfortunately, at other times during the school year as well.
   Nevertheless, meticulously choreographed and occasionally
rowdy protests of a graduation speaker's allegedly noxious
beliefs and public activities are still not uncommon. Sexism,
racism, capitalism, liberalism, materialism, whateverism --
all these and a dozen other sins can provoke the "just wrath
and indignation" of at least some of the graduates.
   In that regard, it has been a delight to watch from afar
the anachronistic salvos from the ideological trenches over
the selection of First Lady Barbara Bush, as Wellesley's
graduation speaker. The question of whether Mrs. Bush is or
is not a formidable person in her own right -- which on the
evidence, she clearly is -- has been lost in what many
somehow perceive to be a serious debate about the legitimacy
of her selection. That she is primarily a wife and mother is
regarded as an insult by a minority of the students. But just
when it appeared that the protesters had taken out a patent
on the silliest possible form of doctrinaire
self-righteousness, along came the counterprotesters to prove
that humorlessness is no respecter of causes. Someone should
compile the editorials and columns that have been appeared on
this subject over the past two weeks and publish them as a
solemn warning to all who might be tempted to become
editorial essayists. By comparison, anything Mrs. Bush has to
say will seem a miracle of grace and wisdom.
   There have been some stunning moments in the history of
commencements talks, singular exceptions to the rule.
Churchill at Fulton, Mo., invoking the Iron Curtain.
Secretary of State George Marshall outlining at Harvard the
plan for European recovery that was to bear his name. Surely
among the clutch of entertainers, anchormen, financiers,
foundation executives, politicians, corporation CEOs,
clerics, government officials and felons who have already
been announced as graduation speakers this year there will be
one whose writers will produce a memorable idea or two, or
whose own head and fingers will actually construct a proposal
of worth not only to the graduating seniors but to the nation
and world.
   But most won't, just as they don't most of the time in
whatever occupations or professions they inhabit. Knowing
that, the wonder is that so many -- the vast majority of
American colleges and universities -- persist with a
tradition whose time has long since passed. Think what a
relief it would be for the kids not to have to endure yet one
more interlude as a captive audience before receiving their
diplomas. Think about the amount of pressure on
administrators it would relieve each year, no longer forced
to compete for the superstars of commerce, government, arts
and the media with no super-little to say. (Other ways could
be easily found to flatter potential big givers.)
   Man and boy, I've been there more times than I can count,
as graduate, father, friend, speaker and faculty. Man and
boy, I've never thought the game was worth the candle, not
even when it was my candle. The funny thing is, hardly anyone
else does either. If someone would just say that from a
prominent graduation podium this year, the whole thing would
collapse of its own dead weight. The funeral would be without
mourners.

   To Know Badminton
   Is to Stop Reviling It

   I read James P. Sterba's April 6 Leisure &amp; Arts article,
"Down With Shuttlecocks," with intense amusement. Obviously,
nobody likes to have his recreational fun spoiled by a change
in his gym's schedule. And to have only "three adults and
four children" take over the gym for two hours to play
badminton, replacing the "dozens of basketball-loving men and
boys from New York's mean streets," must have been very
frustrating.
   Basketball is a great game, but Mr. Sterba jumped to
several conclusions in his article that warrant comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   First, unless he plays with basketball players very
different from those I have played with through the years, he
makes a rather generous "leap of faith" to term them
"God-fearing males gathered into the warm Christian bonds of
basketball fellowship." The hoopsters' contempt and
disrespect for other sports are notorious, as is obviously
the case with Mr. Sterba.
   His desire to "smear badminton fair and square" by linking
the late Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and badminton (by way of
Poona) is a non sequitur. Real shuttlecocks are made from
real geese (and often ducks). But, Mr. Sterba would have lost
his bet, because they are not pulled from "unsedated" geese.
Rather, the feathers are leftovers from the down industry,
i.e. sleeping bags and down jackets, etc.
   Requiring nearly two weeks elapsed time of manufacturing,
huge baskets of feathers are sorted, trimmed, bleached,
dried, re-sorted, inserted, glued, sewn and precisely tested
for weight, flight distance and vibration and graded
accordingly. Thousands of families, primarily in China and
Taiwan, make their livelihood as shuttlecock makers. I
personally have seen the process.
   Admittedly, badminton in the U.S. has a long way to go.
Only a very few badminton players can afford to train full
time. But progress is being made. U.S. National Badminton
teams have shown marked improvement in world rankings
recently, the promotional nightmare of badminton's backward
stigma is slowly dissolving, and more facilities are
providing some badminton court time.
   Guy Chadwick

   ---
   With the exception of soccer, badminton is played by more
people in the world than any other sport. One of the main
reasons China, Indonesia and other badminton powers are
powers is because almost all of their children start playing
at a very early age and are properly coached. This gives
those countries an enormous pool to draw from. We all realize
that is exactly what is needed in the U.S. Naturally, the
more individuals available for competitions, the better
showing that can be made.
   I believe it's important that Mr. Sterba and the 44% of
the sportscasters who wanted badminton removed from the
Olympics become familiar with the game. If he and they do,
they all will be supportive -- I'll guarantee it.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush and top congressional leaders
agreed to begin budget talks at the White House Tuesday, but
the administration insisted that Mr. Bush hasn't surrendered
his opposition to tax increases yet.
   A senior administration official who is involved in the
budget talks emphasized in an interview that while the
administration is approaching the talks with an open mind,
"we haven't changed what we favor and we haven't changed what
we're opposed to."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater gave reporters the
same message. "In the past, some people have said that
raising taxes has to be on the table," he said. "But no
preconditions means just the opposite. It means the table is
clean."
   Nevertheless, talk on Capitol Hill continued to center on
taxes. Referring to Mr. Bush's "Read my lips: No new taxes"
campaign pledge, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said that "we won't have to worry
about lips anymore" but instead can "start digging into our
pockets."
   Republican congressional leaders joined the White House in
trying to cool speculation that the budget summit will
provide political cover for tax increases. Emerging from a
caucus with his members, House Republican Leader Robert
Michel (R., Ill.) told reporters, "I told them to keep their
powder dry."
   Other Republicans, however, continued to argue that
Democrats are forcing the president to raise taxes. Rep. Bill
Archer of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Ways and
Means Committee and a delegate to the summit, said, "When we
sit down and talk, we expect them {Democrats} to put higher
taxes as the linchpin of a deficit-reduction program."
   That sort of talk led House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D., Mo.), who is to head the summit talks when Mr.
Bush isn't present, to complain: "If people simply see it as
a political high-ground exercise, then it won't go anywhere."
   Added House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.): "Good faith
means not posturing politically on either side."
   But in an illustration of the tensions between the
parties, remarks by Rep. Robert Torricelli (D., N.J.)
suggesting that Mr. Bush had been "intellectually dishonest"
during his 1988 presidential campaign provoked a
parliamentary flap on the House floor. Republicans, objecting
to that description of Mr. Bush's position on taxes, tried to
block Mr. Torricelli from proceeding. It took a House vote,
won by Democrats, for the New Jersey liberal to win
permission to continue. Mr. Torricelli subsequently described
Mr. Bush's position on taxes in terms only slightly less
stringent, saying that Mr. Bush had been "intellectually
inconsistent."
   Meanwhile, the White House -- reacting in part to demands
from many Democrats that the administration help prepare the
public for the possibility of a painful deficit-reduction
package -- described the government's fiscal plight in
increasingly dire terms.
   "Severe action needs to be taken to reduce the deficit and
keep the economy on a sound track," Mr. Fitzwater said. "The
deficit is increasing due to a number of factors -- partly
rising interest rates, reduced revenues to the government,
and the cost of the savings and loan bailout."
   But responding to concerns voiced by rank-and-file
Democrats, House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
asked White House Budget Director Richard Darman to testify
before his committee Tuesday both to explain the
administration's swelling deficit forecast and to detail tax
and spending policies that the administration proposes in
response. A spokeswoman for Mr. Darman said that because
summit talks are to begin Tuesday, he won't testify on that
day.
   Congressional negotiators at the so-called summit next
week will include the Democratic chairmen and the senior
Republicans on the Senate and House Budget, Appropriations
and tax-writing committees. Two partisan House leaders also
will be involved: Speaker Foley designated Mr. Gephardt as
his representative and Mr. Michel designated House Minority
Whip Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.). Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell (D., Maine) picked Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.) as
his representative. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R.,
Kan.) designated Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas).
   The White House lists the president, Chief of Staff John
Sununu, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, and Mr. Darman as
its formal negotiating team, but officials said Messrs.
Darman and Brady will play the major day-to-day role. Other
members of the administration will also be included. White
House chief economist Michael Boskin will deal with tax and
economic policy; Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft will address
defense issues; and the president's domestic policy adviser,
Roger Porter, will handle domestic spending programs.
   Although administration officials said talks will go on as
long as both sides find them productive, a senior official
said the hope is that they will progress quickly and be
concluded in "weeks rather than months."
   The immediate goal of budget talks is to find a way to
reduce the deficit for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, by
between $45 billion and $55 billion. That's the amount the
administration says is needed to avoid across-the-board
spending cuts this fall under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law. If all spending on the thrift industry
cleanup is included in the complex Gramm-Rudman calculations,
the administration says, $100 billion in deficit-reduction
measures will be needed.

in Macintosh software since 1984. Nevertheless the company
tried to put a good face on the development, downplaying its
effect on pressure from competing systems such as Microsoft
Corp.'s Windows 3 product and others.

<TEXT>
   The announcement came at a Macintosh developers
conference, where developers were given early versions of the
product to test.
   "We told everybody last year that we were going to shoot
for late summer," said Jim Davis, director of systems
software marketing. "What we're committing to now is the end
of the year."
   "It's probably for the better," he said, because the delay
will give developers more time to test the limits of the new
system, which incorporates new functions into the popular
machine, such as ease of access to large data bases.
   "Software is hard," Mr. Davis added. "To get within five
or six months {of a forecast} is pretty good."

   NEW YORK -- Creditors of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc.'s commodities trading unit filed an involuntary
bankruptcy petition against the subsidiary.
   The creditors, including the central banks of Portugal and
Yugoslavia, as well as Nissho Iwai Corp., a Japanese trading
company, made the filing under Chapter 7 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. A Drexel spokesman said it won't challenge
the filing but will seek to have it converted to a Chapter 11
case, under which the debtor remains in control of the
company. The motion was filed in U.S. bankruptcy court in
Manhattan.

<TEXT>
   DBL Trading, of Fort Lee, N.J., is no longer doing
business and has been "winding down" its positions since Feb.
13, when the parent filed under Chapter 11. A Drexel
spokesman said the trading unit has a net liability of $505
million; its chief asset is a $558 million claim owed to the
unit by the parent company. The parent borrowed $600 million
from the unit before it filed under Chapter 11.
   Barry Dichter, a bankruptcy partner with Cadwalader,
Wickersham &amp; Taft, which represents the central bank of
Portugal, said DBL Trading has about 100 other creditors. The
central bank of Portugal is owed $120 million, he said. The
central banks leased a small portion of their gold reserves
to the unit, which paid the foreign countries interest on the
gold while investing it in other transactions. The largest
creditor is Nissho Iwai, which is owed $500 million.
   Mr. Dichter said the unit had paid about 10% of the amount
that is owed.

   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it assigned its
SP-1 rating to New York City's $900 million of general
obligation revenue anticipation notes -- or RANs -- fiscal
1990, Series C and D. S&amp;P also affirmed its SP-1 rating on
$1.25 billion of outstanding RANs due June 29.
   S&amp;P said the city is being forced to do additional fiscal
1990 cash flow borrowing because of New York state's delay in
adopting its 1991 budget. S&amp;P also said the city's long-range
credit outlook remains negative because of a looming $1
billion budget gap. "There are enough risks and uncertainties
. . . that balanced financial results are by no means
assured," S&amp;P said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also, Moody's Investors Service Inc. assigned its MIG-2
rating to today's RAN issue. Moody's also lowered to MIG-2
from MIG-1 the ratings on the fiscal 1990 series A and B
notes also due June 29.
   Moody's also cited uncertainties surrounding the
resolution of the state budget process or the city's
statutory ability to renew its notes if the state monies
aren't received on time.
   Last night New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins blasted
the Moody's decision, calling it "premature and unnecessary."
Speaking at a dinner of the Municipal Forum of New York, Mr.
Dinkins said he understands the rationale for the decision
but strongly disagrees with it and hopes to persuade Moody's
to change its decision.

   Jury Deadlocks
   On Damages
   In Ford Case

<LP>
   DETROIT -- A federal judge declared a mistrial in the
final, damage-award phase of a patent suit brought by Robert
W. Kearns against Ford Motor Co. after seven jurors couldn't
convince a lone holdout that the inventor should get no more
than $3 million.
   For Mr. Kearns, who had earlier won a judgment from the
same jury that Ford infringed his valid patents for an
electronically-controlled, intermittent windshield wiper
system, the mistrial means another delay in a 12-year battle
that involves not just Ford, but nearly every other major
auto maker in the world.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But interviews with four of the eight jurors suggest that
Ford, which switched its lead counsel after losing the first
phase of the trial, came close to emerging with just a
scratch from a case some patent law experts -- including
presiding U.S. District Court Judge Avern Cohn -- said had
the potential for a huge jury award. Ford had stipulated that
it installed wiper systems that infringed on the Kearns
patents on more than 20.5 million vehicles between 1971 and
1988.
   The jury foreperson, Sharon Harrison-Hamburg, said last
night that after six days of debate, she and six other jurors
felt Mr. Kearns should receive between $2.5 million and $3
million -- not much more than the $1.5 million maximum Ford
lawyers argued was reasonable. She called Mr. Kearns's
lawyer's plea for an award of $325 million an "insult (to)
our intelligence."
   All eight jurors agreed on Tuesday that Ford's
infringement of Mr. Kearns's patents wasn't willful. A
finding of intentional infringement would have allowed the
judge to double or triple any damage award.
   But on the question of money, "there was one who would not
negotiate and held out for $20 million," Mrs.
Harrison-Hamburg said. Three other jurors reached yesterday
described the deadlock similarly. One said that the majority
at one point considered awarding Mr. Kearns as much as $7
million. The woman identified as the dissenter by two of the
jurors couldn't be reached for comment.
   "It was a horrible feeling to leave there" without
reaching a verdict, said juror Anne Grasser.
   Now another jury could have to wrestle with the damages
issue in a new trial, unless the two parties settle. The two
sides didn't know yesterday evening what had gone on in the
jury room, because Judge Cohn didn't allow them to question
the jurors in court.
   Mr. Kearns declared yesterday that he would fight on. "It
was a disappointment, of course," Mr. Kearns said of Judge
Cohn's ruling. "If the journey has to be longer, we're ready
to make that journey," he said.
   Ford, in a statement yesterday, said it, too, was
disappointed that the jury couldn't reach a decision on
damages. "However, we are pleased that the jury recognized
that Ford didn't intentionally infringe the Kearns patents,"
the company said.
   Ford added that it has asked Judge Cohn to overrule the
jury's earlier verdict upholding the validity of the Kearns
windshield wiper patents. That's the first step in what is
likely to be a lengthy appeals process.
   "We continue to believe the Kearns patents were invalid
because the ideas covered by them were disclosed by patents
previously issued to other inventors," Ford said.
   Ford has admitted that three of its intermittent
windshield wiper systems are similar to Mr. Kearns's designs,
but has argued that doesn't matter because Mr. Kearns's
patents are invalid.
   The impasse in the jury room provoked a lengthy battle,
during which the majority of the jurors sought to convince
the single dissenter that Mr. Kearns's inventions simply
weren't worth tens of millions of dollars.
   "We were trying to get reasonable numbers," said juror
Stanley Shackman, who, like Mr. Kearns, is an electrical
engineer.
   Judge Cohn declared the mistrial shortly after 4 p.m. EDT
yesterday after jurors sent a note describing the deadlock as
hopeless. He ordered the parties to stay in the courtroom for
several minutes while the jurors left the federal courthouse
in downtown Detroit.
   The Kearns-Ford litigation is being watched with intense
interest by the world's major auto makers, nearly all of whom
are defendants in a series of patent infringement suits filed
by Mr. Kearns since 1978. The Ford case is the first to come
to trial.
   After Ford lost the first phase of the trial in January,
it brought in a new team of lawyers headed by Malcolm Wheeler
of the Los Angeles office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp;
Flom.
   During the second phase of the trial, Mr. Wheeler rained
blows on Mr. Kearns's argument that he was the victim of
willful wrongdoing by Ford. Among other things, Mr. Wheeler
presented letters sent by Mr. Kearns to his lawyers and a
business partner during the early 1970s in which the inventor
appears to urge that his patent claims be expanded to cover
specific details of Ford's existing wiper systems.
   Mr. Kearns's lead trial lawyer, Paul Janicke of
Houston-based Arnold, White &amp; Durkee, argued to the jurors
that they should focus instead on Ford's admission that its
wiper systems mirrored the claims of Mr. Kearns's patents.
Ford, he said, had reaped $557 million in profits from the
infringing systems. Ford's argument that Mr. Kearns was owed
just $1.5 million "isn't reasonable, it isn't fair, and it
isn't just," he told the jury.
   Mr. Janicke offered jurors two different methods for
calculating a "reasonable royalty." One yielded about $190
million, while the other produced a royalty of $325 million.
   "That fell by the wayside quickly," said Mrs. Grasser.
"There was no basis to it."

   Brent Walker Group PLC, a British leisure concern, said
1989 pretax profit leaped 97%, helped by large gains in
earnings from all divisions.
   Pretax profit for the year was #82.2 million ($137.3
million), up from #41.7 million a year ago. Sales more than
quadrupled to #526 million. Earnings per share more than
doubled to 88.7 pence from 41.1 pence a year ago. The surge
in earnings partly reflects the company's purchase in October
of William Hill Organization and Mecca Bookmakers Ltd. from
Grand Metropolitan PLC for #685 million.

   However, the company reported an increase in interest
payments to #40 million from #5.4 million in the year-earlier
period as a result of its buying spree. Nonetheless, Brent
Walker Chairman George Walker said the company's broad base
of activities gave investors protection during an economic
downturn.
   The company said a "substantial proportion" of its
business is in pubs, brewing and betting activities, and
these areas have shown "a strong resistance to reductions in
consumer demand."

   Letters to the Editor:
   What Does `Homeless' Really Mean?
</HL>
<DATE>
05/10/90
</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A23
</SO>
<LP>
   Randall K. Filer gave a good analysis of why policy makers
are bombarded with conflicting assessments of the homeless
problem ("What We Really Know About the Homeless," editorial
page, April 10). The confusion may lie more in how "homeless"
is defined in the various studies, rather than the differing
estimates and explanations derived.
   Federal statutes define homeless to mean "lower-income
families and individuals, elderly families and individuals,
and handicapped families and individuals that lack permanent
housing, reside in grossly inadequate or grossly substandard
accommodations, or whose primary residence is in institutions
of any type without a fixed and permanent place to live upon
discharge."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Other definitions include those who sleep in shelters,
parks, abandoned buildings, and rented hotel and motel rooms
paid for by public or private agencies; individuals
doubled-up with friends and relatives, or living in
short-term rental housing; those in institutional care with
no permanent address; or those considered "at risk" of
becoming homeless.
   This diversity leads to contradictory estimates. For
example, the U.S. Conference of Mayors estimates that as much
as 50% of the homeless population is made up of families. The
Campaign to End Hunger and Homelessness indicates that
roughly two-thirds of the homeless are single men. The
Friends Committee on National Legislation claims that nearly
30% of all homeless people are employed. The National Academy
of Sciences' Institute of Medicine estimates that there are
at least 100,000 homeless children on any given night. And
the National Coalition for the Homeless claims that 60% of
the homeless population consists of women and children.
   We may never be able to deal with the homeless problem
until there is a consensus on what it means to be "homeless."
   Rep. David Dreier (R., Calif.)
   Washington
   ---
   Mr. Filer talks about "mental health," drug and alcohol
problems, and criminal records being more common among
low-income people and the homeless. He is, of course, really
talking about mental illness. The substitution for mental
health when we mean mental illness comes from our strong
tendency to accentuate the positive. But such desire is
misplaced when it lets us ignore the fact of serious mental
illness.
   Once we acknowledge that mental illness does not go away
by focusing on mental health, but that it does respond to
treatment, we will seek asylum for those who need it, and cut
down the homeless and the prison populations by that much.
   Elsie Roberts
   Rhodesdale, Md.
   ---
   The housing hurdle for the homeless has been raised
another notch, this time by Mr. Filer, who takes the not
unusual academician's approach to a problem -- study it to
death before taking any action. No matter that Mr. Filer
admits, "Issues of causality are complicated by the fact that
many factors are interrelated." According to Mr. Filer's
logic, we should not attempt to save a drowning man, but
rather reflect on how he came to be in his predicament.
   There are loads of available statistics on the homeless,
and perhaps Mr. Filer's desire is a $1 million government
grant to unearth them. Let me save Uncle Sam some money.
   General Assistance in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area
provides $203 a month for single people who have little or no
income and meet eligibility standards. Food stamps, county
health-care assistance and clinics are also available. But
affordable housing is not. The Metropolitan Apartment Guide
figures state that a studio apartment in North St. Paul rents
for $292 a month, a one-bedroom unit for $377. In the
suburbs, the rents are $505 and $571 respectively.
   One doesn't need a Ph.D. to get the message -- a homeless
person can't afford housing here or in most places in the
country. The answer is money or -- more precisely --
lower-cost housing for the poor.
   It doesn't matter whether the homeless number 350,000 or
three million. Even 350,000 is an intolerable number and a
national disgrace in a country so blessed with abundance.

   ---
   Mr. Filer attributed great significance and mystery to
just another buzzword of these weird times in America. The
words "homeless" and "homelessness" occurred 46 times. Left
out entirely were the terms Foodless, Shoeless, Clothesless,
Transportationless and even Dollarless. Assetlessness would
have a nice buzz. But how about using the term "Poverty"?
Buzzwords are harmful; they are used, with enormous help from
the media, to empower advocacies and government bureaus. As
almost everyone knows, problems are thereby created, and
seldom solved. An afterthought: Someone should address the
topic, "Poverty Problems Much Worse Elsewhere Than in the
U.S. -- Why?" There should be thoughtful discussion on what
we're doing right. That might lead to some useful
non-programs that would surely help the impoverished.

   CINCINNATI -- Kroger Co. said it reached a tentative
agreement on a new three-year labor contract for 8,500 clerks
and meat cutters in the company's King Soopers division in
Denver. Employees are voting on the contract.
   The supermarket chain said 6,000 retail clerks and meat
cutters in Dallas-Fort Worth completed ratification of a new
three-year contract last week.

   Pretax Profit Increased 4.2%

   Jefferson Smurfit Group PLC said pretax profit for the
fiscal year ended Jan. 31, edged up a meager 4.2% amid
difficult trading conditions in Latin America and a lack of
substantial price increases in its core businesses.
   Pretax profit at the Dublin, Ireland, paper and packaging
concern rose to 246 million punts ($398.3 million) from 236
million punts in the year-ago period, while sales increased
21% to 1.66 billion punts from 1.37 billion punts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A soft paper industry in the U.S. helped trim profit
growth for the company's biggest-earning region, said
Smurfit's secretary, Michael Pettigrew. In Latin America,
pretax profit dipped 1.8% to 58.6 million punts from 59.7
million punts a year ago. Pressures on certain Latin American
economies, particularly Venezuela's, curbed profit growth,
Mr. Pettigrew said.

   DALLAS -- Integra-A Hotel &amp; Restaurant Co. said it and
several other companies signed agreements that would raise
new capital and allow Hallwood Group Inc. and affiliates to
sell their 13% stake in Integra.
   Integra, which owns and operates hotels, said it expects
the agreements to lead to a shake-up of its board and to
substantial changes in the company's management. They would
also lead Hallwood, a New York merchant bank and Integra's
biggest shareholder, to substantially end its relationship
with the company, Integra said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Integra said Burrus Investment Group Inc., New Orleans,
agreed to make a $10 million, five-year secured loan with an
interest rate of four percentage points above the prime rate.
The agreement also calls for Integra to give Burrus six-year
warrants to buy as many as 1.8 million shares of Integra
common for 46.25 cents each.
   An affiliate of Burrus, meanwhile, agreed to purchase
578,763 Integra shares, or 6.5% of total common shares
outstanding, from Hallwood, according to Integra.
   Separately, Integra said a unit of Westbrooke Hospitality
Corp., a Dallas hotel operator, agreed to provide centralized
hotel operating services to most hotels currently operated by
Integra. Integra would receive an option to acquire the
subsidiary between 1993 and 1995.
   Also, 867 Jennings Investment Co., a private company owned
by a relative of a Westbrooke principal, agreed to purchase a
6.5% Integra stake from Hallwood, Integra said.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Integra closed at 46.87 cents a share, up 3.12 cents.

   Tokyo's Share Prices Slip a Bit on Profit-Taking
   As Nikkei's Five-Day, 1500-Point Rally Ends

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index finished slightly lower on
profit-taking, ending the five-day, 1500-point rally.
   In London, shares ended broadly lower after extremely
lackluster dealings, action that largely signaled a
consolidation following modest day-earlier gains.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 24.97 points to
30945.61. The index gained 14.31 points Tuesday.
   But the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in
the first section, which gained 7.11 points Tuesday,
sustained the rally and added 5.19 points, or 0.23%, to
2308.79. The Topix has posted consecutive gains since April
26, adding 108.69 points, or 4.9%, since that time.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 296.34 points to
close the morning session at 31241.95.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
700 million shares, off from 746 million shares Tuesday.
   Winning issues outnumbered losers 572 to 409, while 139
issues were unchanged. Traders said the tally reflects gains
on the broad-based Topix, noting that declines on the Nikkei
Index were likely on more expensive issues.
   The second section index surged 46.02 points, or 1.25%, to
3717.90. The gain marks the seventh consecutive advance for
the minor index. Volume was estimated at 18 million shares,
up from 14 million shares.
   Early morning bargain-hunting couldn't outpace
professional selling, which began midmorning and continued
throughout the day, and, after a softer morning close, prices
drifted in the afternoon, observers said.
   A vice president of equity research at a U.S. investment
bank compared the market's major movements with acts in a
theater play, with rumors and various corporate news fillers
being equivalent to small, short stories told to keep the
audience entertained between acts.
   In short, he said the market will look for rumors and
corporate news while it's between acts, as the market seeks
to recover from its retracement since the beginning of the
year. However, not being prepared to make a full-scale
rebound, the market is trending upward, helped by favorable
technical price patterns and improved fundamentals.
   The key for a stock rally remains in brokers' abilities to
attract institutional investors, said Christopher Leighton,
manager of international equity sales at Schroder Securities
(Japan) Ltd. He added that institutional and individual
investors have been reluctant to participate mainly because
they're unsure where to put their money for sustained
strength.
   Buying trends are indicating a shortterm marketplace,
observers said, with interest focused mostly on domestics.
"But domestic issues by no means provide a clear indication
of where to invest," Mr. Leighton said, as they can quite
easily and quickly reverse gains.
   In addition, observers noted that arbitrage activity may
be hindering a fullscale recovery.
   "Elements of arbitrage-related selling" were evident
yesterday, Mr. Leighton said, with arbitragers buying
stock-index futures and selling the cash indexes.
   Although the market was in a bullish mood, he noted the
disparity between arbitragers' ability to sway the indexes
and brokers' ability to convince customers to participate.
   Market talk yesterday included a story that Nippon Zeon
has developed the world's smallest pacemaker, according to
Kevin Haag, a dealer in overseas operations at Nomura
Securities Co. The stock ended at its stop-high.
   Industrial machinery stocks were helped by a story in a
leading Japanese economic daily regarding fiber cables
projects, while some pharmaceuticals and chemicals were
lifted on news that a Waseda University team has synthesized
red blood cells.
   Among industrial machinery stocks, Daikin Industries added
80 yen to Y1870 (51 cents to $11.86), Ebara rose 70 yen to
1880 yen and Kubota rose 70 yen to 1100 yen.
   Dainippon Pharmaceutical soared 270 yen to 2880 yen,
Mochida rose 130 yen to 3910 yen and Ono rose 150 yen to 6270
yen.
   Nippon Oil &amp; Fat rose 109 yen to 1100 yen.
   London's Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 share index
fell 19.3 points to 2162.7, a touch above the intraday low of
2160.6 and substantially lower than the day's high of 2179.7,
just after the start of official trading.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 14.5 points at
1695.6. Volume was a 425.8 million shares, modestly better
than 309.0 million a day earlier.
   The market's "just getting a touch tired," said a trader
with a large U.K. brokerage firm, particularly after posting
moderate gains since late last week.
   Wariness on the part of investors ahead of tomorrow's
scheduled disclosure of U.K. retail price index figures for
April helped pressure the market a bit, dealers said.
   Traders added that investors were also waiting to see what
effect the U.S. Treasury's $30.5 billion quarterly refunding
was having on Wall Street.
   A slew of corporate results had diverse effects on
individual share prices.
   Construction and property concern Trafalgar House fell 10
pence to 286 pence (17 cents to $4.78) after interim results
that showed a 2.7% pretax profit rise.
   Pharmaceutical concern SmithKline Beecham dropped 7 pence
to 472 pence after first-quarter pretax profit sagged 6.8% to
#219 million. The results, described by one trader as "pretty
grim," brought the rest of the sector lower.
   Glaxo shed 5 1/2 pence to 781 pence; Reckitt &amp; Colman lost
15 pence to #11.44; and Wellcome slid 7 pence to 643 pence.
   The banking sector was hit hard following a profit
downgrading of Barclays and Midland by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays. Barclays plunged 16
pence to 524 pence; Lloyds sank 10 pence to 265 pence;
Midland fell 5 pence to 290 pence; and National Westminster
lost 7 pence to 329 pence.
   Elsewhere, retailer Great Universal Stores dropped 23
pence to 944 pence in a correction to strong gains Tuesday;
Reuters lost 15 pence to #11.04 on profit-taking; and
industrial gases and health care concern BOC fell 13 pence to
507 pence ahead of half-year results today.
   Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Zurich and Stockholm;
lower in Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Milan; mixed in
Brussels. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Also, stocks closed lower in Hong Kong, Seoul and Taipei,
were mixed in Manila, higher in Wellington and little changed
in Sydney. Singapore was closed.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
the ratings on about $1.7 billion of debt of Pennzoil Co.
because of uncertainty surrounding the company's investment
in Chevron Corp.
   That $2.1 billion investment represents about 45% of
Pennzoil's total assets. Moody's said concern remains over
how long Houston-based Pennzoil will retain its holdings in
San Francisco-based Chevron or whether it will attempt to
increase its stake, at the risk of further burdening an
already leveraged capital structure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Additionally, Pennzoil is experiencing weak operating
performance and may soon be hit with a tax bill that could
total close to $800 million. The tax issue stems from the
settlement of litigation with Texaco Inc. Downgraded by
Moody's were Pennzoil's debentures, notes, Euronotes and
preliminarily rated shelf registration, to single A-3, from
single A-2. Its commercial paper also was downgraded to
Prime-2, from Prime-1.

   IRVINE, Calif. -- The ferocious news battle over affluent
Orange County took a new turn when Times Mirror Inc.'s Los
Angeles Times refused to run an advertisement for a new cable
service owned by Freedom Newspapers Inc., publisher of the
archrival Orange County Register.
   Alan J. Bell, president of closely held Freedom's
broadcasting division, called the action "petulant," and
after the Register ran a story on the imbroglio yesterday,
Mr. Bell began putting the word out.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Times spokeswoman said, "We turned it down because the
Register is a direct competitor and we didn't feel it was in
our best interest to run it."
   The two companies have fought it out in this populous
county south of Los Angeles for years, with the Register
currently claiming circulation of about 350,000 and the
Orange County edition of the Times about 200,000. Earlier
this year, the battle erupted on a new front when each
company announced a cable news venture: Freedom is launching
Orange County NewsChannel, a 24-hour local news service in
September; Times-Mirror, with partners, inaugurated a news
service providing 4 1/2-minute news summaries to Orange
County cable suscribers.
   Each service has signed up cable operators serving 200,000
households, or half the county's cable subscribers. One
wrinkle to this: Times-Mirror owns Dimension cable, a cable
company serving about 100,000 households. The Times's service
is carried on Dimension; Freedom's service is "in
discussions" with Dimension.
   Part of Mr. Bell's pitch for the cable service is his
contention that Orange County residents see themselves as
living in a separate city from Los Angeles, and don't like
being in the shadow of their neighbor to the north. The area
is served by TV stations based in Los Angeles. The ad in
question uses the phrase, "From now on, we're no longer
playing second fiddle to Los Angeles" -- a sentiment that
could, of course, apply to newspapers, too.
   The Times spokeswoman said the fact that the ad contained
a solicitation to readers to answer survey questions was the
"specific" problem with the ad, but wouldn't say whether the
ad would have run without the survey questions. Even though
Freedom Newspapers and the Register aren't mentioned in the
ad, she said, "they make it very clear the news channel is an
arm of the newpaper."
   Although newspapers legally may refuse advertising and
often do if they deem material offensive to their readers, it
is less common to refuse ads from competitors "as long as the
money's green," especially in today's poor economic climate
for newspapers, said analyst John Morton of Morton &amp; Co. in
Washington, D.C.
   "It's pretty small beer to turn down an ad from a
competitor," Mr. Morton said. "There's more overall harm,
from a public-relations standpoint, in not running it. Even
though they're doing better in Orange County recently, I
guess they're still sensitive about the Register."

   ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL OF TRINITY CHURCH, a house of worship
since 1766, is an oasis of calm amid the bustle of New York's
Wall Street area. Here, 64 volunteers, mostly white-collar
professionals from nearby brokerage firms and banking houses,
take turns working with 10 homeless men.
   Typical is Martyna Gerweck, a financial operations vice
president for R.C. Forbes &amp; Co., a securities firm. Two or
three times a month, she spends an evening at St. Paul's with
the church's "guests," offering conversation, a game of cards
and friendship. "The guys become my pals and they stay in
touch after they move on to their own housing," says Ms.
Gerweck.
   The Chapel -- where 10 cots, a bathroom, small kitchenette
and lounge are in a two-story area under the steeple, out of
view of the pews where George Washington once worshiped -- is
a microcosm of the many private, often small shelters set up
around the country since the early 1980s to accommodate the
homeless and unemployed, offering a way station for those
seeking permanent housing.
   Joseph Pickard, a 29-year-old Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
lawyer, has been volunteering about 15 hours a month at the
Chapel for the past year -- taking the meal shift, an
occasional overnighter or parts of the weekend. "Small as
this contributon may be," he says, "it was the only way I
could relieve the frustrations I started feeling when I saw
the homeless on my way to work."
   He learned about the shelter after responding to a subway
poster ad for the Partnership for the Homeless Inc., a
private, nonprofit group that operates sleep-in shelters in
153 New York City churches and synagogues. Despite the
informal relationship between the volunteers and the
homeless, the shelters run on tight rules: Curfews are
enforced, food cabinets and refrigerators are padlocked until
just before meal times and even the job leads that volunteers
occasionally provide the homeless must be reviewed by the
Partnership.
   Mr. Pickard, and most of the other volunteers at the
Chapel, aren't parishioners of St. Paul's; the site is simply
convenient to their Wall Street offices. They try in various
ways to help the men (it's a male-only shelter), often
bringing in pizzas or donating furniture.
   The aid takes many forms. Laurie Hammel, a Chase Manhattan
vice president and loan officer and a volunteer at the Chapel
for five years, helped some open savings accounts after they
landed jobs.
   Ms. Hammel has seen 25 of the men find their "way out" of
the shelter, where the average stay is nine months. There are
setbacks, though. Ms. Gerweck, the R.C. Forbes officer,
recalls one man who simply wandered away, only to be seen
weeks later living in a park. (Private shelters such as St.
Paul's screen out homeless people with a history of drug
abuse or mental problems, referring them to public
facilities.)
   Most of the homeless men at St. Paul's are glad to be
there. "I was in a city shelter for a month and couldn't
stand seeing guards with rubber gloves," says one of the
Chapel's homeless as he prepares that night's chicken creole
dinner.

   Phillips Petroleum
   To Contest Fines
   Levied by Agency

   Phillips Petroleum Co. said it is contesting all $5.7
million of fines levied by the Labor Department, which
accused the company of willful safety violations in
connection with explosions that killed 23 workers at a
chemical plant outside Houston.
   Phillips, of Bartlesville, Okla., had until today to
respond to the citations made by the department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration on April 19.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The explosion at the oil company's Pasadena, Texas,
petrochemical plant last October was one of the nation's
worst postwar industrial accidents. It followed an 18-month
rash of fires and other accidents at numerous petrochemical
plants and oil refineries and has sparked keen interest in
industrywide safety and operating procedures.
   But Phillips strongly disagreed with any assertions that
its operations were unsafe. "Based on our investigation, we
are convinced that this accident took place because of a
single, isolated departure from a clearly established
procedure," said C.J. Silas, Phillips's chairman. "It did not
result from a failure in safety management at the complex, as
stated in OSHA's report."
   The company said that it was most concerned by OSHA's
allegation that it "willfully endangered" the safety of plant
workers. "This simply was not and will never be the case,"
Mr. Silas said.
   Phillips also said it would challenge the legality of the
method OSHA used to arrive at one of the largest fines in the
agency's history. OSHA accused Phillips of 566 willful
violations, which is equal to the number of workers that were
on site during the explosion. It then, in effect, moved to
fine the company $10,000 for each of those workers.
   In recent years, OSHA came under criticism from safety
experts for what they considered innocuous fines, sometimes
just hundreds of dollars even when the death of a worker was
involved. But more recently it has taken a stronger stance,
and especially since Gerard Scannell took over last year as
head of the agency.
   According to Phillips's account of the accident, highly
flammable gases escaped from a polyethylene reactor and then
were ignited "as a result of violation of a procedure" during
routine maintenance. Phillips conducted an internal
investigation that said there were three safety steps, and
that if any one of them had been followed the accident
wouldn't have occurred.
   The first was the employment of a so-called lock-out
device, which if used would have prevented a crucial valve
from being opened, Phillips said. Another set of valves
controlling air hoses that, in turn, activate that other
crucial valve were supposed to be closed, the company said.
And the hoses are supposed to be disconnected, Phillips
maintained. Phillips said its investigation found that none
of these procedures was followed.
   Fish Engineering &amp; Construction Inc., a Houston-area
contractor that has worked at the Phillips plant for 17
years, said it notified OSHA last week that it was contesting
proposed penalties of $730,000. "We expect to overturn (the
penalties) on appeal," said an attorney representing Fish.
Four of the people killed in the explosion and 52 of the more
than 130 people injured worked for Fish.

   Film: AIDS Docudrama, Brooklyn Despair

   "Longtime Companion" has the tone and style of television
movies designed to enlighten the public without provoking or
alarming anyone. Such instructional dramas tend to handle
potentially controversial subjects in a conventional way so
as to defuse any possible objection to the subject matter.
   "Longtime Companion," a feature film about the effect of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome on a small group of
relatively affluent and educated New Yorkers, suffers
artistically from these constraints. Even so, the picture
contains much poignancy -- and yes, it is instructive on how
AIDS developed in 10 years from a curiosity to a central
focus of homosexual life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Playwright Craig Lucas, who wrote the screenplay, and
director Norman Rene, whose main work has been in theater,
have given this movie the structure and style of a stage
play. You could turn the picture off and not miss very much.
   However, they have ably done what they set out to do. They
have created a group of homosexual characters who are
familiar and likable and completely nonthreatening. These
aren't people living on the fringe in any apparent way.
   They are leading comfortable middle-class and better lives
as well-paid professionals who eat well, exercise and for the
most part settle into monogamous relationships. Only the most
rabid homosexual-haters could wish nice men like these any
harm.
   They would be nice to the point of absolute dullness, in
fact, if AIDS weren't introduced into the story to inject
horrible melodrama into their lives. The film's power comes
from its understated if somewhat antiseptic handling of that
melodrama, and from the way the various characters react to
being forced to consider their mortality much earlier than
they'd expected.
   The film makers have used a kind of docudrama approach,
starting each scene with a date to establish the progress of
AIDS into the characters' consciousness and, in some cases,
into their bodies. The movie opens in 1981, with many small
vignettes establishing just how ordinary these men are. There
are a businessman, a lawyer, an actor, a gym instructor, an
investor of his own inherited wealth, and a soap-opera
writer. We see them either in their comfortable apartments
and offices or at the lovely beach house one couple shares in
the Hamptons.
   These opening scenes are light and playful. There is a
funny shot mimicking the standard beach movie where a
gorgeous young, thin creature in a skimpy bathing suit causes
every head to turn -- only here the gawkers are men and so is
the object of their lust. There is exposition meant to plant
the idea that homosexuals have arrived in "respectable"
society. "There are gay restaurants now," says one character.
"Gay doctors, gay lawyers . . ."
   The first mention of AIDS reaches many people in many
locations simultaneously reading an article in 1981 in the
New York Times. But this news is dismissed, much the way
European Jews dismissed the early warnings about Nazi
atrocities.
   As the years pass, however, homosexuals have to stop
dismissing AIDS as something that's happpening to somebody
else. Sooner or later all the characters are forced to
confront the horror that may one day be theirs. This is one
situation where watching a friend fall ill and feeling
panicky yourself isn't a hypochondriac response. Like the
love scenes, the picture's main deathbed drama is shot
discreetly, but without shrinking from the awful premature
senility that often precedes death by AIDS.
   Aside from the title, which refers to the euphemistic way
obituary writers refer to the survivor of a homosexual
relationship, this film doesn't dabble much in irony.
However, it does make note of the fact that as the homosexual
community's health is being attacked, public acceptance of
homosexuals increased: A homosexual character was introduced
on a daytime soap opera.
   The film makers have taken the edge off their material by
refusing to delve into the political as well as the
psychological ramifications of the disease. But despite the
limitations imposed by the bad-things-happen-to-good-people
approach, the sadness is very real.

   When Hubert Selby Jr. published "Last Exit to Brooklyn" 25
years ago, the book's violence and bleakness were shockers.
An English court declared its stark and graphic vision of the
urban underbelly to be obscene.
   Now the book's loosely connected stories about life on the
waterfront have been made into a movie that seems strangely
anachronistic. Though much of the film was shot in the
scabrous Red Hook section of Brooklyn, the German director
Uli Edel has created a work that feels like a relic of German
expressionism. Even the Brooklyn Bridge looks foreign.
   Still, there's some powerful stuff in this dark and darkly
photographed vision of working-class life, especially
Jennifer Jason Leigh's frighteningly astute portrayal of the
self-destructive prostitute Tralala.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Life in Brooklyn isn't always grim, and many
Brooklyn boys have made good in the movies. Look what
happened to John Travolta in "Saturday Night Fever."

   APOLOGIES: To singer Sister Carol, for mistakenly calling
her Sister Mary in the course of praising her rendition of

   The French gross national product grew 4.1% on a market
basis and 3.7% overall in 1989. The former figure only takes
into account market activity, thereby excluding certain
government transactions.

   French government forecasters in the Economics Ministry
said last month that GNP in 1990 would rise 3.2%.
   Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to ease to an annual
rate of 3.1% by June, down from 3.4% in March, helped by
lower petroleum and food prices, as well as the stronger
franc, which lowered the cash cost of imports in the short
term.

   Over-the-counter stocks ended their seven-day streak of
advances with a slight loss as investors kept a cautious eye
on the unfolding quarterly Treasury refunding.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.12%, slipping 0.50 to
431.34. Declining shares overtook advancing stocks, 1,013 to
898, as 99 issues dropped to new lows while 90 reached new
highs. Volume picked up to 146.6 million shares from 133.8
million.

   Peter Da Puzzo, co-head of world-wide equity operations
for Shearson Lehman Hutton, said that he was encouraged by
the market's late afternoon recovery as it became apparent
the auction of 10-year Treasury notes was successful. The
composite index hit an intraday low of 430.82 before firming
slightly.
   Mr. Da Puzzo suggests that today will be quiet, as
investors pull back and wait for the auction of 30-year
Treasury bonds and tomorrow's figures on retail sales and the
producer price index. "The 30-year auction will be key to
what happens in the equity market," he noted. He remains
bullish about both secondary and blue-chip stocks, predicting
the Dow Jones Industrial Average will hit a record high this
summer.
   The technology sector remained in vogue, with Sun
Microsystems in the forefront. Sun rose 2 1/2 to 28 3/8 on
5.3 million shares after this newspaper reported the Mountain
View, Calif., concern is expected to unveil a new low-cost
computer workstation next week.
   Among other technology shares, Intel rose 1/4 to 43 1/4,
Oracle Systems climbed 1/4 to 18 1/8 and Seagate Technology
was unchanged at 12 1/4. The Nasdaq 100 Index of industrial
stocks, including many large technology issues, rose 0.52, or
0.12%, to 430.86.
   Investors embraced an initial public offering of 1.87
million shares of RasterOps, a Santa Clara, Calif., designer
and maker of color imaging products. Offered at $12 a share,
the stock remained unchanged at 14 7/8, with more than two
million shares changing hands.
   National Media was among the day's most-active issues,
rising 1/2 to 9 3/4 on 1.3 million shares. Stephen Axelrod,
analyst at Denver-based Stuart James, raised his earnings
estimates for the Philadelphia provider of direct-marketing
services. According to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report, Mr. Axelrod cited the company's success with a new
television marketing format in his estimate that National
Media will report earnings of $1 a share for the year ended
March 31 and his projection of $1.50 to $2.50 a share in
fiscal 1991.
   Shares of McCaw Cellular Communications, which acquired
52% of LIN Broadcasting, closed off 1/4 at 23 1/2 on more
than four times average volume. Tuesday, LIN Broadcasting,
agreed to acquire Metromedia Inc.'s cellular operations in
New York for $1.9 billion in cash and preferred stock. The
transaction will add more than $1 billion in debt to LIN's
balance sheet. LIN also reported a $180.8 million
first-quarter loss after taking a charge of nearly $300
million for executive severance payments and other costs.
   News of mergers or potential buy-outs fueled gains in
stocks of three northeastern concerns: FNB Rochester rose 2
1/4 to 13 1/2; Lexington Savings climbed 1 1/4 to 8, and
Aritech gained 3/4 to 11 3/4.
   FNB Rochester, a Rochester, N.Y., holding company for the
First National Bank of Rochester and Atlanta (N.Y.) National
Bank, said that a diversified Turkish concern, Cukurova
Holding AS Group, agreed to buy 75% of its outstanding common
stock at $20 a share. The company announced May 1 that it had
received an unsolicited offer.
   Waltham Savings Bank, Waltham, Mass., announced it that
will acquire Lexington Savings, Lexington, Mass., for $10.75
a share. The combined banks are expected to have total assets
of $700 million. Lexington Savings also reported a loss for
the first quarter ended March 31 of six cents a share, after
a $975,000 provision for loan losses, compared with net
income of 17 cents a share a year earlier.
   Aritech gained 3/4 to 11 3/4 after the Framingham, Mass.,
maker of burglar alarm systems said late Tuesday that a
special committee of outside directors will review the
possible sale of the company to management or a third party.
On May 3, Aritech announced it hired an investment adviser to
explore ways to improve shareholders' value.
   Kustom Electronics advanced 5/8 to 4 7/8 after the
Overland, Kan., maker of traffic safety radar systems and
other communications equipment said that Triax International
agreed to buy its traffic safety unit for $4.3 million in
cash and a $700,000 promissory note to be paid over three
years.
   Shares of Millicom, a New York maker of cellular mobile
communications systems, advanced 1 1/4 to 19 1/2. The Federal
Communications Commission issued Millicom's PCN America unit
experimental licenses to build and operate its Personal
Communications Networks in Houston and Orlando, Fla.
   Mesa Airlines rose 7/8 to 8 3/8 after the Farmington,
N.M., commuter airline reported net income for the second
quarter ended March 31 of 28 cents a share, up from 10 cents
a year earlier.
   Comair Holdings, which rose 1 1/4 Tuesday, closed off 1/4
at 17 3/8 after the Cincinnati airline reported that April
traffic rose 40.8% since April 1989.
   Among the day's losers was Quiksilver, which slipped 7/8
to 26 5/8 after this newspaper's Inside Track column reported
that the Costa Mesa, Calif., concern was one of three apparel
companies whose executives and directors sold more than
100,000 shares in the first quarter. The Quiksilver insiders
sold a total of 130,000 shares at prices ranging from $23.53
to $25.38 a share. The company declined comment.
   Kulicke &amp; Soffa Industries fell 1/4 to 9 1/4 after the
Willow Grove, Pa., maker of semiconductor assembly systems
reported Tuesday a loss for the second quarter which ended
March 31 of 39 cents a share, compared with net income of 11
cents a share a year earlier. The most recent quarter
included a $3.9 million increase in reserves for inventories,
a $900,000 charge for organizational changes and legal fees
and an extraordinary gain of $129,000.

   Omnicom Unit Calls Policy
   Of Rebate, Bonus Novel,
   Says 2 Firms Interested

   NEW YORK -- DDB Needham Worldwide Inc. announced a new
compensation plan in which it promises to "guarantee" its
clients' results -- but industry executives expressed
skepticism.
   DDB Needham, a unit of Omnicom Group, heralded its new
plan, which it calls "Total Creativity. Guaranteed Results,"
as a groundbreaking step in agency compensation. Clients will
be given a rebate of as much as 30% off a negotiated base
rate if they agree to a long list of conditions and if
specific, agreed-upon results aren't reached. If goals are
met, the client would pay DDB Needham a bonus.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But ad-agency executives, while lauding DDB Needham's
attempts to be more accountable to its clients, said they had
no plans to follow suit. They noted that agencies have been
negotiating compensation plans with clients for years. The
once-standard 15% commission has given way to negotiated
incentive and bonus systems.
   "I'm very skeptical," said Marvin Sloves, chairman of ad
agency Scali, McCabe, Sloves. "Is this a thoughtful,
intelligent way of being recompensed, or a publicity
gimmick?"
   DDB Needham insists that its plan is different from other
incentive plans. For one thing, DDB Needham is the first
agency to announce a compensation package as policy. For
another, the plan relies on DDB Needham and the client
identifying specific goals, such as specific sales increases.
   Industry executives also wondered how DDB Needham can
guarantee results, when so many factors besides advertising
come into play in a product's sales. "Anytime you get paid
through an incentive, it's a great idea," said Mr. Sloves.
"But I just don't understand how to implement" such a system
intelligently.
   DDB Needham's clients will be trying to sort that out now.
Keith Reinhard, the agency's chairman, said that two, which
he declined to identify, are interested in trying it. And
Peter Falcone, president of DDB Needham's New York office,
said H.J. Heinz Co.'s Weight Watchers is interested. But Mr.
Reinhard refused to speculate on how many of DDB Needham's 55
U.S. and Canadian clients, all of whom are being offered the
plan, would ultimately take the agency up on its idea. DDB
Needham insiders quietly speculated that the figure would be
relatively low as clients take a wait-and-see attitude.
   Clients may be put off, moreover, by the onerous
conditions DDB Needham demands. Among other things, DDB
Needham insists that it be given total, unquestioned control
over a client's entire marketing program -- including work by
outside public-relations, direct-mail and other unrelated
marketing firms. "Insane," scoffed Arthur A. Anderson, an
advertising consultant at Morgan, Anderson &amp; Co., New York.
"This may be a classic marketing ploy for the ad agency to
reassert control over these other budgets."

   Niagara Exchange Corp. said Riedman Corp. is seeking to

Berkley Corp. for about $8.2 million, or to permanently
enjoin the voting rights of that preferred stock.
   Riedman, a Rochester, N.Y., insurance agency that
currently owns about 14% of Niagara's 1.8 million common
shares outstanding, launched a proxy vote to seek two of the
company's seven board seats. W.R. Berkley's 970,000 shares of
Niagara's convertible preferred represent a 35% stake.
Niagara, Buffalo, N.Y., and W.R. Berkley, Greenwich, Conn.,
are property-casualty insurance holding companies.

   Riedman, in a lawsuit filed in Delaware Court of Chancery,
is claiming that Niagara's sale of the preferred stock, which
is still subject to regulatory approval, has blocked its
proxy fight.
   Niagara said the allegations in the complaint are without
merit.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- FNB Rochester Corp. said Cukurova
Holding AS Group, a diversified Turkish concern, agreed to
buy 75% of FNB's common stock outstanding at $20 a share, for
a total of $29 million.
   FNB is the holding company for First National Bank of
Rochester and the small Atlanta (N.Y.) National Bank. FNB has
assets of nearly $300 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, FNB's
stock closed at $13.50, up $2.25 a share. The stock had been
trading between $7 and $7.50 a share until FNB announced May
1 that it had received an unsolicited inquiry about a
purchase of the bank's stock. The book value is $8.60 a
share.
   The agreement calls for redemption of FNB's $7.25 million
of 10% convertible capital notes at 110% of the principal
amount, and provides for an infusion of $10 million in new
capital.
   Cukurova has interests in banking, insurance, steel,
cement, construction and international trade, FNB said. The
Turkish company is seeking a New York bank to handle
international transactions, partly because of plans for a
unified European market after 1992, said Wilbur F. Beh, FNB
president. He said a business broker employed by Cukurova
happened to know one of FNB's directors.
   First National Bank of Rochester, which has offices in
Rochester, Syracuse and Elmira, may open an office in New
York City following completion of the transaction, Mr. Beh
said. He said other European concerns also may seek banking
outlets in the U.S. in preparation for the 1992 changes,
which probably will increase trade between Europe and the
U.S. as well as among European countries.
   The agreement is subject to negotiation of a definitive
agreement within 30 days and to approval by FNB shareholders
and bank regulators, the company said. Cukurova would
purchase the 75% interest through a tender offer, Mr. Beh
said.
   Under the preliminary agreement, present management and
directors would continue, FNB said. The additional capital
would allow the banking concern to continue its growth, Mr.
Beh said. He said the bank hasn't had nonperforming loan
problems comparable to some other banks, partly because it
hasn't reached outside its service area for business.

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Official unemployment in East
Germany surged in April to 64,948 job seekers from 38,313
people the previous month, the East German state news agency
reported.
   Citing statistics from East Germany's Ministry for Labor
and Social Affairs, the agency said the number of job
vacancies in the country receded substantially to 73,558
places by the end of the month. It didn't provide
month-earlier data.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   East Germany only recently began releasing unemployment
data and its current data are considered to be incomplete. As
unproductive state-owned companies are taken public as part
of East Germany's economic integration with West Germany,
many existing jobs are expected to be lost, swelling
unemployment rolls.

   National Realty Says
   It Resolved Lawsuit
   Filed by Unitholders

   DALLAS -- National Realty L.P. said it settled a
class-action lawsuit brought by unitholders who claimed they
were bilked when the real estate master limited partnership
was formed in 1987 out of 35 pre-existing limited
partnerships.
   National Realty was created by a controversial rollup of
partnerships operated by troubled Southmark Corp., some of
which were devastated by the real estate bust in the
Southwest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While National Realty didn't admit any liability in making
the settlement, terms of the agreement call for the company
to issue to plaintiffs five-year warrants to purchase 2.75
million partnership units at $11 a unit for the first year
and $12 thereafter. Also, certain co-defendants agreed to
contribute to the partnership cash and notes totaling $5.5
million.
   National Realty's general partners agreed to contribute
$2.5 million over four years, with the remainder coming from
the former E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. (now Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.), the broker-dealer in the rollup, and Robert A. McNeil,
the former general partner of the partnerships involved in
the litigation.
   A spokeswoman for National Realty said that other
defendants, primarily Southmark-related entities, haven't
reached a settlement with plaintiffs yet.
   The settlement also raises the possibility that National
Realty's general partners could be removed if the value of
the partnership's units doesn't reach agreed-upon targets for
the next five years. After one year, the agreement
stipulates, National Realty units must be worth at least $11;
at the end of five years, the target is $30. Achievement of
the targets can be made both by increases in the share price
of units and by distributions to limited partners.
   In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange,
National Realty closed yesterday at $4.875, up 25 cents.
   If the target in any year isn't met, an oversight
committee formed by limited partners can require National
Realty to sell a percentage of its assets.
   The settlement still must be ratified by a state court in
San Mateo, Calif.

   The `Ripe' Time to Negotiate
   ----
   By Fareed Zakaria
</HL>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20

<LP>
   Modesty in foreign policy was once greatly prized. The
French statesman Talleyrand's legendary advice to young
diplomats was, "Above all, not too much zeal." In his classic
primer, "Diplomacy," Sir Harold Nicolson cautions the ideal
diplomat against "vanity {because it prefers} a brilliant but
undesirable triumph to some unostentatious but more prudent
compromise."
   Richard Haass fears that this lesson has been forgotten
particularly by American diplomats who live in a
"getting-to-yes" culture that believes every problem has a
solution. In his short study, "Conflicts Unending: The United
States and Regional Disputes" (Yale University Press, 172
pages, $22.50), he argues that many international conflicts
can only be managed, not eliminated, and that imaginative
diplomacy can be futile, even dangerous. "Iatrogenic, or
treatment induced, illness has analogies outside the world of
medicine."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This advice sounds suspiciously like a rationalization for
George Bush's foreign policy. Not suprisingly, Mr. Haass, who
taught at Harvard until 1989, is now the president's top aide
on the Middle East and South Asia. In this book, he proposes
adding the notion of "ripeness" to the language of diplomacy.
Ripeness is "the existence of the prerequisites for
diplomatic progress." If the U.S. pushes for far-reaching
"solutions" in the absence of these prerequisites, not only
is failure likely, but the U.S. will dash raised
expectations, lose credibility and generally heighten
tensions.
   For example, he believes that Alexander Haig's frantic
shuttle diplomacy at the start of the Falkland Islands crisis
may have backfired by convincing the Argentine generals that
America's equivocations would dissuade Britain from going to
war. When that didn't happen, the generals felt betrayed by
Mr. Haig. The British, meanwhile, were annoyed by Mr. Haig's
waffling. The author suggests that if the U.S. had backed
Britain firmly from the start of the crisis, the Argentines
might have been deterred from war.
   If a situation is ripe, on the other hand, negotiations
can help. Mr. Haass argues that the Camp David peace accords
between Israel and Egypt resulted at least as much from a
ripe situation as from brilliant (American) negotiations.
Egypt had gained enough prestige from the Yom Kippur War to
allow it to negotiate from strength, and Menachem Begin was
the only Israeli leader who could give back the Sinai without
being accused of weakening the country. Similarly, the
accords on Rhodesia, the Beagle Channel dispute, and the
Iran-Iraq War were all possible only because of their
background circumstances.
   What exactly is ripeness? First, writes Mr. Haass, the two
opposing parties must want an agreement. Second both parties
must be able to carry through (with domestic support) on
their promises. Third, there must be a face-saving rationale
for both parties to claim that they made a good deal. And
last, there must be a negotiating process that both parties
accept.
   This definition, however, veers toward tautology.
Ripeness, as presented by Mr. Haass, allows negotiations to
prosper. But ripeness is also defined as the situation when
both parties want to negotiate, are able to negotiate, and
agree on how to negotiate. Surely it is hardly surprising
that negotiations prosper in these conditions]
   The trick, then, is to know when ripeness exists, not in
hindsight but at the moment. Mr. Haass's discussion of South
Africa illustrates this problem. He makes a perfectly
plausible case that the country is "far from ripe {because
white South Africans} have yet to conclude that the costs of
sustaining apartheid are unbearable." But if President F.W.
de Klerk's reforms, proposed after this book was published,
are implemented, we would have to say, in retrospect, that
suddenly in 1990, white South Africans concluded that
apartheid was unbearable, thus ripening the situation.
   Mr. Haass spends most of the book expertly summarizing
five regional disputes in the Middle East; Cyprus; India and
Pakistan; South Africa; and Northern Ireland. In each case,
he argues that the conditions for ripeness are far from
present and that the U.S. shouldn't put forward peace plans
because they won't work. Instead, he suggests that Washington
strive for such modest but attainable goals as maintaining
credibility with the major parties in the dispute and
preventing accidents and miscalculations. According to his
scenario, an elaborate peace plan for the Middle East would
only backfire, making war even more likely. Mr. Haass fails
to identify situations that are ripe or to suggest any
imaginative alternative.
   It is ironic that a book preaching against overambition
should have a needlessly complicated theoretical
architecture. "Ripeness" is simply a fancy way of saying,
"the time must be right for negotiations." How does one tell
when the time is right? Well, that's what diplomats are for.
They study a situation and make a judgment. No magic formula
can replace political analysis. In fact, Mr. Haass is very
good at this kind of analysis. What he does do in this
alternately irritating and interesting book is to describe
the conflicts with admirable level-headedness and
refreshingly clear prose. And one cannot argue with his
central message -- that American diplomats should spend less
time thinking up clever compromise formulas and more time
moving the opposing parties toward general agreement.
Otherwise, Winston Churchill to the contrary, "jaw-jaw" can
lead to "war-war."

   South Koreans Threaten Jet Fighter Deal With U.S.;
   Demand Is Made for Sensitive Aviation Technology

   SEOUL, South Korea -- A $3 billion jet fighter
co-production deal between the U.S. and South Korea is in
jeopardy because Seoul is demanding that the U.S. hand over
sensitive aviation technology.
   The Korean government sent a letter this week to the
Pentagon saying final negotiations for the Korea Fighter
Project had hit a snag because of what it called U.S. refusal
to compromise on the technology transfer issue.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Washington, Pentagon officials said both governments
have invested too much effort and political capital in the
project to pull out at the last minute. One official familiar
with the project suggested that the South Korean letter may
be designed to win last-minute concessions from the U.S. He
said South Korea would face the same restrictions that apply
to the McDonnell Douglas plane if it opted for any other
U.S.-made aircraft.
   The Koreans are threatening to delay or even scuttle the
deal to buy 12 McDonnell Douglas Corp. F/A-18 jet fighters
made in the U.S., assemble 36 more from U.S.made kits and
co-produce 72 more jets in Korea under the direction of the
St. Louis company. Seoul chose the McDonnell Douglas jet over
General Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 last December.
   People in the U.S. military say the dispute over
technology transfer surprised them, because negotiations were
almost completed and documents were expected to be signed at
the end of this month. "We had a draft document that everyone
had high confidence in," one person said.
   But the U.S. doesn't want to give in to Korea's
last-minute demands. "It is our understanding that we have a
framework for a memorandum of understanding. The U.S. will
stand by what is in the original agreement," a Pentagon
spokesman said. "There are obstacles, but they aren't
obstacles to scuttle the agreement."
   An accord hashed out over months of negotiations in 1988
and 1989 allowed Korean companies to license U.S. technology
so they could learn how to build planes themselves and yet
not infuriate a Congress grown wary of creating competitors
for U.S. business. Such coproduction arrangements are
commonplace with other countries.
   But Korea now wants technology that the U.S. has kept on a
restricted list. Korea's wish-list includes the jets' radar
warning device, the radar itself, composite materials
technology, the high-heat-tolerant parts of the engines that
require special metallurgical skills and the top-secret
software for the on-board computer. "The U.S. has taken the
position that certain things shouldn't be transferred," a
military official in Seoul said.
   The new demands could delay the project for at least a
year if they aren't resolved before June 5, when the pact is
supposed to start wending its way through Congress on a
special track to ease passage. And because the U.S. is taking
a hard-line position on the technology issue, the Koreans are
said to have threatened to scuttle the whole deal and begin
the process of picking a new fighter. The selection of the
F/A-18 took almost two years.
   The KFP project was expected to get through Congress with
little difficulty. But the new demands put that in jeopardy,
say officials in Washington, because it would give new
ammunition to the tiny, but vocal, forces in Congress that
oppose the coproduction deal. "It is off the screen right
now. But all it needs is another incident for the issue to
come back stronger than ever," said Clyde Prestowitz, a trade
expert and a critic of the fighter project because of the
technology involved. Adds a Pentagon spokesman, "Technology
transfer is certainly a sensitive issue in the administration
and in Congress."
   Similar technologies were at the center of a controversy
last year over the Japanese FSX project, the codevelopment of
a new-generation fighter. The FSX sparked strong opposition
in Congress and the Commerce Department, though it was
approved.
   Officials of the Korean Ministry of Defense refused
comment, saying everyone involved in the matter was out of
the country, including Maj. Gen. Lee Woo Shik, who signed the
letter to the Pentagon. Kim Chong Whi, the president's
adviser for national security, who is said to be behind the
plan, refused comment and referred the issue to another
general, who also happened to be out of the country.
High-ranking Korean military officials are scheduled to be in
Washington next week for regular consultations, and U.S.
military officials said this issue was sure to come up.
   Government officials also wouldn't comment on whether the
change in position is the result of a conflict between Mr.
Kim, the presidential adviser and a hard-liner in the ruling
Democratic Liberal Party, and Minister of National Defense
Lee Sang Hun over control of defense policy.
   The fighter-plane controversy probably poses little threat
to McDonnell Douglas. The company declined to comment on what
a delay might mean. A spokesman said only, "We hope that the
two sides will be able to resolve any remaining
technology-transfer issues soon." Americans say there is
little chance that the Koreans would carry out their threat
to scuttle the deal.
   Opposition to the pact has been strong in Korea even after
the two governments came to terms last summer. Nationalists
inside the government said the U.S. forced Korea to give up
too much, particularly because the deal calls for it to buy
off-the-shelf and because the U.S. need only buy back 30% of
the contract's total value in Korean goods under a system
known as "offset." It is common in military-equipment sales
for the offset to be closer to 100%.
   The issue hasn't died down as it did in the U.S. Only a
few weeks ago the Dong-Ah Ilbo, an influential Seoul
newspaper, said, "Korea is placed at a disadvantage with the
terms of the contract when compared to other countries who
purchase expensive arms."
   Said a U.S. military official, "It is an arrangement that
is just as good as anyone gets. They are getting nothing less
than the Spanish or the Australians {two other countries that
have licensed coproduction deals with the U.S.}."
   Korea's aerospace industry is undeveloped, and government
officials made no secret that the fighter deal was designed
to help it develop a commercial aircraft industry. The key
reason McDonnell Douglas won the contract was that the
government thought the company had a better plan to develop
the Korean industry.

   Investor Norman Elowitz said he may make a new offer to
acquire Ultimate Corp., an East Hanover, N.J.,
computer-products concern.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Elowitz, chairman of Honey Fashions Ltd., also said he
raised his stake in Ultimate to 7.2%, or 686,500 shares, from
6.2%. Mr. Elowitz said he increased his stake to strengthen
his position at the company.

   In March, Ultimate rejected Mr. Elowitz's $10-a-share
offer, valued at $95 million. It said it doubted Mr.
Elowitz's ability to finance a takeover.
   Michael O'Donnell, Ultimate's chairman, said: "Nothing has
changed from the company's perspective. But I think the board
must fulfill its fiduciary responsibility, and if that means
looking at a new offer, it will."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ultimate closed at $6 a share, down 12.5 cents.

   U.S. Implicates
   Others at Trial

   CHICAGO -- A federal prosecutor implicated four unindicted
Swiss franc futures traders -- in addition to the three
indicted traders on trial here -- as allegedly taking part in
an illegal scheme to defraud customers.
   The allegations against the four traders in the Swiss
franc pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are a sign the
federal futures trading probe will focus on alleged
wrongdoing by more than the 48 individuals who have so far
been indicted on fraud charges at the Merc and the Chicago
Board of Trade. The allegations came during the government's
opening argument in the first of three scheduled trials of
futures traders and a clerk charged last year with stealing
from customers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Exchange officials have pointed to the limited number of
indictments as evidence that wrongdoing in their markets is a
relatively rare event. But the government's opening salvo in
the Swiss franc case indicates that many more exchange
members may have the propriety of their trades questioned by
prosecutors.
   Sixteen Japanese yen futures traders on the Merc and 12
soybean futures traders and a clerk on the Board of Trade
will stand trial in September on fraud charges in two
separate trials. In documents previously filed relating to
the soybean futures case, the government alleged that its
undercover agent in that pit made illegal trades with "scores
of unindicted co-conspirators."
   The government said the Swiss franc traders on trial,
Robert Mosky, Danny Scheck and David Zatz, were aided in
their alleged scheme to steal from customers by four other
traders: Gary Kost, Michael Joyce, Michael Ansani and Scott
Schumer.
   Prosecutors gave no indication as to whether they had
enough evidence to seek grand jury indictments against the
four traders.
   Mr. Kost is an employee of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and
is a broker in the Swiss franc pit buying and selling futures
contacts for his employer and its customers. Mr. Joyce is an
unaffiliated broker who handles a significant number of
Shearson orders. A Shearson official said he was unaware of
the government allegations and couldn't comment.
   Mr. Kost couldn't be reached for comment. A woman
answering the phone at Mr. Joyce's home referred a call to
his lawyer, Terry Grimm, who couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Ansani, one of the most active independent traders in
the Swiss franc futures pit, couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Schumer also trades for his own account, and declined to
comment on the government allegations.

   Storming the Barricades With a Proxy
   ---
   Takeover Defenses
   Prove to Be Flimsy

   NEW YORK -- Takeover investing isn't dead, despite all the
new state anti-takeover laws and corporate takeover defenses
that were supposed to frustrate raiders.
   Raiders and hostile bidders are storming the barricades
via proxy fights to oust their targets' directors or force
other major changes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In four high-profile takeover battles this year -- for
Norton Co., Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., American General
Corp. and United Airlines parent UAL Corp. -- the target
companies agreed to be acquired or auctioned following proxy
challenges by bidders.
   But as investors from Harold Simmons to Carl Icahn have
learned, a proxy fight alone isn't enough to gain decisive
shareholder support. Both men lost proxy challenges partly
because they weren't making an offer for the target company.
   The battering ram that is working is the one-two
combination of a takeover bid coupled with a proxy fight.
"The whole trend of bid-and-proxy fight is clearly on the
rise," says Robert Cotter, co-head of mergers and
acquisitions at First Boston Corp., which has represented
contestants in six big proxy fights this year.
   Takeover activity is down 50% or more this year, leading
some traders to fear that one of the important props for the
entire stock market is being undermined. The prime culprit is
a dearth of available bank and junk-bond financing for
raiders and leveraged buy-out firms. On top of that, a
growing number of states are legislating tougher limits on
hostile takeovers.
   The reason proxy fights work against state laws and
corporate defenses is that most such measures are crafted to
stop hostile bids, meaning those opposed by the targets'
directors. If the directors get replaced by a shareholder
vote, the opposition ends.
   A proxy fight can even break through one anti-takeover
measure specifically designed to block it, the staggered
board, in which only one-third of the directors faces
re-election annually. It turns out that even a 33% minority
of directors, with backing from a shareholder majority, can
usually maneuver to gain control.
   John Wilcox, managing director of Georgeson &amp; Co., a proxy
solicitor, says that proxy fights are tapping a wellspring of
support from big institutional investors that dominate the
ownership of most large corporations. Those institutions have
come to depend on a steady diet of takeover bids to boost
stock market performance.
   Without corporate raiders financed by high-risk,
high-yield junk bonds, First Boston's Mr. Cotter points out,
"many chief executive officers have been breathing a sigh of
relief. And that has made institutional investors incredibly
nervous" about the lack of market discipline on floundering
companies.
   "Institutions are going to be a major force for change
down the line," says John Gavin, president of D.F. King &amp;
Co., another proxy solicitor.
   A proxy battle can trigger a sale even when the challenger
loses. American General, a Houston insurer, put itself up for
sale this past week despite having defeated Torchmark Corp.'s
attempt to oust the board. That puzzled some investors. One
explanation that wasn't disclosed at the time: a non-binding
proposal that American General be put up for sale received
roughly 50% of the shareholder votes.
   If a company's performance has been weak enough,
challengers can win proxy contests even without a bid. A
group led by Robert Gintel won such a contest against Xtra
Corp. on March 15. And two weeks later, Avon Products Inc.
gave another group of dissidents two board seats to avoid a
probable proxy-vote loss.
   But two well-known hostile bidders, Mr. Icahn and Mr.
Simmons, lost proxy fights when they failed to make bids.
Takeover experts say both Mr. Icahn and Mr. Simmons were also
handicapped by their past reputations as corporate raiders
who might not always act in the interests of other holders.
   Mr. Simmons, for example, won praise for his witty ads
mocking Lockheed management's record. However, he gained only
37% of the vote in his proxy fight, even though he controlled
19% of Lockheed's stock. By contrast, proxy measures to
weaken Lockheed's takeover defenses attracted far more
support, from 54% to 61% of all votes cast. Mr. Simmons was
also hindered by a Lockheed employee stock-ownership plan
that owns 19% of the aerospace company.
   Mr. Icahn limited his challenge against USX Corp. to a
non-binding referendum on whether the company should spin off
80% of its steel business, forgoing a bareknuckle attempt to
replace management. Both sides promised to avoid personal
attacks, saving Mr. Icahn from being tarred for his record as
a corporate raider and his past ties to the now-defunct
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Indeed, it isn't clear yet whether the proxy fight can
become an effective substitute for corporate raiders' tactics
during the heyday of junk bonds -- accumulating stock in a
target and making a low bid in hopes of either buying the
company cheaply or selling out at a profit to a higher
bidder.
   While the Belzberg family and Centaur Partners, both
investors with uneven track records as hostile bidders, are
making headway in current proxy fights, their efforts haven't
yet resulted in huge gains for their stock positions.
   Meanwhile, Ken Miller, president of the Lodestar Group, a
small mergers and acquisitions firm, says the
bid-and-proxy-fight strategy could result in a bunching-up of
takeover activity in the months just before the annual
meeting season each spring.
   Most companies hold annual meetings -- when shareholders
cast proxy votes to elect directors -- from March to June.
"I've sort of been wondering whether there's going to be a
falloff in bids after the proxy season is over," says Mr.
Miller. If so, takeover activity could slow even further in
months to come.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South African new-vehicle
sales dropped 20% to 23,096 units in April from 28,951 units
a year earlier, the National Association of Automobile
Manufacturers (Naamsa) said yesterday.
   April's sales were 24% lower than the 30,576 units sold in
March, the association said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Naamsa's director, Nico Vermeulen, said the decline in
sales in April were larger than expected. He attributed it to
a combination of unfavorable factors including uncertainty
over political changes in the country, work stoppages at
various assembly plants during the month and the impact of
stringent monetary measures.

   Legg Mason Joins
   Regional Brokers
   With Record Profit

   NEW YORK -- Here are two words not often heard on Wall
Street these days: record earnings.
   But several smaller regional securities firms -- including
Legg Mason Inc., A.G. Edwards Inc. and Raymond James
Financial Inc. -- posted record revenue and earnings for past
12 months. Regionals typically are based far from New York
and focus more on clients around the corner than around the
globe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday, Legg Mason reported a 75% jump in net income
for its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, and a 97% rise
for the fiscal year, capping relatively robust returns for
the nation's regional securities firms -- and a far cry from
the woes engulfing many big national brokerage firms.
   The regionals "continue to add to their sales forces and
bring in more customers," says Perrin Long, senior securities
analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. "At most
regional firms, revenues are rising more rapidly than
expenses."
   Legg Mason's results underscore the good news at many
small regional concerns. Their brokerage business serving
individual investors and their investment advisory business,
particularly mutual funds, are prospering, compared with a
lackluster year-earlier period. The improvement in Legg
Mason's retail, or individual-investor, segment reflected a
"modest increase" in the number of the firm's brokers and a
jump in average revenue per broker. And revenue from Legg
Mason's investment advisory business, primarily mutual funds,
rose 22% from a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter net at the Baltimore-based securities firm
was $1.7 million, or 20 cents a share, up from $951,000, or
11 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10% to $58.7
million from $53.2 million.
   Not all regional securities firms have prospered recently.
Net in the most recent quarter fell 19% at Piper Jaffray
Inc., for example. And some big securities firms,
particularly Morgan Stanley Group Inc., are thriving even
amid the current Wall Street recession.
   But it generally has been tougher going for most
full-service national brokerage firms, many of whom have been
sharply cutting back staff. The big securities firms have
been hit hard by a slowdown in investment banking
revenue-down more than 20% at many big firms. And the
investment-banking slump was offset at some firms only by fat
trading gains, which can't be counted on to continue.
   Regional firms, however, are much more dependent on the
activity of individual investors; indeed, their performance
is often viewed as a gauge of small-investor interest in the
stock market. And despite their recent rebound, regional
firms' net income still stands at just half its peak in 1986.
In 1989, regionals' net doubled to $215 million but was still
well below 1986's record $546 million, according to the
Securities Industry Association.
   Regionals face stiffer competition, moreover, from some
full-service national firms such as Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. that are redirecting their energies back to serving
individual investors. Still, regionals have a head start in
courting the little guy, cutting costs and focusing on a few
profitable businesses.
   Regionals "already are well on their way -- if they're not
already niche firms," says Alison Deans, an analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "They're sticking to their
strengths and keeping costs low."
   Legg Mason stock fell 12.5 cents to close at $13.125 a
share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.

   Treasury's Sale of 10-Year Notes Is Big Success
   As Investors Flock to Get 8.88% Average Yield

   NEW YORK -- The Treasury's 10-year note auction was a big
success, drawing unexpectedly strong demand from
institutional and individual investors who were attracted by
the best yields in a year.
   "It was a very strong auction," said Thomas Pura, a
partner at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. "Investors find securities
attractive at these levels."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury sold $10 billion of the new 10-year notes at
an average yield of 8.88%. That was much higher than the
average yield of 8.59% at the previous 10-year note auction
in February and the highest yield at an auction since 9.18%
last May.
   Yesterday's sale was the second part of the Treasury's
three-part $30.5 billion quarterly refunding of the federal
debt. The Treasury sold $10.5 billion of three-year notes on
Tuesday and will conclude the auction with the sale of $10
billion of 30-year bonds today.
   Mr. Pura said yesterday's auction, coming on top of a
strong three-year note auction on Tuesday, increases the odds
that today's 30-year bond sale will go smoothly.
   Bond dealers said that all types of investors -- large,
small, domestic and foreign -- were eager to buy the
Treasury's new 10-year notes.
   F. Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone &amp; McCarthy
Research Associates, said that investors were especially
happy because yields at the auction were just high enough for
the Treasury to set a 8 7/8% coupon rate on the notes.
   "If the average yield had been one basis point (one
one-hundredth of a percentage point) lower, the coupon would
have been set at 8 3/4%. That one basis point was important
and made the notes more attractive to the investment
community," said Mr. McCarthy.
   Michael Moore, manager of government trading at
Continental Bank, said investors eager to buy the 10-year
notes spent much of the morning session selling 30-year,
seven-year and five-year Treasury securities "to make room
for the new 10-year." He said demand for the 10-year notes
was strong because the yield was relatively high compared to
yields on some other Treasury securities.
   The success of the auction was clearly unexpected. Traders
said that some dealers, expecting only moderate or even weak
demand for the 10-year notes, placed bids that were too low
and subsequently did not get enough securities to meet
customer orders. Mr. McCarthy estimates that only 33% of the
major New York dealers that tendered bids were actually
awarded bonds.
   As a result, some firms were forced to scramble to buy the
new 10-year Treasury notes in the secondary market. Evidence
of that was apparent in the unusually heavy trading activity
in the new 10-year note by interdealer brokers,
intermediaries that buy and sell securities for the 44
primary dealers of government bonds. Interdealer brokers do
not trade with the general public.
   Traders said about $1 billion of the notes were exchanged
in when-issued trading activity at yields of 8.85% to 8.86%,
far below the auction rates. Of that amount, $630 million was
said to have been traded by RMJ Securities Corp., one of the
five major interdealer brokers. RMJ declined to comment.
   Individual investors, who purchased a record amount of
three-year notes at Tuesday's sale, also showed a hearty
appetite for the new 10-year notes.
   Individual investors typically buy securities at Treasury
auctions through noncompetitive tenders, which totaled $659
million at the 10-year note sale. That was well above the
average noncompetitive bids of $427 million at the previous
12 auctions, according to Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants
Inc.
   The last time noncompetitive bids at a 10-year auction
were higher than yesterday was in August 1985, according to
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., when noncompetitive tenders
totaled $686 million.
   Japanese investors, as expected, bought large amounts of
the 10-year notes. A trader at one of Japan's largest
securities firm estimates that the Japanese purchased about
30% of the new 10-year notes.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices moved sharply lower ahead of the government's
10-year note auction, as dealers cut prices in an effort to
drum up demand for the government's new securities.
   Traders said the market's weakness ahead of auction also
reflected higher commodity prices, a weaker dollar on foreign
exchange markets and a large sale of mortgage-backed
securities by the Resolution Trust Corp. RTC, the government
agency created to bailout the nation's troubled savings and
loan associations, could not be reached for comment.
   Analysts said the RTC sale depressed the market because
buyers of the securities had to sell Treasurys to hedge their
purchase of mortgage-backed securities.
   Treasury bond prices received a modest boost late
yesterday as dealers scrambled to buy new 10-year notes in
when-issued trading activity. But the lift wasn't large
enough to offset the large declines that occurred earlier in
the day.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which was quoted as
much as 3/4 point lower in early trading, ended about 1/2
point lower. The bond was quoted late at a price of 96 2/32
to yield 8.86% compared with 96 16/32 to yield 8.82%.
   Short-term rates were slightly lower. The rates on
three-month Treasury bills was 7.75% for a bond equivalent
yield of 7.99% while the rate on six-month bills eased
slightly to 7.77% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.18%.
   Here are details of yesterday's 10-year note auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   Mortgage securities ended 7/32 to 9/32 lower in moderate
trading.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9% securities
for May delivery finished at 94 1/4, down 9/32. The agency's
9 1/2% issue was at 96 25/32, down 8/32, and its 10% issue
was quoted at 99 7/32, down 8/32. Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue ended at 96 18/32, down 7/32.
   The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.99% to a 12-year
average life assumption.
   In the derivative markets, Freddie Mac issued a $500
million real estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic,
backed by its 10% securities through Salomon Brothers Inc.
UBS Securities Inc. offered $300 million of Remic securities
backed by Ginnie Mae's 9 1/2% issue.
   In the asset-backed market, Rochester Community Savings
Bank offered about $125 million of certificates backed by
automobile and light-truck loans at a yield of 9.51% through
First Boston Corp.
   The issue by the Rochester, N.Y.-based savings bank was
rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds

   Trump Plaza junk bonds climbed yesterday after The Wall
Street Journal's "Heard on the Street" column reported that
some bargain hunters are buying the bonds.
   Trump Plaza is one of several Atlantic City casinos
operated by real estate developer Donald Trump. The Plaza's
12 7/8% bonds maturing in 1998 gained 1 1/2 to end at 83.
Other Trump junk bonds, including the Trump Taj Mahal Funding
and Trump Castle Funding, showed little change.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended unchanged
to about 1/4 point higher.
   Investment-grade corporate bonds were 1/8 to 1/4 point
lower.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal issues fell 3/8 point in quiet dealings but the
market still feels positive, according to traders.
   "Retail is still buying bonds," one trader said. He
attributed the lack of activity to investors waiting for the
outcome of the final leg of the Treasury refunding today.
   An unsold balance of $17.8 million remained on an $65
million issue of Delaware general obligation bonds won by a
Manufacturers Securities Inc. group. The bonds were priced
for reoffering to yield from 6% in 1991 to 7.20% in 2009 and
2010.
   Among dollar bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue due in 2018 were 3/8 lower at 96 1/4 to yield
7.50%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A stronger yen and falling money market rates pushed up
Japanese government bond prices.
   The dollar ended at 157.03 yen in Tokyo, down from 157.63
yen in late New York trading and 158.05 yen at the Tokyo
close on Tuesday.
   But dealers don't expect the yen's firmness to last. They
say that after this week's $30.5 billion U.S. Treasury
refunding that the demand for dollars will increase among
Japanese investors who have bought the new Treasury issues.
   Elsewhere, West Germany government bonds rose when
international investors, long absent from the market, rushed
to buy mark bonds.
   "There's a bit of a positive sentiment in this market and
no selling except for some domestic investors taking
profits," said a West German bond trader. "And that seems to
be drying up."
   Bonn's 7 3/4% issue due in 2000 rose 0.35 point to 95.20
to yield 8.48%, while its 8% notes due in 1995 jumped 0.25
point to 96.60 to yield 8.89%.
   Bond prices fell in Britain.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Reassembling the Universe: Leonore Tawney's Art
   ----
   By Roxanne Orgill
</HL>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20
</SO>
<LP>
   New York -- Leonore Tawney used to be a weaver, a
pioneering, innovating weaver. In the '50s and '60s, she
showed the world that weaving didn't have to be rectangular;
its sides could taper and swell; it could have holes in it
and still be beautiful.
   Ms. Tawney's so-called woven forms and open-warp
tapestries inspired generations of weavers and brought about
a new concept of weaving, not as something to wear, place a
plate on or hang on the wall, but something that had no
practical function at all.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Ms. Tawney made her last weaving piece in 1976. Since
then she has been hanging threads from the ceiling and
calling them cloud sculptures. She has been building collages
like nests inside the drawers of old wooden chests: birds'
eggs, seashells, a knotted rope, feathers. She wrapped a
wooden duck in pink gauze. She covered an antique wooden shoe
form in pages from old books and stuck an animal jawbone on
top.
   Why is Ms. Tawney doing these things? Ask her, and you'll
hear that she lost her Manhattan loft in 1976 and went to
India for six months and didn't have the space for a loom.
And then the government asked her to do a piece for the Santa
Rosa Federal Building, so she went to California, where "I
stayed for a month to get inspiration. And it came," she
says.
   It was Cloud Series IV (1978), 2,550 blue linen threads
each 16 feet long, suspended from a piece of blue canvas on
the ceiling.
   More than 100 pieces are on view here in the biggest and
most complete show of this spry 83-year-old's career, at the
American Craft Museum through June 17. The show moves to the
Art Institute of Chicago from July 26 through Oct. 28, and to
the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C., from April 12, 1991,
through July 21, 1991.
   The exhibition marks the first time Ms. Tawney's weavings
have been shown with her non-woven work. Curator Kathleen
Nugent Mangan has mixed up all the pieces, so a viewer is
forced to make connections between, say, her first weaving,
the colorful, mildly abstract "St. Francis and the Birds,"
and her most recent assemblage, "Half Heard, in the
Stillness." It's an egg carton painted black, filled with
black eggs, and topped with a dried rose.
   Born in Lorain, Ohio, in 1907, Ms. Tawney was 40 before
she studied art seriously. After working as a proofreader in
Chicago and marrying a psychologist, George Tawney, who died
soon after, she studied sculpture with Alexander Archipenko
for three years. "I gave it up because I wanted a life of my
own, and I couldn't have that and do sculpture," she says.
"It gripped me so."
   Weaving, which she tried next, didn't grip her
immediately. But after spending six weeks with Finnish weaver
Martta Taipale at the Penland School of Crafts in North
Carolina, Ms. Tawney wove "St. Francis and the Birds" in
1954. She used only a hasty sketch and let the structure and
vibrant colors develop on the loom.
   Ms. Tawney had no idea then that she would take the medium
into new paths. She only knew "I had got my hands on
something I could work with, work with what I had inside me."
   The paths appeared quickly, though. The next year she
began making gauzy weavings with areas of open warp. "What
happened was that as I was weaving, the warp began to hang in
places looser than the woven part. I thought to myself, `It
won't be any good.' Then I thought, `But I don't have to show
it to anybody, it's just for myself.' And I felt so free]"
   She began moving away from color, and after relocating to
New York City in 1961, she threw out all her colored yarns
and ordered great quantities of black, white and natural
linen thread. She had the idea to weave contoured forms that
would "go up."
   "I wanted them to be aspiring," she says, eyes closed,
hands moving slowly up and over her head.
   The narrow weavings, 11 to 27 feet tall, which she calls
woven forms, turned the fiber world upside down. They still
startle. Standing in the window of the American Craft Museum,
they look like human figures, perhaps actors in a play
waiting for the lights to go up.
   She had always worked on a large scale, but a series of
"Shields," also begun in the 1960s, were small, elegant
squares or rectangles (the largest is 24 by 16 inches) of
gold, orange or beige linen made three-dimensional by manes
of fringe and discreetly worked in feathers, porcupine quills
and pre-Columbian beads.
   The primitive feeling such non-fiber objects give her work
is no accident. Ms. Tawney has traveled extensively in Spain,
South America, the Near and Far East, North Africa and India.
Primitive objects, she says, "are not made as art, they're
made as offerings, they're made as sacrifices. All my work is
like that too. It comes from my heart, it comes from love.
There's a lot of intellectual art out there, but that's not
me."
   The Santa Rosa cloud sculpture was one such offering,
conceived during a severe drought in 1977. (It rained after
she made the piece.) The show has two other "Clouds," a small
pink and beige one and a huge piece that fills the stairwell:
The threads change color midway down, from light to dark
beige, and the field of knots and loose ends quiver like
hundreds and hundreds of spiders. Seen from underneath, the
"Cloud" looks like rain.
   If sculpture had once seemed too hard for her to handle,
with these clouds, it had sneaked back into her life and
taken her over. In the 1970s, she made assemblages in boxes
and collages on paper, frequently using pages from old books
in foreign languages, splashing them with watercolor or
tearing them into tiny pieces. Although words are everywhere
in this work, they are mostly illegible, and Ms. Tawney
rarely knows what they mean. "I have many old books, and I
don't care what they say. I like the paper and the printing."
   She also filled the boxes, and later whole chests, with
eggs, pictures of owls, a pear, handsome paper, clear
marbles, dead birds, a baby's moccasin. "I had all this stuff
in my loft, and I thought, `I'll just put it in these
chests.' Of course, it didn't make a dent."
   A visit to her Manhattan loft is a little like being
inside one of her collages. The walls, ceiling and floors are
painted white, but the vast space is hardly austere. Sixteen
stones are arranged on the floor in descending order of size;
old wooden gears fill a dresser top; hat forms (some
decorated with feather faces and linen braids) stand on
shelves; broken eggshells from many breakfasts have been
tossed into a basket, etc. A recording of an Indian chant
plays in the background, and pictures of her guru, a
beautiful Indian woman, are taped to pillars, walls and the
fridge.
   Into all this marvelous clutter floats Ms. Tawney, in
white Indian trousers and a blue silk tunic, her hair cropped
short except for a tiny braid in back. She says little but
opens many drawers and cupboards. In a drawer of a private
chest, one not yet made into a "Collage Chest," are two whale
teeth, some bone buttons and a folded paper packet marked "my
hair." In a cupboard is a carton of a dozen "mended eggs"
repaired with scraps of antique book paper. "I ate them and
then I mended them. Now who would have thought of that but
me?" she asks.

   Stocks End Mixed Amid Weakness
   In Bonds and Decline in the Dollar

   NEW YORK -- The stock market's advance over the past week
and a half finally faltered, as prices finished mixed amid
weakness in bonds and a sell-off in the dollar.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a string of seven
consecutive advances by easing 0.68 to 2732.88.
Earnings-related selling in Woolworth and weakness in a few
other blue-chip issues put pressure on the average.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Other market measures, however, managed to extend their
winning streaks. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index went up
0.85 to 342.86, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
gained 0.38 to 187.49 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
rose 0.46 to 318.68.
   Market speculation that the Treasury's auction of $10
billion in 10-year notes, the second stage of its quarterly
refinancing, had been disappointing sent the market to
session lows in the last hour of trading.
   But after the Treasury released the results of the note
sale, which were in line with market expectations, prices
quickly recovered as bonds bounced off their lows and
stock-index futures reached sharp premiums to the cash
indexes, sparking index-arbitrage buying in stocks.
   Other arbitrage-related buy programs, involving the sale
of index futures and the purchase of baskets of stocks to
profit from price differences between them, had surfaced
early in the session to lend support to the market.
   Despite the late improvement, Treasury notes and bonds
showed declines of as much as 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000
face amount, in late dealings.
   Analysts also noted the dollar's downturn, attributed to a
growing belief that U.S. interest rates may have reached a
peak, as a drag on the market. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 1.6360 marks and 156.50 yen, down from
1.6573 marks and 157.62 yen late Tuesday.
   Edward P. Nicoski, managing director of technical analysis
at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, Minneapolis, said the market
appears headed for some slippage during the next one to two
weeks after approaching the upper end of its trading range
this year. "I'd be real concerned about tomorrow just because
of the dollar situation," he said.
   Others said today's final stage of the Treasury
refinancing -- a sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds -- may
pose problems for stocks if it doesn't go well and interest
rates rise.
   Woolworth, which reported that its fiscal first-quarter
earnings went up 5.5% from the year-ago level, dropped 1 to
60 5/8. The results for the latest period were on the low end
of analysts' forecasts.
   Other blue chips to weigh on the industrial average
included Westinghouse Electric, which went down 1 1/2 to 74;
Aluminum Co. of America, off 1/2 to 63 1/2, and USX, down 1/2
to 32 7/8.
   SmithKline Beecham, whose first-quarter earnings were in
line with analysts' forecasts, gained 1 to 37 3/4 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading of 1.9 million shares.
Pretax profit fell 6.8% from the year-earlier period on a
pro-forma basis, which takes into account the merger of
SmithKline Beckman and Beecham Group last year, while sales
rose 15%.
   Another drug stock, Bristol-Myers Squibb, gained 1/2 to 58
1/2 and topped the Big Board's list of most active issues as
2.2 million shares were traded. The brisk activity apparently
was spurred by talk that the New England Journal of Medicine
would carry two positive reports and a favorable editorial on
the company's AIDS drug DDI in today's issue, market contacts
told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Also, Sanford C.
Bernstein reiterated its buy recommendation on the issue,
partly because of the expected articles.
   Warner-Lambert gained 7/8 to 108 1/2. The company told
investors attending a health care conference in Baltimore
that it is "on target" to achieve its goal of at least a 16%
rise in earnings per share this year. Eli Lilly, which was
also scheduled to appear at the conference, rose 3/4 to 69 on
1.1 million shares.
   Sotheby's Holdings plunged 3 1/8 to 16 1/2 on 1.3 million
shares amid disappointment with its sale of contemporary art
Tuesday night. About 37% of the art works that the auction
house put up for bids weren't sold, and many other pieces
were sold at prices below Sotheby's lowest published
estimate.
   Eastman Kodak added 1/2 to 38 1/8. The company said it
expects to post "higher sales, better earnings and improved
cash flows" later this year because of its restructuring
efforts; it also forecast annual sales gains of 20% in
Eastern Europe for its photography operations.
   Federal Express dropped 1 1/2 to 52 1/8.
   Deutsche Lufthansa confirmed that it is holding talks
along with "other parties" to acquire a minority stake in DHL
Worldwide Express, seen as a possible defensive move against
an aggressive overseas expansion by Federal Express. Others
in the talks reportedly include two Japanese firms, Nissho
Iwai and Japan Air Lines.
   Shaw Industries skidded 2 7/8 to 30 1/4. Merrill Lynch and
Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer lowered estimates of the
company's earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ends
in June. The company acknowledged results are slightly behind
internal projections, but wouldn't elaborate.
   Sherwin-Williams jumped 2 to 38 1/8. The company said it
is unaware of any reasons for the move.
   Stone Container fell 7/8 to 16 1/2. The Canadian
Paperworkers Union has selected three paper mills owned by
the company as the target of contract negotiations that will
set the pattern for most of the forest-products industry in
eastern Canada.
   PNC Financial dropped 1 1/4 to 36 7/8 amid speculation
that the company might be facing problems in its financial
dealings with NVRyan, a Virginia-based home builder. But PNC
said that its loan exposure to NVR is "modest" and the loan
is current in principal and interest.
   Nalco Chemical rose 1 1/4 to 53. Salomon Brothers
reiterated a buy recommendation on the stock and said the
company can be considered an environmental play because it
sells chemicals for water and waste treatment.
   Mattel rose 1/2 to 24 after declaring a common dividend of
three cents a share, its first payout since June 1983.
Separately, its board authorized the repurchase of as many as
500,000 shares over the next 12 months to fund a stock-option
plan.
   American Capital Management &amp; Research gained 3/4 to 9
1/8. Primerica, which already has an 82.6% stake in the
company, agreed to swap 0.3 share of its common for each of
the shares it doesn't own. Primerica finished unchanged at 29
5/8.
   Xtra dropped 3/8 to 22 1/8. The company posted a loss from
continuing operations of $1.66 a share for the March quarter
and cut its dividend by 33%, to 12 cents a share; it called
the reduction temporary.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.95
to 348.53. Volume totaled 14,560,000 shares.
   California Energy, which plummeted 1 7/8 Tuesday,
rebounded 5/8 to 10 3/8. The company said it had arranged
financing for its proposed acquisition of some of Chevron's
geothermal operations.
   Greiner Engineering went up 3/4 to 15 3/4. The company
signed a contract with the Hong Kong government to serve as
planning and engineering consultant for the development of a
new airport.
   Forest Laboratories gained 3/8 to 37 7/8 after reporting
that net income for the fiscal quarter ended in March rose
about 26% from a year earlier.

   NEW YORK -- Stanley Stahl, the real-estate investor and
hostile bidder for Apple Bancorp Inc., rejected the bank's
proposed standstill agreement and began a proxy fight for
control of the board.
   Mr. Stahl, who controls 30.6% of the parent of Apple Bank
for Savings, has offered $38 a share, or $121.6 million, for
the rest. The bank has rejected the tender offer, and the two
sides have filed suits against each other.
</LP>

   The bank recently proposed an accord under which it would
give confidential nonpublic data about Apple to Mr. Stahl. In
return, the investor would have agreed not to boost his stake
or make an offer for Apple for two years without the board's
consent.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, however,
Mr. Stahl called the terms of the agreement "unacceptable."
The investor also has proposed to expand Apple's board to 21
members from 12, and he is seeking to elect 13 of the 21
directors. He had said in November that he had planned a
proxy fight for the board.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Apple shares rose 62.5 cents, to close at $43.75.
   An Apple spokesman could not be reached for comment.

   Agricultural Department Report on Winter Wheat
   Is Expected to Forecast a 35% Harvest Increase

   The Agriculture Department is expected to report today
that the nation's production of winter wheat will jump
roughly 35% from last year.
   The biggest improvement is expected to occur in Kansas,
the biggest wheat-producing state, which was dogged by
drought for two years. The wheat harvest there this summer is
expected to total roughly 420 million bushels, nearly double
the harvest of last summer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most analysts expect the Agriculture Department to project
a national winter wheat harvest of 1.963 billion bushels,
compared with 1.454 billion bushels last summer. The report
is the Agriculture Department's first official forecast of
1990 wheat production. Dry weather through the winter had
fanned concerns that a third year of drought would further
deplete U.S. wheat stockpiles, which already are at their
lowest levels in more than 15 years.
   But regular rainfall in March and April caused an
astonishing improvement in the crop, which some grain
analysts expect to be the second- or third-largest harvest in
the state. "It is the best I've ever seen," said Steve Freed,
senior grain analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago.
   Most of the U.S. crop is called winter wheat because it is
planted in September and October and harvested in June and
July. Kansas and several other states in the Southern Plains
region grow the hard red variety of winter wheat, which is
used to make everything from white bread to all-purpose
flour.
   The second big variety of winter wheat, which is called
soft red, is grown in Illinois and Indiana.
   Two wheat crops that are in jeopardy are grown in Northern
Plains states such as North Dakota and Montana. Drought
conditions have lingered for two years in some areas where
spring wheat and durum are grown. The crops are used to make
pasta, among other things.
   The Agriculture Department won't make any prognosis on
these wheat varieties today because they are just being
planted. However, some parts of North Dakota have received as
little as 38% of their normal rainfall so far this year, and
there is little sign that the dry pattern will ease anytime
soon, said Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of Weather
Services Corp., Bedford, Mass.
   Despite problems in the spring wheat belt, the price of
wheat in the U.S. has been slipping in recent months because
of the improvement in the winter wheat-growing areas.
   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the price of the
soft red winter contract for May delivery rose 1.5 cents a
bushel to settle at $3.795.
   Wheat prices rose in sympathy with a strong rise in the
prices of corn and soybean futures contracts. Commodity funds
were heavy buyers of these contracts for technical reasons.
The price of soybean contracts for delivery over several
months rose at least 13 cents a bushel.
   In addition to the wheat crop report, analysts will study
a supply-and-demand estimate for corn, scheduled for release
by the Agriculture Department. Among other things, grain
analysts are interested in whether the department increases
its estimates of corn exports.
   The department won't directly project the size of the corn
crop, which is currently being planted. Some grain analysts,
however, suspect that a continuing rally in corn prices
prompted corn farmers to plant more land than the 4% increase
projected by the Agriculture Department in March.
   Katharina Zimmer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, New York,
said corn farmers might have planted roughly 76.5 million
acres, up about 5.8% from last year. If good growing weather
continues through the summer, U.S. corn production might top
eight billion bushels for the first time since the 1986
harvest.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Gasoline prices surged, leading crude oil prices
higher as well. June delivery gasoline was up 1.49 cents a
gallon to 63.97 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
June delivery West Texas Intermediate crude was up 71 cents a
barrel to $18.99. Supplies of gasoline have tightened,
especially along the Gulf Coast. Many refineries, which
temporarily ceased operations during recent months for
maintenance turnarounds, have remained off line far longer
than expected. According to Lawrence Goldstein of Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation, stricter environmental
requirements have made revamping the refineries more
time-consuming. He predicts that gasoline supplies will be
especially scarce during May and June. Lending support to his
theory was a report by the American Petroleum Institute
released Tuesday showing that daily U.S. gasoline production
and supply declined last week. Output and inventory levels
also remain below levels during a similar period last year,
the report indicated.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices surged on Japanese buying of the
metal and a reported new miners strike. The most active
contract, July, was strongest, rising 5.35 cents a pound to
$1.1750 and setting a new life-of-contract high of $1.18. The
soon-to-expire May delivery was up four cents to $1.2440.
July was strongest because it has more speculative
participation than May, whose last trading day is May 29, one
analyst said. However, he noted, the buying by
computer-oriented funds, which prevailed in the July
contract, tended to exaggerate the advance. The Japanese
buying was in the form of call options in London, analysts
said. A call option is a right to buy a futures contract for
a specific month. Last week, holders of option contracts in
London decided to exercise their right to buy the underlying
futures contracts on the options' last trading day, which
caused futures prices to rise sharply. The London Metal
Exchange subsequently called in all trading cards of futures
brokers to see if there had been any activity that unduly
influenced the market. As of yesterday, according to one New
York analyst, the London exchange hadn't taken any action and
the issue appeared to be closed. "There had been at least a
little concern about what might happen," he said. Workers at
the OK Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea went on strike yesterday
over wages and promotions, Reuters reported. The mine
produces about 230,000 tons of concentrates, which contain
about 100,000 to 120,000 tons of copper after refining, a New
York dealer estimated. In Peru, the union representing
workers at the state-owned Centromin's 17 installations
issued a 72-hour strike notice, analysts said. If there is no
agreement on wage demands by tomorrow, the workers will go on
strike on Saturday, analysts said. Centromin is Peru's
largest producer of lead, zinc and silver and its
third-largest copper producer, accounting for about 12% of
that nation's copper output. Workers at Southern Peru Copper
Co. returned to work last week, but there still hasn't been a
new labor agreement. The workers have presented demands to
the company and if there isn't an accord, they threatened to
go on a threeday strike on either Sunday or Monday, analysts
said. A spokesman for Southern Peru in New York couldn't
confirm the reports, but said the workers' return to the
mines last Friday was unconditional.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were higher. June delivery
gold advanced $1.70 an ounce to $373.70. July silver was up
3.5 cents an ounce to $5.0930. July platinum, which an
analyst said appeared to be oversold Tuesday, rebounded on
reports of some Japanese buying and closed with a gain of
$7.30 an ounce at $486.50. There has been some Japanese
demand for platinum bullion as prices eased recently, but
apparently it picked up somewhat yesterday, the analyst said.
The principal supporting factor in gold was a weak dollar,
according to the analyst, who said the influence of the
dollar overcame continuing speculation that the Soviet Union
and South Africa might sell gold. He said reports had
circulated that the Soviet Union had been a seller of gold,
"but I don't believe it." He said he also didn't believe
other, unconfirmed reports that South African gold mines were
curtailing production because of low prices.

   NEW YORK -- Is money manager John Templeton, one of the
patriarchs of fundamental stock picking, turning in his sharp
pencil for a computer?
   Mr. Templeton's money management firm has quietly acquired
Dais Group Inc., a high-tech stock trading and research
operation orphaned by the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc. Templeton, Galbraith &amp; Hansberger Ltd. paid about
$1 million for Dais, a number-crunching outfit that in its
Drexel days traded big baskets of stock using computer
models. That might seem to be a far cry from Mr. Templeton's
own roam-the-globe strategy of digging up neglected companies
trading below their real worth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. Templeton insists he isn't changing his stripes.
"Buying bargains hasn't become obsolete," he said from
London, where he is administering his $680,000 Templeton
Prize for Progress in Religion.
   He is betting that other money managers, in particular
giant pension funds, are going to rely more and more on
computer-aided "quantitative" research, especially when it
comes to global investing.
   Mr. Templeton, of course, is in a prime position to watch
for trends in the money management business. His firm manages
13 mutual funds with combined assets exceeding $9 billion,
including nine broker-sold funds and four of the publicly
traded "closed end" type funds in the U.S.
   He is going to keep Dais Group at arm's length. "It will
operate under its own name, in its own office with its own
people," he said, and such independent status is a first for
a Templeton subsidiary. Mr. Templeton may not want the
"quants" to get too close to his stock pickers, though he
concedes that his staff already uses some of the Dais Group's
research.
   Martin Flanagan, Templeton's chief financial officer, said
the firm views Dais "like an undervalued security that would
be good to have in our portfolio. That isn't to say that all
of a sudden we are going to take on quantitative research in
the management of the Templeton funds."
   Mr. Templeton manages more than $15 billion in stock for
thousands of investors. A pioneer international investor, he
is famed for finding hidden values in stock markets around
the world.
   But among the holdings, there are other signs that Mr.
Templeton is quietly betting on the business of high-tech
stock trading and research. Among the holdings of the
Templeton funds is 695,000 shares, or about 10%, of Jefferies
Group Inc., the aggressive third-market trading firm that is
making a major investment in high-tech trading systems.
   Templeton funds are also large holders of other
financial-services concerns. They own 1.3 million shares of
Dreyfus Corp., the mutual fund company; about 500,000 shares
of Salomon Inc., parent of Salomon Brothers, and his funds
are among the largest stockholders of money manager American
Capital Management &amp; Research Inc.
   As the money-management business consolidates into bigger
and bigger pools of capital, computers have given portfolio
managers a variety of tools -- from the ability to rapidly
buy and sell big baskets of stocks to sophisticated systems
that compare the day-by-day performance of thousands of
stocks in dozens of markets.
   But there is another reason why Templeton thinks
quantitative investing will become more popular: it's
cheaper. Money managers are trying to cut costs and beat
market averages, and quantitative techniques have in recent
years accomplished both tasks.
   "Many of the traditional, fundamental investors are coming
up for retirement, and the new guard taking over is being
trained" with quantitative techniques, said Nicholas Lopardo,
chief investment officer at State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co.,
which manages about $50 billion solely with quantitative
strategies.
   Last February, when Drexel's parent filed for
bankruptcy-law protection, Dais Group was quickly bought by
its two top executives, George Douglas and Robert Butman.
   Messrs. Douglas and Butman held daily huddles with the
staff to keep up morale, and have sought to fend off
competitors who tried to lure away some of their 125
institutional clients. The Templeton purchase, they say, will
give Dais access to foreign stock-market data and the capital
the firm needs to expand.
   Mr. Templeton launched his first mutual fund, Templeton
Growth, in 1954. But his really spectacular performance
didn't come until the 1970s, when he managed to sidestep the
1973-74 U.S. bear market while making a large and hugely
successful bet on Japanese stocks.
   According to Lipper Analytical Services, Templeton Growth
soared 18.8% a year during the 1970s, versus 5.9% for the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   By the start of the 1980s, Mr. Templeton was managing two
funds, Templeton Growth and Templeton World, with combined
assets of just over $300 million. As money flowed in, Mr.
Templeton has continued to produce handsome, though not
spectacular, results. Through the 1980s, Templeton Growth
returned 16.4% a year, and Templeton World 17.6%, versus
17.5% for the S&amp;P 500 and 18.1% for the average global stock
fund.
   Born in Tennessee, Mr. Templeton became a British national
and was knighted in 1987. He now lives in the Bahamas, at the
exclusive Lyford Cay Club. He sponsors a big cash prize for
significant contributions to religious thought and life. Past
recipients include Mother Teresa of Calcutta and Alexander
Solzhenitsyn.

   Junk Bonds May Get

   NEW YORK -- The high-yield junk bond market is likely to
get a lift today as state insurance commissioners present a
stretched-out timetable for new investment regulations that
affect junk bonds.
   At issue are the statutory reserves that insurance
companies must build up against the possibility of defaults
in their bond portfolios. State insurance commissioners this
spring have been drafting tougher new reserve rules that
could take effect as soon as Jan. 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new rules' biggest impact is expected to be in the
junk bond market, where insurers own about 30% of the $200
billion of publicly traded junk bonds outstanding. In some
cases, regulators plan to require that reserves be built up
five to 20 times as fast as is currently being done. Because
those greater reserve demands would make junk bonds less
appealing to insurers, fears of an insurance-company sell-off
of junk bonds have built up.
   But insurance companies appear to have persuaded
regulators to move cautiously. At a Washington meeting today,
regulators are expected to present the insurance industry
with a plan to phase in the new rules gradually over five
years. "People are saying they want a transition period so
this doesn't affect their balance sheets," said Terence
Lennon, chief examiner of the New York State Insurance
Department. "We're taking a very slow and measured approach."
   Mr. Lennon heads a working group of the 50-state National
Association of Insurance Commissioners that is drafting the
new reserve rules. The latest version of the rules is
expected to be adopted by the entire association next month.

   U.S. Unit Plunges to a 28-Month Low
   Against Mark on Interest-Rate Jitters

   NEW YORK -- The dollar declined sharply against major
currencies yesterday amid fears that current efforts to
reduce the federal budget deficit might result in downward
pressure on U.S. interest rates.
   The U.S. unit fell two pfennigs to a 28-month low against
the mark and dropped more than a yen as a budget "summit" was
scheduled for Tuesday between President Bush and Congress.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some participants said the dollar's sharp decline was
precipitated by an article yesterday in The Wall Street
Journal suggesting that Mr. Bush sees an accord on narrowing
the deficit as the only way to ensure lower interest rates
over the long term.
   The administration is known to favor lower interest rates
as a means of stimulating the economy and spurring
improvement in the country's trade imbalance with Japan,
which recent dollar strength against the yen is seen
impeding.
   During the afternoon, the White House released a statement
saying it hoped an agreement on the budget deficit would lead
the Federal Reserve Bank to reduce interest rates. "We would
hope that the Fed would be impressed" with the latest effort
to cut the deficit, said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The budget talks were scheduled amid some disappointment
in the market at the 8.74% average yield that the Treasury's
$10.5 billion of three-year notes brought Tuesday, said David
Ogg, chief dealer at Credit Suisse in New York. The market
had been hoping for a slightly higher yield to serve as a
sign that pressure for lower U.S. interest rates isn't
growing, Mr. Ogg said.
   News that the Treasury's $10 billion of 10-year notes
brought an average yield of 8.88% yesterday came too late in
the day to influence currency trading.
   Traders said earlier yesterday that they would be watching
the 10-year note auction later in the day and the 30-year
bond sale today in order to gauge foreign investors'
confidence in the U.S.
   Japanese participation in both Tuesday's and yesterday's
note auctions ran at about the customary 30% level, according
to preliminary information. Traders said they are most
interested in Japanese purchases of 10-year and 30-year
paper, reasoning that good buying by Japanese of the
longer-term issues signals stronger willingness to invest in
U.S. paper.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6360 marks, down from 1.6573 marks late Tuesday, and at
156.50 yen, down from 157.62 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6785, up from $1.6705 Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 156.55 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
157.03 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6355
marks.
   Overall, the market remains bearish on the dollar in the
short term, with participants choosing to view developments
with an eye toward selling the U.S. unit, said Robert White,
a vice president and manager of corporate trading at First
Interstate Bank of California in Los Angeles.
   Mr. White cited as evidence the market's reaction to the
budget-deficit talks. Traders focused on the possibility of
lower interest rates that the discussions might produce
instead of on prospects for a reduction in the deficit, which
could be seen as bullish for the dollar, Mr. White said.
   The U.S. unit's fall against the mark was exacerbated by
growing demand for the West German unit based on an improving
market assessment of the West German central bank's ability
to control inflation associated with German reunification,
said Andy Robertson, foreign exchange sales manager at Chase
Manhattan Bank in New York.
   The mark also recorded gains against the yen in active
non-dollar dealings yesterday, rising to 95.63 yen in late
New York trading from 95.10 yen in New York Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery rose $1.90 to $371.90 an ounce in moderate trading.
Estimated volume was 3.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $371 an ounce.

   Players Club Sees a Good Bet in Niche Left by Casinos

   Company Seeks to Treat Medium-Stakes
   Gamblers Like High Rollers

   Players International Inc. is cashing in on gambling
without the help of dice, cards or slot machines.
   The small company's five-year-old Players Club, endorsed
on late-night cable television by the actor Telly Savalas,
promises medium-stakes gamblers a taste of the red-carpet
treatment that casinos usually reserve for high rollers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most people love a bargain, and Players promises discounts
on casino hotel rooms, food and shows, along with other
perks, in such gambling meccas as Las Vegas, Atlantic City,
N.J., and the Bahamas. Some joiners say it doesn't pay. But
the club says many members recoup the $125-a-year membership
fee in a single outing, saving 25% to 60% on air fare,
lodging, food and entertainment.
   Like many new companies, Players aims to capitalize on an
opening left by larger ones. Casinos work hard to bring in
busloads of penny-pinching slot-machine players and to
attract $40,000-a-hand baccarat aficionados and other high
rollers. Players Club is aimed at millions of so-called
middle-market gamblers, who it says are often overlooked by
casino marketing programs. Casinos say the middle market is
so diverse that such gamblers are harder to target.
   In return for steering customers to casinos, Players gets
discount rates on blocks of rooms reserved for its members.
The firm spends $6 million to $7 million annually on ads and
marketing, mostly aimed at attracting new members.
   Players Club has expanded to 90,000 members; it says about
5,500 people join each month. Players International says it
expects to report revenue of more than $16 million for the
fiscal year ended March 31, up from $12 million a year
earlier. Besides running the club, the company's activities
include promoting gambling cruises and other travel for
gamblers and arranging casino promotions.
   But Players still has problems. With membership swelling,
each member faces more competition to get one of the rooms
reserved for the club. Thus, more members are likely to be
disappointed -- which hardly sits well with those who signed
up to be coddled. But the main reason about 40% of Players'
members fail to renew is because they don't use them enough.
   In any case, some industry observers question how well
Players will weather the next economic slowdown or industry
downturn. (It was launched during the biggest casino-industry
boom ever.) Discretionary leisure spending is one of the
first cuts made by consumers in tight times. That could mean
trouble for Players, which depends heavily on membership
renewals.
   At first, the club paid off for Bernard Szynaka, an
engineer from St. James, N.Y., who visited casinos several
times a year. The $29-a-night cost of staying at the Aladdin
in Las Vegas was "like giving it away," he says. He canceled
his membership last month, saying he doesn't plan to gamble
again soon. But he adds that Players' promotions "aren't
quite as good as they were." Lately, he had found new
restrictions, "like no Saturday check-in."
   The company says such cases are the exception and that it
actually has expanded the club's benefits.
   Blaine Warner of York, Pa., a retired 61-year-old former
night-club owner who goes to Atlantic City three times a
month and Las Vegas at least once a year, says, "For me, it's
a good deal because I'm there all the time."
   Some members have complained to local and state
authorities, saying the club doesn't deliver what's promised.
Players says it responds to complaints and none has resulted
in any action against it.
   The club is run from Calabasas, Calif., a Los Angeles
suburb. Edward and David Fishman, the brothers who founded
Players, formerly produced TV game shows. The Fishmans and
other directors own about 53% of the company, which went
public in 1985 by purchasing a public shell corporation.
   "We've got a very specialized niche," says David Fishman.
"Our customers are the ones who usually pay full price for
everything." The average member, according to Players, is
married, 45 to 60 years old, with income of $52,000 and a
per-trip betting bankroll of $1,300.
   Saving a buck isn't the only appeal. "People want to be
recognized," Mr. Fishman adds.
   After a rocky start -- the club attracted only 12,000
members the first year -- Players thinks it has hit a hot
streak. It turned its first profit -- of $509,000, or seven
cents a share, in fiscal 1989, compared with a loss of
$295,600, or four cents a share, a year earlier.
   Players actually bombed in its first direct mailing. "Our
biggest problem was credibility," says Stanley Harfenist,
Players International president. But, after Mr. Savalas --
who is widely perceived as street-smart -- was recruited as
spokesman, members began signing up.
   Although Players found a niche, it is hardly without
indirect competition. "Players Club is one part of a whole
movement toward sophisticated player marketing, and it's
something a lot of casinos are doing very well," says Daniel
R. Lee, an analyst with First Boston Co.
   Some new casino programs are working with Players Club to
attract middle-market gamblers. Such casinos know that
Players has a data base of roughly three million names.
Harrah's Marina casino in Atlantic City, however, is dropping
its contract with Players, saying it can't spare the extra
rooms that the club wants in peak periods.
   Still, Players has more names than members. Then there are
people who never even join; many think they can make better
arrangements themselves.
   Now, though, Players says its biggest worries are about
accommodating members. Says David Fishman, "I'm not lying
awake at night anymore thinking, `Are we going to make it?'"

   Ethyl Plan to Seek Approval for Gas Additives
   Fuels Interest by Analysts in Market Potential

   PHILADELPHIA -- This week's uptick in one chemical
company's shares caught analysts by surprise and prompted
some to wonder: "What's up, Ethyl?"
   The Street is intrigued by Ethyl's Tuesday announcement
that it will seek federal approval for a gasoline additive
designed to cut air pollution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With all the environmental hoopla and government
initiatives to reduce automobile emissions, the Street is
finding "an opportunity to take a new liking to Ethyl," says
one analyst. Ethyl jumped 2 1/8 Tuesday, before subsiding 3/8
yesterday to 27 1/2.
   Several analysts say that if the additive is approved --
and that's a big if at this point -- Ethyl's annual earnings
could grow as much as $1 a share above projections and the
stock could rise to the high 30s within two to three years --
with $5 of that coming from the additive.
   The manganese-based additive, known as MMT, could have a
potential market of $350 million a year if used in all
gasoline sold in the U.S. Ethyl estimates potential sales
initially at $100 million to $150 million a year.
   "This could be the right product at the right time" to
help oil refiners and auto manufacturers meet stricter Clean
Air Act standards, says Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache
Securities.
   Even the most bullish analysts, however, warn that chances
for approval are probably only 50% or slightly better. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which must issue a
decision within six months, is concerned that the additive
could actually increase certain types of emissions --
hydrocarbons -- that contribute to smog. And the auto
industry has previously opposed MMT on grounds that it could
damage pollution-control equipment, especially catalytic
converters.
   Charles LoCastro of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette says he
isn't comfortable recommending the stock because chances of
approval are only "50-50." He notes that the EPA twice
rejected the additive, in 1978 and 1981, and there isn't any
sign that car makers will be more supportive this time.
Ethyl's stock is fully valued at 27 1/2 and stands to decline
from there if MMT fails again, Mr. LoCastro says.
   Ethyl says results of exhaustive testing will convince
even the most hardened skeptics. The company drove a fleet of
48 new cars more than 75,000 miles each to compare tailpipe
emissions and reliability using unleaded fuel with and
without MMT. Ray Wilkins Jr., a senior vice president of
Ethyl, says the additive produced a striking 20% reduction in
nitrogen oxide emissions, but a 6% increase in hydrocarbons,
causing an overall 7.5% reduction in emissions, including
nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.
   Many cars using MMT in the test met strict nitrogen oxide
emission standards being proposed in Congress, and none
violated any existing standards (including those for
hydrocarbons), Mr. Wilkins says. Even with increased tailpipe
hydrocarbons, Ethyl argues, there could be a drop in
hydrocarbons overall because the additive would allow
gasoline refiners to make fuel that is less susceptible to
evaporation. Yet the projected overall 7.5% reduction in
tailpipe emissions still wouldn't meet standards that
Congress is considering mandating for the smoggiest cities.
   "I'm very optimistic we'll have support from the auto and
oil industries and environmentalists," Mr. Wilkins says. The
additive, which would be marketed under the name HiTEC 3000,
has been used widely in Canada for more than a decade with no
apparent ill effects on cars or public health. Athough Ethyl
invented the additive in 1954, so far the U.S. has allowed
its use only in leaded fuel, which accounts for just 6% of
gasoline sales.
   Mary Smith, an EPA official in charge of reviewing Ethyl's
test results, said she couldn't comment on the additive's
chances of approval. But, she said, EPA will scrutinize
closely whether it would reduce the ability of cars to meet
hydrocarbon standards. Spokesmen for Exxon and General Motors
said they couldn't comment until they review Ethyl's test
results.
   Though the additive could become Ethyl's fastest-growing
product, some analysts like its other businesses. Mr. Bogner
calls Ethyl an "aggressive buy" that could earn $2.10 a share
this year and $2.40 next year. If the additive is approved,
he might raise his 1991 estimate five cents to 10 cents a
share. Ethyl, based in Richmond, Va., "could trade in the low
30s over the next six to nine months" without the additive,
and in the high 30s within two years if MMT is approved, he
says.
   John Henry of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets has
recommended Ethyl for some time, in part because of the
additive's potential. His estimates are $2.05 this year and
$2.35 in 1991, and he says MMT could be worth an extra 20
cents to 30 cents a share in 1991 and a $1 a share in several
years: "All this proposed legislation is creating markets for
products that help gas burn cleaner."
   Other companies are benefiting from the drive for cleaner
fuels. Arco Chemical reports fast sales growth for MTBE, an
ether-based product that increases octane and reduces
emissions when blended with gasoline. Ethyl says its additive
can be used with MTBE or other agents to provide greater
reductions in nitrogen oxides.

   NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. President Laurence A. Tisch chose to
look on the bright side of the ratings at the struggling TV
network during CBS's typically contentious annual
shareholders meeting.
   Responding to a stockholder's criticism that almost every
portion of the network's schedule -- including daytime, news,
prime-time and late night -- was in disarray, Mr. Tisch took
exception. "We're a total disaster only in prime time," the
chief executive officer said. "We will correct that."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the 1989-90 season, CBS finished in third place for the
third consecutive year. Last week, a CBS show tied for first
place, but it was a 40-year-old never-before-seen pilot of
the 1950's hit "I Love Lucy."
   The only other CBS show that consistently places in the
Top 10 is "60 Minutes," a 21-year-old broadcast produced by
the company's news division. In the just-completed TV season,
the highest-ranked CBS entertainment show was "Murder, She
Wrote," which placed No. 13 and has been on the air for six
years.
   "We all realize what's going on," Mr. Tisch said, "and
you're going to see progress starting in September. We're
making progress in prime time. Slower than we had hoped, but
we're getting there."
   A shareholder asked about reports that Walt Disney Co.
would purchase CBS. "I don't know of anybody who is going to
buy CBS," he said. "I think CBS is going to remain an
independent company."
   He also said that CBS wouldn't purchase other TV stations
"unless they make economic sense." CBS owns five stations
covering 20.8% of the country. Under regulations by the
Federal Communications Commission, a network can own stations
covering 25% of the country.

   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Pengo Industries Inc. said it emerged
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings in a
reorganization that gave an affiliate of R.D. Smith &amp; Co.,
New York, a 47% stake in the restructured company.
   Senior secured creditors, who held about $48 million of
secured debt, received 46% of the company's newly issued
common and $10.2 million in cash, Pengo said. Holders of
Pengo's senior and junior convertible preferred stock
received 3.5% and 0.2%, respectively, of the new common while
public holders of Pengo's old common, excluding senior
secured lenders, received 2.3%. Pengo management will receive
a 1% stake.

   The Smith affiliate, PIAC Inc., provided Pengo with $7
million in new equity, capital and financing, Pengo said.
Another Smith affiliate, GNPW L.P., was given the capital
stock of several Pengo subsidiaries, including GOEX Inc.,
Townsend Enterprises Inc. and Petro Rubber Products Inc. In
return, GOEX paid Pengo $620,000 and retired $10 million,
principal amount, of secured Pengo term notes it had bought
from senior creditors.
   Unsecured creditors received $1 million cash and a $2
million subordinated debenture in return for about $10
million of unsecured debt, the company said.
   Pengo said its former board was replaced by Arthur J.
Pasmas and Lewis E. Ball II of Houston, Jeffrey A. Smith of
New York, William J. Conway of Baton Rouge, La., and Charles
Merritt of Dallas.
   The company said its principal business will be its wholly
owned subsidiary, Pengo Corp., a Union City, Calif., maker
and distributor of earth engaging augers and teeth. It said
the business is its most profitable, posting net income of
$2.3 million on sales of about $9.6 million in the fiscal
year ended Sept. 30, 1989.

   House-Senate Talks on Spending Bill
   Break Off, Blocking Foreign-Aid Plan

   WASHINGTON -- House-Senate negotiations on a $3.3 billion
fiscal 1990 spending bill broke off as quickly as they began,
leaving an anxious State Department scrambling to expedite
its three-month-old request for new aid to Panama and
Nicaragua.
   The standoff is owed more to disputes over domestic
appropriations than foreign assistance, but the delay is a
further frustration for the State Department, which must
still contend with separate demands that conditions be
imposed on military aid to El Salvador.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Liberal Democrats have maneuvered to join all of the
Central American issues in the House, where Rules Committee
Chairman Joseph Moakley is positioned to delay the $720
million for Panama and Nicaragua until some resolution is
reached on El Salvador. Secretary of State James Baker
telephoned the Massachusetts Democrat yesterday in an effort
to put off the fight. But Democrats have been frustrated, in
turn, by what they see as the administration's failure to
come forward earlier and negotiate.
   "I like Baker, and I think he's on the level. But he's a
one-man show," said Mr. Moakley. "I told him we know you're
acting in good faith, but I hear your nouns and your verbs,
but I don't hear numbers."
   Democrats have proposed withholding as much as 50% of U.S.
military aid to El Salvador in fiscal 1990 and 1991. But Mr.
Moakley said Mr. Baker indicated he wanted to leave this
year's money unencumbered and hold back only 25% of whatever
is approved in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Bernard
Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, is slated to meet with House Democrats today. And
though there is hope of a settlement, most indications are
that the administration will have to make further
concessions.
   Though the foreign-aid package remains the heart of the
bill for the White House, the underlying measure has grown
steadily as it has moved through Congress. The $3.3 billion
total approved by the Senate is more than $700 million above
comparable accounts in the House version. House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, a past
master of pork-barrel politics, is clearly relishing his new
position as the austere budgeteer. The Mississippi Democrat
used yesterday's meeting to lecture errant senators on
attaching scores of amendments he judged neither "dire" nor
an "emergency."
   The Senate bill goes further as well in rearranging
Pentagon expenditures. Altogether $2.86 billion would be cut
from defense appropriations, both to offset domestic spending
and to allow money to be shifted to faster-spending military
personnel accounts. The end result, after the $1.5 billion
across-the-board Gramm-Rudman cut last winter, would reduce
Pentagon appropriations to about $281.5 billion or below
fiscal 1989's level of $282.2 billion.
   Apart from these fiscal issues, the bill has become
entangled in a long-running dispute over federal restrictions
on the District of Columbia's use of its local funds to
finance abortions for poor women. President Bush twice vetoed
attempts last year to modify the current law. And when Senate
liberals renewed the challenge this spring, conservatives
countered with an amendment that would at the same time
impose the death penalty in drug-related murders.
   Abortion-rights advocates have said they will continue to
fight for their provision. But Washington Mayor Marion Barry
Jr. this week wrote the chairman of the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee overseeing the city's budget asking that the
language be withdrawn. "The price for enhancing home rule on
the issue of locally funded abortions -- acceptance of the
death penalty in the District -- is too great to endorse,"
Mr. Barry wrote.
