   LONDON -- Grand Metropolitan PLC's pretax profit jumped
36% in the six months ended March 31, helped by strong
results from its Pillsbury Co. and Burger King Corp. units.
   The British food-and-drinks concern posted pretax profit
of #409 million ($685 million) in the fiscal first half, up
from #301 million in the year-earlier period. Chairman Allen
Sheppard said the better-than-expected performance of
Pillsbury and Burger King "has reinforced our conviction that
the acquisition will be earnings-positive in its first full
financial year." Grand Met bought the Pillsbury food group,
including its Burger King fast-food chain, for $5.75 billion
in January 1989.

   Although Grand Met's first-half earnings exceeded
analysts' forecasts, the company's shares fell on London's
Stock Exchange yesterday against an overall rising market.
Grand Met shares traded late yesterday at 574 pence ($9.61),
down 13.
   Analysts attributed the decline to concerns about Grand
Met's debt level after the Pillsbury acquisition, and to fear
of so-called mad-cow disease. Shares in U.K. food companies
have generally slipped this week amid reports that British
cattle are infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
BSE. Worries about the disease, which causes cattle to
stagger and foam at the mouth, have prompted some U.K.
schools and hospitals to cut beef from their menus.
   British government officials contend that U.K. beef is
safe to eat. Ian Martin, chief executive officer of Grand
Met's food sector, told a news conference yesterday that the
company already uses mostly non-British beef in its U.K.
chain of Berni steakhouses. But Mr. Martin said that Grand
Met is watching the situation closely, and if necessary could
find alternative supplies for British beef within two days.
He added that it was too early to say whether the steakhouses
have suffered any decline in business because of the scare.
   Grand Met's net profit attributable to shareholders,
including extraordinary items, rose 8% to #781 million from
#723 million. Per-share earnings climbed 25% to 28.6 pence
from 22.9 pence. Sales rose 23% to #4.97 billion from #4.04
billion; sales from continuing operations rose 42% to #4.7
billion from #3.3 billion.
   The fiscal first-half results were raised by property
sales, which earned a profit of #44 million, more than double
the #21 million earned from property sales a year earlier.
Grand Met also had an extraordinary gain of #499 million
arising from the sale of its William Hill and Mecca
betting-parlor operations, down from the #518 milion in
extraordinary gains a year earlier.
   Some analysts expressed disappointment at the scale of
property-sale profit and extraordinary gains. But they
generally agreed that Grand Met's core businesses are
operating well.

   I should like to propose a solution to the fight over
preserving Lockwood, the Virginia farmhouse where Gen. Robert
E. Lee spent several nights before a crucial battle to defend
Richmond (page one, April 18).
   While the illustration accompanying the article showed a
very simple, pretty house, the description of its current
state revealed a dilapidation and overwhelming invasion of
termites that would make it absurdly expensive to restore and
maintain. I therefore propose putting a historical marker on
the site of Lockwood and making sure that any available
photographs or other illustrations of the place as it was in
Gen. Lee's day are included in the Virginia Historical
Society's collection.

   I must say to J. Stewart Bryan III, whose company Media
General Inc. is threatening to tear down the structure, that
it is unfortunate he does not see the true importance of
preservation. His family may have been in the forefront of
the preservation movement in Virginia, but in demolishing
this historic home, he will single-handedly wipe out his
family's philanthropic beliefs in saving American heritage.
   What will future generations glean from our past societies
if all they have to experience is the Breakers, Biltmore and
Monticello? I would hope that Mr. Bryan can put aside his
mortal reasoning and present to my children's children a
piece of vernacular American history when they travel down a
Virginia road someday.

   Please be advised that the Commonwealth of Virginia is
rich in most of God's blessings, and beautiful homes of
historical significance are no exception. Should anyone
attempt to damage Westover, Berkeley, Carter's Grove,
Prestwould, Monticello, Mount Vernon, Sherwood Forest,
Shirley Plantation, Stratford Hall, etc., then I would wager
the Bryan family would lead the troops in a successful
defense. However, for Lockwood?

   Basis of Fed's Oversight of Bank Firms
   May Be Questioned in Wake of Ruling
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court decision this week
dealt a significant blow to the Federal Reserve Board's
regulatory power and may raise questions about the basis of
some other important tools the Fed uses in overseeing
bank-holding companies.
   The decision, handed down by the appeals court in New
Orleans, invalidated the Fed's "source-of-strength" policy,
under which bank-holding companies are required to help their
ailing bank subsidiaries by providing them with cash or other
assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling doesn't by any means leave the bank-holding
companies unregulated by the Fed. And last year's savings and
loan association bailout bill makes the companies'
subsidiaries liable for losses to the government from other
banking subsidiaries. However, the decision is a major
setback to the Fed's moves in recent years to expand the
purview of its regulation from the holding company to the
entire banking organization.
   The decision came in a challenge by MCorp, a Dallas
bank-holding company. The government took over 20 failed
MCorp subsidiaries last year, at an expected cost of $2
billion, and the Fed moved against MCorp to recoup some of
the losses. But the New Orleans court said the Fed's reach
didn't extend that far.
   "The Fed must be reeling from this," said Robert Litan, a
banking expert at the Brookings Institution here. "They've
often trotted this policy out as an arm twister."
   "It's a significant loss for the Fed," said Richard
Whiting, general counsel of the Association of Bank Holding
Companies. "I would assume they will appeal it." A spokesman
said the Fed wouldn't comment on the decision until the board
meets on the issue. The fifth circuit covers Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas, but the decision is sure to be cited
as a precedent in other circuits.
   Most holding companies do move to help troubled units, if
only because of public perception. "Most bankers regard
themselves as bound by the source-of-strength doctrine," said
Michael Bradfield, a former Fed general counsel who oversaw
an important 1987 Fed policy statement outlining the
doctrine.
   "Remember what Walter Wriston, the famous {former} head of
Citicorp said: `If Citicorp's name is on the door, I'm going
to bail it out no matter what the lawyers say,' " said Mr.
Bradfield, who also was involved in the MCorp case while he
was at the Fed.
   Some analysts believed the court decision ends uncertainty
over the limits of financial exposure for holding companies
that buy banks or thrifts. "A buyer would think he is buying
a big, black hole that could absorb his last penny," said
Karen Shaw of the Institute for Strategy Development, a
Washington consulting firm.
   Mr. Litan of Brookings also said the decision -- which
found that the Fed had gone too far in arguing that its legal
power to stop "unsafe and unsound" banking practices
supported the source-of-strength doctrine -- had implications
for the other important Fed powers, such as the capital
requirements that the Fed imposes on bankholding companies.
   The appeals court decision, by Judge W. Eugene Davis,
approvingly quoted a statement by the Shadow Financial
Regulatory Committee, a group of academics, bankers, and
attorneys, that "while Congress has empowered regulators of
banks to issue capital directives to the institutions in
their charge, it has not authorized the Fed to issue capital
directives to bankholding companies."
   But Mr. Whiting said the Fed maintains that legislation
going back more than 10 years supports its power to mandate
the capital requirements. And Mr. Bradfield, the former Fed
general counsel, said it was "comical" that the court quoted
the shadow committee, partly because John Hawke, a lawyer for
MCorp in the matter, is a member of the group. "I find it
strange that the court is quoting plaintiff's counsel as an
expert," he said. Mr. Hawke was out of the country and
couldn't be reached.
   While the Fed has rarely invoked the source-of-strength
policy explicitly, bank attorneys say the Fed has used the
threat of the policy as leverage to induce bankholding
companies to take various actions sought by the regulators.
   The appeals court left the Fed a loophole, Mr. Bradfield
said, in saying the Fed "could possibly" require holding
companies to maintain subsidiaries "to some degree of
financial soundness." But how such agreements would work in a
situation like MCorp's, in which the units no longer belong
to the holding company, is unclear.

   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's foreign trade surplus in April
narrowed to a preliminary 2.4 billion kronor ($398.9 million)
from 3.4 billion kronor in March, but widened from a surplus
of 1.6 billion kronor in April 1989, Statistics Sweden, the
national statistics agency, said.
   The latest surplus exceeded the two billion-krona average
prediction of analysts. Exports in April totaled 28.3 billion
kronor, down 4% from a year earlier, and imports amounted to
25.9 billion kronor, down 7%.

   PARIS -- French gross domestic product grew 1% in the
fourth quarter, following a 0.6% rate of expansion in the
third quarter, the National Statistics Institute said.
   For all of 1989, GDP was up 4%, higher than the 3.7%
growth rate previously estimated by Economy Minister Pierre
Beregovoy. The latest figures revise the GDP numbers
published in February, which showed a growth rate of 1.1% in
the fourth quarter and 0.4% in the third quarter. The
statistics agency said the latest figures take into account
definitive results for fourth-quarter industrial production,
which weren't available in February.

   Pick Up Pace of Talks

   TOKYO -- The Mitsubishi industrial group and Daimler-Benz
AG of West Germany are picking up the pace of their
discussions on global industrial cooperation.
   A spokesman for Mitsubishi Motors Corp. confirmed that
Daimler has contacted Mitsubishi Corp., the trading company
at the core of the Japanese conglomerate, about jointly
building a large auto plant in the Soviet Union.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the spokesman said that the talks were in the early
stages and that Mitsubishi hadn't any intention of producing
its own cars in the Soviet Union. "This is a subject to be
discussed in the future," he said. The Japanese press also
reported that the two companies are talking about producing
trucks in East Germany, but the Mitsubishi Motors spokesman
denied that any talks about such a project are under way.
   Mitsubishi Motors and Daimler also have agreed to research
jointly pollution-control devices for autos, the spokesman
said. But he played down the project's significance, saying
only that the two companies may exchange engineers.
   In March, the two concerns made headlines when they agreed
to discuss the prospect of cooperating in a range of
industries, including autos, aerospace and semiconductors.
Last month, Daimler and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.
agreed to conduct joint aerospace research.
   Meanwhile, Mitsubishi Motors confirmed it is looking into
the possibility of a joint venture with Chrysler Corp. in
Europe to produce autos. But the company said this is only
one of several possible ventures it is exploring with other
companies, including Volvo AB of Sweden and Renault of
France. Mitsubishi would be the last of the major Japanese
auto makers to establish a production base in Europe, and
many analysts expect the company to announce a venture later
this year.
   Daimler is said to be mapping out plans for growth ahead
of the scheduled unification of markets by the end of 1992 by
members of the European Community, and cooperation with the
Mitsubishi group could be part of these plans.

   Western Union
   Deficit Widened
   In First Quarter

   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., which has been struggling
to avoid bankruptcy, reported significantly wider losses and
lower revenue for the first quarter.
   The company had a loss of $18.1 million compared with a
$189,000 deficit in the year-earlier period. If undeclared
dividends on preferred shares are included, the company's net
loss was $29.5 million, or 37 cents a common share, against
$13.5 million, or 32 cents a share, in last year's first
quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These numbers are based on an average 80.7 million shares
in this year's first quarter because of the continuing
conversion of Western Union's Class B convertible preferred
shares into common, compared with the average 42.6 million
common shares outstanding in last year's quarter.
   Revenue fell 8.2% to $144.7 million from $158.2 million.
   A company spokesman pegged the wider losses to "a
continued steep decline in our telex revenues, higher
interest expenses and higher operating expenses in our
Financial Services unit . . . particularly from higher fees
and commissions paid to agents of our money transfer and bill
payment services."
   Broken down, Business Services revenue from telex,
electronic mail and Mailgram fell 21%, to $66.1 million from
$83.5 million a year ago. This was primarily due to a
"precipitous" drop in telex revenue of about 33% in the
quarter, said the spokesman. But he added that revenue from
electronic mail, which Western is counting on to pick up the
slack, grew 25%. Financial services, including Money
Transfer, voice messaging, telegram and bill payments rose
11% to $7.9 million in the quarter.
   Meanwhile, Western Union's bid, filed last month, to
recapitalize its debt and issue new common stock has yet to
clear the Securities and Exchange Commission, the spokesman
said. The company has said that it may be forced to seek
protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if the plan doesn't
go through.
   Western Union wants to issue new debt securities to
holders of its senior secured reset notes due Dec. 15, 1992,
which currently carry an interest payment of 19.25%, and to
holders of its 16% notes due June 15, 1991. It is also
seeking to reclassify its preferred stock and the Class B
common shares held by its primary owner Brooke Partners
Limited Partnership into new common shares.
   In its quarterly report to the SEC, Western Union said
that if it can't find sufficient funds to make a $51 million
interest payment due June 15 on its reset notes it could be
forced into a default.

   WESTERN UNION Corp.'s financial-services revenue grew 11%
to $78.6 million. The figure was misstated in yesterday's
edition. In addition, the company said it no longer plans to
reclassify the Class B common shares held by Brooke Partners
Limited Partnership into new common shares.

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany announced twin
programs to subsidize East Germany's industrial
restructuring, including a two-year system of bonuses for
foreign commercial investment beginning July 2, the planned
date for merging the two German economies.
   The unveiling of the subsidy programs came one day after
Bonn and West Germany's 11 states agreed to issue debt for
the creation of a 115 billion mark ($69.99 billion) German
Unity Fund to rescue East Germany's rapidly disintegrating
state economy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Suddenly rushing out East German relief programs after
weeks of murky deliberations, Bonn is preparing for the
signing of the state treaty on German monetary and economic
union by the two German finance ministers in Bonn tomorrow.
East Berlin had pressed Bonn to sweeten its offer before
surrendering sovereignty over monetary and fiscal policies to
Bonn as a prelude to reunification.
   Bonn Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann unveiled a
program with an initial allocation of seven billion marks to
fund the modernization of East German state enterprises.
Fearing mass unemployment, East Germany predicts that
two-thirds of its industry desperately needs bridging aid to
survive the shift to a free market following monetary union.
Bonn also is offering to send financial specialists to judge
which East German enterprises are salvageable.
   Mr. Haussmann also proposed a two-year program under which
foreign commercial investments in East Germany would receive
a 12% bonus on their investments in the year ending July 1,
1991, and an 8% bonus in the second year ending July 1, 1992.
   Unlike the industry programs, the German Unity Fund is to
be separate from the federal budget. In furnishing more
details on the 4 1/2-year funding plan, Finance Minister Theo
Waigel said the federal government and the states will share
equally the burden of raising 95 billion marks in the West
German capital markets. The fund will be topped off by a
total contribution of 20 billion marks from federal budget
cuts through 1994.
   The unity fund's assets will go toward covering East
Germany's widening budget deficits, which are expected to
reach about 30 billion marks in the second half of this year
and 50 billion marks in 1991, as the country's skidding
economy lifts the costs of welfare and unemployment programs.
Mr. Waigel said the Bonn government also will craft a
supplementary 1990 budget to transfer three billion marks
into East Germany's welfare budget, a step that could be
repeated next year.
   The unity fund itself will begin transferring funds to
East Germany with a 22 billion-mark allocation this year. The
payouts are to continue with 35 billion marks in 1991, 28
billion marks in 1992, 20 billion marks in 1993 and 10
billion marks in 1994.
   Mr. Waigel said the fund's interest service and principal
will be borne equally by the federal and state governments,
both of which could face interest service reaching 4.75
billion marks a year by 1995. The finance minister said the
debt load could be covered later by the higher tax revenue
expected from a growing pan-German economy.
   Financial markets watched closely as Bonn rolled out its
funding programs this week, looking particularly for details
on the form of the credit-financing for the unity fund. The
Finance Ministry said that details aren't set but that the
funds will be raised in the long-term domestic capital
markets.
   "It would make sense for them to begin issuing longer-term
government debt with 30-year maturities, as many other
governments already do," Steve Major, a bond analyst for
UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew in London, said. He observed that Bonn's
debt as a percentage of gross national product is projected
at a low 1.5% this year, with the economy expanding a brisk
4% clip, after accounting for inflation. "The market should
be able to absorb it," he said.
   Analysts said anticipation of a heavy flow of new
government borrowing had been factored into capital-markets
prices and interest rates since January, when the costs of
German unity already began taking on massive proportions.
   Bonn estimates that the combined budget deficits of the
two German nations could swell to 100 billion marks next
year. But so far, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has
excluded tax increases as a funding source.

   Landmark Retains
   Salomon to Study
   Firm's Possible Sale

   Landmark Land Co. said it retained Salomon Brothers Inc.
to explore a possible sale of the company, one week after its
proposed $967 million land sale was thwarted by federal
authorities.
   The Carmel, Calif., company, which owns its real estate
through its New Orleans-based Oak Tree Savings, said last
week that the Office of Thrift Supervision had objected to
its plan to finance 75% of the real estate sale to California
developer Barry G. Hon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday it said it would instead sell just one
development to Mr. Hon for $275 million, and that it would
explore restructuring or selling the entire company.
   Landmark said it would realize a $170 million pretax
profit if the sale to Mr. Hon closes. Landmark Chairman
Gerald G. Barton said that while the Office of Thrift
Supervision hadn't explicitly approved the transaction, he
believed the sale fell within federal guidelines.
   The OTS had objected to the previous agreement with Mr.
Hon, because the transaction would have committed more than
20% of Landmark's assets to a single borrower.
   The possible sale of Landmark is a direct result of the
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
of 1989, which tightened restrictions on savings and loan
associations' ownership of real estate.
   The company is best known for its ownership and management
of golf resorts, including PGA West, La Quinta and Mission
Hills, all located in the Palm Springs area. Salomon Bros.'
managing director in charge of real estate, J. Steven
Manolis, said the company's real estate and golf management
could be attractive to Japanese buyers. But in the past six
months, Japanese interests have generally shunned
high-profile U.S. real estate deals, partly because of
anti-Japanese sentiment.
   Mr. Barton said it was possible a single buyer such as Mr.
Hon, a Southern California home builder and land developer,
would emerge to purchase the company's real estate, and a
different investor would wind up owning Oak Tree Savings.
   Landmark, which has only eight million shares outstanding,
is 28%-owned by Mr. Barton and 24%-owned by Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd., the Toronto conglomerate controlled by the
Reichmann brothers.
   In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Landmark
stock rose 50 cents a share to $10.875.

   `Complex' Sculpture: Green Galleries for Alice Aycock

   Mountainville, N.Y. -- Michael Chuney, a teacher at
Newburgh's North Junior High School, hoisted his video camera
on his shoulder and ambled over to the 23-foot pinwheel that
stood on a patch of raw dirt overlooking Schunemunk Mountain.
Mr. Chuney aimed his camera at the wheel and the two men
perched on top of a noisy forklift maneuvering a set of
bright metal rays into position. Then he focused on the woman
in a pink T-shirt and paint-spattered purple cords standing
nearby.
   "That's a really nice piece of art," he said, as sculptor
Alice Aycock dragged on a Marlboro Light. "It's a metaphor
for what -- the world?"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Chuney hadn't seen anything yet. "Fantasy Sculpture
I," the latest attraction at Storm King Art Center, a
400-acre Hudson Valley sculpture park here in the mid-Hudson
Valley about 60 miles north of New York City, still didn't
have its "constellation" wheel dotted with zodiac-configured
holes. And work had yet to begin on its three-tiered "house"
boasting 12 copper gables, eight fortune-telling spheres,
four miniature bridges, two weeping white birch trees and a
tidy picket fence.
   By the time "Complex Visions: Sculpture and Drawings by
Alice Aycock" opens Monday for a long summer stay that will
last until Halloween, the best part of the show may already
be over. For the past two weeks, the 44-year-old Ms. Aycock,
whose eccentric constructions evoke everything from ancient
mazes and tombs to Cuisinarts and Magic 8-Balls, turned this
manicured, mostly outdoor museum into her
studio-away-from-home. Camping out on sleeping bags in an art
center guest house and consuming impressive quantities of
coffee, deli sandwiches and sunscreen, the sculptor and her
five-member team set to work on the patio.
   Although a number of indoor sculptures and works on paper
will be featured in this biggest-ever exhibition of her work,
Ms. Aycock's extravagant visions have maximum elbow room in
her larger outdoor works, which the art center's rolling
acres of lawn, pasture and woodland showcase to great effect.
Along with "Fantasy Sculpture," a new work created especially
for the exhibition, the show includes "The Machine that Makes
the World," a 1979 boatlike oblong of wooden mazes and
guillotinelike steel gates, and "Low Building with Dirt Roof
(For Mary)," a field-stone shack that measures just 30 inches
at its highest point.
   "There is on my part an attempt to create these fantastic
spaces that don't exist in the world per se, or to suggest
those spaces," Ms. Aycock explained.
   Recreating those fantasies at Storm King wasn't easy.
Boxed and bubble-wrapped sculptures were unpacked to reveal
joints that had popped after years of storage, while new
pieces didn't fit together as planned. Some things had been
left behind in the studio; others didn't make it at all.
Manhattan thieves helped themselves to glass panels from "The
Universal Stirrer," as the disassembled 1984 work sat on the
back of a moving van bound for Storm King. Designs for new
panels had to be hastily drafted and rushed to a Brooklyn
glass factory.
   Apart from "Threefold Manifestation II," a steel sculpture
that has sat placidly in one of Storm King's fields since it
was donated to the museum in 1987, most of the works featured
here had to be put together on the spot -- or built from the
ground up. Ms. Aycock first created "Low Building" on a
Pennsylvania farm field in 1973 as a tomblike memorial for a
niece who died at the age of 12. The original work may no
longer exist. It was sold along with the farm land it
occupied to International Business Machines Corp. in 1979. A
company spokesman said there is no record of the sculpture on
the property.
   So Ms. Aycock worked from the original plans and
photographs, bringing in stone from a quarry near Storm King
and tons of bagged topsoil to pour on the slanted roof.
Although the sculptor was all for recreating the work in one
of Storm King's pastures, that plan was nixed by the museum's
director, David Collens, who argued that few people would
visit "Low Building" if they had to hike there. So the
sculpture now sits on a neat and very public patch of grass
just off Storm King's patio, a far cry from the lonely
alfalfa field of its debut.
   To bring the work more into harmony with its lawn-lined
environment, Ms. Aycock decided to plant the topsoil roof
with the same grass seed that covers the lawn. And a small
opening has been left in one of the field-stone walls with a
view of the distant mountains, bringing the visitor closer to
a less-cultivated landscape.
   With its tons of dirt and roughly mortared walls, "Low
Building" still strikes a strange note in the midst of Storm
King's tony "green galleries," which showcase 110 works by
sculptors such as Alexander Calder, David Smith and Isamu
Noguchi.
   And then there is Storm King's greatest work of art, the
grounds themselves, which owe their gently sculpted curves
not to nature, but ingenious landscapers. As Ms. Aycock
assembled her "Fantasy Sculpture," bulldozers in the valley
below were plowing earth into a flat terrace for another
showplace for works from the center's permanent collection.
Mr. Collens, who may be the only museum director in New York
state to wear a walky-talky to work, regularly tours the
grounds by foot and by Jeep to "site" sculptures, which are
occasionally plucked by forklift from established settings
and transferred to more appropriate hills and dales. As for
the grass, a four-member crew makes sure that the lawns stay
at their regulation twoinch height (three in the winter) and
that the pastures maintain a rustic-but-tidy look.
   Ms. Aycock's "Fantasy Sculpture I," which contains
allusions to 18th-century stage sets (the rough wooden slats
at the base), Eastern images of heaven (the 12-sided copper
roof), 15th-century palindromes (elliptical phrases such as
"to cause cataclysms" printed under the eaves), and Magic
8-Balls (large white spheres implanted with spinners reading
"yes," "no," "maybe" and "ask again"), is a response to this
planned greenery.
   "I wanted to add myself to this sense of the garden -- not
in a wild, rambling way, but to the garden that this is," she
said as one of the art center's three lawn mowers cut neat
swaths of grass under a nearby Calder stabile. "It's
emblematic -- a temple to the sky or the sun, or a garden
folly . . . or a teahouse in an 18th-century garden."
   At some points during its installation, "Fantasy
Sculpture" seemed more of a folly than perhaps the sculptor
had intended. Although Ms. Aycock had decided to simplify
matters by eliminating the "hanging doors" that would have
made the structure seem to float over the ground, there were
still some annoying setbacks. After spending half a day
painstakingly attaching the steel-tipped rays, the crew
realized each panel was 1/16 of an inch too wide, and all had
to be taken down again. The names of punched-out
constellations (and mixed-up versions, formed by a
marble-toss game) had been stenciled a fraction too high to
show through the pinwheel's open window. And then the pear
tree that had been chosen to top off the work suddenly looked
too tall and scrawny, requiring a trip to the nursery to
select two suitably pliant and leafy birches.
   However, when the last rock and trailing branch had been
put in place, "Fantasy Sculpture I" was every bit the
spectacle Ms. Aycock intended, with darts of sunlight
streaming through the constellation cut-outs and glinting off
the copper roof. But even as Mr. Collens and a
relievedlooking Peter Stern, Storm King's president,
congratulated her, Ms. Aycock was already thinking of other
last-minute details. No one knew it yet, but plans were under
way to bring a live pigeon for "How to Catch and Manufacture
Ghosts," a 1979 indoor assemblage of pulleys, platforms,
water and a homemade battery. And soap bubbles, of course.
   "Someone will have to sit there and blow bubbles," she
said. "I definitely think it has to be operated in that way."

   Nazi Hypothermia Study
   Is Useless, Surgeon Says

<LP>
   Results from the infamous Nazi medical experiments at
Dachau to see how much cold the human body could withstand
are scientifically useless, a Harvard Medical School surgeon
said.
   The surgeon, Robert L. Berger, reported that he had
examined the surviving Nazi report on the experiments in
which Dachau prisoners were immersed in tanks of ice water
under various conditions. It is believed that as many as 300
male prisoners were subjected to the experiments, of whom 80
to 90 died.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an article in this week's New England Journal of
Medicine, Dr. Berger said he undertook the examination
because of a long-simmering debate over whether scientists
should use the results of the experiments despite their
atrocious nature. Some physiologists claim the results might
help advance research on the body's response to cooling --
hypothermia -- and thus save lives. But others, like Arnold
Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine,
advocate a total ban on using the Nazi results because the
experiments were "a gross violation of human standards."
   Dr. Berger wrote that the 56-page report to SS
Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler on the results of the Dachau
experiments was "riddled with inconsistencies" and contained
evidence of data falsification and fabrication. "On analysis,
the Dachau hypothermia study has all the ingredients of a
scientific fraud, and rejection of the data on purely
scientific grounds is inevitable. They cannot advance science
or save human lives," the surgeon wrote.

   SEOUL, South Korea -- Kim Young Ki is a national hero in
Korea. The scrawny 51-year-old shopkeeper earned the
adulation of his countrymen by setting a world pushup record
last summer. As hundreds of supporters cheered him on in the

   But that wasn't enough for Mr. Kim. He wanted to prove

strength and stamina. So he went on to set two more world
records -- for one-finger chin-ups (16) and two-finger

it gets the respect it deserves from the rest of the
developed world. Many here think the cure for a poor image is
to snare world records. "The more records we have leads to
world power," says Ji Young Mo.
   Mr. Ji is the director of Korea Guinness Association, an
organization formed last year for the sole purpose of getting
Korean feats and records recognized by the Guinness Book of
World Records. Some 3,000 members pay $50 a year to support
the association's efforts, which include sending teams of
certifiers from town to town in search of the extraordinary.
   Among the world records in which the association takes
pride: The tiny village of Chungchun in Chonam province, with
275 families, has 38 sets of twins. (University researchers
haven't yet come up with any explanation.) The Lotte World
Hotel has the world's largest chandelier in its lobby; it
weighs 10.5 tons and holds 700 lightbulbs. And the
Unification Church's Rev. Sun Myung Moon performed the
largest mass wedding ceremony when he married 6,516 couples
from 83 countries at a barley-cola bottling plant near Seoul.
   Few things surprise the people at Guinness, and
understandably so for the arbiters of such things as
eel-eating contests. But even they admit to being somewhat
taken aback by the effort. Korea's record-setting mania is
"rather unique," says Donald McFarlan, editor of the
London-based record book. "I know they are very determined."
   In only a year, Korea has managed to get 19 records listed
in the Guinness Book; it hadn't had any before that. Korea
does take some liberties in claiming records, however. Among
the 19 is one for the world's tallest hotel, the 73-story
Westin Stamford in Raffles City, Singapore. Korea believes it
can claim the credit because a Korean construction firm built
it.
   In any case, Mr. Ji believes South Korea will have enough
records by the end of the year to put it within striking
distance of its arch-rival, Japan, which has about 50. "We
need to have more than Japan to prove that we are better than
they are," he says.
   Achieving Guinness greatness is just a matter of having
the right attitude, Mr. Ji adds. Mr. Kim, the push-up
champion also known as Korea's Popeye, says he was sustained
during the marathon, despite the pain of his ulcers, by the
thought that he would snatch the record from an Englishman.
"He has a strong will to beat foreigners," Mr. Ji says.
   Mr. Ji's dream is to best the U.S., currently the champion
Guinness record-setter with 250. Americans are big on food
feats. Selinsgrove, Pa., for instance, won the distinction of
being a town of world-class jerks. Soda, that is. Two years
ago, residents created the longest banana split: 4.55 miles.
   Korea's passion for records was ignited during the 1988
Summer Olympics in Seoul, which the nation saw as an
opportunity to showcase its economic, cultural and athletic
achievements. The Games gave the nation its first records --
the most competitors in an Olympics, 9,302; the most nations
competing, 160; and, for the opening ceremonies, the world's
biggest drum. The Games whetted the Koreans' appetite for
more records.
   Mr. Ji, 33, is consumed by the quest. From a dingy office
here, the former television sportscaster spends his days
seeking records and getting them certified. He is anxiously
awaiting word from Guinness on a man who claims to have
written 243 Chinese characters on a grain of rice.
   Mr. Ji has learned, to his dismay, that Guinness is tough
to satisfy. It wants records that are measurable and
comparable. Events have to be witnessed by an independent
adult and corroborated by press coverage. And it refuses to
certify stunts it considers "gratuitously dangerous." Mr. Ji
recently sought certification for a seven-year-old boy who
pulled a car with his teeth. But the Guinness people refused,
in part because the feat wasn't "wholesome."
   To encourage competition, Mr. Ji hosts meets at which
people vie to set records. Some 5,000 onlookers showed up at
a meet last fall to witness, among other things, a man bounce
a soccer ball off his head for 5 hours, 6 minutes and 30
seconds. He set a record, but a few months later, it was
broken. Scheduled for the next meets are such events as an
onion-peeling competition, a race in which contestants
balance eggs on spoons, and a bubble-gum blowing contest.
   Foreigners aren't welcome. Michael Skowron, a German
language teacher in Seoul, found out the hard way when he
sought to compete in a "vertical marathon," a race up 52
flights of stairs in Seoul's World Trade Center. The winner
would be sent to the world championships in Singapore. The
Koreans initially barred Mr. Skowron and an American from the
race, but relented after the pair protested. "They told us,
`You can compete, but you can't win,'" Mr. Skowron recalls.
   The Koreans have had some disappointments in their quest
for records. Earlier this year, Mr. Ji sought certification
for the rock with the biggest natural hole (1.9 meters by 1.1
meters). But Guinness didn't have such a category, and it
refused to consider the entry. And Pohang Steel, the world's
biggest steelmaker in 1988, lost that title to its Japanese
nemesis, Nippon Steel, last year.
   Korea would easily win some records, if it cared to submit
them to Guinness. Press reports suggest that Korea uses more
tear gas than any other country -- to quell
ever-demonstrating students and laborers. And Korea's per
capita consumption of garlic and red pepper is generally
acknowledged to be world class. But neither of those are
likely to show up in the record book any time soon.
   "The Guinness people are always asking us whether the
Koreans eat the most dogs," says Mr. Ji, who adds that he
wouldn't consider documenting a record that didn't burnish
the nation's image. "I try to find good things."

   Report Details Accounting Sloppiness
   At Unit of First Executive in Mid-80s
   ----

   LOS ANGELES -- Accounting systems at a First Executive
Corp. insurance unit were so sloppy in the mid-80s that
regulators had trouble confirming the unit's billions of
dollars in insurance reserves, according to a report by the
New York state insurance department.
   The study of the struggling First Executive's New York
unit resulted in a recent fine and unearthed a welter of
problems said to have plagued the unit from at least 1983 to
1986, the official period of the examination. Of late, First
Executive has become the focus of intense scrutiny because of
its junk bond holdings and apparent concerns about its
financial health.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since the period of the examination, conditions seem to
have improved markedly at Executive Life Insurance Co. of New
York, according to Terence Lennon, assistant deputy
superintendent and chief examiner of the New York Insurance
Department.
   The New York department currently is auditing the company
for the three years ended Dec. 31, 1989, a study that won't
be finished for many months. But Mr. Lennon said he thinks
the results will be more straight-forward than the previous
examination. "Right now, the company is obviously under
stress, but the reserves you are looking at {in the company}
are real," he said. It often takes months or even years from
the time an audit is completed to the time it is released and
any action is taken.
   The recently filed report, however, said that during the
period of the examination Executive Life of New York had more
than $288 million of insurance policies lingering on the
books without appropriate reserves in so-called "suspense"
accounts, where new business awaited processing for months
and even years. The insurer also was found to have
inappropriately claimed $148 million of reinsurance and to
have boosted a variety of other detailed accounts by millions
of dollars.
   Last month, First Executive's New York unit admitted a
portion of the insurance law violations alleged in the study.
The violations involved reinsurance, bonuses to sales agents,
and impeding the examination itself. The company paid a
$25,000 fine, a small levy that, in part, took into account
the parent company's current plight, regulators said.
   Ronald L. Kehrli, president and chief executive officer of
Executive Life of New York, says the company's accounting
systems in mid-decade were strained by a surge in business.
"The systems we had in place, quite honestly, weren't able to
handle the volume." Mr. Kehrli said a torrent of about $800
million in new business came into the New York unit that
year. He said that less than $1 million remains in suspense
accounts awaiting processing.
   One industry analyst said that First Executive's unit may
have gotten off very lightly. "The examiners' criticisms were
so strong that the company is fortunate to have retained its
license to operate in New York," says Joseph M. Belth,
professor of insurance at the University of Indiana and
editor of the Insurance Forum, an industry publication. Mr.
Belth has voiced frequent criticism of First Executive.
   First Executive is confronting depressed values in its big
portfolio of high-risk, high-yield "junk" bonds, as well as
concerns by policyholders about its financial health. It
operates through two principal units: California-based
Executive Life Insurance Co., with $12.39 billion in assets
at March 31, and Executive Life of New York, with assets of
$3.69 billion as of the same date.
   First Executive said earlier this week that it paid more
than $1.33 billion in the first quarter to holders who had
surrendered insurance policies and annuities. But it added
that surrender requests had slowed last month and this. The
company also reported first quarter net income of $45.4
million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $554.5 million,
compared with a loss in the year-ago period.
   But looking at the 1986 accounts, New York regulators
found much to question. So murky was the accounting that it
was impossible "to determine with any reasonable degree of
certainty, the total liability reported at year-end {in 1986}
on any given policy or contract issued by the company," the
report said.
   It wasn't the first time Executive Life of New York had
run afoul of regulators. The New York department in 1987
levied a $250,000 fine -- equal to its largest ever -- on the
First Executive unit for violating a variety of insurance
laws, notably sections covering reinsurance.
   Not long after the 1987 fine and in the midst of the
troubled 1986 examination, First Executive put its New York
unit on the block. However, an agreement to sell the unit to
closely held WW Acquisition Corp. for about $460 million fell
through in January.
   There were estimates when First Executive offered to sell
the New York unit that it might bring in $600 million or
more. But that figure proved optimistic, perhaps because of
some of the problems regulators encountered in the 1986
examination. Among other things, examiners reported that 46%
of the company's bonds and short-term investments were not
only junk bonds by regulatory definition, but "below average
quality" within that definition.
   The auditors' analysis was hampered by the company's
demand that all questions be submitted in writing. "Many
answers were incomplete and some were unresponsive," says the
report. Executive Life of New York's Mr. Kehrli says the
order for written queries was "intended to facilitate the
examination, not prevent it."
   Often the examination uncovered relatively small but
nagging discrepancies. At one point, auditors found credits
and debits for company agents' balances reported at a total
of $10.3 million -- or roughly double what they should have
been. The company wasn't able to explain the difference.
Another time, the value of bonds was found to be overstated
by several million dollars, representing a total of seven
accounting errors.
   In all, New York state auditors said $272 million should
have been swept from Executive Life of New York's surplus
account. If done, the cut would have put the company's
statutory "surplus" account in the red. But the department
cut the recommended reduction itself by $110 million, after
which the adjusted statutory surplus was a bare $23.3 million
for the 1986 year end. The final, adjusted net worth included
a $130 million infusion from First Executive's California
unit in February, 1987.
   In February, the California unit made another $50 million,
bringing the statutory surplus to $147.8 million.

   TORONTO -- Varity Corp. said it proposed to amalgamate the
operations of Kelsey-Hayes Canada and its Kelsey-Hayes unit
in a transaction valued at about C$36 million.
   Varity said it plans to offer the minority shareholders of
Kelsey-Hayes Canada either C$20 (US$17.01) a share or a yet
to be determined number of Varity common shares for their
holdings in the Canadian unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At last report, minority shareholders own about about 1.8
million shares of Kelsey-Hayes Canada, or about 27.3% of the
total number of shares outstanding.
   A spokesman for Varity said the proposal is "a logical
extension" of Varity's acquisition last year of Detroit-based
K-H Corp., the parent of Kelsey-Hayes Canada.
   Varity said it has retained Gordon Capital Corp. to review
the proposed amalgamation and to provide a fairness opinion
on the value of the Varity shares to be offered in exchange
for Kelsey-Hayes Canada shares.
   The companies said they expect that the amalgamation
couldn't occur before August.
   At least two-thirds of the shareholders of Kelsey-Hayes
Canada would need to approve the amalgamation at a special
meeting. Varity said Kelsey-Hayes Co. would vote its 72.7%
interest in favor of the amalgamation.
   Kelsey-Hayes Canada has formed a committee of independent
directors to review the proposal.

   NEW YORK -- American Insured Mortgage Investors, a real
estate investment program sponsored by Integrated Resources
Inc., said it is seeking to find a new lender for a mortgage
that represents 62% of its portfolio after the borrower
missed two interest payments.
   Integrated's AIM 84 partnership originated the $99.9
million mortgage, which is federally insured, on Windsor
Court, a high-rise rental apartment in Manhattan. AIM decided
to take the action in light of a soft real estate market that
caused the borrower, Mastic Associates, to miss two interest
payments totaling $1.9 million. The remainder of the
portfolio, which totaled $166 million, includes 20 other
mortgages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thomas M. Finn, chief financial officer of AIM Capital
Management Corp., the managing general partner, said AIM 84
would distribute proceeds of the sale to investors in a range
it estimated at $9 to $10 per unit. Investors would continue
to hold an interest in the remainder of the portfolio, which
Mr. Finn said now totals $18 per unit. The partnership, which
is publicly traded, was quoted at $14, up 50 cents, in
over-the-counter trading yesterday.
   If AIM 84 fails to sell the mortgage to a lender in 45 to
60 days, it plans to assign it to the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. In that case, AIM 84 would be entitled
to 99% of the mortgage, plus accrued interest minus one
month. Mr. Finn said AIM 84 is negotiating with a lender, but
there isn't any assurance the transaction will be completed,
or completed on these terms.
   Regardless of who is assigned the mortgage, investors will
lose the right to participate in the current cash flow or
residual value of the property.
   In addition, Integrated, which is operating under federal
bankruptcy-law protection, has been trying to sell its
general partnership interest in the AIM series of
partnerships through a court-approved auction. Mr. Finn said
the price Integrated could expect to receive "would be less"
as a result of the mortgage sale, but he didn't quantify the
impact.
   Integrated, which manages more than 600 partnerships, has
been trying to sell assets to satisfy creditors, who are owed
$1.8 billion. Integrated has said it would accept a minimum
bid of $40 million for its interest in four AIM partnerships
sold in the mid-1980s that raised a total of $789 million.

   TOKYO -- Production of crude steel in Japan in April
increased 0.2% to 9.1 million metric tons from a year
earlier, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. April
production fell 0.7% from 9.16 million tons in March, when
output was at record levels. Japanese steelmakers increased
their output in the month to meet continuing demand from the
construction sector. Demand for steels used in construction
expanded in April, compared with a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Strong capital investment by the private sector in Japan
is underpinning growth in basic industries such as steel.
Demand from other areas, such as the consumer goods industry,
also has kept production high in the past year.
   As of April, the Japanese economy had been expanding for
41 consecutive months, the third-longest period of continuous
expansion in the nation's history.

Steel Development Co. unit of Mitsui &amp; Co. of Japan and the
LTV Steel Co. unit of LTV Corp., Dallas, to construct and
operate two facilities capable of processing more than
500,000 tons of steel annually.
   Each of the partners is to own one-third of the joint
venture, said Timothy M. Graven, president of Steel
Technologies. He said the venture plans to spend $30 million
to $35 million to build and equip the facilities.

   He said the venture plans to have the facilities
constructed within 18 months. The facilities will be in the
Midwest, but Steel Technologies wasn't more specific.
   Steel Technologies, a processor of flat rolled steel, said
the facilities will use the latest technology in metal
processing, including slitting and cutting the steel to
length. They also will have the capacity to provide steel
storage of about one million tons a year for customers
requiring just-in-time delivery, Steel Technologies said.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Trading in the New Taiwan dollar
continued to be volatile Wednesday, one day after Taiwan's
central bank withdrew support for the unit. Analysts said the
currency is likely to remain shaky for several weeks.
   After a roller-coaster day of trading, the currency closed
in Taipei at NT$27.35 to one U.S. dollar, near its intraday
low but stronger than its close of NT$27.50 to the U.S.
dollar on Tuesday, when the Taiwanese currency plunged
approximately 4%, its sharpest fall since 1981.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a drop in stock prices and expectations of slower
economic growth increased pressure against the New Taiwan
dollar, the central bank had spent about US$6 billion to
support the currency this year. But in the final minutes of
trading Tuesday, the central bank pulled its support. Some
dealers said the bank joined speculators and started selling
New Taiwan dollars.
   Several dealers said there was no apparent intervention
Wednesday, but one report said the central bank sold
approximately US$40 million.
   Several dealers said the central bank's main goal is to
push out speculators because of concern they might shift
their attention to the foreign-exchange market from the
declining stock market. On Wednesday, share prices on the
local stock exchange plunged 6% in response to the New Taiwan
dollar's tumble.
   Officials of the central bank have been unavailable for
comment since Tuesday. On Sunday, the bank's governor, Samuel
Shieh, denied rumors that the currency was about to be
devalued.
   The U.S. has long urged Taiwan to let market forces,
rather than manipulation, rule foreign-exchange rates. In
April, the U.S. Treasury gave Taiwan improved marks for
allowing the rate to more closely follow the market. That is
just what Taiwan's central bank did Tuesday.
   Dealers said the New Taiwan dollar might rally a bit in
the next few days but is likely to consolidate around a rate
of NT$27 to the U.S. dollar for a few months while people
holding the currency evaluate changes in the country's
economy.

   SUPPORT FOR THE ECU

   A survey of European companies and banks found broad
support for elevating the European currency unit, or ECU, to
become the main currency for commerce within the European
Community.
   The study, sponsored by the Paris-based Association for
the Monetary Union of Europe, urged that in 1997 the ECU be
declared the sole currency in the EC, replacing the
currencies of the 12 member states. The study, covering 209
European companies and 47 banks, was conducted by Ernst &amp;
Young Management Consultants and the British-based National
Institute of Economic and Social Research.
   The ECU is a basket currency made up of weighted values of
12 currencies. Governments and international institutions
have occasionally issued ECU-denominated bonds, and certain
transactions are accounted for in the currency. But it hasn't
gained wide commercial use.
   Most of the companies surveyed expected significant
savings to result from a single currency. Companies could
eliminate the costs of hedging against currency fluctuations
and would have clearer information about prices and costs
throughout the EC, the study pointed out.
                                                                                                       

   A STRIKE IN PERU
                                                                                                       

   A strike this week by 12,000 workers of Peru's biggest
mining concern has cost at least $2.8 million, the
government-owned company said. The strike that began Monday
at Central Peru Mining Co., or Centromin, is "causing grave
and perhaps irreversible damage to {the company} and is
endangering its further operations," a company statement
said. The workers are demanding a 137% increase in their
wages, which inflation has shrunk to about $5 per day;
Centromin is offering a 90% increase.
                                                                                                       

   POLAROID IN MOSCOW
                                                                                                       

   Polaroid Corp. opened a new retail shop in Moscow that
will sell the company's cameras to Soviet citizens for
rubles. The cameras, assembled at a Soviet plant from
Polaroid parts, will sell for 250 rubles, about $405, with
instant film going for 30 rubles, a company spokesman said.
The new shop is a joint venture formed by Polaroid and the
Soviet Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industries. Sales were
expected to be about 10,000 cameras in the first year, a
Polaroid official said.
                                                                                                       

   SWITZERLAND AND THE IMF
                                                                                                       

   Switzerland said it will submit an application for
membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank. It said the decision to apply was made after Swiss
finance and monetary officials held exploratory discussions
with their counterparts in the Group of Ten industrial
countries, of which Switzerland is a member. The questions of

   Many Eastern European economies will weaken before they
gain strength, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said in a

Europeans' living standards rebounded from the damage
inflicted by longtime communist rule. "The region's economic
situation is deteriorating, and there is a prospect for deep
recession," said the report.

Qingdao International Seeds Co., will be established in
Qingdao sometime this summer and will be owned 45% by Kirin,
5% by Tokita Seeds Co. of Japan and 50% by Chinese interests.
The new company will grow vegetables and flowers and market

   Faced with a replay of last year's drought, France is
pouring a record 780 million francs ($141 million) into
fighting and preventing forest fires.
   The campaign has begun two months ahead of schedule
because water reserves are less than half those of an average
year, and 33,300 acres of forest have already burned this
year, though the official fire season hasn't begun.
   Half the money targets airborne protection from spotter
and water-bombing planes and helicopters. The rest covers
preventive measures such as clearing highly flammable
undergrowth.
   Though efforts focus on Southern France, the drought isn't
limited to the sunny Mediterranean. Normally soggy Lower
Normandy is restricting watering of gardens and golf courses,
and washing cars is temporarily banned.

   Australia's state-owned communications company OTC is
developing a computerized speech simulator with an Australian
accent. An OTC spokesman said current voice-reproduction
systems were generally of poor quality and tended to have
strong American accents. . . . Ireland's Family Planning
Association was fined $600 for selling condoms at a Virgin
Records store in Dublin. Under Irish law, condoms can be sold
only in drugstores and family-planning clinics. Richard
Branson, Virgin Records' British chief, said the Irish
government seemed "to be treating their citizens with the
same disregard as Ceausescu did in Romania."

   8% in Quarter;
   Stock Slips $1.875

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co. reported an 8%
decline in net income for its fiscal second quarter ended
April 30.
   Though the results were squarely in line with analysts'
expectations, Hewlett-Packard's stock skidded on the news,
closing down $1.875 at $46.125 in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said management's cautious
forecast of future business and the disclosure that the
company was losing share in the market for computer
workstations sent the stock tumbling.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The slip in workstations market share is particularly
worrisome since Hewlett-Packard recently was vying with Sun
Microsystems Inc. for the top spot in the segment. Last year,
Hewlett-Packard bought Apollo Computer Inc., its biggest
acquisition ever, with an eye toward commanding a sizable
share of the workstation business, which is growing rapidly.
   "From their comments, it's clear that Sun is gaining share
and IBM's entry {into the workstation business} is having an
impact on HP," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at First
Boston Corp., referring to comments made by Hewlett-Packard
executives yesterday during a conference call.
   Orders for Hewlett-Packard's personal computers also have
slowed and are flat compared with last year, Mr. Milunovich
said.
   Net income for the quarter totaled $186 million, compared
with $203 million in the year-ago period. The company had
per-share earnings of 78 cents, down 9% from 86 cents in the
year-ago quarter.
   Revenue for the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of
16% from the year-ago quarter.
   Hewlett-Packard, which makes medical equipment,
instruments and other electronic goods as well as computers,
blamed its lower earnings on a continuing shift in its
business that has made the company more reliant on sales of
lower-margin goods such as personal computers and printers.
The company said that, in response, it was moving to reduce
operating costs.
   For instance, in the second quarter the company said it
cut its world-wide work force of 93,000 by 1,000, mainly
through an early retirement program.
   The situation facing Hewlett-Packard is similar to that
facing International Business Machines Corp., Digital
Equipment Corp. and other makers of minicomputers. As prices
for computers decline sharply and minicomputers are replaced
by smaller, far less expensive machines, these firms are
stuck with large, costly direct sales forces that aren't any
longer efficient.
   While analysts said Hewlett-Packard is trying to cut
costs, they said the company isn't moving quickly enough.
They also don't expect any drastic moves any time soon.
   "Progress is slow," said Peter Rogers, an analyst at
Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. "This is another discouraging
quarter."
   In a statement, John Young, Hewlett-Packard's chief
executive officer, expressed caution about the outlook for
the second half of the company's fiscal year. He called the
company's results so far this year "mixed" and said that
"slower economic growth continues to be a concern in many of
the countries we serve."
   "My concern is there's a good chance you'll have a sharp
slowdown in {the company's} revenues growth in the second
half of year," said Mr. Milunovich. However, he said he
wouldn't cut his 1990 earnings estimate of $3.40 a share.

   Stride Rite's Jackson Again Resigns
   As President, Will Head Fisher-Price

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Stride Rite Corp. isn't likely to
offer Ronald J. Jackson a third shot at filling the boss's
shoes.
   Mr. Jackson, who has been president and chief executive
officer of the footwear retailer for just six months,
resigned to become president, chief executive officer and
chairman of Quaker Oats Co.'s Fisher-Price toy business,
which is scheduled to be spun off early next year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's not the first time that Mr. Jackson, 46 years old,
has left Stride Rite for top posts in the toy business. In
1985, after serving as the company's president and chief
operating officer for only five months, Mr. Jackson left to
become president and chief executive of Kenner Parker Toys.
   When he rejoined Stride Rite last November, Mr. Jackson
said he planned to stay longer than he did the first time
around, and this time he did, albeit only by about a month.
   "There were a lot of questions at the time of whether Ron
would do the same thing again. He reassured the board that
would not be happening," said Stride Rite's executive vice
president and treasurer, John J. Phelan. He added, "In the
words of that famous philosopher Yogi Berra, `It's deja vu
all over again.'"
   Mr. Jackson couldn't immediately be reached for comment
yesterday.
   Stride Rite Chairman Arnold Hiatt will assume the
responsibilities of chief executive on a temporary basis
while the company searches for a replacement. "Arnold told me
that in all of his corporate years, this has been one of the
most devastating things he's experienced," Mr. Phelan said.
   Mr. Phelan said the Fisher-Price offer is "a wonderful
opportunity" for Mr. Jackson, noting that he'll get the
chairman's post as well. "How often does something like that
happen?"
   In a statement, Mr. Jackson said leaving Stride Rite was
an "extremely difficult decision," and that the Fisher-Price
offer was "too good to turn down."
   Quaker last month said it planned to spin off troubled
Fisher-Price to shareholders in early 1991 in order to
concentrate on its other businesses. Under the plan,
Fisher-Price would operate as an independent, publicly traded
company.
   But some Wall Street analysts now suggest -- and Quaker
won't dismiss the possibility -- that Quaker may decide
instead to sell the beleaguered toy business, should it
receive an adequate offer.
   "There have been some additional inquiries since our
announcement," a Quaker spokesman said, adding that while a
sale was possible, "it's our feeling that a spin-off approach
still offers the most shareholder value and we are proceeding
with that as quickly as we can."
   Quaker also announced yesterday that E. Robert Kinney, a
former chairman and chief executive of General Mills Inc. and
former chairman of Kenner Parker, which General Mills once
owned, would serve on Fisher-Price's board.

   HONG KONG -- More than half of this colony's imports and
exports to China last year were related to outward
processing, according to a government survey released
Wednesday, providing the freshest evidence of the degree to
which Hong Kong's economy is integrated with the mainland.
   The study, which comes less than three weeks before
President Bush is to decide whether to renew China's
most-favored-nation trade status, indicates that 53% of the
colony's 1989 exports to China, or 76.87 billion Hong Kong
dollars (US$9.87 billion) out of a total of HK$145.05
billion, are sent for processing and then reimported into the
colony.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Business and industrial groups in Hong Kong have argued
that the colony would be badly hurt if the U.S. were to
rescind its most favorable import duties on Chinese
merchandise because of the local economy's mounting links
with southern China. President Bush has until June 3 to make
the decision, which could be rejected by Congress.

   Hands in the Quota Cookie Jar

   Earlier this year civil rights activists drafted a bill
that looked like a plaintiff's lawyer's wish list, and dubbed
it the Civil Rights Act of 1990. The bill (also known as the
Kennedy-Hawkins bill) made some reasonable proposals, but it
featured a devastating triple whammy that would have (1)
placed the burden of proof on employers with a racially (or
sexually) unbalanced workforce to prove that (2) all of their
employment practices were (3) "essential to effective job
performance." Since this is an almost impossible burden to
meet, the message to employers would have been clear: Hire by
quota or face expensive and burdensome lawsuits you almost
certainly cannot win.
   This surely not unintended effect was pointed out in the
ensuing public debate, and was emphasized by veto rumblings
from the executive branch. Rochefoucauld said that hypocrisy
is the homage vice pays to virtue. Caught with their hands in
the quota cookie jar (again), Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.,
Mass.), Rep. August Hawkins (D., Calif.) and other proponents
of the act changed "essential to effective job performance"
to "bears a substantial and demonstrable relationship to
effective job performance." Certainly this looks as if it
might take the quota heat off a little bit. And that is why
the friends of quotas could not really leave it at that. They
had to add that the employer trying to defend himself by this
standard must do so "by objective evidence."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now this innocent-sounding phrase (what could be wrong
about demanding objective evidence?) evidently got by a few
Republican lawmakers who were eager for peace on this front
and looking for a face-saving way to give in. But to
professionals in this field (and those who added those words
certainly are that) "objective evidence" has a technical and
lethal meaning: "objective evidence" means validation
studies. And validation studies are elaborate and costly
studies usually prepared by industrial psychologists on a
consultant basis. As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor pointed out
in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust in 1988, these can be
so burdensome that an employer would often rather flee to the
safe harbor of quota hiring than have to sponsor and pay for
such studies. (This reference to "objective evidence" is so
harsh, that one suspects a trick: it will be traded away
against a few more Republican defections, leaving behind the
phrase "substantial and demonstrable" to do the same work.)
   Add to this that Kennedy-Hawkins still puts the burden on
the employer and still does not require the plaintiff to
identify what practices he or she is complaining about. The
result is that an employer who has not met his quota must
prove by offering these expensive psychological studies that
virtually everything he does that might bear on the racial or
gender composition of his workforce "bears a substantial and
demonstrable relationship to effective job performance."
   Testifying in favor of the original version of
Kennedy-Hawkins, Ray Marshall, President Carter's secretary
of labor, who is not a lawyer and therefore a bit more
forthright about these things, let the cat out of the bag.
The quota pressures in the bill were no bad thing, he said,
because they would encourage employers to train the minority
employees they might otherwise not have hired. There are
several things wrong with that argument. First, it might not
work. Instead, employers might just take their jobs to Taiwan
or Mexico, or at any rate out of racially diverse labor
pools.
   But more important, if an employer is truly innocent of
discrimination, society has no right to tell him who to hire
and who to train or how to run his business. The private
institutions of this country -- so long as they do not
discriminate -- don't belong to Mr. Marshall, or Rep. Hawkins
or Sen. Kennedy, to be used as the tools of their particular
visions of industrial or social policy.

   Class Act: The Master Showman as Solid Citizen

   The popular view of P.T. Barnum as a cynical exploiter of
the world's suckers is off the mark, A.H. Saxon argues in a
brave work of literary rehabilitation, "P.T. Barnum, The
Legend and the Man" (Columbia University Press, 488 pages,
$32.95). Barnum never even said, "There's a sucker born every
minute." Credit for that line should go to a con man by the
name of Paper Collar Joe, whose exact words were "There is a
sucker born every minute, but none of them ever die."
   But if Barnum didn't even utter this most infamous quote,
just what did he do to achieve his notoriety? Plenty, as Mr.
Saxon tells us in this entertainingly scholarly work.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Barnum's first success was with Joice Heth, a case in
which even the most loyal Barnumite must acknowledge a touch
of audience manipulation. Heth, 161 years old, had been the
nurse of George Washington, Barnum told his customers, who
shelled out $1,500 a week to hear this extraordinary woman
sing hymns and tell stories about "little George." Rented
from her Kentucky master in 1835, she charmed the crowds
until her death a year later.
   Then came the moment of truth: A large audience of
doctors, scientists and editors gathered to watch as Ms. Heth
was dissected (admission: 50 cents). The scientific
consensus: She was a bit younger than claimed -- probably 80
years or so.
   Then there were Barnum's three dwarfs: Gen. Tom Thumb,
under 24 inches, 16 pounds; Commodore Nutt, 29 inches, 25
pounds; and Adm. Dot, dimensions unlisted. A 60,000-mile,
587-city world tour followed Gen. Thumb's marriage to Mercy
Lavinia Warren Bump (32 inches, 29 pounds), underscoring the
popularity of these acts. But Barnum had higher goals than
full employment for dwarfs and freaks, despite what you hear
from his detractors.
   Instead, he argued, his "curiosities" were used merely to
get people in the door, after which they were exposed to
educational exhibits, lectures and theatrical extravaganzas.
His "Nero" and "The Fall of Babylon," for example, each
employed over 1,000 actors and dancers. His temperance
productions instructed many in that arcane discipline. Barnum
also brought famed singer Jenny Lind to America, plus a
multicultural lineup billed as the "Ethnological Congress of
Savage Tribes," which included "bestial Australian cannibals"
and "dusky idolatrous Hindus."
   We laugh now, but at a time when few Americans could
afford to travel, Barnum brought the world to America. He
tried to get Sitting Bull, but the famous Indian had already
been signed up by Buffalo Bill. He offered Brigham Young
$200,000 to be exhibited, but the prophet turned him down.
   He was, in short, a master showman, but there was a lot
more to Barnum than show biz. Besides being a passionate
advocate of temperance, Christianity and Republicanism,
Barnum was also a state legislator, a mayor of Bridgeport,
Conn., and an early believer in black enfranchisement.
   A human soul, he proclaimed, "that God has created and
Christ died for, is not to be trifled with. It may tenant the
body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab or a Hottentot -- it is
still an immortal spirit; and amid all the assumptions of
caste, it will in due time vindicate the great fact that,
without regard to color or condition, all men are equally
children of the common Father."
   So spoke a man with a good heart and a powerful vision, a
man who has suffered a century-long smear job.
   What's more, Barnum also performed his artistry without a
single grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Quite
the contrary, he paid his way, selling 42 million museum
tickets and staging enormously popular roadshows. Then there
was, and is, his fabulous circus.
   So the question is, who has done more to enrich American
culture: the man with the Fejee Mermaid, or the tax-financed
creators of masterpieces like "Hermaphrodite Sucking the
Blood Out of a Dead Dog"?
   The answer's obvious, is it not? Hail Barnum. And thank
you, Mr. Saxon.

   More Counties Insist
   Not All Trash Is Equal

   THROWING OUT the trash is getting more complicated.
   Residents of Ingham County, Mich., which includes Lansing,
must call the county health department for an appointment to
bring in their household hazardous waste -- mostly paint cans
and pesticides. All appointments generally are scheduled for
one day each month, with as many as six every 15 minutes. For
material not in the original container, an identifying label
must be affixed, and each container must be placed in its own
clear plastic bag. For the service, participating households
had to pay an average of $75 to $80 last year.
   In Hennepin County, Minn., which includes Minneapolis, it
will be a misdemeanor to put old refrigerators and air
conditioners by the curb after July 1. Violators will face a
$300 fine. "Technically, you could also go to jail," says
county Commissioner Mark Andrew. To avoid the penalties, a
resident will have to call a vendor specially licensed by the
county, who will pick up an appliance within 24 hours for a
fee of $15. The vendor then will be responsible for removing
the appliance's chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which harm the
Earth's protective ozone layer, and polychlorinated biphenols
(PCBs), which cause cancer.
   Meanwhile, in Fitchburg, Wis., near Madison, residents
have been required since April 2 to recycle all polystyrene
plastic, such as egg cartons, supermarket meat trays and the
"clamshells" that enclose fast-food hamburgers. Residents
must wash the polystyrene, put it in a special recyclable
plastic bag supplied by the town and dispose of the bag in
the same curbside-pickup bin that's used for recyclable glass
and plastic containers. Fitchburg requires separate bins for
metal cans and paper products.
                                                                                                       

   Converting a Town

   TO DEMONSTRATE the environmental and financial benefits of
energy efficiency, Iowa Public Service Co. plans to revamp an
entire town's electrical and natural-gas gear.
   The utility will turn the town of Rock Valley, Iowa, plus
200 commercial and 13 industrial energy users, into an
energy-efficiency laboratory during the five-year program
running through 1994. The company is responding to two
concerns shared by many other utilities: the possibility of
power shortages later in the decade and the more immediate
concern of clean air and other environmental legislation.
   Under the program, Rock Valley customers will get free
water-heater insulation blankets and discounted maintenance
on their appliances. Residents of the town, which has a
population of 2,700, also will be offered rebates,
zero-interest financing and other incentives to buy

   Renewable energy sources also will be stressed, including
the use of electric motor vehicles. Commercial and industrial
customers will be trained to operate and maintain energy
equipment more efficiently.
   While the utility stresses it's not trying to win over
propane-fuel users as new customers, it says it wouldn't turn
them away.
                                                                                                       

   Day-Care Centers Stick
   With Disposables
                                                                                                       

   CLOTH DIAPERS may be environmentally applauded, but they
don't get endorsements across the board.
   The reservations coincide with a pronounced turning of the
tide in favor of cloth diapers. "We're running out of
landfill space," according to Florida state Sen. Tom
McPherson, whose bill would ban disposable diapers from being
sold in Florida after October 1993. A New Jersey bill,
meanwhile, would tax consumers a penny for every disposable
diaper that they purchase.
   But disposables are here to stay as far as Kinder-Care
Learning Centers Inc. is concerned. "Disposable diapers can
be dealt with more sanitarily," says Sallye Blake,
spokeswoman for the national child-care chain, who adds that
Kinder-Care requires disposable diapers except when a child
is allergic to them.
   Kinder-Care's position is supported by the American
Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health
Association. The two organizations recently drafted a set of
proposed performance standards for out-of-home child-care
programs. While the draft document is 400 pages long, the
project's co-chairman, George Sterne, a New Orleans
physician, says most public comments have been about the
disposable vs. cloth debate.
   "Many people feel we're off-base" in recommending
disposable diapers, says Dr. Sterne. Although he's a cloth
advocate himself, Dr. Sterne believes there would be a public
health problem involving infectious diseases if cloth diapers
were worn by the roughly one-quarter of American children
between the ages of one and three who are in outside day-care
centers.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   IT'S BACK to the drawing board for Dustbuster. As
currently manufactured by Black &amp; Decker Corp., the hand-held
vacuum cleaner's rechargeable battery isn't removable. Since
B&amp;D is expecting a number of new recycling laws to require
that all household batteries be recyclable, a spokeswoman
says the company is working on a new Dustbuster that will
have a removable battery pack. . . . Annual revenue for the
waste-disposal industry will hit $50 billion by the
mid-1990s, double 1989's volume, predicts National Solid
Wastes Management Association, a trade group. . . . The Texas
town of Sour Lake is one of 20 communities whose new phone
directories are printed on recycled paper by Southwestern
Bell Telephone, a unit of Southwestern Bell Corp.

   Myerson Law Firm Partner Is Granted
   Immunity in Investigation, Sources Say

   At least one former partner of Harvey Myerson has been
granted immunity and dozens of other former colleagues have
been called to testify in the government's investigation of
alleged overbilling by Mr. Myerson and his law firm,
according to people familiar with the investigation.
   A federal grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., may be asked by
early summer to vote on whether to indict the founder of the
now-defunct New York law firm Myerson &amp; Kuhn, the people
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These individuals say that prosecutors are likely to seek
to charge Mr. Myerson with conspiring to defraud at least two
clients by overbilling them and with illegally taking more
than $1 million from his own law firm.
   "There is an investigation and it's being actively
pursued," said Sean O'Shea, an assistant U.S. attorney who is
leading the investigation of Mr. Myerson. "Beyond that,
there's no comment."
   Charles Stillman, a New York attorney representing Mr.
Myerson, said, "When people finally sort through all of the
facts and circumstances, it will be clear that Harvey Myerson
did not violate the criminal law." Mr. Stillman added, "It is
by no means certain that he will be indicted."
   Myerson &amp; Kuhn filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in December. The
New York-based firm was founded in January 1988 by Mr.
Myerson and Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner. Mr.
Myerson and some of the other partners in the firm were
formerly partners of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine,
Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp; Casey, which collapsed in
November 1987 and is still in bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   According to individuals who have talked to the government
about Mr. Myerson, the government appears to be focusing on
alleged overbilling by Myerson &amp; Kuhn of the United Food and
Commercial Workers union and of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
a unit of American Express Co. Both were clients of the firm.
If indicted, Mr. Myerson is likely to be charged with
directing underlings to overbill these clients, people
familiar with the investigation said.
   The government is said to believe that Myerson &amp; Kuhn
overbilled United Food by $550,000. Last month, shortly after
it learned of the alleged overbilling from the government,
the union filed a claim with the bankruptcy court in
Manhattan to try to recover the money. Robert Funk, associate
general counsel of United Food, declined to comment.
   The government is also said to believe that Myerson &amp; Kuhn
fraudulently overbilled Shearson by at least $2 million. As
previously reported, Shearson last year fired Myerson &amp; Kuhn
and accused it of overbilling the securities firm. In June
1989, Myerson &amp; Kuhn settled a dispute with Shearson,
agreeing to pay it $1.2 million. But Shearson claims it is
still owed $488,000 on the settlement and has also filed a
claim with the court.
   The government has also been investigating the possible
withdrawal by Mr. Myerson of more than $1 million from
Myerson &amp; Kuhn. Besides the more than $400,000 Mr. Myerson
withdrew from the law firm in the form of what were termed
"advances," the government is said to have information that
more than $600,000 in additional funds may have been
withdrawn but never accounted for. The missing funds were
discovered in a recent audit of the firm, individuals
familiar with the investigation said.
   Former Myerson &amp; Kuhn accountants and bookkeepers have
also been asked to testify in connection with the probe of
possible tax-law violations as a result of the withdrawals.
Mr. Myerson's annual compensation at the firm had been set at
$1.4 million.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Myerson, who has formed a new law firm, is
moving his residence to Florida from New York, associates
said. Under Florida law, an individual's home can't be seized
by creditors.

   PARIS -- French consumer prices in April rose a
preliminary 0.4% from March and 3.2% from a year earlier, the
National Statistics Institute said.
   The April result follows a definitive monthly gain of 0.3%
in March, while the latest year-to-year rate is down from
3.4% in the previous month. Both figures are in line with
previous forecasts by economists, who had anticipated a
slight acceleration in April as a result of technical
pressure on service prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decline in year-to-year price growth, despite the
higher monthly result, reflects an unusually high 0.6%
increase in consumer prices in April 1989.

   Britain Is Easing
   Its Opposition
   To Currency Tie

   LONDON -- Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major,
asserting that "Britain is a pretty convinced European," made
it clear that Margaret Thatcher's government is backing away
from its ideological opposition to a central European banking
authority, and even to a single currency.
   Trying to shed Britain's reputation as combative and
isolated, the soft-spoken, 47-year-old chancellor emphasized
in an interview the need to take concrete steps toward
economic and monetary union, and promised that the Thatcher
government would soon come up with new plans for advancing
these goals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though he didn't provide a date, he insisted that the
United Kingdom is determined to bring the pound into the
exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The
arrangement links together the major European Community
currencies within set exchange-rate bands. Britain has been
the only major EC member to stand outside the mechanism.
   Mr. Major warned that full EMS membership could be a jolt
both to the U.K. and its partners. He noted that the pound is
a "big currency," the second most widely traded after the
Deutsche mark. If the pound's entry isn't carefully timed, he
warned, it could destabilize other EMS currencies.
   The chancellor also said he would support the further
development of Europe's ECU, the EC's basket currency, and
that he could even imagine the issuance of notes with ECU
value printed on one side and pound value on the other. "I
think there are ways of dealing with a single currency," he
said.
   Mr. Major characterized full monetary union as "a distant
vision in European eyes with no indication of how you
actually get there." But while some British officials have
assailed proposals for a single currency and central EC
banking authority, Mr. Major seemed concerned with
nuts-and-bolts aspects of the transition.
   One tough philosophical dilemma Mr. Major says will
preoccupy EC leaders is the degree of independence of a
future central banking authority, currently dubbed the
"EuroFed." Asked Mr. Major: "If the EuroFed is accountable,
how could it be independent? If it is independent, how will
it be accountable?"
   Speaking of Britain's monetary system, he indicated that a
proposal to make the Bank of England more independent is "not
a live issue at the moment." He continued: "In the United
Kingdom, the monetary authority is effectively the chancellor
of the exchequer and not the central bank." Mr. Major's
predecessor, Nigel Lawson, had suggested that Britain embrace
a more-independent central bank, along the lines of the U.S.
Federal Reserve or the West German Bundesbank.

   The announcement came during the pharmaceutical company's
annual meeting in which shareholders defeated a proposal that
would have required the company to halt all South African
operations. The proposal was made by three of Upjohn's
institutional investors -- the New York State Retirement
Fund, the New York State Teachers' Retirement System and the

South Africa. Upjohn said it hopes to strike a deal by the
end of the second quarter, although required U.S. government
approval may delay the process.
   Upjohn officials said they are selling the plant because
of its weak financial performance. However, they said they'll
only sell the plant to buyers who guarantee to "remain
committed to social programs." Upjohn said the plant now
employs 100 workers.

   Bush Push for Aid

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush stepped up pressure on
Congress to expedite aid to Nicaragua, as House and Senate
negotiators loaded the legislation with bids for new domestic
appropriations.
   A revised fiscal 1990 spending bill, introduced by House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, incorporates
tens of millions of dollars in new initiatives that are sure
to invite criticism from an already irritated White House.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposals run the gamut from at least $68 million to
address flooding problems in the South to smaller but
controversial provisions challenging the authority of
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and earmarking defense funds
for favored projects in the home states of influential
members.
   Mr. Whitten appears bent on reasserting the House's
influence on what has grown into a bill of more than $3.3
billion in the Senate, but as lawmakers pile on, the
Mississippi Democrat and his committee colleagues expose
themselves to reproach.
   In a private meeting Tuesday, the president personally
asked the chairman to expedite the bill, and yesterday, the
White House and GOP allies took a more public route, warning
that the continued delays were endangering the new Chamorro
government by withholding aid.
   The bill promises $300 million in economic assistance for
Nicaragua, as part of a larger foreign-aid package that
includes $420 million for Panama. Mr. Bush reminded Congress
that he initially asked for approval of both items last
month. But the importance of the bill has made it an
attractive vehicle for lawmakers and the president's own
cabinet members, who have lobbied behind the scenes for
supplemental funds to carry their departments through the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   Mr. Bush accused appropriators of having tripled the cost
of his initial request, but the largest single item of more
than $1 billion is to cover what the Agriculture Department
estimates is a shortfall in food-stamp funding. Other major
items include $110 million for the current census and almost
$196 million for child vaccine and preschool education
programs -- much of which is backed by the administration.
And separately, the White House has indulged in its own brand
of pork-barrel politics to buy leverage for itself in the
Senate.
   Still more Pentagon cuts are expected to be needed to
offset added costs, and the military accounts are the focus
of some of the most intensive bargaining. The revised House
bill rescinds $238 million for a Louisiana explosives plant
and anticipates the closing of a second Mississippi
ammunition facility. But the measure also inserts language
sought by Mr. Whitten for a Pentagon-supported academic
center in his home state and includes new provisions for
defense subcommittee chairman, Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.), to
transfer military land and earmark at least $5 million in
funds for research facilities in Pennsylvania.
   The negotiations are to continue this morning. But even if
an agreement is reached on the spending bill, the
administration still needs legislative waivers and
authorizations before the Central American funds can be
distributed. The president sought to focus attention on
Nicaragua's plight and the delayed appropriations process,
but his greater political problem lies with the accompanying
authorizing bill and amendments seeking to impose conditions
on military aid to El Salvador.
   Efforts to separate the two issues have so far failed, and
as peace talks began this week on the Salvadoran war, Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) has joined Democratic efforts to
put pressure on the El Salvador government to negotiate. The
first test will come in the House, and though Speaker Thomas
Foley (D., Wash.) has signaled a willingness to move toward
the administration, there is pressure to reach some
resolution before the Nicaragua and Panama money is released.
   Amid the extraordinary mix of accounts in the supplemental
bill, one policy priority in the negotiations has been the
popular Head Start program to assist poor, preschool-age
children. The House-Senate conference tentatively agreed last
night to add $165.7 million for this fiscal year, an 11%
increase that would bring the program up to its fully
authorized level of $1.55 billion.
   The action came as the House separately approved a $2.4
billion Head Start authorization for the fiscal year
beginning next Oct. 1, but few expect spending to reach that
level, given the pressure of deficit-reduction negotiations.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Film:
   Robin Williams Runs Out of Gas

   The director Roger Donaldson has come to specialize in
making successful movies without any discernible logic. "No
Way Out" didn't make any sense at all but had a razzle-dazzle
speed and style that made you think it did. "Cocktail," on
the other hand, didn't have much of anything except Tom
Cruise, which was enough to make it a hit and to inflate Mr.
Donaldson's currency in Hollywood.
   Now, with "Cadillac Man," he's brought his swooping camera
and chaotic sense of storytelling to the world of the car
salesman. The main thing he's accomplished with this film is
to make Robin Williams seem dull.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Williams is Joey O'Brien, a relentless huckster and
womanizer whose sales have gotten worse as his romances have
gotten better, or at least more numerous. None of it's really
working out for Joey, who's losing his grip on his customers
and his girlfriends. He's brash and crude, but smart enough
to recognize his failings. One could imagine Mr. Williams
doing something wild, something unexpected with Joey's manic
drive for conquests at work and in bed. In fact, he does do
the really unexpected: He plays Joey straight, the way Ken
Friedman, the script writer must have created him. He's
sleazy, as he should be, and boring, as he shouldn't.
   The picture demonstrates how a little of everything can
add up to a lot of nothing. The film makers have tossed in a
little "Something Wild," a little "Tin Men," a little
"Married to the Mob," even a little "Dog Day Afternoon." But
while they recognize the appeal of an off-center sensibility,
they've fallen in with the evil twin of unconventional
plotting, which is incoherent plotting.
   "Cadillac Man" is populated by eccentric characters, many
of whom dress in bizarre clothing. Here, though, the
eccentricities fit like bad wigs; they make you stare at the
person wearing them but for the wrong reason. What is the
purpose of Lila, Joey's dimwitted "fashion designer"
girlfriend, besides giving the lithe, young actress Lori
Petty the chance to prance around nearly naked wearing funny
hats and earrings? Why does a man named Joey O'Brien have an
Italian mother who sounds like a Jewish mother?
   The clunky rhythms are as persistently wrong and
irritating as the man who insists on tapping his feet at a
concert -- and a half-beat off at that. Much of the problem
lies in the script, which has Joey explain his character to
the camera -- in prosaic language that seems especially flat
because we've become accustomed to hearing something bright
and wild when Robin Williams talks directly to an audience.
   Even scenes that might have sounded amusing on paper don't
survive the transition to film. The opening, for example:
Joey pulls up alongside a funeral procession that's stopped
because the hearse has broken down. The astute salesman sees
a smoking car and smells a sale. So he pulls over, offers his
condolences and hands his business card to the funeral
director -- and then to the widow.
   The director might have suspected Joey's character was
coming off a little flat, which may have been the purpose of
the bits of narrative that allow Joey to tell the audience
what he's thinking. But what he's thinking is so
uninteresting: "Hmmm, the paint job is still holding up," he
muses, staring at the outer walls of the house when he goes
to visit his ex-wife.
   Most dispiriting are the scenes between Joey and his ex,
which are full of those deadly moments when a person's deep
feelings about parenthood are supposed to compensate for all
his other character defects. The dialogue is even more
mundane than the thought behind it:
   Asking about his teen-age daughter, Joey says: "She into
drugs or something like that?"
   "She needs a father," says his ex-wife, played worried by
Pamela Reed.
   "She has a father," says Joey.
   The movie drags itself through the opening sequences
designed to establish Joey's troubles. The car dealership he
works at seems to be a friendly kind of place; the guys
gather around for chummy lunches at a Chinese restaurant, the
way the salesmen met at a diner in "Tin Men." Only here, the
waitress has better lines than the salesmen do, which would
be fine except that the movie isn't about her. The old gang
will be breaking up because the owner is moving the operation
to a better neighborhood. Only one or two salesmen will be
brought along, so Joey has one day to prove that he deserves
to stay on staff.
   Meanwhile, his women are becoming more demanding by the
minute. Yet Joey's problems are dwarfed by the dramatic
entrance of Tim Robbins, who plays Larry, the cuckolded
husband of the car dealership's secretary. He storms Turgeon
Luxury Auto Sales with a machine gun and holds everyone
hostage. This event allows Joey to become a man, to dump his
extraneous girlfriends and to keep his job.
   There is one minor note of pleasure, in the nasal whine of
Fran Drescher, who plays Joey's married lover Joy. Ms.
Drescher is one of the more cheerfully obnoxious creatures to
march across the screen in recent memory -- and she brings
her nasty little dog Chester with her.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: If you're in the mood for a witty picture about
a salesman, take a look at "Tin Men." The 1987 Barry Levinson
movie about fast-talking aluminum siding salesmen in the '50s
had great talk and good performances from Richard Dreyfuss
and Danny DeVito.

   Kay Jewelers Inc.'s lenders appear to be losing faith in
the financially troubled jewelry retailing chain.
   Four banks have pulled $16.5 million in lines of credit
since March 16, and three of them would like to withdraw $32
million more, said Michael R. Lavington, Kay's president and
chief operating officer, elaborating on the company's
first-quarter 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The company currently has $86 million in lines of
credit, of which $75 million has been used.

   Mr. Lavington said the reluctant lenders aren't demanding
immediate repayment of the $31 million Kay has borrowed
against the $32 million line. "They are willing to work with
us," he said.
   To solve the credit crunch, Kay is seeking to replace all
of its credit lines with a one-year committed revolving
credit agreement for $80 million to $90 million to meet
seasonal borrowing needs. Mr. Lavington said the Alexandria,
Va., company is in negotiations with several banks to create
such a "revolver" and he expects an agreement to be in place
within six to eight weeks. In the meantime, he said, the $11
million available under existing credit lines should be
"quite adequate.
   "It's certainly tight, but it's manageable," Mr. Lavington
said. "We're fairly close to our peak levels of borrowing
right now." Jewelry retailers such as Kay typically have
negative cash flow for the first nine months of the year. As
of March 31, Kay had only $114,000 in cash.
   In the 10-Q filing, Kay also said that banks providing
$22.5 million of a $90 million letter of credit don't intend
to renew their participation when the agreement expires in
July. Kay is required to maintain the $90 million letter as a
condition of its ongoing agreement to sell its credit card
receivables to NCNB National Bank.
   Mr. Lavington said Kay is seeking a replacement for the
non-renewing banks in the letter of credit.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Kay shares plunged $2.375, to $7.50.
   Kay has been experiencing credit-related problems for
several years. In 1988, the company sold its credit-card
receivables to NCNB to raise cash, and last year the company
floated $100 million in junk bonds. Kay's lenders have become
increasingly skittish, and the company's lines of credit have
been steadily shrinking for several quarters.
   In the first quarter, Kay had a loss of $5.6 million, or
45 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $3.8
million, or 31 cents a share.
   In January, Kay put its Black, Starr &amp; Frost stores on the
auction block, and Mr. Lavington said there is a "very good
chance" the company will sell the division within two or
three months, as required under draft terms of the revolving
credit agreement being negotiated. Failing that, Mr.
Lavington said, the company must add $10 million in equity,
probably through the sale of common stock.
   Kay is holding its annual meeting this morning in
Alexandria.

   Workplace:
   Retirees, Companies Head for Showdown
   Over Moves to Reduce Health Coverage

   It's becoming very familiar. Retirees who believed they
enjoyed lifetime health benefits watch as their former
employers cut or eliminate them. Any legal fight pits the
retirees against their old bosses.
   But in a pending class-action suit against Primerica
Corp., retirees have an unusual ally: the management that
says it made those lifetime promises.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, when Primerica raised salaried retirees'
health-insurance fees -- and warned that the benefit plan
might be axed altogether -- the decision was made by new
executives, most of whom didn't know their counterparts at
the old American Can Co., which became Primerica in 1987.
Now, old management is leading the fight against new.
   "We believe the new officers have zero sense of
responsibility to these people they didn't even know," says
Judd Alexander, a former executive vice president and member
of the annuity board that supervised benefits. Primerica
officials won't comment, but an outside lawyer for the
company says it was legally entitled to raise health fees and
needed to do so to cut costs.
   The Primerica suit and similar cases pending against
General Motors Corp. and Combustion Engineering Inc., now
part of Asea Brown Boveri AB, represent a new wave of suits
challenging the retrenchment by many companies in what they
think they owe retirees. These cases "will stake out the
legal boundaries under which these cuts can take place," says
Christopher Mackaronis, a former lawyer for the American
Association of Retired Persons and now part of the team suing
GM. The stakes are high: The suit against Primerica could
involve more than 2,500 retirees; those against Combustion
Engineering and GM, 1,500 and 84,000, respectively.
   Cuts in retirees' benefits are an increasingly common
response to rising costs. For retirees not eligible for
Medicare, companies' health-insurance bills jumped 18% in
1987 from a year earlier, says the Washington Business Group
on Health, an employers' group. Corporate attention is also
riveted by a new accounting rule, expected to take effect in
1992, that would force companies to put unfunded retiree
health costs on the balance sheet. In a survey last year of
the group's Fortune 500 members, 69% said they have asked
Medicare retirees to pay more, or plan to do so within two
years.
   In many such companies, especially those that have changed
hands, "institutional memory" of promises made has faded,
says Mr. Mackaronis. But at Primerica, institutional memory
is stepping forward.
   Most of the company's former officers have few financial
worries of their own. For himself, says Sal Guidice, former
executive vice president of administration, "I'd say `to hell
with them' and just pay" the higher fees.
   Instead, the erstwhile executives, including Mr. Guidice
and former chief executive Bill May, have declared war.
They've hired lawyers and collected thousands of dollars from
former colleagues to finance the fight, now being staged in
federal district court in Newark, N.J. The battle, they
contend, is over not just insurance premiums, but also
traditional company values. "I'm not in it for the money,"
says Mr. Alexander. "I'm in it for the people I worked with
long ago."
   When Mr. May and his colleagues ran American Can, generous
benefits and a comfortable retirement were vital parts of the
apparent security of working for the company. Asked to
describe her former employer, Irene Meijer, 71 years old, who
worked in the Green Bay, Wis., plant, says: "Well, it was
big. Goodness, it was all over the world." Did she ever
imagine a change in her benefits? "Nobody thought anything
like that could happen."
   That was by design, the former officers say. They say
American Can relied on lucrative benefits rather than high
pay to recruit and keep people -- and, later, to induce some
to retire early. Over the years, some changes were made.
Once, for example, the monthly health-coverage fee was raised
to $5 a person from $3.66, but Mr. Alexander says major
improvements in coverage "offset" that increase.
   The former officers say a reserve clause in plan
descriptions, which refers to "modifications . . . in
conformity with applicable legislation," limits changes to
those required by amendments in federal Medicare or benefits
laws. Even that proviso didn't appear in many company
documents, including those given employees when they retired,
says Mr. Alexander.
   "The way I read it, I didn't have the flexibility
{management is} now exercising," says Mr. May, the former
chief executive. "That flexibility never existed."
   Shortly before he retired in 1985, Mr. Giudice recalls, he
counseled the widow of a colleague who had just died. He says
he never questioned that her benefits would be preserved.
   Still, by 1985 American Can already was changing. Former
Wall Street whiz Gerald Tsai Jr., who later became chairman
of the company and changed its name, was moving it from
industry into finance. In 1988, Sanford I. Weill, who had
built Shearson Loeb Rhoades, merged Primerica into his
Commercial Credit Group Inc. and quickly set out to cut
costs.
   In January 1989, retirees got a letter that began
innocuously with news of the merger: "We are now entering an
exciting chapter in our redirection." Two paragraphs later
came the blockbuster: a boost in retiree insurance fees to
$50 a month per person covered from $5. And, said the letter,
"We must reserve the right to change and/or terminate this
plan at any time."
   For Mr. May, that statement was especially serious.
"Anybody who increases {the fee} 1,000% in one year," he
believes, isn't going to stop there. Former employees, adds
Mr. Guidice, are "looking to me and others who were around
and helped guide" policies. Failing to help them, he
contends, would be like "breaking a moral commitment."
   The outside attorney for Primerica scoffs at the former
executives' position. "If {they} say, `Gee, that's not what
we meant,' that rings hollow," says the lawyer, who asks not
to be named. "It says, when you're in management . . . you
want total flexibility. . . . `Now that I'm a beneficiary,
{it's} take care of me.'"
   More likely, the company's attorney suggests, the former
management just hadn't looked closely enough for cost
savings. "It's easy not to look at these things," he says.
With new management, "sometimes, you look." A rate of $5 a
month, he says, isn't in line with health-care costs -- or
shareholder interests.
   Mr. May, now on the board of Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center in New York, says he's aware of economic realities and
that the health-care system is "a shambles." But he says
Primerica is putting the burden on the wrong people: "You're
asking them to ameliorate a situation that is not their
responsibility and for which they don't have an answer."
   Legal victory won't hinge, though, on who should carry
that burden, but on whether the company can legitimately
raise the fee. Primerica's attorney says the reserve clause
used in company documents allows more leeway than the former
officers say. "I can tell you that before {Primerica made the
change}, it took a long, hard, careful look" at the law, the
lawyer says.
   Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati struck a
big blow for employers with a 1988 ruling in Musto vs.
American General Corp. The court essentially found that while
American General orally had promised retirees that their
benefits would remain intact -- and company brochures might
have given that impression -- the small print in the plan
documents said otherwise, and that's what counted. The
Supreme Court refused to review the case.
   Even under current law, however, plaintiffs' lawyers say
there is plenty of room left for argument. They say the
courts must evaluate how comprehensive a reserve clause is,
whether employees have access to that language and who makes
the promises. In Musto, it was supervisors, says Mr.
Mackaronis, the lawyer in the GM suit. "It's another thing to
have people who devised the plan step forward and say, `This
wasn't the deal.'" That could be "a defense attorney's
nightmare."
   The former Primerica employees hope for just that. "The
people we're suing don't have any of the background we do,"
says Mr. Alexander.
   Whatever the court rules on Primerica, passions will
continue to flare. Igor I. Sikorsky Jr., the attorney
representing Combustion Engineering retirees in their suit,
says he and other lawyers "are constantly turning away
{retirees} who have no legal recourse," given the design of
some company plans and the law. In a letter last week to Sen.
Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), he urged Congress to amend the
laws to better protect older workers' and retirees' benefits.
   It's a "generational issue," says Robert Levin at the
Washington Business Group. Current retirees, he says, should
make some sacrifices so that companies can provide more for
employees and prospective retirees.
   Still, says Mr. Levin, the Business Group survey showed
that 73% of its members were "much more comfortable" changing
benefits for future rather than current retirees. It's hard
to predict which companies will cut back. "Part of it, " he
says, "is cultural."

        The Benefits -- and Costs -- of Retirement
                                                                                                       

   In a study of medium and large employers, March 1990:
                                                                                                       

   -- 84% said they provide medical coverage to retired
employees both before and after age 65. Almost 16% said
retirees either aren't covered or are covered only before age
65.
                                                                                                       

   In preliminary results from a new study of a similar but
smaller, sampling of employers, May 1990:
                                                                                                       

   -- 53% said they have reduced medical benefits for current
retirees at least once in the last two years, primarily by
requiring a bigger contribution, deductible or co-insurance.
   -- 63% said they will probably make a similar decrease in
the next two years.

   BURBANK, Calif. -- "Peter Pan," the story of the boy who
never grows old, will be the next Walt Disney animated
classic released on videotape, Walt Disney Home Video said.
   The movie will be listed at $24.99. But the Walt Disney
Co. subsidiary is linking up with certain Nabisco crackers to
offer a $5 rebate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said the rebate price is the lowest retail
price yet for The Disney Classics series of videotapes, which
most recently featured "The Little Mermaid." Others in the
series have been "Bambi," "Robin Hood," "Pinocchio,"
"Sleeping Beauty," "Lady and the Tramp," "Cinderella" and
Touchstone Picture's "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."
   Since the initial release of "Peter Pan" in 1953, the
animated feature has been re-released in theaters six times,
Disney said, grossing $145 million in current dollars. The
company plans to herald the videotape with an extensive,
national advertising campaign.

   William C. Coleman will always be known for the little arc
lamp, which he introduced in 1903 to light rural homes
without electricity. By now Coleman Co. lanterns -- more than
40 million of them -- have illuminated everything from
football fields and family campsites to rescue boats,
barbecues and Admiral Byrd's expedition to the South Pole.
   As Coleman became a fortress in the market for lamps and
lanterns, the Wichita, Kan., company tried to transfer its
reputation to other businesses. In doing so, Coleman has
shown the strengths -- as well as the limits -- of a fortress
image when a company expands.
   "The continued extension of the Coleman name has worked
very well in building the company," says Coleman President
Lawrence Jones. But even with a name as revered as Coleman's,
he adds, "You've got to recognize that in some markets you
haven't earned the credibility that you have in your basic
business."
   Coleman's basic business began just before the turn of the
century, when "W.C.," as Mr. Coleman was called, saw a
gas-powered lamp in an Alabama drugstore. A school teacher
and part-time typewriter salesman, Mr. Coleman contacted the
lamp's manufacturer and later struck a deal to lease the
lights to merchants.
   After Mr. Coleman died in 1957, his son Sheldon greatly
accelerated Coleman's expansion. Annual sales tripled in the
1960s to $134 million and more than doubled in the 1970s to
$300 million. By the time Sheldon Coleman died in 1988, sales
had doubled again, to $657.9 million a year.
   Over the years, Coleman occasionally ventured into areas
where its reputation seemed irrelevant. In doing so, the
company sometimes found it strayed too far.
   Largely with the steady cash flow from its core camping
products, Coleman purchased companies so distant from its
traditional businesses that replacing their brands with
Coleman's didn't make sense. Among its numerous acquisitions:
Hobie Cat sailboats, MasterCraft ski boats, O'Brien
windsurfers and skis, Crossman air guns, Golden Eagle archery
equipment and Dixon riding mowers.
   But Coleman has since decided to unload many of the
companies it bought. Since 1987, it either sold or offered
for sale 11 units that once represented nearly half of
Coleman's annual sales.
   Some of the selling is aimed at paying down debt from
financier Ronald Perelman's $545 million buy-out of the
family-controlled company last April; Coleman now is a unit
of MacAndrew &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc., which Mr. Perelman
controls. But much of the selling was already planned before
the buy-out. Some of the companies were losing money or had
stopped growing. Others simply didn't fit with Coleman's
expertise.
   In the case of Hobie Cat, Coleman found that a reputation
for lanterns and camp stoves did little to sell sailboats. In
addition, the boats had to be sold through specialty
retailers far removed from Coleman's experience. Hobie had a
loss of $1.7 million in 1988, the year Coleman sold it. Says
a Coleman spokesman: "We want to focus on those things that
Coleman knows and does best."
   When Coleman stayed close to its camp, its expansion often
was hugely successful. The company's folding stoves, coolers
and jugs all became leaders in their fields. So did the
Coleman camping trailer, despite its false start.
   Early models of the folding trailer were defective,
because the lifting mechanism wouldn't raise the tent. The
ensuing product recall might have wrecked another company's
attempt to break into a new market. But Randy Ketelsen, a
camping-trailer dealer in Denver, says the company's
reputation for "uncompromising quality," plus its decision to
replace such traditional construction materials as wood and
cotton canvas with aluminum and rot-resistant synthetic
fabric, helped the company persevere.
   While Coleman recently sold its trailer unit to
mobile-home maker Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. in order to
focus on other lines, Mr. Ketelsen says the trailer operation
represented "the dominant trailer in the industry in the
decade of the 80s."
   By combining Coleman's red-and-white logo with technically
advanced materials, Coleman quickly established itself in the
canoe market as well. A Grumman Corp. unit that makes
aluminum canoes used to dominate the business, until Coleman
emerged with a polyethylene boat that was stronger and half
as expensive. "They went from a standing start to No. 1 in a
few years," says Dennis Hudson, a vice president at George K.
Baum &amp; Co., a Kansas City, Mo., investment bank.
   While Mr. Jones describes Coleman's primary customer as
"high blue collar," Coleman on occasion has managed to place
its name in more-upscale fields. In doing so, it tried
carefully to distinguish these products from other Coleman
goods. In backpacking gear, the company created a special
Peak One label and placed it above the Coleman name. It also
decided to sell the gear in specialty hiking shops, rather
than in the general-interest sporting goods or
mass-merchandise stores where its products usually are found.
   Today, Coleman is considered a leader in certain lines of
backpacking gear. "When they came out with their compact
lantern, it established a whole new product niche," says
David Getchell, equipment editor of Backpacker magazine. In a
recent Backpacker comparison of such products, he says, "the
Coleman stoves finished at or near the top."

   Chicago Developers
   Offered Huge Loan

<LP>
   CHICAGO -- Federal housing officials offered an
unprecedented $16 million bailout loan to the well-connected
developers of a huge and troubled apartment complex here that
already has received a series of unusual government favors.
   Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp made the offer hoping to avert what would be the
biggest-ever HUD foreclosure on a housing project. HUD
officials estimated the agency would lose $87 million if it
had to pay off the $159 million balance on the mortgage on
Presidential Towers and sell the 2,346-apartment development
at its market value.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   HUD set as a condition of the loan offer that the
developers and their partners pitch in another $13 million.
However, one of the developers indicated they weren't
inclined to invest anywhere near that amount.
   Built by three developers with close ties to House Ways
and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski -- who helped
them win lucrative financing favors -- Presidential Towers
defaulted on its Federal Housing Administration-insured
mortgage in February after months of financial problems. Last
year, the developers asked HUD for a so-called operating loss
loan of $16 million to see them through a projected six-year
turnaround period.
   HUD, however, estimates it will take eight years and $26
million to turn around the project, which consists of four
49-story towers and a connecting atrium on the western edge
of Chicago's downtown area.
   The single biggest operating loss loan HUD has made to
date was $2.5 million, an agency official said, and the
longest projected turnaround period on such a loan was five
years; HUD doesn't normally make such loans unless the
project is expected to break even within two years.
   Despite the huge potential loss for the government, the
project has been personally profitable for at least one of
its developers, James P. McHugh. He received $4 million in
fees for construction work that his firm performed. Mr.
McHugh said his total profit was $4.5 million on the more
than $100 million construction project. He defended that
amount as being below normal levels for a job of that size.
   The two other developers are Daniel E. Levin, who together
with Mr. McHugh owns a property-management firm that is paid
to operate Presidential Towers, and Daniel J. Shannon, a
longtime friend of Mr. Rostenkowski's who produced some big
profits for the congressman while managing his blind
investment trust.
   Mr. Rostenkowski has denied any connection between the
trust profits and his help with arranging the government
financing of Presidential Towers, which he said he did to
help redevelop the city of Chicago.
   A limited partnership also raised $59 million for the
project, but getting more money from those investors seems
unlikely because changes in the tax code have made such
investments less profitable, Mr. McHugh said.
   The three developers' combined net worth was said to be
more than $20 million in partnership documents, but Mr.
McHugh said the $13 million investment requirement by HUD is
far bigger than anything they had considered. "I don't have
$13 million to risk," he said.
   Mr. Levin wouldn't comment on how much he would commit,
but said: "We're hopeful we'll work something out. We don't
build developments just to make fees and walk away. We don't
walk away from things." Messrs. McHugh and Levin are among
the Midwest's biggest developers of apartment buildings and
have been in the business for 25 years.
   The developers spent about $7.5 million getting
Presidential Towers started, and they were reimbursed for
those expenses. They made advances of $331,759 to the project
to help cover operating losses.
   James Logue, HUD's deputy assistant secretary for
multifamily housing, said he hadn't discussed HUD's proposal
with the developers, but said the terms aren't negotiable.
"These are basically the conditions under which we could see
ourselves making an operating loss loan," he said.
   Even if HUD and the developers can come to an agreement,
Presidential Towers represents a big gamble. The project has
had a higher vacancy rate and lower rents than projected, as
well as a big increase in property taxes. The Chicago market
for high-rise apartments is glutted, and as Presidential
Towers gets older it could have more difficulty competing
with newer buildings.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Levin is among the developers of a new
904-apartment development under construction here.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   Khmers Are Dancing Again

   Phnom Penh -- "We have two stomachs, the upper for the
soul, the lower for the body. When the upper is hungry, the
lower is also hungry," says Chheng Phon, Cambodia's Minister
of Culture. "Culture is the soul of the nation. So every
Khmer has to think about culture -- except Pol Pot; he wasn't
interested in culture. To restore culture is to restore the
people's soul that was damaged under Pol Pot."
   That may sound like rhetoric, but the spirit and practice
of the idea pervades Phnom Penh. The capital now has two
lively fine arts schools, one teaching music and dance, the
other specializing in the plastic arts, architecture and
archaeology. The combined enrollment is 1,200 students, and
they are dedicated. The concentration on the faces of girls
no more than eight or nine years old being taught classical
Khmer dance banishes any doubts about the practical results
of the Ministry of Culture's high-mindedness.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Phnom Penh again has a professional theater company,
versed in all forms of traditional performing arts and with
some 300 artists and technicians. There are 15 other theater
groups in the capital, as well as regional folkloric troupes
in four provinces.
   These achievements all have come since the overthrow of
Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge 10 years ago. During its 3
1/2-year reign of terror, the Khmer Rouge did its best to
wipe clean the slate of Khmer history, destroying traditional
culture and killing those who represented it.
   After the Vietnamese invasion in 1979 and subsequent
installation of the Heng Samrin government, officials wanted
to reopen Phnom Penh's Fine Arts School. The number of
professionals in all spheres of music, dance and theater who
had survived Pol Pot totaled just 47, according to one
source. Mr. Chheng estimates that 80% to 90% of Cambodia's
intellectuals -- scientists, engineers, doctors, as well as
artists -- were lost during Pol Pot's reign.
   That tragedy, and the subsequent struggle faced by the
Ministry of Culture, were compounded by the fact that
cultural forms had never been recorded. Historically,
teaching had been conducted through a close master-pupil
relationship, and learning was by a kind of osmosis.
   Vietnamese troops remained in the country until the
official withdrawal last September. Some commentators have
accordingly tried to suggest that Cambodian culture has been
"Vietnamized." This isn't true.
   "Vietnamization? There's none at all," says William
Lobban, an Australian ethnomusicologist working as a
nongovernment agency volunteer with the Ministry of Culture.
"The Vietnamese did suggest the introduction of Western
ballet, but the Khmer resisted, saying they have their own
style of dance. No, the only Vietnamese influence has been in
Western music."
   Walking unannounced through the campus of the Fine Arts
School, I heard the strains of a violin coming from one music
practice room, though the distinctive notes of a classical
Khmer instrument wafted loud and clear from another.
   There were no signs of a diluted culture. Khmer forms were
to be seen not only in the classrooms, but also outside.
Donated by Unicef, the new dining hall at the dramatic arts
school has been built in traditional style.
   The gains of the last 10 years have been made through
sheer hard work and with limited funding. Yet the will is
strong. "One of the reasons why so much effort is being put
into this field is that the people know if they do not have
their culture, they are no longer Khmer. Classical arts are
probably more pure now than before because the people
realized the danger of losing everything," says Mr. Lobban.
"What is so interesting here is the people's sense of
history. When you talk of classical dance, you are referring
directly to Angkor and pre-Angkor times, and yet there is
continual reference to the classical in modern culture. Even
the children have a sense of history and will play at battles
between Khmer and Chams {the two ancient civilizations of the
region}."
   For the moment there are only occasional public
performances of classical Khmer dance, but the interest is
there. At a small show put on by students for visiting Unicef
officials, Khmer drivers and guides in the audience appeared
more enthralled than the guests. They laughed out loud at a
comic scene from the "Riemkay" masked dance drama.
   In his work at the Ministry of Culture, Mr. Lobban is
collaborating on a photo book cataloging the 5,000 gestures
of classical Khmer dance. He also is writing a volume
describing the 12 different forms of Khmer theater, including
various types of dance, music and shadow puppets.
   With a peaceful settlement to the Cambodian conflict still
to be found, continued success in the revival of classical
Khmer culture remains uncertain. "The next five years will be
critical," says Mr. Lobban. "Teachers are getting old, and
there is a generation gap between them and the students. If
we don't get organized now, it'll be too late. There is a
need to get knowledge out of old heads and into new heads or
on video."
   But he is optimistic. "There is a tremendous feeling that
it is going to happen. There was never a doubt in people's
minds that after 1979 they could rebuild their culture."
   Mr. Chheng expresses similar confidence in his quiet,
assured conversation. "Even though the country is at war, we
are opening secondary schools of fine arts in the provinces."

   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co.'s $100 million plan to surprise
consumers this summer has turned up some nasty surprises for
the company instead.
   In what Coke calls its biggest promotion ever, the
soft-drink giant has begun distributing 750,000 "MagiCans" --
seemingly ordinary 12-ounce cans of Coca-Cola Classic that
actually contain millions of dollars in cash and prizes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When a buyer pops the top, a device rises through the
opening in the can and displays a curled-up legal tender --
anywhere from $1 to $100 -- or a scroll of paper, redeemable
for prizes. To give the cans the feel of the real product,
Coke has partially filled them with water.
   But last week, an 11-year-old boy in North Andover, Mass.,
opened a so-called MagiCan and drank a clear liquid that his
mother described as "tasting and smelling like a cleaning
solution." Noting that she knew nothing about the promotion,
the mother, Robin Gendron, said she turned the can over to
local police, asking them if they could determine what was in
it.
   Upon inspecting the can, the police found the
prize-delivery mechanism and a $5 bill, and sent the liquid
to a laboratory for analysis, said Mrs. Gendron. The police
spokesman couldn't be reached.
   What happened in Massachusetts, a Coca-Cola spokesman said
yesterday, was "an isolated incident."
   Concerned Coca-Cola marketing officials have huddled for
the past two days to discuss how serious a problem they face.
The cans are the heart of a $100 million summer promotion
that features commercials with New Kids on the Block, a
popular vocal group, and giveaway promotions at fountain
outlets.
   The Coca-Cola spokesman confirmed that there have been
malfunctions in other cans, but said that there were "fewer
than 10." He said the company is looking into the problem.
   The early reading, according to one person familiar with
the discussions, is that Coke believes the can problems are
more of an isolated nuisance than a widespread nightmare.
   Ever willing to jump on its main rival's mishaps, Pepsi
turned up Tuesday on the doorstep of the Massachusetts youth.
A local Pepsi sales manager, performing what the company
described as a "good-will" visit, offered the boy a couple of
cases of Pepsi, as well as several Pepsi hats and towels.
   Mrs. Gendron said she has mixed feelings about the affair.
Her son, she said, "was thrilled to have the $5, as any
11-year-old would be." She added, however, "Knowingly putting
something in a can that says Coke -- but isn't -- doesn't
make a lot of sense to me."

   Speaking of Business:
   It's Not How Much You Pay CEOs -- but How
   ----

   The cover of Business Week earlier this month showed Craig
R. McCaw, founder of McCaw Cellular Communications, the
nation's largest cellular phone company. Last year, according
to the magazine, his total compensation of $53.9 million made
him No. 1 among chief executives. That's a nice bundle,
especially for the CEO of a company that has yet to earn a
dime.
   Some McCaw investors, Business Week says, are beginning to
wonder whether Mr. McCaw isn't overdoing it. But Michael
Jensen and Kevin Murphy argue that we should look not at the
total amount of executive pay but at the way it is paid. Mr.
Jensen, who teaches at Harvard Business School, and Mr.
Murphy, who is at the William E. Simon Graduate Business
School at the University of Rochester, offer their views in a
Harvard working paper.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As it happens, Mr. McCaw last year was paid $289,000 in
salary and bonuses. The rest of his income came from exercise
of stock options. If he holds on to a great deal of that
stock, he is moving in a direction that Mr. Jensen and Mr.
Murphy will like: His future earnings will depend heavily on
just how well McCaw does.
   The two professors suggest three steps to make corporate
CEOs more accountable: Boards can require that CEOs hold
substantial amounts of company stock. Salaries, bonuses and
stock options can be structured so as to provide big rewards
for superior performance and big penalties for poor
performance. The threat of dismissal for poor performance can
be made real.
   "In most publicly held companies," the authors write, "the
compensation of top executives is virtually independent of
performance. On average, corporate America pays its most
important leaders like bureaucrats. Is it any wonder then
that so many CEOs act like bureaucrats rather than the value
-- maximizing entrepreneurs companies need to enhance their
standing in world markets?"
   U.S. CEOs earn several times as much as their counterparts
in Japan and Germany. American chief executives, however,
still haven't caught up with U.S. corporate leaders of a
half-century ago.
   According to the study, the average salary and bonus for
CEOs of leading companies on the New York Stock Exchange
during the period 1934 through 1938 was $882,000, in 1988
dollars. This compares with $843,000 for 1982-88.
   The study also showed that, with respect to pay for
performance, CEO compensation "is getting worse. . . . The
most powerful link between shareholder wealth and executive
wealth is direct stock ownership by the CEO. Yet CEO stock
ownership for large public companies, measured as a
percentage of total shares outstanding, was 10 times greater
in the 1930s than in the 1980s. Even over the last 15 years,
CEO holdings as a percentage of corporate value have
declined."
   All the public complaints about the levels of executive
compensation do a lot of harm, the authors contend. Corporate
directors, leery of likely publicity, shy from writing
employment contracts that would reward CEOs handsomely for
superior performance, even though such contracts would
penalize the executives for poor performance.
   One reason directors may not force perform-or-be-punished
contracts on CEOs is that chief executives often are very
close to the directors. Boards' compensation committees
usually are composed of outside directors, but the outsiders
usually have been chosen with at least the advice and counsel
of the CEOs.
   Messrs. Jensen and Murphy would like companies not only to
punish CEOs with pay cuts, if they deserve them, but to boot
them out now and then. The authors are annoyed by the fact
that chief executives seem to become corporate fixtures,
whether they're doing a good job or not. "On average," they
write, "CEOs in our base sample (2,505 CEOs) hold their jobs
for more than 10 years before stepping down, and most give up
their title (but not their seat on the board) only upon
reaching normal retirement age." The authors cite two other
studies, spanning 20 years and more than 500 management
changes, that showed only 20 cases where CEOs left their jobs
because of poor performance.
   While tying the executives' compensation to the fate of
the company stock has advantages, it also has weaknesses. The
stock market often moves in mysterious ways, not always
governed by the company's current financial results. That's
why the Jensen-Murphy study would like to see companies make
innovative use of cash compensation, something that few of
them now do. In fairness, such plans should be based on the
company's results in relation to similarly situated firms.
   Someone may object that CEOs are motivated by
considerations other than money: the beautiful offices,
limousines, airplanes and other perquisites that often go to
chief executives. These things go with the job and to some
extent always will. But they have a major disadvantage as
incentives to performance. If a CEO leads a company to a bad
year, it's not likely the board will move him out of his
office and into a broom closet. Cash is easily paid and
fairly easily taken away.
   If the compensation system were reformed as Messrs. Jensen
and Murphy suggest, they reckon that the average CEO would
probably make more money. But a number of current chief
executives would lose their jobs and the high pay would
attract talented men and women to take their places.
   The individual companies and the economy would be better
served.

   Canadian Pacific, Rogers Venture Vies
   For Canada Long-Distance Phone Market

   OTTAWA -- Unitel Communications Inc., jointly owned by
Canadian Pacific Ltd. and Rogers Communications Inc., applied
to Canadian regulators for permission to compete in Canada's
highly lucrative long-distance telephone market.
   Long-distance telephone service is currently provided, on
a regulated monopoly basis, by one company in each of the
country's 10 provinces. Cross-country services are
coordinated by a telephone-company association, Telecom
Canada.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The federal regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission, rejected a previous Unitel bid
in 1985 to enter the long-distance market because of concerns
over the financial feasibility of its plan. But Unitel
President George Harvey said he was confident that the new
application will be successful because of what he said would
be the potential benefits from competition. Unitel,
previously known as CNCP Telecommunications, operates a
nationwide telecommunications network, providing private
line, data, video and audio services.
   Mr. Harvey predicted a "tough fight" with the phone
companies, centering on their "scaremongering" claims that
long-distance competition would result in sharply higher
charges for basic local phone service, which is heavily
subsidized by long-distance revenues.
   The Unitel executive said competition need not prompt
higher local phone rates, because he predicted competition
would expand the telephone market. But Bell Canada, the
largest Canadian telephone company, said that in the U.S.,
which has had regulated competition for long distance since
1978, local rates rose by 100% from 1978 to 1989. Average
flat monthly rates in the U.S. are almost double those of
Bell Canada, the utility said.
   Bell Canada, a unit of BCE Inc., said it is able to keep
local rates low by subsidizing them with 65 cents of every
dollar it earns from long-distance business.
   The utility, which operates in Quebec, Ontario and the
country's far-northern regions, said that since 1983 the cost
of its local and long-distance services, including taxes, has
declined by 3.5% while the cost of U.S. services has
increased 18%.
   Some major Canadian companies, including Royal Bank of
Canada, support long-distance phone competition because they
say they believe it will produce technical advances and lower
phone rates. Unitel said it is cheaper for a Canadian
businessman in Vancouver to route a Toronto phone call
through the U.S. than to place it entirely through the
current Canadian long-distance network.
   Unitel's application asked that its proposed regulated
long-distance rates be set 15% below those of the telephone
companies in order to give the company a chance to gain a
foothold in the business. But Bell Canada said Unitel is no
infant enterprise trying to establish itself.
   Its owners, Canadian Pacific and Rogers
Telecommunications, are two large companies that want "a
chance to creamskim long distance with an average 15%
regulated price differential," said Bell Canada President
Jean Monty.
   To provide long-distance service to businesses and homes,
Unitel asked for permission to interconnect its system with
the local networks of the federally regulated phone companies
in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. It also
intends to seek access to the long-distance markets of
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, provided Parliament
approves proposed legislation that would bring the
provincially owned telephone utilities in the three provinces
under the control of federal regulators.
   On the Toronto Stock Exchange, BCE closed at C$39.125 a
share, off 25 Canadian cents. Rogers Communications' B shares
closed at C$8 each, down 75 cents, and Canadian Pacific
closed at C$21.375 a share, off 25 cents.

   Beer Import Curbs

   OTTAWA -- G. Heileman Brewing Co. of LaCrosse, Wis., filed
a complaint with the U.S. government against Canadian import
restrictions that it said are costing it a potentially
attractive market for its beer.
   Heileman said its petition under Section 301 of the U.S.
Trade Act calls for U.S. retaliation against the allegedly
discriminatory practices of provincial government beer
outlets in pricing and distribution of U.S. beer. Heileman, a
unit of Bond Corp. Holdings of Australia, said the trade
barriers prevent Canadian consumers access to U.S. beer at
"fair-market prices, which are considerably less than the
prices charged by Canadian brewers."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Provincial liquor-control authorities can limit the number
of listings granted to imported brands in government-owned
liquor stores.
   Provincial practices place an "unjustifiable, unreasonable
and discriminatory burden on U.S. commerce," said Bob
Bennardo, Heileman managing director.
   Heileman and some other U.S. brewers had made significant
inroads into the Canadian market by cutting prices of brands
listed in government-controlled stores. But, responding to
complaints from Canadian breweries, the Ontario government
last summer boosted the handling charges for imported U.S.
beer by 57 U.S. cents for six cans or bottles. Heileman said
sales of its Lone Star brand fell from a peak of 350,000
cases a month in Ontario to 2,000 cases after the markup was
introduced.
   Canadian breweries have close links with some major U.S.
breweries, producing under license leading brands such as
Budweiser, Coors and Miller, which are sold in Canada in
industry-owned stores. But brands such as Heileman's Lone
Star and Rainier can only be purchased in provincial
government-owned stores at what Heileman says are unfairly
high prices.
   Heileman is the fifth-largest brewer in the U.S., where it
has been hurt by declining sales. A Heileman spokesman said
at a news conference that the trade complaint wasn't
initiated because of the company's financial problems.
   A spokeswoman for the Brewers Association of Canada, an
industry group, said sales of imported beer from the U.S.
have grown 150% since 1987 and listings of U.S. imports are
up 21%. "The market in Canada really has been opening up over
the past few years," she said. "We don't think (Heileman) has
much of a case."
   U.S. imports account for 4% of the Canadian market. In
some provinces, including Alberta and British Columbia, the
market share is about 10%.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Canadian Trade
Minister John Crosbie are expected to discuss the issue at a
meeting tomorrow. A spokesman for the U.S. trade
representative said the office has 45 days to study the
petition.
   The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based
organization that regulates trade between most non-socialist
countries, already has ruled that practices used by
provincial liquor-control boards are unfairly discriminatory
against beer imports.

   U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Rufus Yerxa told the

   Subway Beggars Do Have a Message: Desperation

   Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin lived in the 1700s, and he
was an army officer, a statesman, and a lover of Catherine
the Great. Given that combination, he was for many years the
most powerful man in her empire. In 1787, when Catherine
toured the newly conquered Crimea, Potemkin is said to have
ordered the construction of sham villages, facades made of
cardboard, so that she would think all was well as she passed
through.
   Now, 200 years later, we have his ideological descendants
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Their
names are Francis Altimari and William Timbers, and last week
they built a Potemkin Village of their own: They ruled that
in the world of New York's subways, there's no such thing as
a beggar.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Anyone who goes down into a New York subway station, who
stands on a subway platform or who rides in a subway car
knows the system is peopled by beggars, many of them
homeless, most of them harmless, some of them frauds. These
people are desperate. Some are belligerent. Many are
aggressive. Few are polite. Together, they are a constant
reminder of the social problems besetting New York --
hopelessness and homelessness, disease and despair.
   Last fall, the agency that runs the subway system began
enforcing a longstanding ban on begging and panhandling in
the stations and on the trains. The Legal Center for the
Homeless sued on behalf of itself and two homeless men,
arguing that begging is a form of expression, a form of
speech, and that to ban begging is to violate the First
Amendment to our Constitution.
   The federal district court agreed.
   "A true test of one's commitment to constitutional
principles," Judge Leonard Sand wrote, "is the extent to
which recognition is given to the rights of those in our
midst who are the least affluent, least powerful and least
welcome."
   And no American is less affluent, less powerful or less
welcome than a beggar on the subway.
   Less welcome, especially, to the people who run the subway
agency. They appealed. And last week, in a two-to-one
decision, they won. Judge Sand was overruled.
   Beggars have no message, Judges Altimari and Timbers
wrote. They just want money. And that just threatens,
harasses and intimidates the 3.5 million people who use the
subways every working day, the judges said. Beggars, they
said, are "a menace to the common good."
   It's true that some beggars do threaten, harass and
intimidate. It's true, too, that it's hard to avoid an
aggressive beggar in the confines of a subway car. But the
beggars just want into the system, not necessarily into the
cars. They simply want the same rights given to solicitors
from organized charities, men and women who are allowed that
form of begging in certain areas of the city's 468 subway
stations.
   What is the distinction? A crippled beggar shaking a cup
is crying out every bit as much as the man primly carrying a
sign asking for contributions to save the rain forests. A
disheveled woman with a makeshift sign saying "I am homeless"
is communicating every bit as much as the well-dressed woman
politely asking for help to finance an anti-abortion group. A
wild-eyed man demanding help has a message every bit as
important as the message from the clean-scrubbed collegian
seeking money for animal rights.
   The distinction is this: The crippled beggar, the
disheveled woman, the wild-eyed man reflect the ills of
everyday life rather than the campaigns of everyday life.
We'll deal with causes, but we don't want to see ills. That,
at least, appears to be the distinction drawn by the transit
agency and upheld by the court.
   It's a sad distinction, and a wrong one.
   "In the seclusion of a judge's chambers, it is tempting to
assume that beggars could obtain jobs and spend their free
time distributing leaflets or buttonholing passersby in the
subway to further the cause of the homeless and poor," Judge
Thomas Meskill noted in dissent. But that is not the real
world. Beggars beg because they are desperate. They are
desperate for food, or shelter, or clothing, or medicine. For
attention. For help.
   No one knows how many beggars there are, or homeless, but
in New York City they are everywhere. They are in the parks
and the doorways, on the sidewalks and in the gutters. They
carry signs, they push shopping carts, they nurse babies.
   These men and women are speaking out in actions as well as
words, and their begging is probably saving their lives. It
is their job, in effect, their means of livelihood. They have
been stripped of all but that most precious possession,
freedom -- freedom to speak, to seek help, to broadcast their
woes, to make you uncomfortable.
   But now, in New York, they have been stripped of that
freedom, too. Now, the subways, teeming and steaming, will be
free of those pesky beggars begging for their lives.
   Catherine the Great would feel right at home.

   Mutual Funds:
   Mutual Funds With Low Turnover
   Find Penny Saved Is Penny Earned

   NEW YORK -- Many investors think rapid-fire buying and
selling is the hallmark of a top stock-fund manager.
   Not so, says the Scrooge school of mutual-fund investing.
These penny-pinchers say that one of the keys to investment
success is controlling costs, and that an important sign of a
thrifty fund is a low portfolio turnover rate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That admonition is controversial. Most stock-picking
styles involve a fair amount of buying and selling. By
avoiding high-turnover funds, investors end up ignoring the
vast majority of mutual funds.
   The penny-pinchers, it seems, may be right. Morningstar
Inc., a mutual-fund research firm in Chicago, looked at the
278 domestic stock funds that have been around for the past
decade. The firm found that the slowest 25% in terms of
turnover -- those that on average bought and sold just 23% of
their stocks each year -- returned 15.8% a year during the
decade ended April 30. That compares with 15.1% for the
average stock fund.
   No other group of funds did that well. The 25% of funds
with the most rapid portfolio turnover did minutely better
than average, while the middle two quartiles both trailed the
average fund's return by about 0.4% a year.
   Clearly, low turnover isn't going to save a lousy stock
picker, nor will high turnover make too much difference to a
talented fund manager. But for fund investors, steering clear
of high-turnover funds is like avoiding broker-sold funds
that charge sales commissions or those with high annual
expenses. It is just another way of tilting the odds in the
investor's favor.
   Less buying and selling of stocks clearly means lower
trading costs. But low portfolio turnover may also have other
benefits.
   Kenneth Gregory of San Francisco investment advisers
Litman/Gregory &amp; Co. encourages clients to own value-oriented
mutual funds as their core portfolio position. While Mr.
Gregory doesn't stress turnover when picking between funds,
he says a lot of his favorite value funds do have low
turnover.
   "The market focuses on a pretty short time horizon, maybe
six months to one year," says Mr. Gregory. "With value
players who are willing to take long-term positions, that
sort of time horizon seems to pay off. A low turnover may
indicate an investor who is dealing in a relatively
inefficient part of the market."
   Gerald Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter, a
Chicago-based newsletter, is surprised that the low-turnover
funds examined by Morningstar didn't do even better. He
thinks he has an explanation. "In the lower-turnover group,
you're going to find funds that invest in smaller company
stocks, and their performance hasn't been all that great
since June of 1983," he says.
   Mr. Perritt also thinks that the highest-turnover funds --
those that turn over their entire portfolios every eight
months, or at a 154% annual rate -- would look much worse on
a risk-adjusted basis. "I would suspect that funds with
average portfolio turnover of 154% are extremely risky," he
says. "Why would you have 154% turnover unless you were
dealing with volatile stocks?"
   High portfolio turnover also leads to quicker realization
of capital gains as winning stocks are sold, gains that are
taxable for investors. By hanging onto winning stock
positions, a low-turnover fund is effectively sheltering
shareholders from capital gains taxes.
   Morningstar's results jibe with an earlier study done by
Mr. Perritt. In 1987, he looked at the 20 stock funds with
the highest and lowest turnover for the period 1984-86. He
found the 20 low-turnover funds had a compound total return
of 50.7% during the three years, compared with 34.1% for the
high-turnover funds.
   The 278 funds Morningstar looked at had average turnover
of 79% during the 1980s. Turnover is measured by the lesser
of securities sales or purchases divided by average assets
during the year. For a fund with 79% turnover, that means the
average holding period for a stock is just over 15 months.
   Fund investors often don't realize how much turnover is
costing them in brokerage commissions and other transaction
costs. Though the turnover ratio can be found in a fund's
prospectus, and sometimes also in its annual report, the
actual amount of brokerage commissions paid is normally only
disclosed in a supplement to a fund's prospectus known as the
"statement of additional information." Moreover, brokerage
commissions are not included in the annual expense ratio
published by each fund.
   A peek at the statement of additional information for the
$150 million Century Shares Trust, which last year had
turnover of just 3%, shows it paid only $10,678 in
commissions to brokers. The $673 million Janus Fund, by
contrast, forked over $2.5 million in commissions for its
205% turnover.
   But the cost of turnover isn't just measured by the
brokerage commissions paid. Fund managers also have to
contend with the spread between the bid and ask price on a
stock, as well as the tendency for stock prices to move away
from a large buy or sell order.
   "The question is, what's the cost of a turn?" asks Mr.
Perritt. "That really depends on the market size of the stock
you turn. Most of us fund managers are paying anywhere
between four cents and eight cents per share. But the big
thing is the spread. The spread on a round-trip, large-block
trade is probably between 3% and 6%."
   James Craig, manager of the top-performing Janus Fund,
begs to disagree. Janus Fund, which returned 20.8% a year on
average over the past decade, regularly chalks up annual
portfolio turnover of 200%; that's the result of a
growth-stock orientation combined with a rigorous
stock-selling discipline. Mr. Craig says careful trading can
avoid huge trading spreads, and he argues that investors
should ignore portfolio turnover when picking between funds.
"The two most important things for mutual-fund investors are
volatility and return," he says.
   The low-turnover value funds favored by Mr. Gregory, the
investment adviser, include Lindner Fund, Selected American
Shares and Clipper Fund. Among low-turnover small-company
funds, Mr. Gregory likes Acorn Fund, Babson Enterprise Fund,
GIT Equity Trust-Special Growth and Pennsylvania Mutual Fund.
All these funds can be bought without paying a broker's
commission.

   Your Money Matters --
   College Advice to Parents:
   Start Saving Money Now

   Here's a multiple-choice question for parents: How much
will it to cost to send your kids to college?
   a) $500,000
</LP>
<TEXT>
   b) $50,000
   c) Nothing, since you'll never be able to afford it
anyway.
   Too often, parents are paralyzed by financial advisers who
sell so-called college-savings investments and equate the
cost of an undergraduate degree with the purchase price of a
B-2 bomber. But while college is expensive, it may be more
affordable than many parents think.
   In fact, parents with a two-year-old daughter who save
$419 a month will accumulate $163,334 by the time she starts
college, assuming an 8% annual return -- enough to cover the
projected average cost of four years at a private school. If
they send her to a public school, they will need $77,040, or
$198 a month.
   And there are some uncomplicated, no-fee ways for parents
to do their college saving. These include making regular
investments in no-load mutual funds, contributing the maximum
to 401(k) retirement plans at work, and prepaying mortgages.
   The most important thing to do is to find a simple plan,
start now and stick with it. Parents who wait until their
child is 10 to start saving will have to put aside $705 a
month to afford a private college.
   Unfortunately, the investment strategies financial
advisers frequently tell parents about involve
high-commission products purportedly designed for college
savings. "Most of them offer nothing special for college
savers except the name," says Richard E. Anderson, director
of the Forum on College Financing, a federally funded center
at Columbia University.
   Among the most common "college investments":
   -- Variable and universal life insurance policies offer
earnings that grow tax-deferred. Then, when the child goes to
college, parents can withdraw the premiums, or borrow against
the "cash value" (premiums plus earnings), at rates
comparable to market interest rates, plus or minus one to two
percentage points.
   But sales commissions, which are subtracted from policies
in the early years, keep cash values low, making the policies
suitable only for parents who plan to hold them at least 10
and preferably 15 years. In addition, a portion of the annual
premium goes toward the cost of term life insurance, which
reduces yields by cutting into the amount invested.
   "The tax advantage is what's driving the sale of these,"
says Glenn Daily, an insurance consultant in New York who has
analyzed the products. But everything considered, he says,
the tax advantage may not be enough to make the policies
worthwhile. "If you hold the policy for at least 10 years --
and optimally 20 -- you may do 0.5% to 0.7% better on an
annual basis than if you bought term insurance and invested
in similar taxable investments."
   -- Zero-coupon bonds, including tax-free zero-coupon
municipal bonds, are sold at a big discount to their face
value, making them accessible to many financially strapped
parents. So-called "baccalaureate bonds," offered by at least
12 states specifically for college savings have been
especially popular.
   The problem with all fixed-income investments is the
interest-rate risk between the time the investment is made
and when it matures. "If there's an upward shift in
inflation, the purchasing power of these bonds can be
drastically reduced," says Mr. Anderson, who next month
becomes vice chancellor of finance at Washington University
in St. Louis. Moreover, since zeros don't pay interest or
principal until maturity, their market value over the years
will fluctuate more than conventional bonds -- a problem if
they have to be sold before maturity.
   -- Prepaid tuition plans, which are offered by four
states, promise to cover the cost of four years at a state
school when the child is ready to attend. Parents "can prepay
up to four years of a college education in today's dollars,
essentially freezing the price so they don't have to worry
about investing their dollars in the interim period," says
Greg Stringer, president of Hemar Corp., St. Paul, Minn.,
which is developing a private prepaid-tuition plan that could
be used at schools nationwide.
   What parents get in simplicity, however, they give up in
flexibility. If their child doesn't attend a participating
school, they may get back only their principle, or at best a
4% return. "Parents should investigate cash-out provisions
carefully," says Mr. Anderson.
   -- "Income shifting," in which parents put college savings
in their child's name, is supposed to help money grow faster
by reducing the tax bite. The so-called kiddie tax has
crimped this approach a bit, by taxing unearned income of
children under age 14 at the parents' rate on amounts above
$1,000. But many financial advisers still suggest the
strategy, using investments that don't pay out earnings until
after the kids turn 14, when they'll be taxed at their lower
rate of 15%.
   In reality, however, the tax advantage may be of minimal
benefit. Say, for example, parents put $10,000 for their
child in Series EE Savings Bonds, which are free from state
taxes. Assuming a 7% yield, the value at maturity in 10 years
will be $18,221, after figuring taxes at the child's 15%
rate, says Jim Mulvaney, a tax manager at BDO Seidman, an
accounting firm in New York. Meanwhile, if the parents put
the same amount in a taxable investment yielding 9%, they'd
have $17,657 after 10 years, even taking into account federal
and state income taxes amounting to 35%. Mr. Mulvaney
suggests that parents consider AAA quality tax-exempt bonds.
At 7 1/8%, this couple would have $19,903.
   Fortunately, there are easier ways to save. "Ignore the
hype and choose an investment solely on its merits," says Mr.
Anderson of the Forum on College Financing. "Investing for
college is no different from investing for any other
long-term goal."
   Investment advisers say investing for growth makes the
most sense if parents have a long-term horizon. Then, as the
child approaches college age, parents should shift gradually
into fixed-income or money-market accounts, they say.
   One of the easiest ways for parents to save is by using
no-load mutual fund families, which enable parents to
allocate their money among growth, fixed income and other
types of funds. Many fund companies can arrange automatic
withdrawals from a parent's checking account, and a few,
including T. Rowe Price Associates, can arrange for automatic
payroll deductions.
   Another way to save that most parents overlook is by using
their 401(k) retirement plans at work. Contributions reduce
their taxable income and grow tax-deferred, and they are
often matched by employers at least 50 cents on the dollar.
Parents can allocate their savings among growth stock funds,
or guaranteed investment contracts that pay a fixed rate that
is often comparable to certificates of deposit. "There's no
way you can duplicate those kinds of benefits," says
Frederick Rumack, director of taxation at Buck Consultants, a
benefits consulting firm in New York.
   Parents often worry about tying up dollars they may need
for college. But many companies allow employees to borrow as
much as half of their 401(k) account balance, up to $50,000,
without taxes or penalties. Interest rates are low, says Mr.
Rumack, but parents will have to repay the money within five
years to keep the loan from being treated as a taxable
distribution.
   Even if parents can't borrow from their accounts, some
advisers recommend that they contribute as much as they can
anyway when children are younger. Then, while the child is in
college, they should quit funding the accounts and instead
use the money to pay for tuition.
   Another strategy to consider is prepaying a home mortgage.
By prepaying an additional $200 a month on a $100,000,
30-year 11% fixed-rate mortgage, parents of a three year-old
can pay off a loan in 15 years, and save $142,391 in
interest.
   "Meanwhile, the equity in their home has grown
tax-deferred, and is available to be withdrawn via a
home-equity loan (the interest on) which is also tax
deductible," says Marc Eisenson, author of "The Banker's
Secret," a book that discusses such strategies. With the
mortgage paid off, parents could also redirect the money from
mortgage payments toward tuition.
   The impact of this strategy on deductions for mortgage
interest is minimal. But if interest rates rise above the
rate one's paying, it won't make sense to prepay money that
could be earning a greater return, says Mr. Mulvaney of BDO
Seidman.

   Upbeat Mood Is Crimped Only

   PARIS -- Europe's current economic boom, fueled by unity
in the West and collapsing walls in the East, should be more
than capable of withstanding any slowdown in U.S. economic
growth, economists and businessmen here say.
   With factories in France and West Germany working close to
capacity, however, and West Germany preoccupied with the
costly task of absorbing East Germany, the risk of reignited
inflation on the continent remains high. Inflation in Britain
reached an eight-year high of 9.4% in April, and is expected
to near or top double figures before subsiding. British
industrial growth trails that of its continental partners.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But mainly the mood here is euphoric. "The outlook is
unremittingly rosy," says Jacques Plassard, the head of
Rexeco, a Paris forecasting company. "The main brake on
economic growth right now is not enough skilled workers and
industrial capacity. This should keep growth to a level of 3%
to 3.5% across Europe, which in turn should keep inflation
down in France and Germany." In the medium term, says Mr.
Plassard, the opening of Eastern Europe should solve Western
Europe's skilled labor and capacity problems much faster than
they would have been solved had the Iron Curtain stayed up.
   Mr. Plassard adds that European growth is now helping to
pull along the U.S. economy, a reversal of historical trends.
"France is running a trade deficit with the U.S., while the
German trade surplus with the U.S. is falling," he says. "So
two of its major trading partners are aiding U.S. growth."
   The Franco-German couple looks like it can exceed all
growth forecasts this year, just as it did last year. Both
countries' economies grew by about 4% last year, way ahead of
expectations. The West German economics ministry this week
raised its estimate for this year to 4%. The official French
statistical office INSEE currently pegs French growth at 3.4%
this year, but private economists expect that to be revised
up toward 4% as the year goes on. For the first time in many
years, France may even end the year with a lower inflation
rate than its neighbor.
   "The economies of France and Germany, as well as all of
Europe, are going to be drawn toward higher growth by the
needs of Eastern Europe," says French Finance Minister Pierre
Beregovoy. "And the fact that German unity is happening at
the same time as closer economic and monetary union in
Western Europe isn't a contradiction, but rather reinforces
both processes."
   The speedy reunification of Germany is forcing West German
companies, especially, to plan and make quicker, bigger
investments in the East, rather than sit on that money in
West German banks. Elsewhere, mergers, acquisitions and
investments continue to quicken on the continent as companies
prepare for the removal of most trade barriers within the
European Community by the end of 1992. "It's a pure case of
what (John Maynard) Keynes called the release of the animal
spirits of entrepreneurs," says Giles Keating, chief
economist for Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. in London.
"Europe in the 1990s will see a major increase in
investment."
   David Lomax, group chief economist at National Westminster
Bank in London, adds: "West Germany is the first beneficiary
of the investment boom, because it makes the capital goods in
Europe." Mr. Lomax estimates that East Germany alone will
absorb nearly $200 billion of investment over the next 10
years or so, which in itself would give a small but
measurable boost of between 0.5% and 1% to Europe's growth.
   But the real boost goes well beyond the figures. European,
especially West German, companies of all sizes are rushing to
either sell to Eastern Europe, invest in it, or both,
especially in East Germany. All the big West German banks are
opening branch networks in the East. Volkswagen AG will make
and sell cars there. Fiat S.p.A. has big plans in the Soviet
Union. Virtually every European carmaker is looking into
investing in or buying Skoda, the Czech auto company.
   In addition to private investment, Western governments
will inject more than $10 billion into Eastern Europe over
the next few years through official grants. "There is the
potential for a classic, investmentled expansion, with
incomes and productivity levels spreading across open
borders, just as classic economic theory tells us they will,"
Mr. Lomax adds.
   Managing this expansion is largely a question of keeping
inflation in check. West German inflation of about 4% is
worrisome to both the Bundesbank and securities markets,
which expect higher German interest rates and increased
inflation to pay for reunification. But so far, at least,
this inflation pressure hasn't spread to France, which
recently managed to cut interest rates a little. In Britain,
worrisome inflation is seen as largely self-generated, as
British wage increases have run well ahead of productivity
increases, and consumer demand has remained relatively
strong.
   Worries about German inflation and potentially big
interest-rate increases there to control it, have sent
jitters through the Frankfurt-based stock and bond markets.
But much of this money has found its way westward to Paris,
where the Bourse has recently touched record levels.
   Michel Develle, chief economist for Banque Paribas in
Paris, thinks inflation won't get out of hand, but he is also
much more pessimistic about the strength of Europe's economy
than are most of his colleagues. He sees growth slowing
everywhere, to under 4% in Germany, and to zero in Britain
and the U.S. This is "not at all a catastrophe," he says,
reasoning that slower growth will lessen inflationary
pressures.
   So far, Europe's higher-than-expected growth has had an
uneven impact on its higher-than-desired unemployment, which
is down nearly everywhere but not by much. In France, it
remains a stubborn 9.4% and in West Germany 7.3%, both well
above the U.S. figure of 5.4%. The British rate has dropped
steadily to 5.6%, but many economists expect it to rise
before it falls any further.
   Mr. Plassard of Rexeco says that both the French and
German figures are misleading. "Both countries face a big
shortage of skilled labor. The unemployment is among the
unskilled, or women seeking part-time jobs, or immigrants who
have been laid off from less-efficient enterprises. The
welfare systems also encourage less-skilled people to stay
unemployed rather than take a low-paying job."

   The stock market rally that carried the Dow Jones
Industrial Average to two consecutive records stalled amid
uncertainty about how much farther interest rates can fall.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.77 points to
2819.68 in active trading. The rally swept the Dow 84 points
higher since last Thursday, but gains tailed off to less than
a point Tuesday. The rally was triggered by perceptions
inflation was waning and interest rates were headed lower.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Long-term bond prices were modestly lower for the second
day in a row. The dollar ended mixed.
   Analysts said that despite the Dow Jones average's record
highs, investors remain wary about how much further stock
prices can climb without either substantial reductions in
interest rates or big gains in corporate earnings, neither of
which appears likely in the short term.
   "The stock market, no matter what happens, is not going to
go an awful lot further until we get through the first half
of the year and start to see better numbers on the earnings
front," said Harold MacKinney, head of the investment policy
committee at Fleet National Bank in Providence, R.I.
   Yet some traders contend that prices won't retreat very
far simply because money managers who didn't quickly jump
into the big rally Friday will view any price declines as
buying opportunities.
   The bond market's lack of any further gains after last
week's big rally is a major restraint on stock investors.
While the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
plunged to less than 8.7% from more than 9% in just two
weeks, the interest-rate decline stopped this week. Even good
news on inflation failed to get any rise out of bond prices
yesterday. The government reported that the consumer price
index rose 0.2% in April. Bond traders said the lack of
response to the data wasn't surprising given the substantial
price gains last Friday.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices slipped in active trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 160 million shares. Declining
issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 814 to 701.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost about an eighth of a point, or about $1.25 for each
$1,000 of face amount, for a yield of 8.63%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading the
currency was quoted at 1.6455 marks and 151.67 yen compared
with 1.6465 marks and 150.80 yen Tuesday.

   Food-Label
   Bill Clears
   House Panel

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- A food-labeling law moved closer to reality
as a House panel brushed aside the objections of a dozen
food-trade groups to adopt consumer-protection legislation.
   Designed to dispel consumer confusion over nutrition and
health claims, the bill would require food manufacturers to
use a uniform nutrition label that lists the amount of
calories, fat, salt and other nutrients in thousands of
packaged foods. The measure also would require the nation's
supermarkets and groceries to post information or distribute
brochures regarding the nutrition content of fruits and
vegetables as well as fresh fish.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bill, approved by the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, would empower the Food and Drug Administration to
regulate disease-prevention claims and health messages. It
also would authorize state agencies to enforce federal
labeling requirements.
   The measure, co-sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman (D.,
Calif.) and Rep. Edward Madigan (R., Ill.), would require
food manufacturers to relabel virtually all of their packaged
products within six months of enactment. Industry
representatives complained that it would take at least 18
months to relabel the 20,000 food products typically carried
by supermarkets.
   In the Senate, a companion food-labeling bill cleared the
Labor and Human Resources Committee by a 10-5 vote last month
and now awaits floor action.
   "The purpose of this legislation," said Mr. Waxman, "is to
make sense of the confusing array of nutrition labels that
confront all consumers every time they enter the
supermarket."
   But spokesmen for the food industry argued that the bill
doesn't go far enough in pre-empting state food-labeling laws
and warned that it would only bewilder shoppers.
   "We must have one set of national rules governing health
and disease information," asserted C. Manly Molpus, president
of the Grocery Manufacturers of America. "This bill fails
this critical test."
   Many in the industry fear a proliferation of state laws
patterned after California's Proposition 65. Passed in
November 1986, Proposition 65 requires manufacturers to put
health warnings on any food containing an ingredient believed
to pose a risk of cancer or birth defects.
   At the industry's behest, Mr. Madigan, the ranking
Republican on the Commerce Committee, proposed pre-empting
Proposition 65-type regulations. But Committee Chairman John
Dingell (D., Mich.) rejected the amendment, saying it wasn't
germane to the legislation since Proposition 65 applies to
carcinogens, not nutrients.
   The bill, among other things, would require that nutrition
claims such as "low" and "light" be consistent with
food-content definitions set by the FDA. "On some products,
`light' means low in fat; on others, such as some brands of
olive oil, it refers to the color of the product," said Mr.
Waxman. "The bill would correct this deceptive and misleading
state of affairs by requiring that {such} terms have a single
meaning."
   As for disease-prevention claims, such as bran prevents
cancer, none could be made until the FDA has reviewed the
scientific evidence and ruled on the validity of the claim.
Once a specific claim has been approved, any company could
make the claim so long as it was consistent with the FDA's
findings.
   But some food processors complain that the provisions on
disease claims are too narrowly drawn. "The bill is so
restrictive on what you can say that it is tantamount to a
no-health-message policy on foods," said Jeffrey Nedelman,
spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
   In a letter to Rep. Dingell this week, a phalanx of
food-trade groups, including the American Meat Institute,
National Grocers Association, Snack Food Association and
American Bakers Association, voiced "significant concerns"
about the legislation. They contended -- without mentioning
Proposition 65 -- that the bill would allow states to impose
different health-labeling laws and that these laws would
disrupt the nation's food-distribution system and jeopardize
food exports.
   Consumer advocates counter that both the House bill and
the Senate bill, drafted by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.,
Ohio), would provide uniformity in food labeling and
sufficiently empower the federal government to pre-empt state
laws.
   Lobbying efforts by some trade groups to broaden the
bill's pre-emption provision to cover Proposition 65 are
"simply an attempt to turn a piece of consumer-health
legislation into a Trojan horse that would void consumer and
environmental-protection measures across the country,"
asserted Bruce Silverglade, spokesman for Center for Science
in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group.
   Both bills would require disclosure of serving size, the
number of servings per container, the number of calories per
serving and the number of calories derived from total fat and
saturated fat in a serving. Both also would require
manufacturers to list the total amount of fat, saturated fat,
unsaturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, sugar, fiber, protein
and carbohydrates on the label.
   The bills would exempt, among other things, restaurant
food and prepared foods sold in delicatessens. They wouldn't
cover meat and poultry products, which are regulated by the
Agriculture Department.
   he House Commerce Committee, in a 24-19 vote, rejected an
amendment pushed by the Food Marketing Institute to exempt
fruits, vegetables and fresh fish from labeling requirements.
Under the Waxman-Madigan bill, supermarkets would have to
post nutrition information or distribute brochures regarding
only the 20 top-selling items in each category.
   Rules to carry out the legislation would be written by the
FDA, which already is working on a comprehensive
nutrition-labeling package. The agency also is sounding out
the public on proposed health-message regulations. The FDA's
proposal appears to dovetail with what lawmakers have in
mind, and the agency's regulatory timetable for issuing new
regulations -- by early 1991 -- appears to satisfy them as
well.

   To make sweeping, irresponsible statements about the

   Lawmakers Seek to Pass 1990 Farm Bill
   Before Summit Brings Any Subsidy Cuts

   WASHINGTON -- Farm policy makers in Congress are in a rush
to pass a politically palatable 1990 farm bill, putting off
until later any deep crop-subsidy cuts that may come out of
the budget summit.
   Such a legislative strategy would let Congress reauthorize
the government's expiring farm programs for another five
years and avoid the pain of slashing agricultural subsidies
until the fall or, conceivably, in a lame-duck session after
the November elections.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both the House and Senate appear inclined to hold the line
on farm spending by adopting a $53 billion proposal, roughly
what would be spent over the next five years if the 1985 farm
law were extended. At the same time, House and Senate
Democrats are contemplating various plans to boost farm
income, including tying subsidy payments to farm-production
costs or the consumer price index. But they would find
savings elsewhere in the farm budget to offset such subsidy
increases.
   The current thinking is that if the White House and
congressional negotiators reach a budget agreement, farm
lawmakers can always go back in September or December and
make whatever cuts are required of agriculture. With the
entire House and one-third of the Senate, including nine
Agriculture Committee members, up for re-election, this
approach has considerable bipartisan appeal.
   "Politically, you always look for the course of least
resistance," said Rep. Kika de la Garza, chairman of the
House Agriculture Commitee. "My estimation is that they can't
hit us with any more cuts. {But} if we need to do more, we
will."
   At this point, the consensus is that agriculture won't
have to take more than a $1.5 billion cut in fiscal 1991 --
about what the Bush administration has recommended. "There's
a strong case for freezing {commodity} target prices where
they're at," said Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.). "Frankly,
from the view of the House Budget Committee, that wouldn't be
all that bad."
   The administration proposes cutting farm-program spending
$19.2 billion over the next five years, while the Senate
budget resolution spares farmers from any cuts. The House
budget resolution calls for cuts totaling $8.1 billion,
including $800 million in fiscal 1991. But it insists that
these cuts be contingent on a summit agreement regarding
taxes or other revenue-raising measures.
   "In political and procedural terms, we won't be forcing
spending cuts until we have a revenue deal," said a Budget
Committee staff member. "That could be very much later this
year."
   Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
denounced several House Agriculture subcommittees for
exceeding the so-called spending baseline of $53 billion by
$14.3 billion. "Maybe these big, high numbers make good
campaign material back home, but the day of reckoning is
coming," Mr. Yeutter said.
   Mr. de la Garza (D., Texas), in turn, cautioned his
colleagues: "We have promised policies we don't have money
for." He now has a contingent of subcommittee chairmen and
ranking Republicans working to bring the budget numbers down.
   Taking a bloated farm bill to the House floor would be "a
big mistake," said Rep. Edward Madigan, ranking Republican on
the House Agriculture Committee. "It would be just inviting a
lot of trouble that the committee wouldn't be able to
handle."
   For one thing, a coalition of conservative Republicans and
big-city Democrats, led by Rep. Richard Armey (R., Texas) and
Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), is preparing to pounce on
the bill at the first opportunity. One of the coalition's
main objectives is to prohibit farmers earning $100,000 a
year or more from receiving farm subsidies. Some members also
have targeted certain programs, such as peanuts and sugar, as
being anti-consumer.
   "I think their presence dictates to the committee an extra
degree of fiscal responsibility," said Mr. Madigan of
Illinois.

   LONDON -- Europe's financial-services industry is headed
for major changes as the European Community's 1992 project to
knock down barriers to free trade becomes reality. With
increasing speed, the borders that protected banking markets
in West Germany, France, Britain and elsewhere are tumbling.
   Europe's ambitious plan is clearing a path for European
competitors, and for rivals from the U.S. and Japan, to tap a
single market of 320 million people. As a result, many banks
are embarking on an expensive wave of mergers and takeovers
to increase market share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While consumers anticipate such benefits as better service
and lower charges, many of Europe's bankers are headed for a
rude shock. Europe already has too many banks, with half the
deposits per capita of the U.S. but 20% more branches. That
situation is likely to worsen as the 1992 frenzy heats up.
   Increased competition, the opening of financial markets to
insurers and money-managers and a revolution in banking
technology probably will lead to a shake-out. The upheaval in
banking and finance, for centuries Europe's clubbiest of
businesses, could be greater than that confronting any other
industry.
   "The pace at which change is occurring is unprecedented,"
says Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse. "If you look at
history, bankers in Continental Europe have had pretty steady
development for the past 100 years. Now there is a new
situation, and I am sure a lot of mistakes are going to be
made."
   Harry Taylor, vice chairman of Safra Republic Holdings
S.A. and former president of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.,
likens the current European climate to the pressure-cooker
atmosphere in the U.S. when interstate-banking regulations
were changed, which led to hundreds of smaller banks being
swallowed up. Many of Europe's banks, Mr. Taylor says, "won't
be able to afford to continue as they have. Competition will
make margins shrink."
   A major factor behind the looming crunch is that national
trade barriers have allowed Europe's banks to remain
inefficient and under-competitive. Cashing a traveler's check
in Spain often can involve three tellers, two to process the
check and one to hand over the currency.
   Some French banks spend as much as 70% of their operating
income on overhead. By contrast, some U.S. banks spend only
55%. (The difference on average is narrower.)
   As a result, says Rodney Schwartz, a London-based banking
analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the number of
European commercial banks could be halved, to about 800.
   When the dust settles from the 1992 shake-out, experts
foresee a Europe dominated by perhaps 15 pan-European giants,
combinations of the 20 or so European banks currently in the
world's top 50. Other than America's Citicorp, no
non-European competitor is likely to rank among them.
   To prepare for Europe without borders, more than
two-thirds of Europe's publicly traded banks have engaged in
mergers, takeovers and collaborations in the past few years.
The merger pace is intensifying as 1992 nears. The biggest
impact is on retail banking, which provides most of European
bank profits and subsidizes the melee of wholesale and
commercial banking, where the Americans and Japanese are
bigger players.
   Europe's biggest banks, such as Deutsche Bank, National
Westminster Bank PLC and Banque Nationale de Paris, are
prospecting for opportunities in almost every member country
of the European Community. NatWest, one of Britain's biggest
clearing-house institutions, already has expanded its network
to more than 150 branches in Spain and has raised its stake
to 80% of Dutch merchant bank F. van Lanschot Bankiers.
   And yesterday, NatWest said it's holding talks with Credit
Commercial de France aimed at buying the French company's
L'Europeenne de Banque subsidiary. In Rotterdam, Radobank
Nederland, a major Dutch cooperative-banking group, and the
Robeco Group of investment trusts disclosed that they plan "a
lasting strategic alliance" though not a merger.
   At Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, an official says: "We want
to be a leading European bank, and active in every European
country." The thirst for growth has led the big German bank
to spend more than three billion marks in the past four years
buying a major Italian network from BankAmerica Corp., a
Portuguese investment firm and a Dutch trade-finance company.
In December, Deutsche Bank bought Morgan Grenfell Group PLC
for about $1.4 billion, the largest takeover of an
investment-banking firm in history.
   Now, with German unification on the horizon, Deutsche Bank
is leading a charge into East Germany, with plans to
establish as many as 100 branches in a cooperation accord
with East Germany's Deutsche Kreditbank. But "our focus still
is on Europe '92," says the official, adding that it may be
years before Eastern Europe becomes an attractive banking
market.
   But for most banks, combinations thus far have been
amicable, arm-linking exercises to fend off even-bigger
interlopers and protect their home turf. Such deals "are
defensive," says Safra Republic's Mr. Taylor. "Banks are
making themselves units of a size indigestible to the vast
majority of other European banks."
   The volume and size of such combinations already are
stunning. Holland's two biggest banks, Amsterdam-Rotterdam
Bank N.V. and Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. are discussing a
combination to create Europe's seventh-largest bank, with a
40% share of certain home markets.
   Other mergers involving more than $125 billion in assets
have created Norway's and Denmark's biggest banks, and
shuffled the list of leaders in Sweden. In Spain, Banco
Hispano Americano bought 5% of Germany's Commerzbank, which
owns 10% of Hispano.
   The U.S. players in Europe, meanwhile, are split. Buffeted
by tough problems at home and burned in previous European
expansion, many U.S. banks are pulling in their horns.
   Only Citicorp is given much chance of emerging a big
pan-European player in retail and wholesale financial
services. However, such financial-service companies as
American Express Co. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. are making a
strong push in some European markets.
   Citicorp, already big in Europe with 18,000 employees in
21 countries, still is building. It may double its office
network through acquisitions -- though it won't say where --
and hopes to almost double its share of European households
with which it does business to 5% in the next few years. Its
strategy is to offer new products, such as mortgages in
Britain, insurance in Belgium and car loans in Italy, while
hammering at costs.
   James Robinson, American Express's chairman, told a Paris
gathering last week that Europe's market for charge cards "is
barely penetrated."
   Meantime, Japanese institutions are steadily increasing
their presence as the prospect of 1992 lures more of their
domestic clients to Europe.
   Bank of Yokohama acquired control of Britain's Guinness
Mahon Holdings PLC last year, and Sumitomo Bank has a
majority stake in Switzerland's Banca del Gottardo. Nomura
Securities Co. has doubled its European staff to about 2,000
in the past five years. "Europe has never been more
important," says an official. And the Japanese are expected
to become even more important players.
   The Eurobank marriages often make some strange bedfellows,
however, and some bankers are skeptical of the prospects for
success. Amro and ABN have been bitter rivals for a century,
and some bankers familiar with the two institutions say
combining their businesses may prove difficult.
   Previous betrothals, such as Amro's earlier plan to merge
with Belgium's Generale de Banque S.A., have fallen apart
because of the inability to bridge corporate-culture
differences, and to make tough decisions on cost-cutting and
strategy.
   Many experienced bankers warn that such alliances, while
creating a much stronger player if successful, often are
difficult to implement. "They are only as strong as the
weakest link. And the perfect balance is difficult to
achieve," says Credit Suisse's Mr. Gut.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Stocks Close Mixed; Industrials
   Snap Four-Day Streak of Gains

   NEW YORK -- Stocks closed mixed as investors took profits
in big stocks and searched for bargains in smaller issues.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.77 lower at
2819.68, snapping a fourday streak of gains. Declining New
York Stock Exchange issues outpaced advancers by 814 to 701,
and volume totaled 159,810,000 shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
dropped 0.28 to 354.00, and the New York Stock Exchange
composite index slipped 0.17 to 193.14. But the Nasdaq
composite index gained 0.43 to 442.93.
   Traders said institutional investors put in a busy day,
taking profits in technology shares and financial stocks, and
buying up some health and retail issues. Compaq Computer
slipped 3/8 to 114 1/8, while Digital Equipment eased 1 5/8
to 88 3/8. Humana gained 1 1/8 to 46 1/8.
   Bond and stock investors shrugged off the consumer price
report that showed an increase of 0.2% last month, slightly
below what economists expected. Now many are turning their
attention to tomorrow's expiration of May stock-index
futures, index options and options on individual stocks. The
expiration could be very active and possibly volatile,
traders said, because positions that were taken in last
Friday's big rally may be unwound this week.
   Meanwhile, investors are cautious, but discernibly
positive on the outlook for stocks. Michael L. Schonberg,
chief investment strategist at Chase Investors Management
Corp., thinks the market is in "a new bull leg." Mr.
Schonberg said he is fully invested, but he continues to
concentrate on growth stocks rather than seeking a broad
exposure. "The cyclical rebound in economic activity isn't
here yet," he said.
   James Awad, president at BMI Capital, a money management
company, said that he has been paring down cash levels from
about 40% in April to about 25% currently. Mr. Awad said
declining interest rates should refuel economic activity
providing a bottom for corporate profits in the second half
of the year. Additionally, he believes prices of a number of
secondary issues seem to have hit bottom and are turning
higher.
   Disappointment with Hewlett-Packard's financial
performance in its fiscal second quarter sent the stock
tumbling 1 7/8 to 46 1/8 in Big Board-composite trading of
1.8 million shares. The company's net income for the three
months ended in April dropped 8.4% from a year earlier and
fell short of most analysts' estimates.
   Several analysts said they would lower their fiscal 1990
earnings estimates on the company, citing concerns that
low-end products are accounting for an increasing percentage
of its sales, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. Hewlett-Packard "can still live profitably and
successfully with low-end products, but they need to cut
operating costs much more in order to do so," said Timothy R.
McCallum, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.
   Monsanto continued a decline that began Tuesday after
Goldman Sachs lowered the stock's investment rating and First
Boston reiterated a sell recommendation on the stock. After
losing 5 points in Big Board trading Tuesday, the stock
dropped 2 1/2 to 101 1/4.
   Goldman cited soft April sales for Lasso and Roundup, the
company's major agricultural chemicals, as a reason for its
downgrading of Monsanto. Meanwhile, First Boston noted that
Elan is close to obtaining approval from U.S. regulators for
a drug that would compete with Calan, the company's
calcium-channel blocker.
   Castle &amp; Cooke, which said it would delay the proposed
spinoff of its Dole Food unit to shareholders, skidded 4 to
32 1/8 on 1.3 million shares. The company's board decided
that acceptable financing for the real-estate development
business that would remain after the spinoff wouldn't be
available.
   Circle K plummeted 7/8 to 1 1/8 on 3.1 million shares in
response to its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection, submitted after the company failed in an effort
to get creditors to agree to a restructuring of its $1.1
billion in junk-bond debt.
   Alcan Aluminium topped the Big Board's list of most active
issues for the second consecutive session as a result of huge
institutional trades designed to capture its quarterly
dividend. The stock, which went down 1/4 to 21 1/4 on nearly
9.2 million shares, carries a 5.2% dividend yield; the record
date for its next payout is tomorrow.
   Syntex gained 1 3/8 to 55 1/8 after Merrill Lynch selected
the issue as its "focus stock of the week." Analyst Richard
Vietor said Syntex is worth $60 a share based on fundamentals
and is "the most undervalued of the drug stocks," according
to the investor report.
   Sotheby's Holdings climbed 1 1/4 to 18 5/8 in the wake of
an auction of impressionist and post-impressionist works at
Christie's Tuesday night, at which "Portrait of Dr. Gachet"
by Vincent van Gogh was sold for a record $82.5 million.
   Glaxo Holdings slid 5/8 to 26 7/8 after Sweden's Astra AB
reported that its ulcer drug Losec, which competes with
Glaxo's drug Zantac, has been gaining acceptance in European
markets since its introduction late last year.
   Manville fell 1/2 to 6 1/2 after U.S. and New York state
judges ordered the trust that the company established to pay
the claims of asbestos victims to account for a shortage in
funds. The judges also raised the possibility that they may
order drastic measures to ensure that the trust and Manville
make payments more rapidly.
   Perkin-Elmer advanced 7/8 to 22. The company agreed to
sell a majority stake in its optical-lithography operations
to a group that includes Silicon Valley Group and
International Business Machines.
   Ohio Edison, which reached a conditional agreement in its
pending rate case before Ohio regulators, gained 1/2 to 20
1/8. The company said the proposed three-year accord would
allow its revenue to rise 4.65% this year, 4.35% in 1991 and
2.65% in 1992.
   Time Warner slid 1 5/8 to 94 1/4 after the New York City
Board of Estimate voted to issue a preliminary denial of the
company's application to renew its two cabletelevision
franchises in Manhattan.
   Baltimore Bancorp dropped 7/8 to 14. The company rejected
a $217 million takeover offer from First Maryland Bancorp, a
unit of Allied Irish Banks, and said it wasn't for sale.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.12
to 353.68. Amex volume totaled 12,187,230 shares, compared
with 14,512,035 shares Tuesday. There were 265 issues
advancing, 293 declining and 281 unchanged.
   Sbarro rose 1 1/2 to 28 1/4. The company reported that net
income for the first quarter ended April 22 was more than 40%
higher than in the comparable year-earlier period.
   Landmark Land gained 1/2 to 10 7/8. The company, which
agreed to sell a substantial portion of its real-estate
holdings, put itself up for sale and said it would consider
selling additional assets as well.
   AT&amp;E gained 1 1/2 to 19 1/2. Analysts attributed the
stock's strength to optimism about the prospects for the
company's Receptor message watch, which is currently being
tested in the Portland, Ore., area.

<LP>
   Maybe George Bush convened the budget summit because he
felt sorry for Washington. Out in places like Prague, Riga,
Mexico City and Moscow, democracies are being created, ideas
are flying and national systems are being transformed. Back
in Washington, the inheritors of the Constitutional
Convention are spending the best years of their lives on . .
. parental leave, Section 301, and carbon dioxide buildup in
the atmosphere.
   So it's heartening to see the old juices flowing again.
Democrats ripping Dick Darman. Another press run at John
Sununu's power. The smell of the White House putting the tax
fat in the fire. Republicans gagging. Sunday-morning viewers
abandoning the excitements of the Discovery Channel to watch
the talk shows again. But George Bush is a shrewd man, and we
suspect he knows that one of the great attributes of the
American political circus is that if you pull enough people
under the big top, a few may go off in a corner and
accomplish something serious -- such as getting a rope around
the out-of-control federal budget.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The spending side of the federal budget has had quite a
run 16 years to be exact. It began back in 1974 with passage
of the ironically titled Budget Reform Act. One of the act's
chief "reforms" was to eviscerate the President's rescission
authority, or the power to trim back spending levels. One
year after the new budget law, spending as a percentage of
GNP had jumped from 19% to 21.8%. Except for 1979, it has
never fallen below 21%. Yet on Monday, Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Jim Sasser announced with the confidence
of a man who has been at it since 1977, "The problem is not
the process. The problem is that revenues do not match
outlays."
   How ungrateful of the American people the past 16 years
not to convey tax payments equal to the spending commitments
made by Senator Sasser on their behalf. How irresponsible for
the citizenry to have created these deficits by voting in the
last three presidential elections for men who opposed raising
federal receipts to cover the outlays of Senator Sasser's
blameless "process."
   In the accompanying chart, we depict the level of budget
receipts collected by Washington since the end of World War
II (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ May 17, 1990). Note
that taxes today as a percentage of GNP are roughly at levels
seen only during the wartime periods of Vietnam and Korea.
   Therefore we disagree emphatically with those members of
the Washington establishment who, like former congressional
budget office head Alice Rivlin, are now describing proposals
to reform the process "mostly diversionary." Ms. Rivlin, like
Senator Sasser, simply wants taxes hiked. As to the spending
cuts, well, we all have read articles and heard calls on the
TV talk shows for a gas tax, liquor tax, tobacco tax, sales
tax, VAT tax, user fees, pollution tax, popping the bubble
and taxing the rich. But has anyone read a single, serious,
detailed article about spending cuts?
   In fact, the Democratic delegates to the budget summit
came out of the White House Tuesday saying that they wanted
the President to go on national TV and propose spending cuts.
News reports yesterday on the summit had the Democrats saying
that the President had to take responsibility for financial
sacrifices, and the President had to help them sell the hard
decisions to their constituents.
   Yet let anyone suggest that this same President should
have line-item veto authority or even enhanced rescission
power and suddenly Senator Byrd is back on Mount Olympus:
"You eliminate the need for Congress." Senator Hatch: "It
would give the President an unprecedented power to play
politics with the budget." Heaven forfend]
   But of course it would allow the President to play
hardball with the 535 members of Congress who for 16 years
have pushed spending through "omnibus appropriations" and
"supplementals" to its current level of $1.2 trillion.
   Process reforms are not a diversion. They must be at the
heart of any serious agreement to tame the deficit if the
deal is to withstand future assaults by Congress's spenders.
   Finally, if the parties to this budget summit come away
with a deal that raises taxes higher than current levels with
no lasting institutional reform, then the case grows for a
constitutional 12-year limit on congressional terms.

   NEW YORK -- Citicorp's Citibank Private Bank unit named
James R. Hocking chief investment officer of the U.S.
Investment division, signaling the bank's determination to
raise its profile as a manager of assets for wealthier
individuals.
   Mr. Hocking, 60 years old, joins Citibank from Templeton
International, a unit of Templeton Galbraith &amp; Hansberger
Ltd., the London money manager. As senior vice president and
portfolio manager there, his responsibilities included
creating and marketing mutual funds and managing portfolios.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At Citibank, he will oversee more than 50 portfolio
managers who invest $15 billion for individuals of high net
worth. And Mr. Hocking will direct the bank's efforts for
U.S. customers who want to invest in overseas securities.
   In October 1988, Citicorp sold its Citicorp Investment
Management Inc. subsidiary, which invested pension-fund
assets for U.S. institutions. Other banks also have sold such
operations, which are "highly price-competitive," said David
E. Gibson, Citicorp's group executive for global private
banking. The company did maintain its international
institutional business.
   But having sold the U.S. institutional line, the bank
resolved to boost its individual private-banking work. "We
have a big involvement and a big commitment" to individual
private banking, but "we don't have the public image," the
50-year-old Mr. Gibson said. Through "selected important
personnel," including Mr. Hocking, the bank hopes to boost
that profile, he added.

proposed the split, according to the annual-meeting proxy

development of its business opportunities." Savin, which is
55%-controlled by HCS Technology N.V. of the Netherlands,
hasn't yet set a record or payment date for the split. Savin
holders also passed a proposal under which HCS could continue
to receive dividends on the Savin Series C preferred shares
it holds, but HCS won't vote the shares that accrue as
dividends. HCS recently agreed to form a 50-50 joint venture

   GRAFTON GROUP Ltd. said in Toronto that it didn't declare
a quarterly dividend on its common or Class A shares because
of recent poor earnings and a depressed outlook for its
retail businesses. Grafton paid two Canadian cents (1.7 U.S.
cents) on each class of stock in March. It lowered the
quarterly dividend last June from eight Canadian cents.
Grafton is a retailer of apparel and footwear, which recently
announced plans to sell or close chains that sell womenswear,
discount merchandise and unisex casual wear and a
home-furnishing subsidiary. The company reported a loss of
24.5 million Canadian dollars (US$20.8 million), or C$1.38 a
share, for the year ended Jan. 31. Results included a loss of
C$29.1 million, or C$1.56 a share, from the units that it
plans to discontinue. In trading on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, Grafton Class A shares closed yesterday at C$4.60,
up 10 Canadian cents. The closely held common shares, which
last closed at C$4.50, didn't trade.

   Money Fund Yields
   Moved Upward
   In the Latest Week

<LP>
   Yields on money-market mutual funds turned up in the week
ended Tuesday, a delayed reaction to the uptick in short-term
interest rates of a couple of weeks ago.
   The average seven-day compound yield rose to 8% from
7.96%, the highest in more than three months, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Compound yields assume
reinvestment of dividends.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the 428 taxable funds tracked by the Holliston,
Mass.-based newsletter continued to fall, however, to $374.7
billion, their lowest point since mid-January. About $2.3
billion came out of money funds in the latest week, the
seventh consecutive weekly drop.
   Short-term interest rates have come down in the past week,
after rising for a time before that. The three-month Treasury
bill sold at Monday's auction, for instance, yielded 7.93%,
down from 8.06% the week before. But the yield on the
three-month bill was at 8.18% at the April 30 auction, up
from 8.05% the previous week.
   "We're wondering if {money fund} assets will work their
way back up again, now that rates have started to fall," said
Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report. She noted
that some of the cash withdrawn from money funds in recent
weeks probably went to buy higher-yielding Treasury
securities.
   Money-fund yields typically lag behind overall interest
rate trends, as fund managers vary the maturities of their
investments to get the best possible returns. The average
maturity remained at a fairly long 44 days for the fifth
consecutive week, according to Donoghue's, indicating that
there won't be any sharp swings in money-fund yields for at
least the next few weeks. Fund investments include such
things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
rose to 7.70% from 7.66%. The average 30-day simple yield
remained at 7.68%, while the 30-day compound average stayed
at 7.98%.
   Yields on tax-free funds fell for the second consecutive
week. The average seven-day compound yield, for instance,
slid to 5.67% from 5.74%. That's equal to 7.88% for an
investor in the 28% tax bracket and 8.46% for someone paying
taxes at a 33% rate.
   Assets of the 221 tax-exempt funds fell by $262.3 million,
to $75.3 billion. Average maturity shortened by a day, to 41
days.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- North Canadian Oils Ltd. said it plans
an offer to acquire the 13.5% of Bankeno Resources Ltd. that
it doesn't already own in a transaction valued at about 18
million Canadian dollars (US$15.3 million).
   If successful with its planned C$4.25-per-share offer,
North Canadian said it will merge with Bankeno. Both
companies are Calgary-based oil and gas producers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   North Canadian said it expects to mail its offer next
week. Grant Billing, North Canadian's senior vice president,
said the company hopes to complete the purchase by June,
subject to government and regulatory approvals.
   Mr. Billing is also president of Bankeno, which said
separately that its board plans to recommend acceptance of
the offer. In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday
Bankeno closed at C$4.20, up C$1.35 a share, and North
Canadian closed at C$18.125, unchanged.
   North Canadian's announcement follows its proposal Tuesday
to restructure the debt of Coseka Resources Ltd., of which it
owns 47.6%, and ultimately merge with it.
   Pending the outcome of talks with Coseka's lenders, who
collectively hold about C$165 million of debt, North Canadian
hopes also to conclude a merger with Coseka by June, said G.
Barry Padley, senior vice president, finance.
   Mr. Padley declined to offer details of the proposed
Coseka debt restructuring, or merger. But he said it would
largely involve cash. North Canadian had cash and short-term
investments of about C$250 million at the end of 1989.

   Pravda, the official Soviet Communist Party newspaper, has
turned downright capitalistic: It is about to throw its pages
open to U.S. advertisers.
   Pravda, which has almost never accepted advertising from
the West or anywhere else, began contacting more than 150 of
the nation's largest companies earlier this week, offering
them the chance to advertise in the Communist Party organ for
$50,000 a page. In a letter sent to chief executive officers,
I.N. Filipov, a Pravda representative, says the paper will
accept ads in conjunction with Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to
the U.S. in early June. The paper's goal: to make some money
off Western companies looking to break into perestroika-era
Soviet turf.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We must acknowledge that American corporations are
unknown to the Soviet public in general," Mr. Filipov says in
the letter. "Pravda is certainly the most influential
newspaper in the U.S.S.R. . . . Mr. Gorbachev himself starts
his day with reading Pravda," he adds.
   While the letter is tied to Mr. Gorbachev's visit to the
U.S., Pravda's push for U.S. advertisers isn't a one-shot
deal. "The plan is to start this on a regular basis," says
Victor Linnik, Pravda correspondent in New York who's
doubling as sales agent as the paper dips its toes into
advertising. Pravda "has been too slow in realizing the world
is new, it's changed, and we'd better think hard about the
commercial side of our business -- which actually we never
have," he says.
   Pravda follows the lead of Izvestia, the official
government newspaper, which began running Western advertising
in January. Pravda, though, appears to be the more aggressive
of the two. Mr. Linnik says that calls and letters went out
Tuesday to just about every major corporation you could name,
including the big oil companies, Procter &amp; Gamble,
McDonald's, Philip Morris, Gillette and PepsiCo.
   Response, however, has been mixed. A Philip Morris
spokeswoman says, "We would consider doing something" in
conjunction with Mr. Gorbachev's visit, "but what that could
be -- a corporate welcome down to a product ad -- I don't
know." Philip Morris, which owns General Foods and Miller
Brewing, has never advertised before in the Soviet Union.
   A Gillette marketing executive also expressed interest,
Pravda's Mr. Linnik says. Boston-based Gillette announced in
January that it may build a razor and blade factory in the
Soviet Union in a joint venture with a Soviet manufacturer.
But a Gillette spokeswoman says the company's interest in
advertising in the Soviet Union is "down the road. . . . We
can't even put a timetable on it."
   Some U.S. ad executives, though, expressed skepticism
about advertising in Pravda or elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
Most Western products and services aren't available there.
And for those that are, few Soviets have the hard currency
needed to buy them.
   What's more, ad executives say other Eastern European
countries are likely to open to Western businesses more
quickly than the Soviet Union. "The Eastern European economy
-- Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia -- seems to have more
entrepreneurial energy. It seems more likely to open up {to
Western advertisers} before the Soviet Union," says John
Bernbach, president of Omnicom's DDB Needham ad agency, whose
clients include Seagram and H.J. Heinz. "I'm not aware of any
of our clients that have immediate plans to go into the
Soviet Union."
   Some companies were just plain baffled by Pravda's
approach. Mr. Filipov's missive is a form letter faxed to
executives, some of whom weren't sure if it was real. The
letter offers "a chance to publish in Pravda a journalistic
story about your corporation including your own interview,
your ad and photographs of your products." It also tells
advertisers to "contact us immediately" so it can send a
correspondent. One executive at a Fortune 500 company says
she received a call from a Pravda representative but
dismissed it, because "I thought it was a joke."
   Pravda's Mr. Linnik, though, says that Pravda is selling
advertising, not news stories. The letter offers to send a
correspondent, he says, only because companies may need help
translating their ads.
   Pravda's quoted ad rate of $50,000 a page compares
favorably with that of U.S. publications. Pravda's
circulation is more than eight million, Mr. Linnik says. The
New York Times, whose Sunday edition has a circulation of 1.7
million, charges about $53,000 for a Sunday page. The Wall
Street Journal, with daily circulation of 1.9 million,
charges about $99,000 for a full page. Pravda, however, is
learning from its capitalist brethren quickly: The Pravda ad
rate, Mr. Linnik hastens to say, is "just a start-up price."
   Before it plunged into advertising itself, Izvestia
published an article last year saying that "Western
advertising could be very useful." Some Western companies
have been coming up with ingenious schemes to make themselves
household words. Pepsi created a flurry of publicity by
advertising on Soviet TV, for example, while the name
Olivetti flashes on TV screens for a full minute before the
main evening news program, superimposed on a ticking clock.
   "The Soviet Union these days looks like a giant potential
market," says Pravda's Mr. Linnik, acting in his new ad sales
role, "so I don't really think any of the serious-minded
companies would pass this opportunity -- or should, for that
matter."

   Lintas to Buy Small Shop
                                                                                                       

   Lintas: USA agreed in principle to acquire Hawley Martin
Partners, a tiny Richmond, Va., agency headed by David
Martin, who was previously chairman of Richmond's Martin
Agency.
   Hawley Martin, which has billings of $25 million, will
operate independently as a subsidiary of Lintas, which is a
unit of Interpublic Group. Terms of the transaction, a cash
deal, weren't disclosed.
   Mr. Martin left the Martin Agency, which he founded in
1965, last year, saying the shop had its "management team in
place and it was ready to roll." That agency, which is owned
by Scali, McCabe, Sloves, has gained notice as one of the
more creative regional agencies.
   "The Lintas connection expands our ability to serve
clients in our particular part of the world with greater
resources," said Mr. Martin, Hawley Martin's chairman. Hawley
Martin clients include Eskimo Pie Corp. and Riggs National
Bank.

   A Soviet circus troupe has chosen to remain in a motel in
Atlanta, rather than go back to the Soviet Union. Members of
the Great Circus Bim Bom ran out of money shortly after
starting their U.S. tour, but have turned down an offer of
tickets home. Businessman Steven Leber says they "would
rather be here making no money." We guess this means that
even zero dollars are still worth more than perestroika's
rubles.

   Your April 6 article "Schoolteachers Say It's Wrongheaded
to Try to Teach Students What's Right" fills me with disgust
and despair. Of course, it is wrong to "pick up" a bicycle on
the street for one's child. Of course, it is right to rush
"into a burning building to save" a life. Of course, it is
right to lift "the moral standards of students above those of
their parents." I was under the impression that this was the
very essence of public education in America-socialization of
children to the core values of our culture. Every culture
must have some set of agreed-upon values. Without that
consensus, a society disintegrates into an agglomeration of
individuals, into chaos.
   Fortunately for my peers and me, our teachers did not
suffer from cultural ambiguity. They informed us clearly as
to why the Pilgrims left England. Must we now apologize that
religious freedom is a central value in this country?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I am sick of the apologies and excuses. Are the core
values of "white, middle-class" America so inappropriate to
1990? Are respect, responsibility, compassion, honesty and
courage passe? If that is the case, then the future of
America is grim indeed.

   I do not want schoolteachers teaching my daughter values
and morals. Their job is to educate my child to prepare her
to locate, extricate and assimilate information to make up
her own mind. And, it is hoped, they can teach her to
communicate, so that she might share her mind with others.
And I also expect them to have freedom to enforce the
discipline necessary to maintain an atmosphere conducive to
learning.
   I feel that it is my duty and my privilege to teach my
child values and morals at home. And I realize that the most
effective, if not the only, method I have at my disposal is
the example I set.
   My advice to this "growing number of parents, worried that
their children aren't building good character" is to take
stock of their own lives. What kind of role models are they
providing their children? Therein might very well lie the
reason why their children appear to be lacking in "good
character."

   I am a public-high-school teacher in my 35th year of
teaching. I share with the teachers of business education in
my high school the opinion that they would never want to do
business with many of the young people in their classes.
These young people are totally dedicated to the principle
that a citizen of the U.S. should be able to cheat and rip
off anyone as long as they don't get punished.
   I don't think that my students resent my teaching that
honesty is the best policy. I teach them the ethic of
Aristotle, that total honesty is the very heart of human
happiness and fulfillment. Whoever lies to himself or herself
and therefore lies to anyone else robs himself or herself of
the joy of being a fully integrated person. Any teacher in
public high schools who would avoid teaching the value of
basic honesty should never be a teacher of our children.
These children of our nation were not born corrupt. We teach
them to be corrupt. Any public-school teacher who avoids
teaching honesty teaches those children dishonesty. There are
no religious overtones to such teaching. Whether there be a
God or not has nothing to do with teaching children basic
honesty.

   Moral education taught in the manner suggested in your
article is nothing more than indoctrination. Indoctrination
is not education. Furthermore, what makes us think that the
moral and ethical decisions that our children will be making
in the future will be at all similar to the decisions we are
making today?
   Ethical and moral decisions are becoming increasingly
complex. Children need the tools and skills to make these
choices, not indoctrination. They need to be taught the
skills of ethical inquiry, skills that will improve their
reasoning ability and help them make better ethical decisions
not just today but tomorrow also.

   Through the 1960s and into the 1970s educators were forced
into the position of trying to teach a value-free education,
an impossible position, morally speaking. To teach a moral
stance was rather looked upon as trying to "impose values."
Responses to moral issues thus became a matter of preference,
sometimes looked upon with equal value. Philosophy, logic,
ethics and moral principles were something to be inferred
rather than directly taught.
   Creating a separate curriculum agenda on morality may be a
response to the weaknesses identified in the survey. It is
definitely fraught with the difficulties you have identified.

   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- World-wide semiconductor sales are
expected to remain flat this year compared with 1989, before
growing at a double-digit rate through 1993, the
Semiconductor Industry Association said.
   The trade group projected semiconductor sales would reach
$48.4 billion in 1990, down nearly 1% from 1989 sales of
$48.8 billion. In 1991, sales are projected at $54.5 billion,
a 12.8% increase from this year; in 1992, sales are expected
to total $65.2 billion; in 1993, sales are estimated at $74.7
billion, the trade group said.

   "For the most part, all market segments should experience
double-digit growth in 1991, 1992, and 1993," said Doug
Andrey, the trade group's director of industry statistics.
"Substantial growth in the MOS Logic and MOS Memory markets
will be the key factors for these increases."
   The market growth takes into account a stable U.S. dollar
exchange rate through the balance of the forecast, the trade
group said.

   Taiwan Stocks Plunge on Rise in U.S. Dollar;

   Concerns over a sharp rise in the U.S. dollar sent Taiwan
shares tumbling Wednesday, driving the weighted index down
5.96%, its second-largest single-day loss in percentage
terms.
   Tokyo stocks finished slightly lower and London shares
were firmer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan investors feared that a higher U.S. dollar is
accelerating capital outflow, hurting stock market
development.
   The U.S. dollar hit a 14-month high Tuesday, ending at
27.5 New Taiwan dollars, up sharply from 26.4351 Monday.
   "Shares are dropping like a slide," said one broker.
"Investors are panicking to dump stocks."
   Taiwan's weighted index, which advanced 294.53 points
Tuesday, plummeted 510.41 points, finishing at 8059.14, the
lowest closing level since July 15, 1989.
   Trading volume including stocks and mutual funds totaled
about 1.62 billion shares, up from 972.3 million Tuesday.
   Losers outpaced gainers by 193 to 2, with one stock ending
unchanged.
   The market opened firmer, fueled by gains on export-driven
sectors such as textiles and electronics. Players bought
these stocks as they thought a higher U.S. dollar would give
local companies a competitive edge. The index had an intraday
high of 8689.79 points, up 120.24.
   The strength, however, quickly disappeared as renewed
concerns over continued capital outflow prevailed and caused
bouts of selling, traders said.
   According to newspapers, Taiwan's capital outflow is
US$5.7 billion so far this year, compared with US$8.25
billion in 1989.
   "Capital outflow always afflicts investors as it means
less turnover in the stock market," said James Lin, assistant
manager of Ting Kong Securities Co.
   The market hit a record high at 12495.34 points on Feb. 10
and has since plunged more than 4,400 points, or 36%.
   A slip on the banking sector, in particular for Hua Nan
Commercial Bank, First Commercial Bank and Chang Hwa
Commercial Bank, added to the bearish sentiment.
   Analysts in general see a gloomy outlook for the market.
"With luck, the market will see a rebound here, but it will
again drop anyway," said Dickson Ho, senior analyst with W.I.
Carr (Taiwan) Ltd. "The market trend really looks bearish."
   Tokyo stock prices softened Wednesday in a tug of war
between bargain hunters and profit-takers, with the Nikkei
index finishing lower for the second consecutive day after
fluctuating narrowly on either side of 32000 points.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues closed down 29.42
points at 31967.62. The index fell 45.61 points Tuesday.
Trading lacked energy Wednesday, reflecting the absence of a
clear market focus, participants said.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 83.61 points to
close the morning session at 32051.23.
   On Wednesday, Shigeo Akiba, head of equity trading at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew International, said that following sharp
gains Monday and last Friday, when almost all shares moved
higher, "investors don't know what to do next."
   Prices ended mixed Wednesday as a result of rotational
buying among sectors and among different shares within a
sector, observers said. Sharp gains were noticeable in
certain stocks that appeared to be receiving heavy buying
from speculators' groups. The groups, hit hard by the decline
that began in January, are becoming active players in the
recent recovery of the market, traders said.
   Volume on the First Section was estimated at 750 million
shares, down from 926 million Tuesday. Advancing issues
outnumbered declining issues, 512 to 438, while 185 remained
unchanged.
   The broader-based index ended the day firmer, despite the
decline in the Nikkei. The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of
all issues listed in the First Section, which gained 8.46
points Tuesday, was up 4.99 points, or 0.21%, at 2403.77. The
Second Section index, which added 3.32 points Tuesday, was up
6.60 points, or 0.17%, to close at 3855.38. Volume in the
Second Section was estimated at 16 million shares, down from
18 million Tuesday.
   London shares finished firmer in moderate trading, pushed
higher on technical factors and improved sentiment among
investors about Britain's political and economic climate.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
up 8.9 points at 2221.1, substantially below its intraday
high of 2237.1 and above its early-morning low of 2213.2.
   The narrower FT 30-share index finished up 8.2 points at
1739.8. Volume was 460.6 million shares, better than the
402.4 million that changed hands Tuesday.
   In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2258.0, up from 2246.0 Tuesday.
   Sterling's early weakness didn't paint the most promising
picture for gains on the day, dealers said, but bears
covering short positions helped lift the market around
midafternoon. But a weak opening on Wall Street trimmed the
advance, they added.
   Some traders were skeptical about whether stop-loss buying
alone could have boosted the FT-SE 100 index so high, and
suggested that investors are taking a kinder look at the U.K.
stock market following a better-than-expected showing by the
incumbent Conservative Party in recent local government
elections and optimism about the pound's early entry into the
European Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism.
   Additionally, one dealer said some fresh buying was
visible. The confluence of positive forces caused prices to
race ahead in an exaggerated upswing, he said.
   A slew of corporate results hit the market with varied
effects. Oil and gas concern Ultramar lost 4 pence (6.7
cents) to 337 after its net profit for the first quarter
tumbled 43%.
   Food and drinks company Grand Metropolitan dove 13 to 574
despite a 36% jump in interim pretax profit. Although coming
in slightly above market forecasts, the results were buoyed
by a large contribution from property disposals.
   Although hit with a first-quarter loss of #25.6 million
($42.9 million), largely on severe weather claims that took a
toll on the rest of the sector, composite insurer Commercial
Union gained 4 to 456 as its earnings topped most market
expectations.
   Elsewhere around the market, pharmaceutical group Glaxo
posted the day's biggest loss, dropping 30 to 783. One dealer
said profit-taking cut into the share price. Additionally, an
unconfirmed report that sales were better than expected for a
competing drug marketed by another company undermined Glaxo's
share price, this dealer added.
   Share prices closed higher in Paris, Amsterdam and Milan;
mixed in Zurich and Brussels and lower in Frankfurt and
Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed firmer.
   Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore
and Wellington; Seoul shares closed higher and Manila shares
finished unchanged.

   Tests May Fail to Detect

   Some individuals infected with the AIDS virus may not be
detected by current testing procedures, according to a new
study.
   Researchers at Emory University and the Centers for
Disease Control, both in Atlanta, examined a group of 165
individuals at high risk of having the virus associated with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. While no one in the
group had tested positive for AIDS using conventional
examinations, a new test found that 30 individuals -- or 18%
of the group -- were, in fact, infected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The report, which appears in the current issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, doesn't mean
that current testing procedures are inadequate or should be
replaced, says A. Ahmed-Ansari, a professor at Emory and one
of the authors of the study. Rather, he says, the new test
provides a "window for early detection {of the virus} in
high-risk groups," such as drug abusers.
   Current tests for AIDS involve examining serum samples for
the presence of antibodies against the human immunodeficiency
virus. The new test involves stimulating purified blood cells
to induce the release of such antibodies.

   Canada? Who'd Want It?

   Tomorrow may be Canada's last chance to save itself from
breaking into pieces. A committee of the House of Commons is
scheduled to unveil a last-ditch plan to save the Meech Lake
accord. The accord -- a package of decentralizing
constitutional reforms designed to satisfy once and for all
Quebec's recurrent demands for more autonomy -- was
negotiated three years ago, and requires ratification by all
10 provinces. Three provinces still hold out: Manitoba, New
Brunswick and Newfoundland. If the parliamentary committee
fails to come up with enough concessions to please them -- or
if it comes up with so many that it offends Quebec -- the
Meech Lake accord will founder.
   In that case, it is quite possible that Quebec will choose
to secede. A May 14 poll found that 56% of Quebeckers now
favor sovereignty -- the highest proportion ever. Quebec's
federalist premier, Robert Bourassa, has been hinting that
his loyalty cannot be counted on if Meech fails.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But even if Meech does become law, Canada's prospects
don't look much brighter. The English provinces have become
more and more exasperated with Quebec. Federal Environment
Minister Lucien Bouchard, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
most trusted Quebec adviser, said last month that if
Newfoundland would not give way on Meech, "Canada would have
to make a choice about what Canada will be -- a Canada
without Quebec or a Canada without Newfoundland."
   From every beer hall, phone-in show and
letter-to-the-editor page in English Canada came the reply --
in that case, we choose Newfoundland. A majority of English
Canadians, according to a December poll, would cheerfully
permit Quebec to leave if it asks. Twenty-five percent want
to throw it out even if it doesn't ask.
   Canada is not just divided along French-English lines.
British Columbia's finance minister, Mel Couvelier,
complained in a television interview two weeks ago: "It's my
opinion that on a straight dollars-and-cents basis, it
doesn't make sense for B.C. to be in Confederation." An
insurgent populist party, the Reform Party, which wants to
reduce the influence of both Quebec and Ontario in Canadian
politics has popped into first place in the opinion polls in
Alberta. It was, though, Nova Scotia Premier John Buchanan
who expressed the great unutterable thought of Canadian
politics last month: If Quebec were to secede, the four
Atlantic provinces would have "no choice" but to seek
admission to the U.S.
   If worse comes to worst, then, Canada could be fractured
not into two pieces but into four or even more: Quebec,
Ontario, some grouping of Atlantic provinces, some grouping
or groupings of Western provinces -- with some of those
pieces possibly pleading for admission to the U.S. But before
anybody gets too excited about redrawing the U.S. border
northward, take a look at what America would be getting.
   According to a December poll, 27% of Newfoundlanders and
21% of New Brunswickers would accept an invitation to join
the U.S. The figure for the rest of English Canada was just
13%. But Atlantic Canada was also the region most virulently
opposed to the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. What the
four Atlantic provinces are seeking is not economic
opportunity, but a bigger, richer sugar daddy.
   More than any other Canadians, people down east believe it
is the responsibility of government to look after them. At
fabulous cost, governments -- particularly the federal
government -- have tried. The region is littered with the
carcasses of white elephants, most notoriously two
now-abandoned heavy water plants on Nova Scotia's Cape Breton
Island. Nearly 37% of the budget of the government of Nova
Scotia is funded by federal transfers. Federal spending in
Prince Edward Island is equal to half the gross provincial
product.
   Despite all this federal assistance, tax rates are higher
in Atlantic Canada than anywhere else in the country. Debt
service consumes an average of 14.6% of the revenues of the
four provinces, again more than anywhere else in Canada,
except Quebec. Not surprisingly, federal assistance has not
succeeded in alleviating the region's poverty. Incomes per
capita are only two-thirds those in the rest of the country
(in Newfoundland 56%), and unemployment rates the highest: 9%
in Nova Scotia, 12% in New Brunswick, 14% in PEI and nearly
15% in Newfoundland. The dole is a way of life. By current
law, 10 weeks of work qualifies the recipient for 42 weeks of
unemployment insurance. Kind employers rotate one job among
five people.
   One-quarter of all Quebeckers say they would join the U.S.
if invited, but the province would make a very odd state.
Despite the pro-business talk that issues from the lips of
separatists and federalists alike, Quebec remains the most
statist place in North America. Fully 5% of Quebec's GDP is
accounted for by one giant state-owned company, Hydro Quebec.
The most powerful financial institution in the province,
Caisse Populaire, is also state-owned. The province's
technology industries, especially aerospace, depend on
government, usually federal, funding.
   The private sector is heavily involved with dying
industries such as clothing, textiles, shoes and furniture.
It is hobbled by some of Canada's most destructive trade
unions and burdened by government spending. As a result,
while Quebec's GDP equaled 62.2% of Ontario's in 1979, a
decade later it had sunk to 58%. Quebec unemployment rates
are nearly double Ontario's and labor force participation is
five percentage points lower.
   Nor is the province's statism purely economic. The Quebec
government regulates the language of corporate memos in any
company that employs more than 100 people. Commercial signs
must be in French only. If the Montreal French-language
school board has its way, after June 30 schools in the
province will discipline or expel any student caught speaking
any language other than French on school property, including
playgrounds. Quebeckers may flirt with joining the U.S., but
once they got a glimpse of the Bill of Rights, they'd change
their minds.
   Canada really has two Wests, and, if the country
dissolves, each might go its separate way. Saskatchewan and
Manitoba are economically depressed farming provinces that
vote socialist. British Columbia and Alberta are
resource-producing provinces (timber in British Columbia, oil
in Alberta) with free enterprise traditions.
   The two far western provinces believe they could do pretty
well on their own or as American states. The U.S. government
apparently agrees. State Department documents produced during
the last bout of Quebec separatism and obtained by Quebec
journalist Jean-Francois Lisee under the U.S. Freedom of
Information Act identified British Columbia as the only
province that should be considered for statehood if Canada
broke up.
   All four western provinces share a list of grievances
against Ottawa: high interest rates set by the Bank of Canada
to dampen inflation in Ontario, the 9% goods and services tax
that comes into effect on Jan. 1 and an angry sense that
Quebec gets too much federal patronage and pork barrel while
they get too little. A former Manitoba attorney general has
explained his province's hostility to Meech Lake as
retaliation for Ottawa's decision four years ago to award a
military maintenance contract to Montreal instead of
Winnipeg.
   The West's angry belief that it pays more than it gets has
often been true in the past. But with commodity prices low
and falling, it is likely to be much less true in the future.
The Globe &amp; Mail reported Monday that a new federal report
found that from 1984 to 1988, Ottawa spent more in British
Columbia than it raked in -- $2.3 billion more in the peak
year, 1985. On their own, British Columbia and Alberta would
be boom and bust economies; Saskatchewan and Manitoba, bust
and bust.
   The province that cares most about holding Canada together
is the one that would profit most if it fell apart. Ontario
is the only province where Canadian nationalism counts for
much -- 90% of its people think of themselves as Canadians
first and citizens of their province second. Only 74% of
Albertans, 63% of Nova Scotians and 44% of Quebeckers think
of themselves that way. Good thing, since Ontario, with about
one-third of the country's population, is the province paying
the bills.
   A few Ontarians have begun to wonder aloud whether the
province might not do better, now that it has access to the
U.S. market through the Free Trade Agreement, if it stopped
subsidizing the have-not provinces. They note that the
world's richest countries -- Sweden, Switzerland, Austria --
tend to be compact and homogenous places, not sprawling
federal states that need to bribe antagonistic regions into
consensus. Others say that if Canada does split up, Ontario's
interests lie in union with Quebec, not with the other
English-speaking provinces.
   Most Ontarians continue to be willing to pay the price of
empire. But how long will they be able to afford it? The
Liberal government of Premier David Peterson has proven
itself among the most profligate in the developed world:
Spending on social programs has grown, from an already high
base, by 9.5% a year since 1984.
   Nor is the underlying economy troublefree: Ontario's
biggest industry is making cars for GM, Ford and Chrysler. In
the coming decade, that could be nearly as precarious a
living as growing wheat. Still, over the long haul, Ontario's
location, educated population and ethnic harmony should
enable it to retain its place among the richest jurisdictions
in North America.
   ---
   Ever since Quebec nationalism emerged in the late 1950s,
the U.S. has unambiguously supported Canadian unity. If
Canada should disintegrate, though, what ought the U.S. to
do? Extending statehood to Canada's eastern and near-western
provinces would only bring three or four more hungry
Democratic senators, accustomed to the chunkier Canadian
style of pork barrel, to Washington.
   The American interest in Canada remains what it has always
been: stability and openness to trade and investment. That
means economic integration, but not political annexation. A
North American common market -- composed of as many
sovereignties as the people of North America want -- would
contribute to the welfare of all; sending the checks to
Canada's regions from Washington rather than Ottawa would
benefit nobody.

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted 95-4 to provide $2.9
billion in emergency funds over five years to help strained
health-care systems shoulder the cost of the AIDS epidemic.
   The House is expected to pass a similar bill in several
weeks. The Bush administration hasn't endorsed the bill and
has expressed concern about the precedent of providing large
amounts of emergency help to benefit a group of people with
one disease. But the growing support for the bill will
probably eliminate any chance of a veto.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is a very important step forward," said Mathilde
Krim, president of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
"It shows that the federal government realizes that the care
area needs attention. The government has done very well on
research, but the care system in this country has been
deficient."
   The bill's co-sponsors, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), a
liberal, and Sen Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), a conservative,
built strong bipartisan support for the measure, which also
gathered strong backing from the health-care industry. Funds
will be targeted to 13 large cities that have reported 2,000
or more cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Hospitals in these cities are providing millions of dollars a
year in care without compensation.
   In addition to easing the financial burden on hospitals,
the bill would help local health planners experiment with
providing less costly care for those suffering from acquired
immune deficiency in private homes, nursing facilities and
hospices. "There are no nursing home beds for people with
AIDS," Dr. Krim explained.
   The bill also would pay for 150 Food and Drug
Administration inspectors to monitor the nation's blood
supply to make it sure it is free of the AIDS virus.
   Four conservative Republicans voted against the bill --
Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire, William Roth of Delaware and Malcolm Wallop of
Wyoming.

   New York State's legislature appears ready to approve a
package that includes $1.4 billion in new taxes, and delays a
$400 million personal income tax cut.
   The package doesn't include an earlier controversial
proposal to tax advertising, accounting and other services.
That plan, which had been tentatively approved by legislative
leaders, would have generated about $380 million in new tax
revenue.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tax package includes new taxes on liquor, cigarettes,
hotel rooms costing more than $100 a night, and cleaning and
security services. There would also be a 15% surcharge on
corporate taxes.
   State Senate and Assembly leaders hashed out the final
elements of the tax plan late Tuesday, a full six weeks after
the April 1 deadline for reaching a budget accord.
   Still to be decided is the crucial school aid component to
the budget, as well as a Senate proposal for a cap on
spending. Legislators have said they hope to have a final
version of the $50 billion budget prepared by the end of the
week.
   State officials have said the delay has cost
municipalities tens of millions of dollars in short-term
borrowing costs. The annual budget battle usually is a
contentious three-way affair, pitting upstate Republicans,
downstate Democrats and Gov. Mario Cuomo against one another.
As in past years, each side has blamed the others for the
delays.

   Over-the-counter stocks upstaged exchange-listed issues
and posted a slight gain.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose .43 to 442.93, a 0.1%
advance, compared with a 0.1% decline in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. Advancing shares reclaimed their lead
over declining stocks, 993 to 960, but volume slipped to
152.5 million from 162.3 million.

<TEXT>
   Portfolio manager Stephen Lieber, co-chairman of the $700
million Evergreen Fund, says the strength of secondary issues
doesn't surprise him.
   "We're beginning to see some evidence of a shifting
phase," Mr. Lieber says. Portfolio managers who were
reluctant to commit their cash in the first quarter are now
buying shares of specialty companies that have reported
healthy earnings, he says.
   "I think the evidence shows that in any period of
declining corporate profits, there tends to be
proportionately more interest in those companies that show
rising earnings trends," he adds.
   At the same time, more aggressive money managers who
traditionally buy fast-growing, smaller companies "are rather
quiet" after actively trading OTC stocks in the first
quarter, Mr. Lieber says. He also suggests that in the near
term the market in general will reflect the shifts in federal
budget policy and interestrate expectations.
   Strong earnings aren't confined to any particular OTC
sector, according to Mr. Lieber, but range from some of the
healthier regional banks to technology shares and even some
speciality retailers. Among some shares favored by the
portfolio manager are: international advertising agency
Omnicom Group, which yesterday gained 1/2 to 25 3/8;
specialty retailer Medicine Shoppes International, which
yesterday dipped 1/4 to 21, and software designer and
marketer Borland International, which advanced 3/8 to 16 7/8.
   Peter Coolidge, senior OTC trader at Kidder Peabody, said
he was impressed with the market's action yesterday. After
the Nasdaq Composite Index drifted to a low of 440.58 at
noon, it held firm and then recovered, Mr. Coolidge noted. He
called this performance a sign that the rally may continue.
   Mr. Coolidge pointed to two other signs that may bode well
for the market: an increase in initial public offerings and
recent announcements of mergers or proposed buy-outs, calling
the latter "a phenomenon that's creeping back into the
market."
   Three of the day's top percentage gainers -- Bio-Medicus,
Unilab and Silicon Valley Group -- were sparked by news of
buy-outs or potential takeover threats.
   Bio-Medicus surged 3 3/8 to 20 on 1.2 million shares after
Medtronic, a Minneapolis medical-technology concern,
unexpectedly offered Tuesday to buy the Eden Prairie, Minn.,
health-services company in a tax-free exchange of stock.
Medtronic offered one share of its common stock for each 3.3
shares of Bio-Medicus common. Based on Medtronic's May 11
closing price of $71.375, the offer is valued at $21.74 a
share. Medtronic currently holds about 5.5% of Bio-Medicus's
outstanding shares.
   Bio-Medicus said it will consider the offer at a regular
board meeting today.
   Separately, Bio-Medicus reported net income for the fourth
quarter ended March 31 of 22 cents a share, up from five
cents a year earlier.
   Unilab rose 1 5/16 to 6 after MetPath Inc., a unit of
Corning Inc., said it raised its stake in the Norcross, Ga.,
provider of laboratory testing services to 26.25% from about
20.9%. Metpath said it may consider seeking control of the
company.
   Silicon Valley Group gained 1 5/8 to 9 3/4 after
Perkin-Elmer said late Tuesday that it sold a two-third
interest in its semiconductor-equipment business to the San
Jose, Calif., maker of electronic equipment. The two
businesses will form a new company, SVG Lithography Systems
Inc., involved in optical lithography technology used to
produce semiconductors. International Business Machines is
planning to invest in the new business's research and
development; Sematech, a consortium of U.S. industries and
the government, has entered into a joint development with the
new company.
   Positive earnings continued to attract investors to
selective OTC shares. Applied Materials gained 2 1/4 to 34
3/4 after the Santa Clara, Calif., maker of water fabrication
equipment reported late Tuesday that net income in the second
quarter ended April 29 fell to 62 cents a share from 83 cents
a year earlier, but was still higher than the average of
analysts' estimates. Scitex rallied 1 1/8 to 33 1/4 after the
Israeli maker of imaging and computer graphics reported late
yesterday net income for the first quarter ended March 31 of
78 cents a share, up from 35 cents a year earlier.
   Coda Energy traded as high as 2 5/8 before closing
unchanged at 2 3/8. The Dallas oil and gas drilling company
reported income from continuing operations for the third
quarter ended March 31 tripled to three cents a share from
year-earlier results.
   Analysts' recommendations sparked interest in Duty Free
International, up 3 1/4 at 29 1/4, and Optical Radiation, up
1 3/4 at 34 1/2, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton retail analyst Stacy Ruchlamer
repeated her "buy" opinion on Duty Free and raised her
earnings fiscal 1991 first-quarter and full year earnings
estimates for the Ridgefield, Conn., operator of duty-free
retail stores, DJPIR said. Duty Free's chief financial
officer tied the rise to the analyst's comments.
   Similarly, Montgomery Securities analyst Leonard S. Yaffe
emphasized his purchase opinion on Optical Radiation and
raised his 1991 and 1992 earnings estimates for the Azusa,
Calif., maker of optical equipment, according to DJPIR.
   Homestyle Buffet gained 1 to 10 3/4 after a secondary
offering of 1.45 million shares of the Oldsmar, Fla.,
restaurant concern was priced Tuesday at $9.50 a share.
   Among the day's biggest percentage losers was Action
Savings Bank, off 1 5/8 at 2 1/4. The Somers Point, N.J.,
thrift bank said Tuesday after the market closed that an
ongoing examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision will
result in as yet unspecified increases in its non-performing
assets and allowances for loan losses.
   Common and preferred shares of First Executive lost ground
after the troubled thrift reported that it paid more than
$1.33 billion in the first quarter to people surrendering
insurance policies and annuities. First Executive common
shares fell 1/4 to 2 5/8; the series E preferred shares
dropped 1 3/8 to 5 3/8; series F preferred shares tumbled 2
1/8 to 9 3/8, and series G lost 5/8 to 4 3/4.
   Concord Camera fell 1/4 to 3 3/8 after the Avenel, N.J.,
maker and distributor of cameras reported a loss of 24 cents
a share for the third quarter ended March 31, compared with
net income of 17 cents a share a year before. The company,
which a week ago couldn't explain a jump in its stock to 3
7/8, attributed the quarterly loss to price competition,
continuing retail weakness and the financial difficulties of
one of its major customers, Ames Department Stores.

   Dolphin-Tuna Policies
   Won't Hurt Fishermen

   Your April 17 editorial on dolphins and tuna fish was
misleading and based on incomplete information. The
announcement that StarKist, Bumblebee and Chicken-of-the-Sea
will voluntarily stop buying tuna caught with methods that
harm dolphins is something to cheer about, not disdain.
   Most U.S. tuna fishermen should benefit, not suffer as you
imply, from these changes. One reason will be an increased
demand for tuna from grounds where dolphins are not involved.
Tuna swim with dolphins primarily in the Eastern Tropical
Pacific (ETP). Many U.S. fishermen, especially from small
fisheries on both coasts, already use technologies and
methods unrelated to dolphins. Of the 74 American tuna
purse-seine vessels in the Pacific Ocean in 1988, only 28
fished in the ETP and regularly exploited dolphins.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to your assertion of the U.S. fleet's "remarkable
achievements" in saving dolphins, the dolphin kill per U.S.
vessel actually increased threefold in the decade from
1977-88.
   Under the dolphin-safe cannery policies, the U.S. tuna
fleet will not go out of business. Fishermen can adjust as
they proved in 1986 when the fleet exceeded its dolphinkill
quota of 20,500 animals and was forced to abandon temporarily
the exploitation of dolphins for tuna. The U.S. is the
largest consumer of canned tuna -- nearly 55% of the world
market in 1988. Much of this is supplied by foreign fleets
dependent on the U.S. market. As soon as every U.S. processor
sells only dolphin-safe tuna, foreign fishermen will make it
a priority to use dolphin-safe technologies and methods.

   Jim Henson, who died yesterday at age 53 of a massive

Walt Disney Co. since Disney agreed to acquire his company
last year. And these projects will go forward as planned,
executives said.
   "We vow to do all that we can to see that the
extraordinary legacy of this great friend and colleague will

   Mr. Henson created the Muppets and a host of other
characters known world-wide. Last August, Disney agreed to
acquire New York-based Henson Associates Inc. (which excludes
Mr. Henson's participation in the television characters on
"Sesame Street") for about $100 million to $150 million. Mr.
Henson has been active in every phase of Disney's operation
since then, although the transaction has not been formally
completed.
   At Disney's theme parks, a Muppet show and daily parades
are scheduled to begin at Walt Disney World's Disney-MGM
Studios in Orlando, Fla., on June 15. Mr. Henson was
finishing up a filmed attraction set to open at Disney-MGM
next year and at Disneyland in California in 1993. A "Muppet
Movie Ride" is scheduled to open at Disney-MGM in 1993.
Disney officials say they don't expect any delays in the
projects.

   TRENTON, N.J. -- The New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection said it ordered PPG Industries Inc.
to pay more than $31.5 million to clean up 32 residential
lots in Jersey City.
   The state agency said it believes PPG, based in
Pittsburgh, is responsible for chromium contamination at the
lots.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman at the maker of glass, chemical and coatings
said, "We haven't seen the directive, so we can't comment."
   The state agency said it plans to begin cleanup work at
the sites this fall. If the company fails to reimburse the
state for the cost of the cleanup, PPG will be liable for
triple damages, Commissioner Judith Yaskin said in a release.
   PPG, according to the agency, operated a chromium chemical
plant in Jersey City for more than 50 years until it was
closed in 1964. However, chromium waste from the plant was
used as fill material at many locations in Jersey City,
including the residential lots slated for cleanup, the state
agency said.

   WASHINGTON -- For nearly a year, President Bush has argued
that his lenient policy toward China would moderate that
repressive regime's behavior. Now, as he considers a
controversial renewal of a lucrative trade benefit for
Beijing, that case is tough to make.
   Mr. Bush's determination to maintain ties with Beijing
over the past year has generated bitter criticism in
Washington, sent conflicting signals to U.S. allies and upset
dissidents in China. Meanwhile, here's what Mr. Bush has
gotten in return from Beijing:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- Even as China sought to improve its image in the West
last week by releasing some prisoners it took during the June
massacre of pro-democracy students at Tiananmen Square, a
Florida businessman was being arrested by U.S. Customs agents
for plotting to illegally ship China computer components that
have military uses. And Beijing's Washington embassy was
planning to intimidate Chinese students through visits to
U.S. college campuses.
   -- In December, as National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
made their second visit to Beijing and toasted China's
leaders with champagne, China began jailing Roman Catholic
priests, bishops and laymen who supported the pro-democracy
movement, according to Asia Watch, a human-rights group.
   -- Despite numerous U.S. requests, China continues to
supply weapons to Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who
slaughtered more than one million people during their
three-year reign. China also recently signed a 10-year
military technology agreement with Iran and is a regular arms
supplier to other Mideast nations.
   "Bush's policy has been an embarrassment for the country,"
said Rep. Samuel Gejdenson (D., Conn.), who heads a House
subcommittee that oversees trade issues. "The president's
longtime relations with the leaders of China seem to cloud
his ability to see what's in the best interest of the Chinese
people."
   That view is expressed across the political spectrum.
"There is a disturbing general pattern in administration
actions: waivers, vetoes and unrequited conciliatory moves --
and above all the double standard between China and support
for democracy elsewhere," said Winston Lord, U.S. ambassador
to China during the Reagan administration, at a congressional
hearing yesterday. "Repression has really deepened" in China
in the past year, added Holly Burkhalter, Washington director
of Asia Watch, who also testified.
   These criticisms are sure to flare anew as Mr. Bush mulls
whether to renew China's most-favored nation trade status,
which entitles it to the same treatment as America's other
trading partners. Some critics say Mr. Bush's lenient
attitude toward Beijing, which sent a signal of
business-as-usual, now further complicates the decision, even
if a renewal were accompanied by rhetoric calling on China to
alter its behavior.
   During a White House news conference yesterday, Mr. Bush
said he hasn't made a decision yet. "It isn't an easy call
because I don't want to send a signal that we are happy with
the human rights record," he said. Mr. Bush's tolerant
attitude toward Beijing over the past year would suggest he
is at least leaning toward extending the trade benefit. "I
still am of the mind that having contact and working in an
area where there has been progress -- on the economic side --
with China is important," he said.
   Even some members of Mr. Bush's administration wonder
privately why the president continues to pursue a policy with
so little gain. One expert believes that Mr. Bush, a former
envoy to China, sees the bloody events of last June 4 as an
aberration, rather than a fundamental decison by the aging
leadership to cling to power. Other supporters assert that
conditions would grow worse if the U.S. attempted to isolate
China.
   But other experts say that Mr. Bush's actions have damaged
his credibility with America's allies. The U.S. labored to
produce a joint statement condemning China's actions last
July at the economic summit in Paris. The allies learned
later that during that same month Mr. Bush had secretly
dispatched Messrs. Scowcroft and Eagleburger to Beijing, even
as he was promising to ban high-level diplomatic meetings
with China.
   Moreover, notes Jonathan Pollack, a China expert and head
of the political-science department at Rand Corp., Mr. Bush
further confused U.S. allies and bolstered China's feeling of
self-importance during a news conference in January. He
suggested that it was crucial to cultivate China because it
was a counterweight in Asia to Japan's imposing presence.
State Department officials contend that analysis is faulty
and probably reinforces Beijing's notion that the U.S. isn't
serious about trying to punish it. "Sending such a signal is
dumb," says Mr. Pollack.
   The administration's unwillingness to strongly condemn
China's leaders for the massacre also has alienated members
of the younger generation who may be leading China in the
future.
   Asia Watch estimates that between 10,000 and 30,000
Chinese dissidents have been arrested since June. No one is
certain how many remain in jail. In January, China announced
that it was releasing 573 political prisoners, but State
Department officials note that because Beijing didn't provide
a list of their names, the U.S. isn't sure how many actually
were freed. Similarly, last week's announcement that 211
prisoners were being released was accompanied by a list of
only about a half-dozen names.
   Mr. Bush must decide before June 3 whether to renew
China's most-favored nation status. If he does, Congress may
pass a joint resolution opposing his action. However, Mr.
Bush can veto the resolution, and Congress would need a
two-thirds majority in both houses to override it.
   Some congressional aides say that it will be difficult to
muster two-thirds support if the president extends the
most-favored nation status. An intense campaign by U.S.
companies that import goods from China already is under way
to persuade lawmakers to support continuing the trade benefit
to China. Last week, for instance, Sparkomatic Corp., which
sells electronic products to such national retailers as K
mart and Wal-Mart, circulated a letter on Capitol Hill
warning that if most-favored nation status is lifted some
import duties would rise to 35% from 3.7%, making "many of
our most important products noncompetitive."
   The conservative Heritage Foundation, in a paper issued
last week, also noted that about 65% of China's exports to
the U.S. first go to Hong Kong for packaging and shipping. As
a result, Hong Kong's economy would be hard-hit if China's
most-favored nation trade status were lost, the study found.
But it didn't make a recommendation on renewing the status.
   Because of the pressure and the complexity of the issue,
even some lawmakers like Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.),
chairman of the House Asian affairs subcommittee and an
outspoken critic of the president's China policy over the
last year, are ambivalent on the most-favored nation issue.
Late yesterday, Rep. Solarz said it would be appropriate to
extend most-favored nation status if Mr. Bush accompanied it
with certain actions. He said the president should make
"strong tributes" to those killed at Tiananmen Square, commit
the U.S. to maintain existing sanctions, and state that
subsequent renewals will depend on China's making progress on
human rights in the coming year.
   "Nobody sounds like they're all fired up to go to the mat
on China," says Roger Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China
Business Council, which supports extending most-favored
nation status. "And I can understand why."

   Rep. Waxman Says
   Health Official
   Urged Not to Speak

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman charged that the Bush
administration "silenced" a top health official by preventing
him from testifying on U.S. efforts to promote tobacco
exports.
   In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan, the California Democrat alleged that James Mason,
assistant secretary for health, was "instructed not to
present testimony" at a congressional hearing on cigarette
exports today. James Brown, a spokesman for Dr. Mason, called
the charge "nonsense."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The flap highlights the awkward position the
administration finds itself in over the promotion of smoking.
Dr. Sullivan and Dr. Mason strongly oppose smoking, and Dr.
Sullivan has sharply attacked cigarette advertisements aimed
specifically at women and blacks. But another branch of the
administration, the U.S. trade representative, has been
fighting to tear down foreign barriers to U.S. cigarette
exports. Despite his outspoken opposition to smoking, Dr.
Sullivan has refrained from attacking the export promotion
policy.
   Separately, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
voted for an anti-smoking bill after deleting a provision
that the tobacco industry complained would interfere with
nationwide advertising campaigns.
   As initially introduced by panel Chairman Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D., Mass.), the bill would have repealed a federal
preemption of state advertising regulations. This would have
freed states to set their own standards, making nationwide
advertising campaign impossible. Sen. Kennedy said he removed
the provision to avoid a jurisdictional controversy that
could have bottled up the bill. Remaining provisions of the
legislation would impose new regulations over certain
cigarette additives and finance new federal anti-smoking
campaigns.
   The cigarette export issue pits health concerns against
export promotion. Congressional smoking opponents have
launched a spirited campaign to stop the administration from
expanding markets for U.S. tobacco companies by threatening
trade reprisals against Thailand and other countries that
limit tobacco imports.
   Dr. Mason had been scheduled to testify today at a hearing
where a number of witnesses, including the head of the
American Cancer Society, are planning to attack the
export-promotion policy. But he withdrew on Tuesday,
provoking Rep. Waxman, chairman of the health panel of the
House Commerce Committee to suggest that "the administration
has refused to permit Dr. Mason's appearance before us."
   HHS officials rejected this interpretation, saying that
Dr. Mason decided not to testify after learning from the
department's legislative staff that the hearing was on trade
practices and that an official from the trade
representative's office was going to testify on behalf of the
administration. "I can assure you that the secretary didn't
tell Dr. Sullivan not to go to that hearing," Mr. Brown said.
"And I can assure you that Dr. Sullivan and Dr. Mason will
continue to speak out about smoking and health."
   Controversy over smoking is likely to heat up if, as
expected, a proposal to increase the cigarette excise tax
emerges during the budget summit as one of the measures to
lower the deficit.

   The Entangled Death Penalty

   Chief Justice William Rehnquist went on the hustings this
week to urge that the courts be freed of a death-penalty
appeals process that leaves the justice system tied up in
knots years after any argument about guilt or innocence has
been settled. He told a law-reform group that the current
system "verges on the chaotic." Typical delays between
sentence and execution run to more than seven years. A man
who killed a state trooper in 1977 is finally scheduled to be
executed in Louisiana tomorrow.
   "At no point until a death sentence is actually carried
out can it be said that litigation concerning the sentence
has run its course," Chief Justice Rehnquist said. He also
noted that voters in 37 states have approved the death
penalty, which means that unelected federal judges endanger
both democracy and federalism when they obstruct capital
punishment for convicted murderers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice Rehnquist thought he had solved this problem
last year with the recommendations of a group of judges
headed by former Justice Lewis Powell Jr. They proposed
limiting the number of federal appeals in most cases to two
if states would provide a free lawyer to handle them for the
prisoner. A group of judges in the Judicial Conference who
oppose the death penalty have tried to sandbag this
Powell-Rehnquist proposal, which the Senate will take up next
week.
   Unfortunately, this is not the only proposal on the table.
Senator Joe Biden has a bill that, amazingly, would add to
delays by reversing Supreme Court cases that limited some
appeals. It would also create a right to appeal for a vaguely
defined "miscarriage of justice." An amendment by Teddy
Kennedy would effectively abolish the death penalty by
barring it when there is a "racially discriminatory pattern"
in such cases.
   Whether one agrees or disagrees that constitutionally
sound death penalties are good public policy, so long as
states allow them federal judges have no right to interfere.
Too many do. One reason inmates file appeal after appeal is
that they know that in time they will land with a judge who
will rule favorably because he opposes the policy of capital
punishment. These so-called habeas corpus appeals are limited
only by the imagination. One convict recently tried to
persuade the Supreme Court that the death penalty applies
disproportionately to blacks and so his sentence should be
overturned -- even though he is white.
   As chief administrator of the federal courts, Chief
Justice Rehnquist worries especially about the huge amount of
court time that goes to these appeals. In a case decided in
March that threw all North Carolina death penalties into
doubt, Justice Antonin Scalia called the newest procedural
hurdle "the sort of argument that causes state legislators to
pull their hair." He found "new substance to the charge that
we have been administering a `bait and switch' capital
sentencing jurisprudence."
   The delays and obstructions leave 2,200
multiple-murderers, rapist-murderers, cop-killers and
pusher-murderers on death row. We can find one bright spot,
though, in William Rehnquist's frustrations with the legal
system. It can't be entirely bad that the Chief Justice of
the U.S. discovers for himself how bad laws, cumbersome
procedures and recalcitrant judges can create foolish
results.

   WILLIAMSBURG, Ky. -- Pat Sulfridge was married at age 14
and pregnant at 15. Today, at 32, she is single again,
supporting herself and three children on a $250 monthly
salary, plus welfare payments and foodstamps. Her electric
bill hasn't been paid in months, and her six-year-old son,
Brandon, can wiggle his toes through his torn blue sneakers.
To deal with the stress, she chain-smokes Winston 100s and
gulps down instant coffee.
   Yet for many of her fellow women here without a man in the
household, Ms. Sulfridge is a role model. She works part-time
as a social-service counselor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On the job one day recently, she is sitting beside a coal
stove in a blue shack tucked deep among the pines off Red
Bird Road, visiting a 16-year-old girl who has threatened to
run away. The girl, smoking cigarettes and combing knots from
her blond hair, talks of her school troubles and her fears
that her stepfather, who once dragged her by the hair across
the living room floor, may return to the house and beat her.
   Ms. Sulfridge comforts her and urges her to stay in
school. "Read everything you can find," she says. And, she
pleads: "Be a child before you have a child." As the sun
slips behind the Cumberland Mountains, Ms. Sulfridge climbs
into her rusty 1982 Pontiac Phoenix, frustrated that she
can't do more for the girl. "If these kids give up," she
says, "we've lost the battle."
   Long the heart and soul of Appalachia, women like Pat
Sulfridge are becoming its backbone too. Here in Whitley
County, which is mostly white, nearly one in three households
is headed by a woman. That is double the national average,
and fast approaching the proportion of the nation's black
families that are headed by women -- 44%.
   When Ms. Sulfridge checks in at the food-stamp office for
her monthly rations, only women join her in line. At the
Wal-Mart, about the only men she sees are a few retirees
waiting for prescriptions. "It's the mamas who are fighting
for their families," she says. "Surely to goodness, there are
some good men in this county, but I don't know where they
are."
   Carol M. Straus, a University of Kentucky researcher who
has studied Kentucky women in poverty, says, "It's becoming
less and less likely that an Appalachian woman can rely on a
man for support of herself and children." The same holds true
in poorer places elsewhere in the country. Says Sylvia
Hewlett, a New York economist: "The inner-city model has
moved into white, blue-collar communities. If you're a
25-year-old white woman, you have a 40% chance of being a
single mother."
   Not that mountain women could ever depend on men for a
steady income. Work in the region's coal mines, tobacco
fields and logging camps was always erratic. But in these
remote hills and hollows, families hung together. The region
has been physically and culturally isolated for generations.
Even though highways now link mountain communities, the
hollows remain off-limits to outsiders and their notions of
women's liberation. So generations of women have lived a
traditional life, dropping out of school to marry and raise a
brood of youngsters.
   They depended on fathers, brothers and cousins, who
usually lived close by, to help support them in hard times.
They deferred to their husbands. At mealtimes, they fed the
men first, and then the children. Wives often gulped their
own meals while clearing the dishes. "Men had the right to
tell you when to go to bed and when to get up," says Edith
Parrett, a 59-year-old native of neighboring Clay County.
"Women have been second-class citizens."
   The men have been leaving these parts for the big cities
of the Midwest or California, or simply to drift, at a faster
rate than their women. Virtually every local industry has
automated or retrenched; employment in Kentucky coal mines
has dropped 40% to just 29,500 in the past decade. In Whitley
County, with a population of 35,600, there are only about
1,200 manufacturing jobs, and even minimum-wage work in
fast-food restaurants or retail stores is scarce.
   One of those who left was Ms. Sulfridge's husband.
   The life she has led since is not what she expected
growing up as the sixth of nine children in a rural Whitley
County family. Her family lived on a tiny farm in a wooden
shack without plumbing. But her parents stayed together. They
still milk the cows together, and they celebrated their 46th
wedding anniversary this year. "They share the struggles,"
Ms. Sulfridge says.
   Two of her siblings left Kentucky for work in California
and Michigan. The others remained to work in the mines. Ms.
Sulfridge's childhood sweetheart was Reese Sulfridge, who
attended vocational school and talked of college and studying
architecture. She dropped out of the 10th grade to marry him.
"He seemed ambitious," she says.
   Instead of going to college, Mr. Sulfridge took
construction jobs to support his bride and their first child,
Patty. Several times they went to Michigan and Ohio to search
for factory work but always were drawn back to Kentucky to be
close to family. By 1983, they had two more children, Shawnda
and Brandon. In most years Mr. Sulfridge's seasonal work
earned him less than $4,000. Ms. Sulfridge took part-time
jobs cleaning houses and serving food at Pizza Hut.
   In their best year, Mr. Sulfridge earned about $10,000 at
the Williamsburg water plant. "We felt rich," Ms. Sulfridge
says. But the job didn't last. Mr. Sulfridge, unemployed,
went "bowling, fishing and hunting," she says. Then, she
says, the drinking and arguing began. Once they separated
when, she says, he told her she couldn't spend $25 to buy
Patty a blue-jean jacket. "Every $1.25 he laid up on a bar
could've helped buy a pair of shoes for the kids," she says.
"To think I once dreamed of growing old and sitting in
rocking chairs together."
   About 18 months ago, the couple divorced. Since then Ms.
Sulfridge has received just $80 in child-support payments. In
Kentucky, only $2.68 in support payments is collected for
every $1 spent to track missing fathers, according to the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Sulfridge,
one of those who is often missing, couldn't be reached for
comment. Ms. Sulfridge says he has dropped by to visit from
time to time, but she doesn't know where he lives.
   Ms. Sulfridge was forced to move to cheaper quarters
several times in the past 18 months. She has lived in a
cramped trailer and a dilapidated house so leaky that snow
fell on her face as she slept. She recently found a modern,
three-bedroom house with a front yard where two puppies can
run with the kids. The rent is cheap because the house is
about a dozen miles away from the nearest town. Ms. Sulfridge
is redecorating one bedroom by covering a wall with a roll of
navy and pink flowered wallpaper purchased for $1.
   A tall, thin woman who looks older than she is, Ms.
Sulfridge shops at yard sales and shares pairs of second-hand
blue jeans with Patty, now 17 years old. Walking through a
Wal-Mart one recent morning, Ms. Sulfridge finds that her
budget allows only one purchase: a $1.77 container of roll-on
deodorant. When she spots a penny in the parking lot, she
picks it up and pockets it. "I need all the luck I can get."
   Since her husband left, she has taken odd jobs. She has
scrubbed floors and stood in cold barns for 12-hour shifts,
stripping tobacco. "I'll beg, borrow or steal to take care of
my kids," she says.
   What's sustaining her now is a community of other single
mothers. With so few men left in the region, she doesn't
expect to remarry -- nor does she especially want to. But she
has found help and an extended family at the Whitley County
Communities for Children, a woman-run, grant-supported group
that offers training in such diverse areas as raising
livestock, counseling teen-agers and running computers.
   Ms. Sulfridge first went there for tutoring for a
high-school equivalency degree. Then she was hired as a
part-time counselor. Several days a week, she and other
single mothers travel the dirt roads of Whitley County,
visiting girls like the teenager living in the blue shack.
   "I probably wouldn't have made it if not for these people
here," she says.
   At lunch, one woman prepares a salad in a large bowl to
feed a score of volunteers and staff. Near the kitchen, a
dozen toddlers play as mothers take turns providing daycare.
A loom in the corner of the room displays a half-finished
blue rug, which will soon be sold to raise funds for the
center.
   After lunch, several women pile into Ms. Sulfridge's used
Pontiac to locate teenagers who might want after-school
tutoring. She and her friends depend on her car because there
is no public transportation in the region. The drive to a
doctor's office or job is often 30 miles or more. The women
chip in for gasoline. Some have never learned to drive
because their husbands never let them.
   Driving through the rugged countryside, they pass wooden
shacks with chickens darting through littered yards filled
with empty milk cartons and other garbage. "That white house
over there is where a grandmother is raising her 25
grandchildren," says a passenger in the car. "And a
bootlegger lives over there," she whispers. Whitley County is
legally dry.
   Thin plastic rather than glass covers the windows of many
homes. "I'm poor and I've had a hard time," Ms. Sulfridge
says. "But there are kids living here who've never even had a
$3 Happy Meal at McDonald's."
   The women can't find the teen-agers who had asked them to
visit, and turn back toward home. On the way, they stop for
Cokes and other small purchases, paying with food stamps.
After dropping each of her passengers off, Ms. Sulfridge
hurries to pick up her three children at school. They get
nervous when she is late. Since her husband left, her son
Brandon often wakes up at night yelling, "Where's Mom?"
   "These kids hang on to me like a leech," Ms. Sulfridge
says. "I can't start to the store without them asking, `Where
are you going and when will you be back?'"
   Sandwiches make tonight's dinner. Afterward the table is
clear and dishes promptly washed. Seventeen-year-old Patty
works quietly at the table, rewriting stories for her
high-school yearbook. She will graduate with an A average
this month and hopes to win a scholarship for college.
   Patty has never worn a new dress to a prom, and she
doesn't expect one for graduation, either. But she would like
to send out graduation announcements, and asks her mother if
there is any money. Ms. Sulfridge silently studies the order
form. Then Shawnda asks her mother how to dress for her role
as Mother Mouse in a school play, and Brandon brings out the
coloring books and crayons. He mischievously shows a visitor
how to pick the bathroom lock with a pocket knife. "My Dad
gave me this," he brags.
   At 11 p.m., after the children have gone to bed, Ms.
Sulfridge tackles a heap of laundry and talks of her hopes
for her children. "I hope they get an education and do
something with their lives," she says. Then, she says, she
hopes to go to college herself and become a nurse. She also
confides that she has stashed away a few dollars to order
Patty's graduation announcements. "Some things," she says,
"are too important to do without."

   Sagging Dollar

   NEW YORK -- While U.S. stocks and bonds have surged in
recent days, the dollar has fallen from its lofty perch.
   With U.S. interest rates sinking, the dollar has slumped
5% the past month against the yen and 3% against the mark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. currency may have farther to fall, economists
say. But they don't expect the dollar's troubles to hurt the
U.S. stock and bond markets.
   In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 151.67 yen. That was up 0.87 yen from Tuesday's level, but
down substantially from the 12-month high of 159.79 yen
earlier this spring. The dollar inched downward to 1.6455
marks from 1.6465 marks the day before. Sterling was quoted
at $1.6805, up from $1.6740 Tuesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 152.23 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
151.95 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6415
marks.
   "The dollar continues to be vulnerable against the yen,"
says Robert Chandross, an economist at Lloyds Bank PLC in New
York.
   Like most traders and economists, Mr. Chandross is
focusing on inflation-adjusted, "real" interest rates in the
U.S. and other big industrial nations. By that analysis, the
dollar has become a lousy resting place for global investors'
cash.
   After allowing for inflation, U.S. long-term interest
rates of 8.8% currently provide investors with a 3.6% real
return. That's about the lowest real return of the U.S.'s
major trading partners. By comparison, Japan's real interest
rates are about 4.5%, France's are 6.3%, and West Germany's
about 6.2%.
   "This unfavorable real yield comparison is the main factor
behind the weakening of the U.S. dollar," says Hung Tran, a
research director at Deutsche Bank AG's New York office.
   Earlier this year, the dollar had strengthened on
expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise U.S.
interest rates to fight inflation. But the Fed in recent
weeks has indicated that it isn't likely to tug rates upward.
That has left traders and economists convinced that the
current global interest-rate gaps are likely to last awhile.
   "All the central banks are on hold," says David Germany,
an economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "Nothing tells me that
the dollar's sag will be interrupted short-term."
   Longer term, though, Mr. Germany sees the dollar
rebounding on the strength of growing exports, a healthy
domestic economy and an eventual boost in U.S. interest
rates.
   The dollar's latest jitters have reminded some market
participants of the 1985-87 period, when sudden drops in the
dollar repeatedly led to brief plunges in U.S. stock and bond
markets. At those times, Japanese and other foreign investors
stopped buying U.S. securities.
   But economists aren't biting their nails now. "I wouldn't
expect any movement out of the dollar to be of a magnitude
that would cause a panic or an abandoning of U.S. financial
assets," says Mr. Tran.
   Japanese investors, in particular, simply aren't as
crucial to the U.S. securities markets anymore. Last year,
Japanese investors bought $3.3 billion of U.S. stocks,
according to the Securities Industry Association, down from a
record $11.3 billion in 1987. They bought $2.3 billion of
Treasury bonds last year, down from a record $21.8 billion in
1988. Stocks and bonds both gained anyway in 1989, without a
major Japanese boost.
   "Foreign investors -- led by the Japanese -- have shifted
from being portfolio investors in U.S. stocks and bonds to
making direct investments in the U.S.," says Deutsche Bank's
Mr. Tran. For the first half of 1989 alone, Japan invested
more than $9 billion in U.S. plants and equipment, real
estate, corporate acquisitions and other forms of direct
investment, according to the Bank of Japan. Such assets, Mr.
Tran observes, aren't likely to be sold quickly just because
of a short-term drop in the dollar's value.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for
current delivery settled at $369 an ounce, down $1.90.
Estimated volume was a light 1.8 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $369.25 an
ounce.

   Lotus and Novell
   Extend Discussions
   On Planned Merger

   Lotus Development Corp. and Novell Inc. extended merger
negotiations amid speculation that Lotus is under pressure to
give Novell a larger role in the management of the proposed
computer-software combination.
   Analysts and major Novell shareholders predicted that the
merger terms will be revised to give more authority to
Raymond Noorda, Novell's chairman, and to other top Novell
managers. Lotus has agreed to acquire Novell for Lotus shares
worth about $1.41 billion at current market prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The companies extended until Friday a letter of intent,
under which definitive terms of the merger are being
negotiated. The letter's original expiry date was Tuesday.
   Lotus, of Cambridge, Mass., and Novell, based in Provo,
Utah, declined to say what remained to be negotiated, but
said that share-exchange terms aren't under discussion. Lotus
is proposing to exchange 1.19131 of its shares for every
Novell share.
   At least part of the delay is related to dissatisfaction
among Novell holders about the terms of the deal, including
the proposed responsibilities of Mr. Noorda, regarded as an
astute builder of Novell's business. Under the announced
terms, Mr. Noorda will be vice chairman of the combined
entity, while Lotus's Jim P. Manzi would remain as chairman,
chief executive and president.
   "I think that Ray Noorda will become co-CEO and more than
vice chairman," under the final terms of the deal, said Fred
Cohen, an analyst at Labe, Simpson &amp; Co. in New York.
   "There's certainly been some disgruntlement among Novell
holders," said Walter Price, a portfolio manager for RCM
Capital Managment, of San Francisco, holder of 2.2 million of
Novell's 33 million shares. "It's important to Novell
shareholders that (Mr. Noorda) have more of a role."
   Mr. Price said he believed Mr. Noorda's responsibilities,
and the roles and incentives for a "layer of people under
him" are under discussion by Lotus and Novell. He and other
Novell holders said they were concerned that Lotus and Mr.
Manzi won't give enough autonomy to Novell, whose business
and customer base are different from Lotus's
personal-computer software.
   "People are afraid Novell will get sucked into Lotus, and
that will be the end of it," said Valerie Malter, an analyst
at Chancellor Capital, in New York. Ms. Malter said
Chancellor's holdings were greater than the 666,000 shares
listed in its latest disclosure statement.
   Novell shareholders have also been concerned "about what
the proper valuation is," said Marty Hurwitz, who follows
Novell for IDS Financial Corp., a big mutual fund manager in
Minneapolis. Mr. Hurwitz declined to discuss IDS's current
stake in Novell, which was 1,070,600 shares at the end of
last year.
   Mr. Cohen of Labe Simpson figures that Lotus should be
giving 1.25 of its shares for each Novell share, but Ms.
Malter said she "would be very surprised to see any change"
in price.
   It wasn't immediately clear whether the concerns of Novell
holders would be enough to block the merger as currently
agreed. Messrs. Price and Hurwitz and Ms. Malter declined to
say how their institutions would vote. The merger is subject
to the approval of both companies' shareholders.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Lotus
closed at $34.50, up 50 cents, and Novell closed at $40, up
50 cents.

   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it has
developed futures contracts on health and auto-collision
insurance for use by insurance companies.
   Details of the new contracts are being tightly guarded for
competitive reasons, said the futures exchange, which soon
will submit the proposed new contracts to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission for approval. It's likely to be
several months before the federal regulator acts on the
proposals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The contracts are likely to be based on "baskets" of
insurance policies maturing at the same time, futures
industry officials speculated.
   Futures contracts on insurance policies have been
considered by a number of futures exchanges over the past
several years. The Board of Trade seriously considered
listing insurance futures contracts in the early 1970s, but
it put the product on hold while it pursued interest rate
futures.
   Insurance futures found a new champion in Leslie
Rosenthal, who had been exchange chairman when the idea for
the product was floated in the early '70s. Earlier this year,
Mr. Rosenthal was asked to head an exchange subcommittee that
developed the contracts.
   Richard Sandor, who advised Mr. Rosenthal on the product,
conceded that there hasn't been a groundswell of demand for
the futures contract, and that it may be a hard sell among
traditionally conservative insurance companies.

   Boeing 737 Inspections Ordered by FAA
   After Control-Wheel Incident in Flight
   ----

   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to
inspect pilot controls on three models of Boeing Co.'s
popular 737 jetliner, after a missing cotter pin caused a
control wheel to come off in a co-pilot's hands.
   The agency said Seattle-based Boeing, which reported the
in-flight incident Monday, had discovered a second airplane
with a cotter pin missing when it conducted an inspection on
airliners being readied for delivery at its Renton, Wash.,
plant. A Boeing spokesman said the plane landed safely after
the pilot took over on the second set of controls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An FAA spokesman said the airline that experienced the
in-flight problem was West German, but he wouldn't identify
it, as a matter of policy. The only West German carriers
Boeing lists as flying the 737-400, the 146-seat model that
had the problem, are named Hapag Lloyd and Bavaria.
   The Boeing spokesman said a total of 1,857 of the
company's various-model 737 twin-engine jets have been
delivered to 19 U.S. operators and 147 airlines.
   The inspection order covers only newer-model 737-300s,
737-400s and 737-500s, the FAA said. Boeing said 94 of the
737-400s, 609 of the 128-seat 737-300s and 10 of the
108-passenger 737-500s are being operated world-wide.
   A so-called airworthiness directive for U.S. carriers,
which generally is also followed by foreign airlines, was
sent out by the FAA's Northwest Mountain Region headquarters
in Seattle. It calls for a one-time inspection within 72
hours of the control-wheel installation for cotter-pin
installation and damage to the attached bolts. The West
German airline also reported damage to threads of a bolt that
is part of the control-wheel assembly.
   The Boeing spokesman said the steel cotter pin is
installed by mechanics into a control-wheel subassembly at
the company's Portland, Ore., facility, and connected within
the cockpit on the 737 production line in Renton by
mechanics. Discovery of the second plane with the defect
"obviously concerns us," he said, and further study is under
way at Boeing.
   The work required by the FAA apparently isn't costly, but
it does suggest that Boeing might not have solved
production-line quality problems that have plagued it in
recent years.
   In 1989, after flaws were discovered in fire-extinguisher
systems in the engines and cargo bays of some aircraft, a
world-wide inspection resulted in reports of a total of 94
separate instances of defects, on almost every Boeing model.
   As the fire-extinguisher problems were being tallied, the
regional office of the FAA wrote Boeing that it was concerned
that "unsafe conditions" might have resulted from
"inadequacies in several areas of the company, including
basic design of electronic components, manufacturing,
production inspection quality and suppliers."
   Boeing, which claims its quality problems aren't systemic,
has said it has taken steps to improve production-line
quality, including redesign of the fire-extinguisher wiring
to prevent installation of the devices with crossed wires.
   The electrical problems had followed letters that two of
Boeing's biggest customers, Japan Air Lines and British
Airways, had sent to the manufacturer complaining about
quality problems on planes they had received.

   Morgan Stanley's
   Gilbert May Get
   Post at Big Board

   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange is expected to
nominate the head of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. as a Big Board
vice chairman, people familiar with the selection process
said.
   The naming of Morgan Stanley Chairman S. Parker Gilbert --
subject to Mr. Gilbert's acceptance and a vote of the
exchange's new board on June 7 -- could have important
repercussions. Among other things, it could solidify the
influence that powerful Morgan Stanley already has over the
exchange's policies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also, the appointment could defuse an internal debate at
Morgan Stanley over the role of the Big Board on a modern
Wall Street. Some top Morgan officials have been questioning
whether Morgan, at a time when much stock trading is done
away from the traditional exchange floor, needs to remain a
member of the Big Board at all. It's unlikely that Morgan
Stanley would abandon the Big Board while Mr. Gilbert is
serving as a vice chairman.
   Yesterday, a Big Board spokeswoman said, "We don't comment
on board matters."
   Mr. Gilbert, 56 years old, has been Morgan Stanley's
chairman since 1984 and is the highest-paid chief of a Wall
Street securities firm whose shares trade publicly. According
to Morgan Stanley's latest proxy statement, Mr. Gilbert
earned nearly $5.5 million in cash compensation last year,
double that of his peers at other big firms.
   Asked in a brief interview about becoming Big Board vice
chairman, Mr. Gilbert said it would be premature to talk
about the issue.
   Morgan Stanley already wields much influence at the New
York Stock Exchange, and floor traders both fear it and
respect its technological prowess. There is a faction of
officials within Morgan Stanley that is in favor of
purchasing a specialist firm -- the floor traders who each
have a monopoly on the trading of a particular Big Board
stock -- as almost a charitable act in which Morgan Stanley
could demonstrate how a modern specialist firm can work. But
other Morgan officials who think the exchange is an
anachronism are against such an idea.
   Morgan says it's committed to the exchange, although it
has also formed a special, highly secretive committee to
develop an electronic network between giant institutional
investors, enabling them to trade away from the Big Board or
any other exchange floor.
   A Morgan spokesman declined comment on the committee or on
the debate over specialist firms, saying both were internal
issues.
   The Big Board currently has two vice chairmen, one from
outside the exchange and one from inside. If elected, Mr.
Gilbert, a board member since 1986, would succeed William A.
Schreyer, the chairman of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Mr. Schreyer is
ending a five-year term as an exchange director, the last
three as vice chairman. Mr. Gilbert would not have to give up
the Morgan chairmanship.
   The "inside" vice chairman is Donald Stone, senior partner
at the Big Board specialist firm Lasker, Stone &amp; Stern. Mr.
Stone doesn't appear to have a challenger for his vice
chairmanship post. Indeed, his name has surfaced as a
possible successor to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr.,
who has said he plans to step down later this year after
about six years as chairman. But Mr. Stone has said he isn't
seeking the chairmanship.

   WASHINGTON -- Despite growing concern about possible links
between exposure to chemicals and degenerative nerve diseases
such as Parkinson's, the U.S. fails to adequately monitor the
neurological risks of chemicals used in farms and factories,
a congressional study concludes.
   "Neurotoxic chemicals constitute a major health threat;
the social and economic consequences of excessive exposure to
them are potentially very large," warns John Gibbons, the
director of the Office of Technology Assessment, the
congressional research agency that issued the report.

   The government's current system for testing chemicals and
pesticides focuses primarily on determining cancer risks. But
"adverse effects on organs and organ systems, particularly
the nervous system, may pose an equal or greater threat to
public health," the report says. "Consequently, it is
important to devise risk-assessment strategies to address
non-cancer health risks."
   The impact of toxins on the nervous system can range from
dizziness to death. Some recent scientific studies have
linked an increased incidence of two degenerative nerve
diseases -- Parkinson's and amyotrophid lateral sclerosis,
commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease -- to environmental
factors. In addition, some researchers speculate that
prolonged exposure to some chemicals may help cause
Alzheimer's disease. But the report stresses that "no link
between a toxic chemical and the disease has been
conclusively demonstrated."
   The Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors some
65,000 toxic chemicals, is currently drafting new
neurotoxicity guidelines for pesticides. The Office of
Technology Assessment suggests a number of other steps the
government could take -- including stepped-up research
efforts and improved coordination among the EPA, the Food and
Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and other agencies that regulate pesticides,
industrial chemicals, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
   Increased testing for neurotoxicity could be expensive for
industry. The OTA calculates that it could boost currently
required testing costs by as much as 240%. Such increases
wouldn't have a large impact on the already high costs of
developing new drugs and pesticides, but it could
significantly boost the costs -- and therefore reduce
innovation -- of developing low-volume, specialty industrial
chemicals, the report says.
   Over the last six years, both Congress and regulatory
agencies have grown more concerned about the impact of toxins
on the nervous system. The OTA report, which is entitled
"Neurotoxicity: Identifying and Controlling Poisons of the
Nervous System," is likely to stimulate more activity in that
area. "It's time we develop new tests for neurotoxicity,
promote research into the causes and treatments of neurotoxic
effects, and use our regulatory programs to reduce human and
environmental exposure to neurotoxic chemicals," says Rep.
Robert Roe (D., N.J.), chairman of the House Committee on
Science, Space and Technology.

   Sotheby's Art Auction Is Well-Received
   As New Sector of the Market Takes Off

   NEW YORK -- As the impressionist art market shows signs of
cooling from its torrid pace of appreciation, another sector
of the art market may be taking off.
   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. held a well-received sale here
last night of the art collection of Lydia Winston Malbin,
which consisted mostly of Italian futurist paintings.
Moreover, the auction house had its own money on the line.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sotheby's had estimated that the artworks for sale would
fetch $56.5 million to $74.8 million. The final total for the
91 artworks sold was $74.3 million, with many of the lots
selling above their highest presale estimate.
   While the sale was technically not part of the spring
series of impressionist and modern art auctions that sets the
tone for the overall art market, it was notable because
Sotheby's had gone out on a limb to guarantee the entire
collection.
   Sotheby's declined to disclose the amount of its
guarantee, but dealers reportedly put the figure at upward of
$70 million. That includes the artworks sold last night and a
handful of others, notably a Claude Monet painting estimated
at $6 million, which are up for bid at separate Sotheby's
auctions.
   Bidding was active and broad-based from a variety of
mostly European dealers and collectors. Buyers said demand
was brisk because futurist works rarely come up for auction.
   Under a guarantee arrangement, the estate receives the
amount of the guarantee, regardless of what the bids for the
artworks total, essentially making Sotheby's, not the estate,
the primary seller. Guarantees have been much criticized
because of the conflict-of-interest questions they raise, but
they have grown increasingly common as competition for
collections has intensified among the three fine-art auction
houses here, Sotheby's, Christie's International PLC and
Habsburg, Feldman Inc.
   At the Sotheby's sale, among the top-selling artworks was
Piet Mondrian's "Composition in Black and White with Blue
Square." The stark geometric canvas sold for $6.8 million. It
had been estimated to sell for between $5 million to $7
million. Overall the handful of impressionist and modern
paintings in the Malbin collection, such as paintings by
Matisse and Miro, sold within their estimates.
   Sotheby's stock, which is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, closed $1.25 higher at $18.625 yesterday. The stock
rose primarily on news of the stunning, world-record price
set for a Vincent van Gogh at Christie's Tuesday evening.
Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo paid $82.5 million for "Portrait
of Dr. Gachet," almost double the previous record for an
artwork. Christie's stock also rallied in London Stock
Exchange trading, closing at #3.37 ($5.66), up 10 pence.
   At Tuesday night's impressionist painting sale at
Christie's, the total for the artworks came to about $269
million, in the midrange of the company's published presale
expectations. Overall, 24 of the 81 works Christie's
auctioned didn't sell, and of those that did, 31% sold below
their presale price estimates. Moreover at a daytime sale of
second-tier and less-expensive impressionist art yesterday,
Christie's reported that one-fourth of the artworks were
unsold.
   On balance, the results weren't as impressive as those
reached in recent years, showing a slowing in the rate of
appreciation for impressionist art, but they were better than
the doleful returns fetched for contemporary art at Sotheby's
and Christie's last week.
   Christopher Burge, president of Christie's America, noted
that, while some pieces sold below estimates on Tuesday,
"they sold," and the numbers represented a "solidifying of
the market."
   The sales so far have been a prelude to Sotheby's huge
auction of impressionist and modern paintings tonight. The
centerpiece of that sale is Pierre-Auguste Renoir's "Au
Moulin de la Galette," an ebullient, colorful depiction of a
Parisian dance hall. The estimate for the painting is $40
million to $50 million, but given the price fetched by the
more somber van Gogh, some dealers are now expecting it to
break the world record. Reportedly, the well-endowed Getty
Museum of Los Angeles is expected to be among the bidders.

   Interest Rates Finish the Day Little Changed
   Despite Encouraging Data on Consumer Prices

   NEW YORK -- Most interest rates ended little changed
despite further signs that inflation pressures have eased
from their torrid pace earlier this year.
   A government report yesterday morning showing that
consumer prices rose only 0.2% last month sparked a brief
bond-market rally. That was the mildest increase since
September and was slightly less than the 0.3% rise many
analysts expected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the rally didn't last long, partly because of growing
concern about the nation's huge budget deficit. Several money
managers and bond traders are worried about the lack of
progress so far in budget talks between Bush administration
officials and congressional leaders.
   Prices of actively traded Treasury notes and bonds ended
the day unchanged to slightly lower. Long-term government
bonds fell about 1/8 point, or about $1.25 for each $1,000
face amount. Short-term Treasury bill rates were flat.
   Washington's growing budget woes are "not a positive for
the bond markets," said William Brachfeld, executive vice
president and head of fixed-income securities trading at
Daiwa Securities America Inc. He said several Daiwa clients
here and in Japan "are increasingly concerned" about the
failure so far of the White House and congressional leaders
to agree on a big deficit-reduction package.
   The budget talks are being watched closely because an
accord could mean less government borrowing and might even
encourage the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates. The
Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee,
met Tuesday to review strategy.
   Until recently, many analysts had expected the Fed to
raise short-term rates in an effort to fight an inflation
problem that appeared to be growing. But those worries
evaporated quickly following a string of government reports
showing unexpectedly weak business activity and less
inflation than generally feared. Now, the consensus is that
the Fed will hold short-term rates steady in coming weeks.
   However, the Treasury's borrowing needs remain huge, and
investors received a fresh reminder of this yesterday.
   The Treasury said it will sell $10.8 billion of new
two-year notes Wednesday, followed Thursday by the sale of
$8.5 billion of notes due in five years and two months. The
size of these two sales was "bigger than expected," said
Kevin Flanagan, money-market economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. "It eclipsed even our gloomy expectations."
   Mr. Flanagan and other analysts worry that the Treasury's
borrowing needs could be exacerbated by the thrift bailout
and a growing federal deficit. "Things don't look that rosy
for next year" for the budget deficit, Mr. Flanagan said.
   Late yesterday, the new two-year notes were quoted in
when-issued trading at 8.55%, while the new five-year,
two-month notes were trading at about 8.60%.
   Fed officials probably won't make any credit policy
changes at least until early next month, after the release of
May employment statistics, several analysts said. The April
employment report, released earlier this month, showed much
smaller employment gains than expected.
   Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc., said the bond market appears to be "on
hold" until the May jobs report. Until then, Treasury bond
yields are likely to hover between 8.55% and 8.75%, he said.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Lured by lower borrowing costs, two more large
corporations tapped the bond market.
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the Chicago-based retailer, was the
biggest borrower in the corporate debt market with a $400
million offering of new three-year notes. The non-callable
notes were priced to yield 9.387%. Underwriters led by
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. boosted the size of the issue from $300
million in response to strong investor demand.
   Desmond Wong, corporate finance director at Sears, said
the company decided to tap the market after the consumer
price report showed an unexpectedly small increase in
inflation last month. "In our case, we just saw the
opportunity when the consumer price index was announced and
the market was stable," he said. "We are getting a coupon of
9.35%, and for a three-year, we think that's a good level for
us."
   Separately, Maytag Corp. sold $200 million of 12-year
debentures. Thomas Ringgenberg, treasurer at Maytag, said the
appliance maker had been seeking to tap the market for some
time. However, "it was really last Friday's PPI {producer
price index} number that caused {yields on} Treasurys to come
down within our range" and prompted Maytag to issue debt, he
said. Maytag's 12-year debentures were priced to yield
9.814%.
   Nevertheless, many other corporate treasurers are waiting
on the sidelines for lower rates before they tap the market.
   "It's going to take a long {Treasury} bond range of
between 8 3/8% and 8 1/2% to bring a lot of corporate
treasurers in," said James Quigley of Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets. The Treasury's 30-year bonds yielded about 8 5/8% as
of late yesterday.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, corporate
issues closed between 1/8 and 1/4 point lower. In the junk
bond market, high-yield issues, or bonds with
below-investment-grade ratings, ended the day mixed.
   Among the junk bonds that advanced were issues of
Owens-Illinois Inc. as investors were encouraged by the
company's first-quarter earnings report. But among the big
losers in the market were junk bonds of Burlington Holdings
Inc., which slipped about 1/2 point on average.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities fell 1/32 to 5/32 point, but most
issues held up better than Treasurys despite talk that the
Resolution Trust Corp. sold as much as $1 billion of mortgage
issues.
   The RTC, the government conservator for failed thrifts,
has stepped up its sales of mortgage securities in recent
weeks as it seeks to resolve the situations of 141 thrifts by
the end of the quarter.
   While the RTC was a rumored seller, there also was strong
demand for mortgage securities.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
June delivery ended at 95 18/32, down 2/32; 9 1/2% securities
were at 97 30/32, down 3/32; 10% securities were at 100
13/32, down 1/32; and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2%
securities were at 97 1/2, down 5/32.
   The Ginnie Mae 10% issue was supported by the issuance of
a $500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed
by 10% securities via Salomon Brothers Inc.
   The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.78% to a 12-year
average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury
10-year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.12.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   After a brief early-morning rally, Treasury bond prices
reversed direction, finishing the day with slight declines.
   The government's benchmark 30-year bond initially rose to
101 19/32, a gain of about 1/4 point from Tuesday. But by
late in the afternoon, the price had fallen to 101 6/32, to
yield 8.63%.
   The latest 10-year notes fell to 101 9/32 from 101 14/32.
Earlier yesterday, the issue traded as high as 101 19/32. The
yield rose to 8.66% from 8.64%.
   However, prices of two-year Treasury notes inched higher,
helped by rumors that an institution had purchased a large
amount of the latest two-year issue and sold a similar-sized
block of long-term bonds. The two-year notes rose 1/32 point
to 100 19/32 to yield 8.51%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended mostly unchanged to off 1/8 point
with some issues trading down 1/4 in a moderately active
session.
   In new-issue activity, $266 million in debt was priced,
following more than $1 billion on Tuesday.
   In related activity, Moody's Investors Service Inc.
confirmed its single-A-1 rating on Nassau County's general
obligation bonds, citing the New York county's "strong,
diverse and affluent economic base" that provides
"fundamental credit strength." The confirmation came ahead of
the sale today of $85.1 million of various purpose bonds via
competitive bid.
   Among seasoned bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue of 2018 was unchanged at 98 bid to yield 7.36%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Snapping a three-day rally, Japanese government bond
prices fell as the yen sank against the dollar.
   Japan's benchmark bond due in 1999 was quoted in
mid-afternoon at a price of 87.79, down 0.34, to yield 7%.
   In other major markets, West German bond prices drifted
lower as traders braced for a heavy supply of new borrowing.
The government is creating a 115 billion mark ($69.8 billion)
special German Unity Fund, which will issue large amounts of
debt to raise money to rebuild East Germany's economy. West
Germany's 7 3/4% bonds of 2000 fell 0.15 point to 93.95 to
yield 8.69%.
   In London, British government bond prices seesawed
throughout the day, ending very close to where they were the
previous day. Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007
declined 1/8 point to 98 7/32 to yield 12%. The 12% bonds due
1995 rose 1/32 point to 96 27/32 to yield 12.92%, while the
11 3/4% issue due 1991 was unchanged at 98 6/32 to yield
14.75%.

   Two Men Found
   To Have Violated
   Securities Laws

   A federal jury in Los Angeles found that a stockbroker and
a former printing-plant employee committed securities fraud
by trading on information from advance copies of Business
Week.
   In the civil suit, brought by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the jury found that Brian Callahan, formerly a
stockbroker with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., and
William Jackson, who worked at the Torrance, Calif., printing
plant of R.R. Donnelly &amp; Sons Co., broke the law by trading
on confidential information.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SEC charged that Mr. Jackson traded on information
from Business Week before the magazine hit the newsstands and
then passed the information on to Mr. Callahan. Employees of
Donnelly, one of the companies that prints Business Week for
McGraw-Hill Inc., have been named in other SEC lawsuits
alleging that they used advance information from the
magazine. Donnelly requires its employees to keep such
information secret.
   Mr. Callahan and Mr. Jackson were accused of making a
total of 122 transactions involving 53 stocks between July
1987 and July 1988. Mr. Callahan joined the scheme in April
1988 when Mr. Jackson opened an account with him, the SEC
said.
   U.S. Judge Stephen V. Wilson issued a freeze on the amount
of the defendants' assets that the SEC is seeking to have
turned over as illegal profits. The SEC said the $19,500
freeze on Mr. Jackson's assets represents illegal profits
made on the transactions in Mr. Jackson's own accounts, those
of a brother and a joint account he had with two brothers.
The brothers weren't accused of any wrongdoing.
   The $27,600 freeze on Mr. Callahan's assets equals the
illegal profits that he and eight clients made on the
transactions, plus $8,000 in brokerage commissions, said
Jeffrey Zuckerman, an SEC associate regional administrator
from New York working on the case. The SEC has said Mr.
Callahan was fired by Prudential-Bache in August 1988 for his
alleged involvement in the scheme.
   The two defendants also face penalties of as much as three
times the illegal profits. Judge Wilson will decide whether
to order any penalties.
   Attorneys for the defendants said Mr. Callahan's and Mr.
Jackson's stock trading violated no securities law. Joseph
Connolly, an attorney for Mr. Callahan, said his client
didn't know the information he received from Mr. Jackson was
confidential. Jack Samet, an attorney for Mr. Jackson, said
he doesn't believe the violation of a work rule should
constitute a securities-law violation.
   The defense attorneys have filed a motion asking Judge
Wilson to reject the SEC's use of the "misappropriation
theory" in this case. Under that theory, the SEC charges
securities fraud if a defendant trades on confidential
information that was taken in violation of a fiduciary duty.
The defense attorneys plan to appeal if their motion is
denied.
   Although that SEC rule has been upheld in other federal
jurisdictions, including New York, it hasn't been decided in
the Los Angeles court.

   Tucson Electric Co.
   Might Have to Seek

   TUCSON, Ariz. -- Tucson Electric Co. raised the
possibility that it might be forced to seek bankruptcy-law
protection from its creditors if various financing plans
aren't successful.
   In a regulatory filing, the company said its "immediate
cash requirements would exceed available credit under
existing bank lines" if some proceeds of certain securities
offerings aren't received or other financing alternatives
aren't completed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company estimated that an additional $120 million will
be needed to meet its cash requirements through year end.
   The bankruptcy threat wasn't mentioned at the company's
annual meeting yesterday, where angry shareholders called for
the resignation of company directors and grilled executives
about the company's failed investments and depressed stock
price.
   In an interview after the meeting, Charles Bayless, chief
financial officer, said the company disclosed the bankruptcy
possibility upon legal advice, but doesn't think it is a
serious possibility. The company is "more confident now" of
obtaining adequate credit lines than earlier this year, he
said. Tucson Electric also indicated that it plans to ask
state authorities for a rate increase of about 10% by early
summer.
   In January, Tucson Electric eliminated its quarterly
dividend on common stock based on its lack of earnings and
inadequate cash flows. Last year, the company had a net loss
of $82.1 million, or $3.55 a share, on revenue of $593.7
million.

   NEW YORK -- A U.S. bankruptcy court here permitted Ames
Department Stores Inc. to receive $250 million in interim
financing so the company can purchase goods from hesitant
suppliers.
   Stephen L. Pistner, chief executive officer of Ames,
called the court's ruling "very good news for Ames's
creditors, employees, customers and suppliers." Ames has said
suppliers have refused to ship goods and extend credit since
the company filed for bankruptcy court protection last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Pistner said that "merchandise shipments should be
back to normal in very short order." Chemical Bank, a unit of
Chemical Banking Corp., is the lender of the $250 million.
   Bankruptcy court Judge Howard Buschman said Ames needed
only $150 million for current purchases, and that the
additional $100 million was needed as an inducement for
suppliers to extend credit on normal terms.
   Creditors with other loans outstanding to Ames initially
objected to the new loan, raising concerns about their
repayment priority in relation to Chemical. The court
approved the new loan after the 33 lenders reached agreement
on repayment priorities, and on terms for splitting $91
million in an Ames cash collateral account.
   The troubled discount retailer operates about 600 stores
in 20 states.

   DENVER -- Tele-Communications Inc. reported that its net
loss widened in the first quarter, largely as a result of
increased interest expense arising from financing and
servicing debt of several purchases.
   For the quarter, the nation's largest cable television
operator said its loss widened to $57 million, or 16 cents a
share, from $51 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier.
However, operating profit -- before interest, depreciation
and amortization expenses -- grew 34% to $330 million from
$247 million. Revenue rose 31% to $861 million from $655
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tele-Communications said interest expense rose to $228
million in the quarter from $175 million a year earlier. TCI
pointed to several purchases, including closing of the
purchase in the quarter of TCI/Cooke Systems, with more than
200,000 subscribers, from Jack Kent Cooke Inc. and Cooke
Media Group Inc. for nearly $400 million. TCI also pointed to
the cost of servicing debt incurred to finance other earlier
transactions, including the purchase of a 42.5% indirect
interest in SCI Holdings Inc. and the merger of United
Artists Communications Inc. and United Cable Television Corp.
   In the quarter, TCI also purchased additional shares of
cumulative redeemable exchangeable preferred of Storer
Communications Inc., and now owns about five million
preferred shares, or a 40.55% equity stake. TCI said it may
consider additional purchases of Storer securities.
   In national over-the-counter trading TCI closed yesterday
at $13.75 a share, down 25 cents.

   N.V. Philips of the Netherlands said it signed an accord
with Thomson S.A. of France to push jointly for a European
launch of new high-definition television, or HDTV, technology
in 1995.
   French government officials said the two companies,
Europe's biggest consumer electronics concerns, plan to
expand their joint laboratory research in HDTV. Philips
declined to comment. But it said the companies estimate
HDTV's launch may cost all of European industry three billion
European currency units ($3.73 billion); the Philips-Thomson
outlays haven't been decided. HDTV would offer extra-sharp
color pictures, improved sound, and cinema-style screen
formats. But HDTV sets in Europe initially may be priced at
as much as 30,000 French francs ($5,410).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Billing the HDTV market as the battleground for global
dominance in consumer electronics, big makers have been
seeking government research subsidies. State-controlled
Thomson is negotiating its five-year research budget; the
accord and the big HDTV cost estimate may buttress Thomson's
arguments for increased funding. Thomson declined to comment.

   Del Webb Corp. said a nonbinding shareholder resolution to

support from the Phoenix, Ariz., real estate developer's

   The proposal by Los Angeles-based Webbcott Holdings, which
owns a 9.7% stake and is controlled by director James J.
Cotter, would request that the board redeem shareholder
rights issued under a "poison pill" plan adopted last year.
Less than half the votes have been tallied, but a company
spokesman said a "significant majority" of the votes counted
so far support the resolution. A final tally isn't expected
for several days.

   In April, Webb agreed to several of Mr. Cotter's demands
to avert a proxy fight at yesterday's annual meeting. Mr.
Cotter had planned to offer a rival slate of directors and
wanted to eliminate "golden parachute" provisions for senior

   TORONTO -- Horsham Corp. said its partners in Clark Oil &amp;

Horsham yesterday, or about a 2.6% stake.
   The shares, crossed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, were
sold by Paul Anthony Novelly and Samuel R. Goldstein,
president and chairman respectively of Apex Oil Co., a
Horsham official said. Apex Oil holds a 40% stake in Clark
Oil. Horsham acquired the other 60% of Clark Oil from Apex
Oil in late 1988.

   Paul Melnuk, Horsham's chief financial officer, said he

Mr. Goldstein have sold about 3.5 million Horsham subordinate
voting shares in the last few months and currently hold about
5 million of the shares.
   Horsham is controlled by its chairman and chief executive,
Peter Munk, who holds all of the company's multiple voting
shares and about an 83% voting stake.
   Mr. Melnuk said Apex Oil, of St. Louis is on the verge of
coming out of U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
"Presumabley {Mr. Novelly and Mr. Goldstein} just needed some
liquidity" to help finance Apex Oil's reorganization, Mr.

   Even before Baltimore's board met late yesterday afternoon

Baltimore's chairman and chief executive officer, told
shareholders at the company's annual meeting that the bank
was not for sale.
   Baltimore also said there was no assurance that an
agreement on a merger transaction could ever be reached
because the proposal was conditioned on a due-diligence
investigation by Allied Irish and its advisers. The process
would have required Baltimore to open its books and records
to First Maryland, a major competitor.

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration's budget-deficit
projections have grown so large that concern exists in the
White House and Congress that meeting deficit targets may do
more harm than good to the economy.
   New administration forecasts show that to avoid
across-the-board spending cuts this fall, the government may
need to find as much as $64 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases -- even if the added borrowing needed to clean up
the thrift industry is excluded. If all the thrift costs are
included, as the law currently requires, they would need as
much as $114 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At his first news conference since the start of budget
talks with Congress, President Bush said that paring the
deficit by more than 1% of the gross national product --
about $55 billion -- would "risk . . . slowing down the
economy further."
   Mr. Bush said that he won't give details of his position
on budget issues until an agreement has been reached and that
he was concerned about "frightening" the financial markets by
exaggerating the extent of the budget problem.
   The president dismissed calls by some Democrats that he
give a televised address or otherwise lead a broad public
discussion of the budget deficit, presumably to prepare the
public for the possibility of tax increases or other
measures.
   Another alternative mentioned with increasing frequency on
Capitol Hill would be to alter the targets under the
Gramm-Rudman law to require less deficit reduction this year.
Both administration and congressional negotiators already
seem prepared to alter the law so they don't have to count
the cost of the thrift bailout.
   Cutting the deficit in one year by the amount that may be
required to meet the Gramm-Rudman target might be neither
politically possible nor economically wise, some congressmen
say. "You may not be able to save that much without harming
the economy in some way," House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) warned.
   Both White House Budget Director Richard Darman and Robert
Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, are
to discuss this issue with budget negotiators this afternoon.
   A major economic rationale for trimming the federal
deficit is to curb the government's appetite for debt, thus
freeing up money for private investment and bringing down
interest rates. This, in turn, would help keep the economy
growing. But the newly expressed fear is that such a
beneficial effect might be offset by a sharp cutback in
government spending and an increase in taxes. The resulting
reduction in overall demand could slow the economy down.
   "I don't think anyone can say for sure where that line can
be drawn," Mr. Reischauer said.
   Some members of Congress say worrying about cutting too
much from the deficit is ridiculous. They say the greater
risk is that this year's deficit-reduction package, like
those in the past, will be swollen with accounting gimmicks
that have little economic impact.
   In the past several years, Congress never agreed on more
than $25 billion in real, lasting reductions of the deficit,
according to the Congressional Budget Office.
   At his news conference, Mr. Bush defended his reticence,
saying he doesn't want to "go out there and do something that
might inadvertently suggest crisis and frighten markets."
   But Democrats continued to press him. "The American people
must hear from the president about the length and breadth of
this problem, and they must also see a proposal from him,"
said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D.,
Texas).
   Mr. Bush said that while he feels an obligation to be
candid with lawmakers, he sees no need to involve the public
in the discussions. Nor, he said, will he put his own
proposals out first, as some members of Congress have
suggested.
   "I want to go out when we have a bipartisan answer to the
problem, (and) say, `Here's what the problem is and here's
what the answer (is).' And if I go out there today, we don't
have a bipartisan answer, and that's the only way this
problem's going to be solved," Mr. Bush said.
   Mr. Darman now figures the deficit for the year beginning
Oct. 1, without any policy changes, will total between $123
billion and $138 billion, congressional staffers said. Mr.
Darman says thrift borrowing could add as much as $50 billion
to that total. The range is slightly different than the one
reported by lawmakers immediately after the first budget
"summit" meeting Tuesday. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, the
deficit for the year can't exceed $74 billion.

   Stripped-Down Beneficial Profits by Lending
   To the Little Guy and Shunning the Big Deals

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Looking for a financial services stock
untainted by commercial real estate loans, leveraged buy-out
loans, foreign loans or junk bonds? Beneficial may be a good
way to bet on the old-fashioned middle American borrower.
   After shedding unrelated businesses such as the Spiegel
mail-order catalog, Western Auto Supply and a loss-plagued
reinsurance unit, Beneficial is focused on consumer lending.
About 63% of its loans are second mortgages; most of the rest
of its assets are unsecured personal loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Those loans have helped Beneficial generate consistently
increasing earnings. Several analysts expect earnings to
increase about 12% this year and next; the company is widely
expected to boost its dividend 9% to a $2.40 annual rate at
its board meeting next Wednesday. Yet Beneficial shares, at
52 3/4, are selling for about 10 times trailing earnings,
while the overall market multiple is 16 times.
   Noting Beneficial's 13 consecutive quarters of increasing
earnings, analyst Sy Jacobs of Mabon Nugent says, "In an
environment where the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 earnings have
become unpredictable and disappointing, that kind of record
deserves something close to a market multiple."
   Others argue that Beneficial offers a chance to invest in
consumer lending unburdened by other businesses. Of
Beneficial's main competitors, Commercial Credit is owned by
Primerica, which has big securities and life insurance units;
and Household International has more than $2 billion of such
unpopular assets as LBO loans, commercial real estate loans
and junk bonds.
   "My theory is that Beneficial is really the only pure play
left in the consumer finance business," says Lacy M.
Shockley, a regional bank analyst with Smith Barney, a
Primerica unit.
   The major risk for Beneficial is one that the stock market
views as unlikely: A recession or depression in which
unemployment soars and middle-income borrowers stop paying
their debts.
   Over the past decade, Beneficial has increased the share
of its lending that is secured by homes, but it has remained
conservative in the amounts it will lend. Beneficial won't
allow total debt on a borrower's house to exceed 75% of its
appraised value. The amount of Beneficial's average
second-mortgage loan is $25,000; its average unsecured loan
is $2,200.
   Most Beneficial customers could get lower rates or bigger
loan amounts from banks or thrifts, but the company has
thrived by developing a network of offices staffed by
aggressive, service-oriented salespeople.
   One new program that is providing significant earnings
growth is tax-refund lending, offered through H&amp;R Block. For
a flat fee of $35, Beneficial will send a taxpayer a check
for his expected refund within a day or two after H&amp;R Block
makes an electronic tax return filing for the customer. Last
year, Beneficial made about 550,000 of the so-called "refund
anticipation loans"; this year, the number doubled to 1.1
million. Gregory Whyte, a Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst,
expects the program to contribute 65 to 70 cents a share to
earnings, up from 30 to 35 cents a share last year.
   Andrew C. Halvorsen, Beneficial's chief financial officer,
won't predict a dividend increase but says the issue "will be
a topic of discussion at the May 23 board meeting. We realize
that dividends are important to our shareholders." He also
assures investors with long memories that Beneficial doesn't
have any remaining liability for its former American
Centennial reinsurance unit. The unit, which ate up $460
million of Beneficial's capital in 1986, was sold for $10
million in cash and $98 million in notes, and its new owners
have paid Beneficial $15 million in principal and interest so
far. Mr. Halvorsen said American Centennial soon will begin
making modest payments on a $60 million note that matures in
1997 and that Beneficial carries on its books at zero.
   One drag on earnings is the Harbour Island real estate
development near Tampa, Fla., that will produce pretax losses
of about $21 million this year, which Mr. Halvorsen hopes to
reduce. A potential real estate gain literally surrounds
Beneficial's headquarters in Peapack, N.J., where the company
hopes to sell 600 acres of a 700-acre tract, now on the books
at only $11 million.
   Ms. Shockley of Smith Barney believes that within five
years, Beneficial will be acquired by a diversified financial
services company or a big regional bank. "I would not be
surprised to see a price somewhere near $100 a share," she
says.
   But beware. Beneficial's management put the company up for
sale in 1986, and some analysts estimated it could fetch a
price of $85 a share. But the best bid was only $75 a share,
which Beneficial rejected, and the stock since then hasn't
approached its takeover-induced high of 78 5/8.

   Chyron Corp., a Melville, N.Y., manufacturer of television
graphics and special-effects equipment, reported a $2 million
fiscal third-quarter net loss on a 36% sales drop.
   Hurting results in the quarter were the company's halting
of a deferred-payment plan for dealers and customers,
expenses from unsuccessful merger discussions, and an
unprofitable subsidiary.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chyron shares fell 25 cents to $1.75.
   Adjusted for a 2% stock dividend paid March 1, the loss
for the quarter ended March 31 equaled 17 cents a share,
compared with net income of $112,000, or one cent a share, in
the year-earlier period. Sales sank to $7.7 million from
$11.9 million.
   Alfred O.P. Leubert, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that effective Jan. 1, the company stopped offering
extended payment terms. Dealers now will pare inventories and
order products as they need them. "We see the loss of sales
as temporary," he said.

   The Gow School for Dyslexics Has
   A Prize Grad in Bob Buterbaugh

   ROBERT BUTERBAUGH OF HILTON HEAD, S.C., is a 37-year-old
college graduate who has trouble reading and writing. This
reflects no failure by Michigan's Hillsdale College, his alma
mater, but the fact that he has dyslexia, a neurological
condition that confuses the way a person reads and writes.
"We read differently," is how he explains it.
   Mr. Buterbaugh, who grew up in Detroit, credits his
college degree and his success in the real estate business to
his five years at the Gow School, a New York school for
dyslexics. His feelings, however, go far beyond the old
school tie. He has become Gow's chief fund-raiser.
   Dyslexics are a special breed. The disorder, first
identified at the end of the last century, affects probably
10% of all men and 3% of women. It is not a visual weakness
(airline pilots can have it) nor does it stifle talent.
Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and Nelson Rockefeller were
dyslexics; so is Oscar-winner Cher.
   Peter Gow, a Buffalo schoolteacher, had been bothered when
obviously bright students performed miserably in class. He
got interested in dyslexia in the 1920s after he met Samuel
Orton, an Iowa neurologist and psychiatrist who had made a
special study of it. The upshot of their meeting was that in
1926 Gow created a special prep school for dyslexics in South
Wales, N.Y., 30 miles from Buffalo.
   Bob Buterbaugh arrived as a seventh-grader after his
parents had despaired of his ever getting much further. In
Gow's deliberately small classes -- 10 is the maximum --
young Buterbaugh was able to overcome his handicap
sufficiently to qualify for college, as most Gow graduates
do. A 1977 study of more than 900 Gow alumni by Johns Hopkins
University found that at least 58% earned bachelor's degrees
and 10% went on to graduate schools. Mr. Buterbaugh says he
has taken on the fund-raising chores for Gow to help pay back
the school for what it did for him. He now makes the 952-mile
trek from Hilton Head to Buffalo four or five times a year,
spending two or three days on each visit.
   The main base for Gow's fund raising is its 1,200
graduates, and Mr. Buterbaugh is working to get them into a
habit of making regular gifts. For this, he spends much of
his time working his Hilton Head telephone. In two years as a
trustee, he has raised $250,000.
   David Gow, the founder's son who at 66 is about to retire
as headmaster, says part of the money will go for more
student aid to help more dyslexic boys meet the school's
$14,000-a-year tuition bill. (So far it is boys only, but Mr.
Gow expects girls before too long. "With schools like V.M.I.
accepting women," he says, "it has to happen.")
   Mr. Buterbaugh doesn't confine his philanthropy to Gow.
After Hurricane Hugo smashed into the Carolinas last year, he
left Hilton Head (which was spared) to spend a week around
battered Charleston doing damage assessment for the Red
Cross. But Gow is his first cause.
   "I want to find time for this," Mr. Buterbaugh says of his
work with Gow. But so far, he has ignored one Gow precept.
Because dyslexia cannot be cured but only compensated,
students are advised to "find yourself a wife who can spell."
He's still a bachelor.

   ICH Corp. said it expects to report a profit for the first
quarter compared with a net loss of $10.7 million, or 37
cents a share, a year earlier.
   The Louisville, Ky.-based insurance holding company said
release of first-quarter results has been delayed because the
company didn't receive financial statements in time from
First Executive Corp., in which ICH has about a 20% stake, or
from the purchaser of Philadelphia Life and the Denver
subsidiaries that ICH sold at the end of the first quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   ICH said it can't be certain that its outlook is accurate
until it has fully reviewed that financial information.
   The company said health-insurance operations "have had
improved levels of policy renewals at rates that have
resulted in a somewhat improved ratio of losses to premiums.
As a result, those operations achieved higher revenues and
improved margins, and are ahead of our internal expectations
for this year."
   In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock
Exchange, ICH closed at $3.375, unchanged.

   Futures Shock: Tight Rein if SEC Reigns

   Higher Margins

   WASHINGTON -- Futures-markets investors can expect higher
trading margins, tighter market surveillance, and more
skeptical review of new financial products if the Securities
and Exchange Commission wins its battle to oversee
stock-index futures.
   Investors also may see the SEC tinkering with the way
index futures are traded on the Chicago and New York
exchanges, as well as the way investment suitability is
handled, regulatory and industry officials say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Those are just a few of the issues the SEC could take on
if Congress endorses the Bush administration's proposal to
shift regulation of stock-index futures to the securities
agency from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Currently, the SEC regulates stock and options trading, but
it and the Treasury Department have been pushing to get index
futures switched.
   While the jurisdictional debate has by no means been
settled and could well end in a stalemate, debate is raging
in Washington and at the exchanges over how the index-futures
market would change under new overseers.
   Stock-index futures, first traded in 1982, are one of the
nation's fastest-growing investment products. Traded
similarly to other futures products on the commodity
exchanges, they allow investors to bet on the movement of a
basket of stocks without owning the actual shares. They are
most often used by large institutional investors to offset
risk in a portfolio -- a technique called hedging.
   SEC officials have grown gun-shy about discussing how they
might regulate index futures. "That's much too much of a hot
potato," said one market-regulation official recently when
asked to comment on the issue. But interviews with agency
officials before the imposition of the media blackout,
statements at public hearings and comments by people in touch
with regulators show that the SEC clearly has some things in
mind.
   To be sure, not even futures loyalists expect the agency
to wreak immediate and sweeping changes. "My guess is that to
avoid people like me standing up and saying I told you so,
they would regulate them at first exactly the same as the
CFTC does," said John Damgard, who heads the Futures Industry
Association. "But ultimately they would play to their
audiences," the securities firms and exchanges, he says.
   Many of those constituents -- as well as SEC and Treasury
officials -- have been calling for higher margins. When
futures margins, which are set by the exchanges, slip too
low, the extra leverage can trigger sharp moves in stock
futures that spill over into the stock market, they argue.
   "We would certainly take a look at margins, assuming we
would have the authority," Richard Ketchum, the SEC's head of
market regulation, said in an interview last month. SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden also has urged higher margins,
proposing a national "speed limit" that would set a floor on
futures margins, the good faith money required for trades.
   Futures-exchange officials, aware of administration
sentiment, have boosted margins sharply in the past two
months. Currently, for example, margins on the most popular
contract, based on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index,
stand at $20,000, or 11%, for speculators. That's more than
twice the $9,000 level of last September.
   If the S&amp;P 500 margin was raised to 20%, a figure Mr.
Breeden has floated, the initial deposit for speculators
would jump to more than $35,000, based on current price
levels. Barry Lind, chairman of Lind-Waldock &amp; Co., Chicago,
the largest discount futures-brokerage firm, contends that
that level would throttle retail trading in stock-index
futures, pushing retail customers to other, lower-margin
contracts, such as soybean or foreign currency futures.
   But retail, or individual, customers account for only
about 5% of S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures trading volume at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, staffers there say. The two
largest groups of users, local traders in the pits and
institutional customers, usually don't trade on margin.
Locals trade on margin only if they hold positions overnight
-- which is rare for these independent traders who often
trade in and out of positions within minutes. Institutional
customers investing money for pensions -- the bulk of the
institutional business -- are prohibited by federal law from
trading on margin.
   Futures money managers who trade actively on margin might
have trading damped by higher margins, though traders say the
big managers wouldn't have any problem pulling cash out of
other markets to make a major bet on stock indexes.
   But the SEC may have other changes in mind, in addition to
higher margins. As former SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest
notes, "If you want to change margins you don't have to
change jurisdiction."
   For example, the SEC would be forced to decide how to
handle trading-floor surveillance procedures. Currently, it
cedes that responsibility to the stock exchanges, while the
CFTC employs surveillance personnel to patrol the pits.
   Despite that floor presence, and despite the stock
market's insider-trading scandals, the Chicago exchanges have
long been perceived as being weaker in policing trading than
are the stock exchanges. The CFTC, which was created in 1975,
was roundly criticized last year after a federal undercover
operation turned up widespread trading fraud on the Chicago
markets. The agency has moved to fix those problems, but SEC
staffers privately point to those difficulties and swear they
would never happen on the stock exchanges.
   Conversely, however, the agency historically has been more
willing to allow new products, industry observers note. While
that is partly a result of the more-innovative spirit of the
futures markets, the SEC has been a cautious regulator,
officials at both agencies say. These regulators, who
declined to be named, suggest the SEC might stifle
innovation.
   The SEC's cautiousness stems in part from its creation
during the New Deal to protect investors following the 1929
crash. Stock and options investors must clear a suitability
test to be certain the products are appropriate investments.
The futures markets have no similar test. "The SEC has a
regulatory philosophy pervading the agency that goes toward
investor protection," says Mr. Damgard, the futures industry
lobbyist. "But the futures investor needs much less
protection."
   That same Depression-era philosophy spawned the SEC's
"uptick" rule, which allows stock-market investors to short
stocks only if the last recorded price move is up. That rule
was designed to keep short sellers, who bet that a stock will
fall, from ganging up on shares and driving them down. "It's
the old philosophy that everyone here wants to see the
markets go up," says one high-level SEC staffer.
   But the futures markets have no similar rule, and futures
price moves mainly have daily price limits to rein them in.
The SEC would have to decide whether to carry the uptick rule
into the futures markets.
   For some observers, the move of stock-index futures, which
represent about 5% of the total futures volume, is simply a
test for moving other futures to the SEC. "It's only 5% of
the market, so in that sense it might be a good prototype for

   NEW YORK -- The leveraged buy-out fund run by Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. acquired Londontown Holdings Corp., maker of
London Fog rainwear and other apparel for an indicated price
of more than $63.2 million.
   The seller is General Electric Co.'s General Electric
Capital Corp., which financed a $178 million leveraged
buy-out of Londontown in December 1988. Interco Inc. sold
Eldersburg, Md.-based Londontown at the time to reduce debt
Interco took on to fend off a takeover bid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   GE provided the financing for the original buy-out with
$215 million in debt, $20 million in preferred stock and a
$75 million bridge loan by GE's securities unit, Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. That loan was refinanced last year with a sale
by Kidder of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds.
   Merrill is paying $1,631.23 a share for 38,750 Class B
Common shares of Londontown Holdings, or $63.2 million, plus
a sum it didn't disclose for part of an equity interest held
by Londontown management. The common shares include 9,687.5
warrants sold in connection with the junk-bond offering and
convertible into a 17.5% interest in the company. The
transaction values the warrants at $15.8 million.
   GE will continue to hold its Londontown debt and preferred
stock, and the junk bonds will remain outstanding. But a
spokesman wouldn't disclose GE's purchase price for its
equity stake or its indicated profit or loss on the
transaction.
   Executives of Merrill's buy-out fund, Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners Inc., couldn't be reached for comment.

   The expenditure is part of $190 million in plant

Chrysler also said it will spend about $28 million for new
equipment at its New Castle, Ind., machining and forge plant,
and about $12 million on new tooling for its Kokomo casting
plant.

   Chrysler said production of the new transmission -- a

the transmission plant expansion will begin this month and
end in February 1991. The Highland Park, Mich., auto maker

   But If Christmas Is Moved, Santa
   May Put Coal in Their Stockings

   PITTSBURGH -- The Fourth of July is a long way off, but
the fireworks have already started here.
   Declaring its own independence from the federal calendar,
the city of Pittsburgh will hold its celebration of
Independence Day on July 3 this year, even though the Fourth
remains a holiday. Despite tradition, city officials figure
it's a way to save some money.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the decision has lit a fire under some residents, who
consider it dumb and, if nothing else, un-American.
   Not so, counters Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff, who made
the change through her authority as chief civic permit giver.
Through an aide, the 72-year-old mayor insists the change
shouldn't be seen as a litmus test of her patriotism. It's a
prudent move, she says, because it will save about $23,000 in
holiday overtime for police officers, fire fighters,
ambulance workers and city park employees.
   As for people who have complained, city officials say,
they should consider themselves fortunate for having even a
July 3 celebration. It was "either canceling the Fourth of
July celebration or compromising," says Albert Neri, the
mayor's press secretary.
   Still, the mayor's rationale hasn't cooled the fire of
local business owners. They say the switch will cost them
thousands of dollars because people won't be coming downtown
on the Fourth.
   "Anytime they change the celebration of a holiday two
months ahead is asinine. If you're going to make a change,
make it for 1991, don't make it for the same year," says
Sonnie Miller, co-owner of Love Tourists, a local tour-guide
operator. Now, Ms. Miller says, her company is going to have
to notify 181 people who booked a dinner cruise on the Fourth
expecting to sail down the Allegheny River with fireworks
bursting overhead.
   The city's police are also hopping mad. They charge that
the mayor is merely being vindictive. She's sour, they say,
because city employees won an arbitration case in February
that more than doubles their overtime pay on holidays.
   Although the city will sidestep holiday overtime pay, the
police department may have the last laugh. Patrick McNamarah,
president of the Fraternal Order of Police, says the
department normally has more officers off on Tuesdays than
Wednesdays. So the city will have to pay some overtime to
bring in extra officers on July 3, a Tuesday.

   THE U.S. INDICATED that Soviet moves in the Baltics could
jeopardize trade ties.
   As Secretary of State Baker opened talks in Moscow aimed
at resolving superpower arms-control disputes, U.S. officials
said the Bush administration may be unwilling to sign a new
treaty liberalizing U.S.-Soviet trade relations at this
month's Bush-Gorbachev summit because of Kremlin tactics
against independence bids by the Baltic republics. At the
White House, Bush said the situation in Lithuania, Estonia
and Latvia has "put some tension on" the planned Washington
summit.

   Nicaragua's government reached tentative agreement with
Sandinista labor leaders to end some strikes by government
workers. The walkouts have disrupted public services in
Managua. The accord was reached after President Chamorro
agreed to restart negotiations. The union's wage demand,
however, remained unresolved.

can't meet Chamorro's request for a $40 million emergency
loan.

   In contrast to several other West German banks, Deutsche
Bank's conservative funding structure, in which it financed
long-term lending activities with long-term funds, made the
bank less vulnerable to the February rise in German interest
rates on fears that monetary union with East Germany would

   Data General also unveiled the $12,995 AV 3200 server
system, which can work as the center of a network of
workstations or personal computers. It also introduced two
faster, more expensive servers.

   Commodities:
   Copper Futures Prices End Somewhat Higher
   As Peruvian Mine Labor Situation Gets Worse

   NEW YORK -- Copper futures prices recovered from early
declines to end slightly higher on a worsening of the
Peruvian mine labor situation.
   The most-active July delivery ended with a gain of 0.30
cent a pound at $1.1440, after trading as much as one cent a
pound lower at $1.1310.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Late yesterday, well after the close of trading, the
world's leading copper producer -- Chile's state-owned copper
company, Codelco -- further reduced its production forecast
for this year to 1.19 million tons of refined copper. This
projection is down from its original estimate of 1.29 million
tons at the end of 1989. Since then, there have been several
cuts in Codelco's estimated output for this year. The company
said numerous production problems have reduced output and
increased costs.
   For most of the session yesterday, futures prices
continued under the recent pressure generated by an
improvement of copper supplies and an apparent slowdown in
the U.S. economy, which may result in slower copper
consumption.
   Although the soon-to-expire May delivery, which closed at
$1.2170 for a gain of 0.40 cent, showed an 0.10 cent
improvement in its premium over July, the premium of the cash
price over the three-months' contract in London continued to
narrow.
   "The severe tightness of supplies has apparently been
broken, and the only thing that kept prices from sliding
significantly was the report that a miners' strike would take
place Monday in Peru," said one analyst.
   The New York spokesman for Southern Peru Copper Corp. said
the unions representing workers at the company's Toquepala
and Cuajone mines, and its Ilo smelter, had given notice they
will strike on Monday.
   The employees at Southern Peru Copper's three
installations on March 12 went on a strike that lasted eight
weeks. They returned to work late last week without an
agreement in response to a government order. Negotiations
between the unions and management have continued since then.
   The company's Ilo smelter, which receives concentrates
from other mines as well as its own two, has an annual
production of about 280,000 tons of refined copper.
   Separately, the Peruvian state-owned mining company,
Centromin, is also on strike. The company principally mines
zinc, lead and silver, but it produces about 35,000 tons of
copper.
   Economic statistics continue to present a
less-than-promising picture for copper. The Commerce
Department said housing starts in April fell 5.8%, following
a drop of 11.2% in March. Permits for housing starts, a
longer-term indicator, were off 8.7% in April following a 5%
decline in March.
   This was the third consecutive monthly drop in these
statistics, which, according to one analyst, "represents a
solid trend." Combined with other recent statistics that
indicate a slowing of economic growth, they are a negative
factor for copper, he said.
   Another analyst, Fred Demler, metals economist for
PaineWebber, New York, noted that there are actually mixed
signals about the economy, and that could be eventually
favorable for copper.
   "While the economy may be slowing, interest rates have
been dropping and the stock market is strong," he said. "This
indicates that down the road the economy will improve."
   An important factor that soon could make its presence
felt, Mr. Demler said, was that three U.S. copper-producing
companies, which have a combined production capacity of
420,000 tons of refined copper, will have their labor
agreements with unions end on June 30.

   ENERGY: The American Petroleum Institute's bullish
statistics this week on U.S. gasoline inventories didn't
counter the API's extremely bearish figures on crude oil
stocks in energy futures trading yesterday. The result: a
56-cents-a-barrel plunge in the price of the New York
Mercantile Exchange's June crude oil contract. The API
numbers, released late Tuesday after trading had ended,
showed a huge 4.2-million-barrel decline in gasoline
inventories for the week ended last Friday. But crude oil
inventories rose by more than 4.3 million barrels. Some
traders had expressed hopes that the gasoline number would
prove more bullish than the crude figure was bearish, but
those hopes didn't pan out. The June crude oil contract ended
the session at $19.03 a barrel, just above the
psychologically important $19 level. June gasoline, which
started the trading day higher and then sagged with crude,
rebounded at the end of the day to finish 0.66 cents higher.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork belly futures closed up the
two-cent-a-pound daily limit in response to a weekly report
indicating a tightening of supplies, contrary to analysts'
expectations. The report showed a net flow of 199,000 pounds
of pork bellies out of warehouses to processors. Many
analysts had estimated net movement into warehouses, in
advance of an expected seasonal peak in demand this summer,
of as much as one million to 1.5 million pounds, said Jerry
Abbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis.
The warehouse report augurs well for higher belly futures
prices in the weeks ahead, said Charles Levitt, a futures
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in Chicago. One reason
for the decline of pork belly movement into warehouses is
that many pork bellies are apparently being ground up into
trimmings to be used for hot dogs and sausage, where retail
demand is higher currently than it is for bacon, Mr. Levitt
said. The belly futures market was also poised for a rebound
following a week of declining prices, analysts said. Pork
bellies for July delivery closed up two cents, at 64.37 cents
a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The rally in pork
belly futures prices spilled over into the live hog pit at
the Merc, where July live hog futures closed up 1.5 cents at
63.67 cents a pound.
                                                                                                       

   COCOA: Futures prices rose on continued turmoil in the
Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer. The July
contract ended with a gain of $35 a metric ton to $1,433,
after trading as high as $1,485. Signs of division among the
armed forces of the Ivory Coast resulted in renewed tension
that sparked the price surge in futures, said Sandra Kaul,
analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton. Apparently, army recruits
protesting low pay and poor living conditions commandeered
both military and civilian vehicles and rioted in the
streets, she said. Regular troops were stationed to guard
communication centers, she noted, and added that the airport,
which early yesterday was held by the recruits, later was
taken over by military police. A French military force
stationed outside Abidjan, the nation's capital, was put on
maximum alert, she said. Another analyst, Judith Ganes, of
Merrill Lynch, observed that, so far, the disturbances
haven't affected the production or shipments of cocoa.
"However, there is the concern that if they last long enough
and spread, they will have an impact on the cocoa market,"
she said.

   Circle K Squares Off With Its Creditors

   Chapter 11 Filing Makes
   Revamping Even Harder

   Circle K Corp., fighting to stay competitive in the
nation's convenience-store wars, is about to revamp its
corporate culture, product mix and pricing strategies in an
attempt to lure back former customers and attract new ones.
   Industry analysts say that's a tough-enough trick for the
second-largest U.S. convenience-store chain to pull off in an
industry overcrowded with clones. Now it will have to carry
out the massive changes while jousting with creditors and
dealing with the complexities of the bankruptcy-court system
after filing Tuesday night under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code. The filing was made after major bank lenders
refused to compromise on terms of a financial restructuring.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Circle K got into its present mess by expanding too fast
and taking on $1.1 billion in below-investment-grade junk
debt to buy and open additional stores. But it also committed
two of retailing's biggest blunders: It charged its customers
prices well above the competition, assuming they wouldn't
care; and it offered them lots of high-profit-margin products
they didn't want, cutting back on old standbys that brought
people in the door.
   That harsh critique comes from none other than the
company's president, Robert A. Dearth Jr., who says he's
determined to change all that and reposition the company so
that it can return to profitability and pay its debt.
   "Before, we had the attitude of gouging the customer for
what we could get," says Mr. Dearth, who took over in January
at the chain, based in Phoenix, Ariz.
   The executive plans to change things by slashing overall
prices 10% by the start of summer, revamping product lines
and starting a massive "long-term" frequent-buyer program.
He's also planning a giveaway program, with more than $100
million in prizes aimed at luring customers back to the
chain's 4,600 stores. But he hasn't any intention of
downsizing the company or laying off any of Circle K's 27,000
employees.
   Whether or not company creditors, seeking to preserve
assets, will agree to such a spending spree remains to be
seen; but initial signs are positive. "We would encourage any
plan that generates income. We believe this {marketing} plan
probably will," says one of Circle K's bank creditors.
   Others, however, are skeptical about any repositioning in
what has become a fiercely competitive industry. "It takes
money to reposition inventory. It takes money to do
giveaways. It's pretty dubious whether the bankruptcy judge
will stand for this," says Dennis Telzrow, a
convenience-store analyst with Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner. "I
don't know where they will get the money," adds Mr. Telzrow,
who expects the company's troubles will force it to sell 10%
of its stores.
   Already, Circle K's major competitor, Southland Corp.'s
7-Eleven stores, has tried drawing customers with car
giveaways. In addition to giving away a BMW, another
competitor, National Convenience Stores Inc., briefly
instituted a frequent-buyer program two years ago. Customers
received Black &amp; Decker appliances, but the program was
discontinued as far too costly.
   Analysts agree that no amount of marketing can solve the
industry's major woe: There are just too many convenience
stores -- about 83,000 in North America, according to
Convenience Store News. Also, sales of the stores' major
products -- cigarettes and beer -- aren't exactly booming
themselves. The analysts believe that the future of the
business lies with such oil-company giants as Los
Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., which can market its
own gasoline less expensively, thus attracting customers to
its AM-PM minimarkets.
   For years, convenience stores have unsuccessfully tried to
solve their problems by expanding beyond their traditional
customer base -- blue-collar men between the ages of 18 and
35 -- to include more white-collar workers and women.
   In the mid-1980s, most chains introduced videocassette
sales and even rentals; the effort largely flopped because of
competition from an expanding number of videocassette stores
carrying a much wider selection of films. Some chains have
introduced automatic bank tellers, as well as freshly
prepared and microwave foods. Recently, Houston-based
National Convenience tried to go more upscale at some of its
stores, introducing such traditional yuppie fare as bottled
water, wine, Pepperidge Farm pastry products, and health
foods.
   At Circle K, expansion started in 1983, when the company
was a regional chain with 1,300 stores. By last year,
competition and management lapses had produced losses, and
the then-chairman, Karl Eller, decided that one solution was
to boost store prices by about 6% to 7%.
   "They felt the consumer wouldn't be sensitive to price
increases. They were wrong," says Debra J. Levin, a retail
analyst with Salomon Brothers. In the four months prior to
last February, sales nosedived 8% to 10% in the stores;
gasoline sales declined between 1% and 6%, Ms. Levin says.
Mr. Telzrow estimates that Circle K's merchandise sold for
about 5% more than the competition. In February, Mr. Eller
reversed the price rises and worked to pressure vendors to
reduce prices to the company's stores. But the move came too
late, and Mr. Eller resigned under criticism last month.
   Mr. Dearth says current price cuts, which he believes
bring Circle K in line with its competitors, have already
gone into effect with its biggest sellers: tobacco, candy,
beer, wine and bottled beverages.
   Future product offerings will be more tailored to the
particular ethnic or socioeconomic store clientele, a change
that will come hand in hand with a shift in power to store
managers. "Before, if it wasn't in the order book, you
couldn't order it. That was the simple rule," says Mr.
Dearth. He adds, "We are taking the handcuffs off the store
managers." Mr. Dearth says stores that have implemented
pricing and other changes have seen sales double over the
past eight weeks.
   In July and August, 3,900 Circle K stores will distribute
180 million scratch-and-win card games with more than $100
million in prizes, from free airline travel to discounted
gasoline purchases. In June, another 700 stores will begin a
frequent-purchaser program.

   Economy:
   April's 0.2% Rise in Consumer Prices
   Reflects Slowing in Rate of Inflation

   WASHINGTON -- Inflation at the retail level is slowing
from its fiery pace at the start of the year, following the
path of wholesale prices, new government figures indicate.
   The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose
0.2% in April, the mildest increase since September and far
below the rises of 0.5% in March and February and 1.1% in
January.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new price figures, which came a few days after the
Labor Department said producer prices declined in April,
supported the predictions of many analysts that the inflation
surge at the start of the year would be temporary.
   The price slowdown comes amid signs of continuing slack in
the economy. The Commerce Department said housing starts fell
5.8% in April, following drops of 11.2% and 5.1% in March and
February. Earlier government reports for April showed
declines in industrial output, retail sales and private
employment.
   Many economists said the price figures give little
indication that real progress is being made in reducing the
country's core inflation rate.
   "The real changes have been in perception and market
sentiments," said Robert Falconer, senior vice president of
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New York. "Underlying inflation is
not getting any better or any worse."
   Excluding food and energy prices, whose wide and frequent
swings tend to distort the overall inflation picture,
consumer prices also rose 0.2% in April. Food and energy
prices, along with a surge in clothing prices, were largely
responsible for the first quarter's swift inflation rate,
which was the fastest pace in seven years.
   The latest reading brought the increase in consumer prices
over the preceding 12 months down to 4.7%, where inflation
has been hovering during the past few years. Excluding food
and energy, the rate was 4.8%.
   "Obviously the figure was good news," said Richard D.
Rippe, chief economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York. "But I don't think one month of a two-tenths CPI
reading is going to erase inflation concerns."
   Still, given the moderation in both producer and consumer
prices -- along with new evidence of weakness in the economy
-- it seems likely that the Federal Reserve will leave
interest rates alone for a while. Before this month's string
of reports, speculation had grown that the Fed was about to
push up interest rates to battle price pressures.
   After the inflation report came out yesterday, John
LaWare, a Fed governor, said: "It sounds pretty good."
   Most of the moderation in consumer prices last month came
in categories that posted sharp rises in earlier months.
Energy prices, which soared in January in response to a surge
in demand during a late December cold wave, fell for the
third-consecutive month. They dropped 0.4%. Food prices,
which shot up after the cold snap damaged crops in the South,
fell 0.2%.
   Clothing prices grew only 0.1% after leaping 3.3% in
February and 1.6% in March. The earlier jumps had puzzled
analysts, but the Labor Department said they partly reflected
earlier-than-usual introduction of spring-fashion lines,
which escaped the department's formula for adjusting for
regular seasonal price changes. Housing costs inched up 0.1%
after rising 0.5% in March.
   In some other areas inflation remained stubborn.
Medical-care costs increased 0.8% for the third month in a
row, bringing their rise over the past 12 months to 8.9%.
Entertainment costs grew 0.4% after rising 0.6% the month
before.
   Richard Peach, deputy chief economist at the Mortgage
Bankers Association, blamed the miserable performance in
housing construction on rising mortgage rates. Work began on
houses and apartments at a 1,245,000 annual rate in April,
the lowest level since October 1982, when the country was in
a recession.
   At the end of April the interest rate on 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages averaged around 11.1% compared with
about 10% at the start of the year, according to the bankers
association.
   "Builders are scanning the environment and seeing sales
falling, inventories rising and interest rates on a dramatic
upward trend for four months," said Mr. Peach. "I suspect
that really shook their confidence in going out and starting
new units."
   Starts of single-family homes, the core of the housing
market, dropped 7.5% after plummeting 12.5% in March.
Building permits tumbled 8.7%, to an annual rate of
1,125,000.
   But mortgage rates have been edging down in May, leading
housing economists to hope for improvement in both home
building and sales during the month.
   The numbers in both reports were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.

   As an accounting firm on the make, Laventhol &amp; Horwath was
eager five years ago to land an unusual new client: the
religious organization of now-defrocked and imprisoned
evangelist Jim Bakker.
   The work for his PTL brought Laventhol fees of $180,000 a
year -- and a lawsuit seeking $184 million in damages from
Laventhol and many other defendants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit is only one of a series directed at Laventhol,
which over the past three years has been forced to pay out
more than $50 million for allegedly sloppy audit,
financial-statement and tax work. After insurance recoveries,
it was still out at least $20 million. Two years ago,
Laventhol also suffered the distinction of being the first
accounting firm to lose a jury trial under the federal
anti-racketeering law.
   Laventhol, once one of the nation's fastest-growing
accounting firms and now the seventh-largest (425 partners in
51 offices), has hit hard times. Key employees are leaving.
An important Canadian affiliate has defected to Price
Waterhouse. Laventhol's operating profits, prior to legal
costs, have declined in the past two years. Lenders are said
to be pushing it to sell major units.
   What caused such a decline? Consultants to accounting
firms say Philadelphia-based Laventhol, which acquired no
fewer than 70 other firms between 1968 and 1980, grew too
quickly. From 1980 to 1986, its annual revenue surged almost
fourfold to $275 million; since then it has grown 28% more,
to $345 million.
   "Laventhol was overly aggressive doing some mergers that
it shouldn't have done and therefore probably didn't pay as
much attention" as it should have to the quality of the firms
it was buying and of the new clients it was picking up, says
Jay Nisberg, a Ridgefield, Conn., consultant. "It may soon be
scrambling for a merger to stay afloat." Laventhol won't
comment.
   Lawrence Reisman, a former Laventhol tax supervisor,
thinks he knows why the firm got into trouble. He and many
others in accounting believe that Laventhol took too many
risky clients like PTL -- a strategy that, ironically,
accountants often advise their clients to avoid.
   When he was at Laventhol in late 1982, Mr. Reisman and his
boss, Martin Helpern, sent a memo to the managing partner of
the New York office recommending that the firm drop a Houston
oil-drilling tax shelter as a client. Laventhol was getting
$150,000 a year to do the shelter's tax and audit work. But
Messrs. Reisman and Helpern said expenses that the shelter,
Terra Drill &amp; Heavy Oil, was deducting to sublicense a new
drill gun "are not a valid business deduction." They
questioned whether Laventhol's reputation is "enhanced by our
association with this type of sham."
   The New York managing partner, Leonard Douglas, rejected
the advice. "Every person is entitled to be represented by as
competent a professional as he can get," he wrote back. "Even
in criminal law, there is a guaranteed right under the
constitution. The client is entitled to representation." Mr.
Douglas recently retired; messages left for him at Laventhol
weren't returned.
   Unfortunately for Laventhol, Messrs. Reisman and Helpern
proved prophetic. The Internal Revenue Service later
disallowed all the deductions claimed by Terra's investors.
In a deposition taken by investor-plaintiffs in a subsequent
class-action lawsuit, Neil Kran, an IRS engineer who
investigated Terra, said the shelter's "sublicense fees are
unsupported by the value of the rights acquired." Terra
officials defended the fees but said they needed more time to
make the drill commercially feasible.
   In 1986, the class-action lawsuit, filed in federal
district court in Houston, charged that Laventhol helped
mislead hundreds of investors into buying allegedly
fraudulent limited partnerships in Terra. The suit contended
that the investors lost $42 million. Last December, a federal
jury returned a $72 million judgment, including interest,
against Laventhol for allegedly violating anti-fraud statutes
in working for the shelter.
   Laventhol settled the suit early this year for $13.5
million, of which only $4.4 million was covered by insurance.
Richard Drubel, a Houston attorney who represented the
investors who sued, says, "We offered to settle the case
before trial for $5 million. Apparently, Laventhol likes to
take risks. They lost this one, too."
   As for other matters, Laventhol confirms the recent loss
of its Toronto affiliate, with its 30 partners and 200
professional staffers, to Price Waterhouse; Eric Slavens,
co-managing partner in Toronto, says the affiliate needed
"more cross-country coverage for clients in Canada."
   Laventhol declines to comment on its other problems. This
would be only a "rehashing of past situations and innuendo
and unattributed false claims," the firm says. Robert N.
Levine, who will assume the top post at Laventhol on June 1
and is actually running the firm now, declines to go beyond
this.
   Laventhol's recent payouts in legal settlements are
enormous and are stretching the firm's insurance coverage. An
out-of-court settlement in Chicago last October with nine
creditor banks in a holding-company bankruptcy cost Laventhol
at least $30 million. Of that, only $18.5 million was covered
by insurance.
   In 1988, Laventhol paid $15 million in an out-of-court
settlement of the suit it lost under RICO, the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. The firm has said
the settlement was covered by insurance. In that case, in
federal court in Sacramento, Calif., the jury found that
investors, relying on Laventhol's audits of fraudulent
cattle-breeding tax shelters, put more than $20 million into
the partnerships, which then collapsed and resulted in tax
penalties for the investors.
   Laventhol still isn't free of lawsuits alleging
professional negligence. In 1988, shareholders of Convenient
Food Mart charged in a state court in Chicago that Laventhol,
the food-store franchiser's auditor in 1986 and 1987, didn't
adequately review and check work papers and other information
prepared by Convenient. In mid-1988, Convenient stunned
securities analysts by disclosing that it had overstated 1987
profits by 68%.
   Another case involved a report issued by Laventhol for
Wieboldt Stores Inc. in 1985. The report stated that a
leveraged buy-out of the store chain wouldn't make it
insolvent. Former Wieboldt stockholder-managers, who were
sued in Chicago federal court by Wieboldt's bankruptcy
trustee for allegedly running the company into the ground,
charged in their own suit in the same court that Laventhol
had misrepresented the retailer's finances.
   Laventhol has denied allegations in both of these
still-pending cases but declines to comment further.
   Laventhol also must regret taking on the PTL ministry.
After Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells (later merged with Touche
Ross to form Deloitte &amp; Touche) was dropped for unexplained
reasons by the PTL in 1984, Laventhol took the job a year
later.
   In 1987, a group of investors with "lifetime memberships"
in the PTL sued Mr. Bakker and others, including Laventhol,
in federal court in Charlotte, N.C. They charged that the PTL
had perpetrated a massive fraud against them. The suit
alleges that Laventhol helped Mr. Bakker "cook the books" and
turn a $19 million loss into a $26 million profit in the
fiscal year ended May 31, 1986. It says Laventhol permitted
the PTL to change the method of amortizing lifetime partner
income to "convey to bankers and other outside partners a
false sense of solvency."
   PTL directors, the suit says, were "lulled into a false
sense of security" about PTL's finances by Mr. Bakker. The
suit says he told them the PTL "had excellent accountants,
that it had internal control by certified public accountants
{and} that it had external audits by reputable firms."
   The suit also charges that $60,000 of the annual $180,000
audit fee that Laventhol collected was "to manage a secret
bank account" that the PTL allegedly used to conceal
embezzlement by some of its top officers. The suit says the
PTL's vice president for finance wasn't allowed to know what
was in the account but "the outside auditors {Laventhol}
maintained a running account of the funds."
   The PTL has collapsed, and Mr. Bakker has gone to prison
after being found guilty of financial fraud. In 1987, after
Mr. Bakker resigned from the PTL amid the scandal, his
successors replaced Laventhol as PTL's accountant with Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co., which worked for six months to help the PTL
clear up its books.
   In court filings in response to the lifetime investors,
Laventhol has noted that it criticized PTL's accounting
controls and qualified PTL's 1986 annual report -- that is,
indicated that it had some reservations about PTL's finances.
As to the bank account, Laventhol told the Washington Post
that it wasn't "secret" but was a "clerical payroll" account
that didn't compromise Laventhol's independence as an
auditor. Laventhol declines to comment further.
   Another black eye for Laventhol was its work for Grabill
Corp., a Chicago real-estate firm run by William J. Stoecker.
Mr. Stoecker's empire crumbled early in 1989 when it was
forced to seek bankruptcy-court protection. Last January in
Chicago federal court, Mr. Stoecker was found not guilty of
criminal charges of bankruptcy fraud for allegedly failing to
turn over records to the Chicago bankruptcy court. But his
activities are still under investigation by the U.S.
Attorney's office in Chicago.
   Mr. Stoecker, his lawyer says, isn't available for
comment. However, in an interview on the CBS program "60
Minutes" early this year, Mr. Stoecker was asked whether
Laventhol should have been able to see his company was in
trouble. He replied that it should have taken the accountants
"no more than a day or two to look at" his books and see the
company had questionable assets and was low on cash.
   According to papers filed by the trustee in the Chicago
bankruptcy court, Laventhol's last audit of Grabill, on June
30, 1988, showed $390 million in assets, including $68.6
million in real estate. Grabill Trustee Jay Steinberg says,
"We cannot reconcile the books to the audit. We found less
than $2 million in real estate."
   Laventhol was charging Grabill a fee of close to $1
million a year -- considered exorbitant by many in the
accounting profession. Lee Seidler, a former accounting
professor at New York University and special associate
director of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., the major securities firm,
says such a huge fee for a small real-estate operation raises
"obvious questions." He adds: "A million dollars a year is
what Bear Stearns pays for its audit. Laventhol failed to
employ one fundamental practice for auditors -- kick the
tires."
   Laventhol declines to comment.
   Although Mr. Levine, who's currently running Laventhol, is
assumed to be tuning down Laventhol's hunger for new, risky
business, the firm may be showing questionable judgment in
hiring some new executives. Last March, its Chicago office
hired Andrew Doppelt, a former Internal Revenue Service
agent, to head a new financial investigative operation. What
Laventhol apparently didn't know was that Mr. Doppelt was
being criticized for exaggerating the sales of National
Investigative Services Corp., a company that he helped found
several years ago and that went out of business earlier this
year.
   National Investigative Services was ranked 125th in the
nation in growth of private companies by Inc. magazine last
year with 1988 sales of $4.7 million. But John Case, an Inc.
senior writer, says now that the company's sales two years
ago "weren't anywhere near $4.7 million." Mr. Case says the
bigger figure was supplied to Inc. in a letter signed by Mr.
Doppelt. Mr. Doppelt denies the figure came from him,
attributing it to a company sales employee he refuses to
name.
   Sheldon Epstein, who heads Laventhol's Chicago office,
says National Investigative Services' 1988 sales were "a
little over $1 million." Asked why Laventhol hired Mr.
Doppelt in light of the questionable sales figures, Mr.
Epstein says: "Maybe Andy's ability to run a business isn't
as good as his ability to service clients. He is one of the
best professionals at helping trustees uncover assets after a
bankruptcy and finding individuals who counterfeit products
without paying royalties. We feel we can manage him without
any problems."
   In the wake of Laventhol's troubles, a raft of top
Laventhol executives are leaving the firm. For example,
Steven Matthews, a former Laventhol employee-benefits
consultant in Phoenix, Ariz., says he left last March
"because of the litigation problems."
   Mr. Reisman, the former Laventhol man who urged caution,
left the firm in 1983 and now has a New York tax practice. He
says he was upset about Laventhol's professional standards.
"The urge to take such risks there was too ferocious," he
says. "The dog-eat-dog atmosphere and knowledge that if you
weren't willing to cut a corner, someone else would be found
there who will, was too much for me."

   Insider-Trading Rule Extends to Therapy

   A federal judge ruled that a psychiatrist who bought
BankAmerica Corp. stock based on information he allegedly
received from a patient during therapy can be charged with
insider trading.
   The case seems to break new ground in determining who can
be charged with insider trading, since it apparently is the
first to accuse a doctor of trading on confidential
information from a patient. The case also is one of the first
to apply a federal appeals-court decision two weeks ago,
involving stockbroker Robert Chestman, that restricted the
scope of insider-trading laws. The federal judge in New York
said that even under the guidelines of the Chestman decision,
the charges against the psychiatrist, Robert Howard Willis,
shouldn't be dropped.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Willis is charged with buying the stock in early 1986
after learning that Sanford Weill, former chief executive
officer of Shearson Loeb Rhodes, was seeking to become
BankAmerica's chief executive officer. Previously, court
documents have identified the patient as "Jane Doe," who was
upset because her husband would have to move if Mr. Weill
took the job. Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, in her written
decision, however, disclosed that the patient is Mr. Weill's
wife.
   Dr. Willis argued that the charges against him should be
dropped because he violated no fiduciary duty in allegedly
trading on the information. He also claimed that under the
Chestman decision he needed to have been specifically told
that the information was confidential. Dr. Willis, charged
with 46 counts of securities fraud and mail fraud, is accused
of making a profit of $27,475 on the transactions.
   Judge Cedarbaum, however, ruled that because of the
tradition of physician-patient confidentiality, Dr. Willis
should have known from the start that any information gleaned
from Mrs. Weill was to remain secret. She also said that
allegations against Dr. Willis amounted to theft of valuable
information from Mrs. Weill.
   "It is difficult to imagine a relationship that requires a
higher degree of trust and confidence than the traditional
relationship of physician and patient," Judge Cedarbaum said.
Unlike circumstances in the Chestman case, where the
defendant wasn't informed that a stock tip he received was
confidential, Judge Cedarbaum said Dr. Willis knew he was
receiving information in confidence from Mrs. Weill.
   Judge Cedarbaum also said the alleged insider trading
defrauded Mrs. Weill in two ways. First, she had an interest
in Mr. Weill's possible advancement at BankAmerica, which the
judge said could have been jeopardized by disclosure of the
information. Second, the judge said, Mrs. Weill "had a
property interest in a continuing course of psychiatric
treatment. . . . Dr. Willis's disclosures jeopardized the
psychiatrict-patient relationship and put at risk the
patient's financial investment in psychiatric treatment."
   Mr. Weill currently is chairman of Primerica Corp.
   Edward Brodsky, a lawyer for Dr. Willis, said he believed
that under the Chestman case, the charges against Dr. Willis
should have been dropped. Also, he said, Dr. Willis didn't
violate the type of fiduciary responsibility that is required
for there to have been a securities-law violation. "Patient
confidentiality doesn't extend to securities law," he said.

   RED SQUIRRELS won't stand in the way of Arizona
observatory, court says.
   In a decision that some environmentalists fear may weaken
the federal Endangered Species Act, the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals overturned a ruling that had suspended a
University of Arizona plan to build the $200 million
observatory on Arizona's Mount Graham. But the San
Francisco-based appeals court said the stay on construction
could be reinstated if evidence emerges of a threat to the
180 red squirrels that live on the mountain.
   Congress initially authorized the project on the basis of
a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report that found that the
observatory wouldn't significantly harm the squirrels. Two
Fish and Wildlife Service officials later said in depositions
that they had suppressed their misgivings about the project.
"The government biologists wanted to say there was danger to
the squirrels, but politics got in the way," said Brock
Evans, vice president of national issues at the National
Audubon Society, one of the plaintiffs in the case.
   Environmentalists have expressed concern that the court's
decision reflects an unwillingness to reverse congressional
approval for a project even though some of the evidence may
have been fraudulent or erroneous. A spokesman for the
Maricopa Audubon Society in Arizona said the court
effectively sides with those "who have said the project's
going to continue no matter what, regardless of what Congress
said about their intentions to not weaken the Endangered
Species Act."
   Plaintiffs' lawyers wouldn't comment on the decision,
saying the judge instructed the parties not to discuss the
specifics of the case.
   John Moag, a lawyer representing the university from the
Baltimore office of Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow, said Congress
closely followed the guidelines of the Endangered Species Act
"in balancing the purposes of the project against the
possible negative impact" on the squirrels. The university
had argued that its monitoring and feeding of the squirrels
would reduce the possibility of extinction. "I think we're
going to be an integral factor in this squirrel's survival,"
Mr. Moag said.
   A red squirrel is named as a plaintiff in the case,
although "no one actually suggested that the squirrel should
appear in court," according to a University of Arizona
spokesman.

   CENSORSHIP SUIT challenges ban on filming of "Bonfire"
scene in courtroom.
   The suit involves the decision by New Jersey Chief Justice
Robert Wilentz preventing a production crew from filming a
scene from "The Bonfire of the Vanities" in an Essex County
courthouse in Newark. Judge Wilentz said in his ruling that
the scene showing a group of black citizens rioting "could
serve to seriously undermine the confidence of black citizens
in our court system."
   In the lawsuit filed yesterday in federal court in Newark,
Essex County Executive Nicholas R. Amato and the county
alleged that the judge had acted as a censor in violation of
the First Amendment. A spokesman for Judge Wilentz said he
couldn't comment on pending litigation.
   Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit, which is producing
the film based on the novel by Tom Wolfe, had agreed to
donate $250,000 to the courthouse-restoration fund for the
use of the courtroom. Ultimately the scene was filmed in the
courthouse in Queens, N.Y.
   "The county has historically used court buildings for the
filming of movies as a revenue source. We want to get the
groundwork laid on how much control the chief justice has
over filming in county-owned property," said H. Curtis
Meanor, Essex County counsel.
   Mr. Meanor said the county will seek to recoup the lost
fee from the state judiciary as monetary damages.

   FAT BOYS rap group wins right to sue Miller Brewing Co.
over commercial.
   In federal court in Manhattan, N.Y., Judge Charles Haight
rejected a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which claims that a
commercial featuring Joe Piscopo and imitators of the
rap-music group infringes on the group's copyrights and
trademarks. The defendants, who also include Mr. Piscopo and
the advertising firm Backer &amp; Spielvogel, argued that the
case should be thrown out because the commercial was a parody
of the rap group's style, rather than a ripoff of the group's
work.
   Judge Haight said the commercial wasn't protected as
parody, however, because its "use is entirely for profit: to
sell beer." The judge said that based on previous cases,
"appropriation of copyrighted material solely for personal
profit, unrelieved by any creative purpose, cannot constitute
parody as a matter of law."
   Judge Haight, however, did throw out a part of the lawsuit
charging that the commercial defamed the group, whose members
are all under 21. They claimed that their reputations were
hurt and business prospects damaged because the commercial
implied that they promoted the drinking of alcoholic
beverages by minors. The judge said the look-alike group's
behavior in the ad was unlikely to be seen as an endorsement
of under-age drinking.
   Lawyers for the defendants couldn't be reached for
comment.

   Bush, Citing Soviet Tactics in Baltics,
   Indicates Trade Pact May Be Imperiled

   MOSCOW -- The Bush administration indicated it may be
unwilling to sign a new treaty liberalizing U.S.-Soviet trade
ties at the coming summit because of Soviet tactics against
independence movements in the Baltic states.
   The new U.S. stand was discussed by U.S. officials
traveling here with Secretary of State James Baker. The
secretary was here for negotiations aimed at settling
arms-control disputes before the planned meeting between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in
Washington later this month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But even if the tricky arms-control issues can be
resolved, the summit meeting seems likely to be held under a
cloud caused by the escalating turmoil in the Baltics --
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Specifically, U.S. officials
here have warned the Soviet Union that the trade treaty may
be put off.
   In Washington, President Bush made it clear that the
Baltic issue wouldn't halt the summit itself, or block
arms-control accords. But he added: "I'm unhappy about the
state of play in the Baltics" and conceded that "it has
certainly put some tension on the summit."
   Other administration aides in Washington confirmed that it
is becoming less and less likely that the trade treaty will
be signed at the summit, as once anticipated. One official
said there is a growing belief that the U.S. will have a
"better feel" for whether to go ahead with the pact after the
meeting. This official said that in addition to Baltics
problem, the U.S. is concerned that the Soviet Parliament
hasn't yet passed a long-promised emigration law sought by
Washington as a condition for waiving current U.S.
restrictions on trade with Moscow.
   By threatening to tie trade liberalization to the Baltic
question, the administration is risking removing from the
summit agenda one of the U.S.-Soviet agreements that seemed
most certain to be reached. U.S. and Soviet negotiators have
nearly concluded a trade agreement and the Soviet Parliament
is expected to pass the new emigration law May 31, during the
summit.
   Any decision to withhold better trade ties would be the
first concrete penalty the U.S. has imposed on the Soviet
Union since Moscow imposed an economic blockade on Lithuania
last month.
   The U.S. officials here cautioned that Mr. Bush hasn't
made a final decision on whether to withhold approval from
the trade treaty or the potential waiver of the U.S. trade
restrictions. Just a few weeks ago, Mr. Bush appeared on the
verge of breaking off talks with the Soviets on the trade
treaty, only to back away from the decision at the last
minute. His decision was prompted in part because European
allies were strongly urging him to keep economic talks on
track.
   However, in an interview earlier this week with
Knight-Ridder newspapers, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills warned that "if there is a very strident problem
between the Soviet Union and Lithuania . . . a presentation
of such an agreement to Congress under these circumstances
would not seem to be one that I would recommend." Mr. Baker
told CBS News that "the situation in the Baltics is not
static," and he hinted that the president might drop his
passive stance on the issue if Moscow doesn't agree to
negotiate with the rebel republics.
   A key factor in the administration's toughening stance is
the heavy opposition developing in Congress toward improving
trade relations in the face of the Baltic turmoil. U.S.
officials conceded that the administration takes the
congressional opposition seriously and is stressing it in
private discussions with the Soviets.
   Mr. Gorbachev, who is under severe pressure to improve the
Soviet economy and produce results from his foreign policy,
is believed to eagerly desire trade liberalization as a
political symbol, even though it isn't likely to yield much
direct economic improvement any time soon.
   While the administration is suggesting the trade treaty
might be put in limbo, it is signaling that it will continue
to allow relaxation of economic restrictions on the Soviets
in some other areas. Just yesterday, with the White House's
blessing, the Soviet Union was granted observer status in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based
international organization that oversees world trade.

   MATERIAL SHORTAGES wane but prompt few worries of a slack
economy.
   The list of industrial materials in short supply has
dwindled to a handful, due to both increased capacity and
slowing demand, says Bob Bretz of the National Association of
Purchasing Management. That's unusual at this stage of a
business expansion, when shortages and production bottlenecks
often signal higher inflation and then recession, says Norman
Robertson, chief economist of the Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trend isn't triggering oversupply worries either, says
Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of
Manufacturers, who credits "better balance" and more
sophisticated inventory controls. It is, however, keeping
prices down, says David Littmann of Manufacturers National
Bank of Detroit, noting that price pressure is flat "for the
first time in many years." And that, he says, bodes well for
lower interest rates.
   Environmental worries prompt some shortages. Paper mills,
trying to reduce dioxin pollution, scramble for chemicals to
replace chlorine in whitening paper.
                                                                                                       

   PROM SPENDING is strong, but a smaller teen population
limits the market.
   "You can't get more lavish than it has been," says Richard
Wiewiorka, of the Fairmont Hotel's Tonga Room, San Francisco,
which is sold out almost every weekend from April through
June. Or can you? The hunt for prom gowns began in February
instead of April this year, with some girls spending as much
as $700, says Jacalyn Dunn of Jacalyn's Lace &amp; Promises,
Pittsburgh. Rent-A-Stretch Inc., Hackensack, N.J., cites new
demand for $100-an-hour stretch limos.
   Cost per couple: $300 to $1,000, says Your Prom magazine,
launched this year to tap the lucrative market. But some
businesses say lavish spending isn't enough to keep the prom
market growing. "Flat demographics," explains Michael Kashman
of Gingiss Formal Wear, New York. Bill Gallagher of Town &amp;
Country Tuxedos, East Meadow, N.Y., says the graduating class
at one local high school dropped from some 700 students 11
years ago to only 175.
                                                                                                       

   DOCTORS AND DENTISTS are expected to tell more patients to
charge it.
   With traditional credit-card markets nearly saturated,
attention is shifting to health care. "It is a tremendous
market," but no one has paid much attention to it, says H.
Spencer Nilson of the Nilson Report, Los Angeles. He
estimates only 3% of consumers' out-of-pocket medical
expenses now are charged on credit cards. Why? "Doctors have
looked at themselves as professionals and above credit
cards," says Stephen Getzoff, an Encino, Calif., accountant
who specializes in medical practices.
   But that is changing as doctors, under pressure from
insurers and other medical providers, look for ways to
improve cash flow. Visa USA launches a program to woo
doctors, designing both new signs and new ways for patients
to pay. Medical credit cards -- such as MedMaster Systems
Inc., Logan, Utah -- welcome the Visa push. "It is like being
a Burger King on a McDonald's corner," says David Whipple of
MedMaster, which also provides back-office services.
   Doctors may begin offering patients a discount for cash
when faced with credit-card fees, Mr. Getzoff says.
                                                                                                       

   HE WEARS THE PANTS but she buys them, says a survey from
MRCA Information Services. In 1989, women bought 78% of men's
sweaters, 71% of men's socks and 70% of men's sport shirts.
But they bought only 23% of men's suits, apparently letting
men pick out their own.
                                                                                                       

   IT LOSES SOMETHING in the translation, admits Di Jin, who
is translating James Joyce's "Ulysses" into Chinese. The
visiting fellow at University of Virginia says puns, literary
allusion and political references make the work particularly
hard for Chinese to understand.
                                                                                                       

   SUPERMARKET SKILLS will be taught in a new
mini-supermarket being set up in Walton High School
classroom, New York. Sponsored by Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific
Tea Co. and Cornell University, the project will teach
students to price units, stock shelves and process orders.
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN ATHLETES find more equipment designed just for them.
   Women who used to settle for men's sports gear are
starting to demand their own, says Patricia Hubbard, editor
of Outdoor Woman, Nyack, N.Y. Sporting-goods manufacturers
are responding with everything from specially-sized kayaks to
fly-fishing rods for women. Orvis Co., Manchester, Vt.,
recently came out with a pair of lightweight women's waders
in fashionable burgundy. Sawyer Canoe Co. offers models that
can be portaged and maneuvered solo by a 110-pound to
150-pound person.
   Why the interest? "Sporting-goods manufacturers have
recognized that the men's niche has topped out," says Missy
Park, president of Title 9, a Berkeley, Calif., mail order
house that caters to "athletic women." But some retailers
have a hard time selling women's gear, she says, because
they're used to targeting men.
   More women outfitters are organizing women's expeditions,
says Ms. Hubbard, noting it's often easier to learn skills
when men aren't around.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: To woo accepted students, the College of Wooster
lets them "test drive" the school's academic computer before
deciding whether to enroll. . . . A campaign that aims to
enlist Sen. Alan Simpson in helping to bring back the buffalo
nickel calls on people to "join the herd."

   Maxwell Nabs Three Supermarket Tabs

   NEW YORK -- "Hungry Alien Gobbles Tab Trio]"
   That headline might be a fittingly sensationalized banner
in one of the newest properties of British media mogul Robert
Maxwell, who announced plans to acquire three of the
largest-selling tabloid papers in the freaks-and-geeks field
-- the Globe, the National Examiner and the Sun -- from Globe
International Publishing Inc. of Montreal. Publishing
executives involved in the transaction say the price topped
$100 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The acquisition thrusts Mr. Maxwell and his closely held
Mirror Group Newspapers Inc. into an escalating war of
supermarket tabloids. He plans to acquire the three weakest
competitors in the field, aiming to spruce them up and go
head to head with the granddaddy of sensation, the National
Enquirer, and its sisters, the Star and Weekly World News,
all owned by Macfadden Holdings Inc. of New York.
   The Globe acquisition gives Mr. Maxwell, the rotund and
hyper-competitive chairman of Maxwell Communication Corp., a
spot on U.S. magazine racks, a market he has fought to enter
before. In April 1989 he lost out to Macfadden in the bidding
for the National Enquirer, the tabloid leader, and the Weekly
World News, which went for $412.5 million combined.
   But not all supermarket tabloids are the same. What Mr.
Maxwell has scooped up are the racier, raunchier and riskier
of the tabs. "Jesus Is Already Back On Earth" screams a
National Examiner headline this week. "Boy, 5, Gives Birth"
informs this week's Sun, whose cover also features a large
photo of a badly deformed baby.
   Times have been tough for the tabloid field recently, but
the Globe papers have lost circulation at a far higher rate
than their three stronger rivals. The National Examiner
circulation dipped 20.2% in the second half of 1989; the
Globe lost 12.9% in the same time; the Sun's figures weren't
audited for that period. Meanwhile, Macfadden's Enquirer lost
4.3% in the same period while the Star lost 2.6%.
   Maxwell executives readily agree the sassy publications
need some help.
   The Globe tabloids "aren't the fat cats in the industry,"
concedes Ernest Burrington, deputy chairman and managing
director of Mirror Group. "We realize these newspapers need
to be strengthened." For now, Mr. Burrington plans no major
staff changes at the tabloids, all three of which are based
in Boca Raton, Fla., just down the road from the National
Enquirer, in Lantana.
   But the quality of the publications, which are profitable,
may matter less than the national distribution system they
use -- the true object of Mr. Maxwell's desire, in the view
of some industry experts.
   Mr. Maxwell bought not only the tabloids but also Globe
Marketing Services, with a 500-person field force that
distributes magazines and newspapers in supermarkets and
convenience stores nationwide and negotiates for premium
display space. Mr. Maxwell could use the operation to
distribute other companies' publications for a fee and, more
likely, to distribute publications he wants to start up or
acquire.
   "The field force is a great asset because competition for
space at checkouts is so fierce," says Robert A. Cohen, head
of Robert Cohen Associates, a New York publishing consulting
firm. "I don't know if anyone really wants these magazines
for what they are. What he's done is like buying landing
slots at an airport."
   Mr. Maxwell also seems eager to expand elsewhere.
Yesterday he announced his intention to acquire a stake in
Berliner Verlag, an East German publishing company whose
properties include the 420,000-circulation Berliner Zeitung
and the 1.5-million-circulation magazine FF.
   Mr. Maxwell already owns several daily U.K. tabloids that
are somewhat less raunchy than rival Rupert Murdoch's
tabloid, the Sun, which regularly runs pictures of
bare-breasted models on Page Three. In photographs in Mr.
Maxwell's Daily Mirror, the women are less scantily clad.
   In the U.S., Mr. Maxwell's tabloid archrival, the National
Enquirer, is itching for a fight.
   It could be an expensive fight for both publishers. Iain
Calder, editor of the National Enquirer, said he looks
forward to competing with the Maxwell-owned tabloids. But the
Scottish-born editor boasts the largest editorial budget --
$16 million annually -- and thus can outbid other tabloids
for "exclusive" stories. The Enquirer had offered $1 million
to Marla Maples, alleged girlfriend of billionaire Donald
Trump, but she turned it down. (Paying for stories is frowned
on at most major newspapers.)
   Globe executives said their tabloids operate with
editorial budgets "significantly less" than that of the
Enquirer. The Canadian publisher decided to sell the tabloids
only within the last week, after choosing to focus on its
consumer magazines, such as Bridal Guide. The company is
owned by Michael Rosenbloom, who is 62 years old and has run
the company for 20 years.
   Peter Rubenovitch, chief financial officer of Globe
International, says now is the time to sell the tabloids
because "the prices in the market have been so buoyant." In
March, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. agreed to sell another
scandal sheet -- the Star -- to Macfadden Holdings for $400
million in cash and stock.
   Industry experts say the falling circulation of
supermarket tabloids is due largely to overcrowded checkout
shelves as well as the competition for mass audiences from
the growing number of gossip sheets and magazines such as
Time Warner Inc.'s People.
   That doesn't mean Globe executives won't miss the tabloid
business, despite its troubles. "I am personally going to
miss it a lot," says Mr. Heine. "It's the most exciting part
of the publishing business."

   Ohio Edison Co. said in Akron that its revenue would
increase 4.7% this year, 4.4% in 1991 and 2.7% in 1992 if the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio approves a recommended
rate boost.
   However, the electric utility said the three-step increase
would become null and void if the commission doesn't grant an
increase in revenue of at least $198.5 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rate rise recommended by the commission's staff is
part of a "conditional stipulation" that the commission is
considering for adoption. Ohio Edison said formal hearings on
the rate boost have ended and a decision is expected by
midsummer.
   Ohio Edison had requested a $218 million increase in
revenue in August 1989. That request included a two-step
increase in revenue of 7.5% this year and a 5.3% increase in
1991.

   LOS ANGELES -- Northrop Corp. said it is counting on a
strong rebound in 1990 profitability, although Wall Street
reacted skeptically to indications from its chief executive
officer that the defense contractor is seeking to earn as
least $163 million this year.
   In a news conference after Northrop's annual meeting, Kent
Kresa, president and chief executive, said he hopes the
company would achieve better than a 10% return on stockholder
equity this year, excluding the $67 million gain the company
recorded in the first quarter from sale of its headquarter
complex here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Based on first-quarter shareholder equity of $960.7
million, that would indicate at least $96 million, with total
net income approximating at least $163 million. In 1989,
Northrop had a net loss of $80.5 million, or $1.71 a share,
although in the 1990 first quarter, net income surged to $96
million, or $2.04 a share, including the gain from the
headquarter sale.
   Northrop traditionally doesn't forecast corporate
earnings.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Northrop shares closed at $17.50, up 12.5 cents.
   Mr. Kresa also said the company plans a reduction in
employment of about 3,000, or 7%, this year from a current
work force of 41,000. Employment was cut by about 2,500 last
year.
   The reduction in employment reflects attempts to reduce
overhead expenses at Northrop, which is the prime contractor
for the Pentagon's B-2 Stealth bomber and for the YF-23
Advanced Tactical Fighter, one of two competing designs for
the next generation of Air Force fighters.
   Mr. Kresa said better inventory management and the efforts
to reduce overhead will facilitate a planned major reduction
of Northrop's current debt of $1 billion. He said the
company's "financial projections show that we will eliminate
our present debt by the mid-1990s."
   The Defense Department's proposal to cut the number of
B-2s to be acquired to 75 from 132 will lead Northrop to
"reduce the size of our B-2 operations accordingly," the
executive said. He said about 500 of the employee cuts could
be directly associated with the Stealth bomber. As a way of
"capitalizing on the reduced requirements for B-2
manufacturing," he said, Northrop would carry out full-scale
development work on the ATF at the same Pico Rivera, Calif.,
facility where work on the B-2 is in progress. He said the
Air Force would benefit from having the fighter developed at
a leading aircraft-development facility.
   The company also will continue to sell assets that "don't
match the business environment we see ahead of us, or where
we feel better use can be made of the assets," he said.
Northrop's longer-term goal is for "returning over the next
few years to at least a 20% return on equity," Mr. Kresa told
shareholders.
   David Smith, who follows aerospace concerns for the
securities firm of Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla., said the investment community "didn't even
blink" at Mr. Kresa's hopes for earnings. That suggests,
according to Mr. Smith, that "the market is saying I don't
believe you." Mr. Smith, like other analysts, however, hasn't
forecast earnings for the company because of a history of
unpredictability that includes numerous write-downs from
weapons programs.
   Mr. Smith also suggested that the efforts to pay down
debt, tighten operations and purchase shares of Northrop
stock for the company's retirement plan could be part of a
"scenario that could involve taking the company private." Mr.
Kresa also said at the meeting that 1.2 million additional
shares of Northrop stock had been purchased for the
retirement plan, putting a significant stake in employee
hands.
   A Northrop spokesman said the firm doesn't have any plans
to go private.

   Companies listed below reported quarterly profit
substantially different from the average of analysts'
estimates. The companies are followed by at least three
analysts. Results in parentheses are losses.
   The percent difference compares actual profit with the
30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues
forecasts in the past 30 days. Otherwise, actual profit is
compared with the 120-day estimate.
